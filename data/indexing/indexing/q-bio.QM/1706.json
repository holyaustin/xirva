When the system is not observable,\nan important and practical problem is how to add a \\emph{minimal} number of\nsensors so that the system becomes observable. This minimal observability\nproblem is practically useful and theoretically interesting, as it pinpoints\nthe most informative nodes in the system. We consider the minimal observability\nproblem for an important special class of Boolean networks, called conjunctive\nBoolean networks (CBNs). Using a graph-theoretic approach, we provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for observability of a CBN with $n$\nstate-variables, and an efficient~$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for solving the\nminimal observability problem.

We seem to have more data than ever before but few resources and\nmeans to use it efficiently. We need a general, extensible solution that\nintegrates and homogenizes data of disparate origin, incompatible formats, and\nmultiple spatial and temporal scales. To address this problem, we introduce the\nScientific Knowledge Extraction from Data (SKED) architecture, as a\ntechnology-agnostic framework to minimize the overhead of data integration,\npermit reuse of analytical pipelines, and guarantee reproducible quantitative\nresults. The SKED architecture consists of a Resource Allocation Service to\nlocate resources, and the definition of data primitives to simplify and\nharmonize data. SKED allows automated knowledge discovery and provides a\nplatform for the realization of the major goals of modern health care.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 19:05:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Trippe", "Elizabeth D.", ""], ["Aguilar", "Jacob B.", ""], ["Yan", "Yi H.", ""], ["Nural", "Mustafa V.", ""], ["Brady", "Jessica A.", ""], ["Assefi", "Mehdi", ""], ["Safaei", "Saeid", ""], ["Allahyari", "Mehdi", ""], ["Pouriyeh", "Seyedamin", ""], ["Galinski", "Mary R.", ""], ["Kissinger", "Jessica C.", ""], ["Gutierrez", "Juan B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.08041", "submitter": "Pavitra Krishnaswamy", "authors": "Pavitra Krishnaswamy, Gabriel Obregon-Henao, Jyrki Ahveninen, Sheraz\n  Khan, Behtash Babadi, Juan Eugenio Iglesias, Matti S.

However,\noptions for assessing electrophysiological activity in these structures are\nlimited. Electromagnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in subcortical\nstructures can be recorded non-invasively using magnetoencephalography (MEG)\nand electroencephalography (EEG). However, these subcortical signals are much\nweaker than those due to cortical activity. In addition, we show here that it\nis difficult to resolve subcortical sources, because distributed cortical\nactivity can explain the MEG and EEG patterns due to deep sources. We then\ndemonstrate that if the cortical activity can be assumed to be spatially\nsparse, both cortical and subcortical sources can be resolved with M/EEG.\nBuilding on this insight, we develop a novel hierarchical sparse inverse\nsolution for M/EEG. We assess the performance of this algorithm on realistic\nsimulations and auditory evoked response data and show that thalamic and\nbrainstem sources can be correctly estimated in the presence of cortical\nactivity. Our analysis and method suggest new opportunities and offer practical\ntools for characterizing electrophysiological activity in the subcortical\nstructures of the human brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Jun 2017 06:52:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnaswamy", "Pavitra", ""], ["Obregon-Henao", "Gabriel", ""], ["Ahveninen", "Jyrki", ""], ["Khan", "Sheraz", ""], ["Babadi", "Behtash", ""], ["Iglesias", "Juan Eugenio", ""], ["Hamalainen", "Matti S.", ""], ["Purdon", "Patrick L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.08089", "submitter": "Christophe Guyeux", "authors": "R\\'egis Garnier, Christophe Guyeux, and St\\'ephane Chr\\'etien", "title": "Finding optimal finite biological sequences over finite alphabets: the\n  OptiFin toolbox", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a toolbox for a specific optimization problem that\nfrequently arises in bioinformatics or genomics.

The success of such campaigns depends on adequate household\nparticipation during the active phase as well as on sufficient follow-up during\nthe surveillance phase when newly infested houses or infested houses that had\nnot participated in the active phase will receive treatment. Queueing models\nwhich are widely used in operations management give us a mathematical\nrepresentation of the operational efforts needed to contain the spread of\ninfestation. By modeling the queue as consisting of all infested houses in a\ngiven locality, we capture the dynamics of the insect population due to\nprevalence of infestation and to the additional growth of infestation by\nredispersion, i.e. by the spread of infestation to previously uninfested houses\nduring the wait time for treatment. In contrast to traditional queueing models,\nhouses waiting for treatment are not known but must be identified through a\nsearch process by public health workers. Thus, both the arrival rate of houses\nto the queue as well as the removal rate from the queue depend on the current\nlevel of infestation. We incorporate these dependencies through a load\ndependent queueing model which allows us to estimate the long run average rate\nof removing houses from the queue and therefore the cost associated with a\ngiven surveillance program.
