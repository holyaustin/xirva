Correct diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies with altered oxygen affinity\nrequires a determination of hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), which\nrelates the hemoglobin oxygen saturation to the partial pressure of oxygen in\nthe blood. Determination of the ODC of human hemoglobin is typically carried\nout under conditions in which hemoglobin is in equilibrium with O2 at each\npartial pressure. However, in the human body due to the fast transit of RBCs\nthrough tissues hemoglobin oxygen exchanges occur under non-equilibrium\nconditions. We describe the determination of non-equilibrium ODC, and show that\nunder these conditions Hb cooperativity has two apparent components in the\nAdair, Perutz, and MWC models of Hb. The first component, which we call\nsequential cooperativity, accounts for ~70% of Hb cooperativity, and emerges\nfrom the constraint of sequential binding that is shared by the three models.\nThe second component, which we call conformational cooperativity, accounts for\n~30% of Hb cooperativity, and is due either to a conformational equilibrium\nbetween low affinity and high affinity tetramers (as in the MWC model), or to a\nconformational change from low to high affinity once two of the tetramer sites\nare occupied (Perutz model).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 22:03:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Scrima", "Rosella", ""], ["Fugetto", "Sabino", ""], ["Capitanio", "Nazzareno", ""], ["Gatti", "Domenico L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.00370", "submitter": "Ricardo Ruiz Baier I", "authors": "Luis Miguel de Oliveira Vilaca, Bryan Gomez-Vargas, Sarvesh Kumar,\n  Ricardo Ruiz-Baier, Nitesh Verma", "title": "Stability analysis for a new model of multispecies\n  convection-diffusion-reaction in poroelastic tissue", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematical Modelling, 84, 425-446, 2020", "doi": "10.1016/j.apm.2020.04.014", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We perform the linear stability analysis for a new model for poromechanical\nprocesses with inertia (formulated in mixed form using the solid deformation,\nfluid pressure, and total pressure) interacting with diffusing and reacting\nsolutes convected in the medium.

To investigate the completeness of recorded\nprostate cancer mortality, we compared other-cause (non-prostate cancer)\nmortality in men found and not found to have prostate cancer following a needle\nbiopsy.\n  Methods: We linked Medicare claims data to SEER data to analyze survival in\nthe population of men aged 65+ enrolled in Medicare who resided in a SEER area\nand received a needle biopsy in 1993-2001. We compared other-cause mortality in\nmen found to have prostate cancer (n=53,462) to that in men not found to have\nprostate cancer (n=103,659).\n  Results: The age-race adjusted other-cause mortality rate was 471 per 10,000\nperson-years in men found to have prostate cancer vs. 468 per 10,000 in men not\nfound to have prostate cancer (RR = 1.01;95% CI:0.98-1.03). The effect was\nmodified, however, by age. The RR declined in a stepwise fashion from 1.08 (95%\nCI:1.03-1.14) in men age 65-69 to 0.89 (95% CI:0.83-0.95) in men age 85 and\nolder. If the excess (or deficit) in other-cause mortality were added to the\nrecorded prostate cancer mortality, prostate cancer mortality would rise 23% in\nthe youngest age group (from 90 to 111 per 10,000) and would fall 30% in the\noldest age group (from 551 to 388 per 10,000).\n  Conclusion: Although recorded prostate cancer mortality appears to be an\naccurate measure overall, it systematically underestimates the mortality\nassociated with prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment in younger men and\noverestimates it in the very old. We surmise that in younger men\ntreatment-related deaths are incompletely captured in recorded prostate cancer\nmortality, while in older men the diagnosis \"sticks\"-- once diagnosed, they are\nmore likely to be said to have died from the disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 15:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Welch", "H.

Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM\nis widely used for deep-tissue imaging in the brain. However, due to sequential\nscanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand,\nfocuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field\nillumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a\ncamera detector, TFM suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a\nresult, TFM produces images of poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures such as\ndendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach\nto improve resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM\nimaging while maintaining high-resolution through scattering media. We\ndemonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal\nneurons in the mouse visual cortex. We show that our trained network rapidly\noutputs high-resolution images that recover biologically relevant features\npreviously buried in the scattered fluorescence in the TFM images. In vivo\nimaging that combines TFM and the proposed 3D convolution neural network is one\nto two orders of magnitude faster than PSTPM but retains the high resolution\nand SNR necessary to analyze small fluorescent structures.

However, although existing\nimage fusion techniques, including traditional algorithms and deep\nlearning-based algorithms, can generate high-quality fused images, they need\nmultiple images with different focus depths in the same field of view. This\ncriterion may not be met in some cases where time efficiency is required or the\nhardware is insufficient. The problem is especially prominent in large-size\nwhole slide images. This paper focused on the multi-focus image fusion of\ncytopathological digital slide images, and proposed a novel method for\ngenerating fused images from single-focus or few-focus images based on\nconditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Through the adversarial\nlearning of the generator and discriminator, the method is capable of\ngenerating fused images with clear textures and large depth of field. Combined\nwith the characteristics of cytopathological images, this paper designs a new\ngenerator architecture combining U-Net and DenseBlock, which can effectively\nimprove the network's receptive field and comprehensively encode image\nfeatures. Meanwhile, this paper develops a semantic segmentation network that\nidentifies the blurred regions in cytopathological images. By integrating the\nnetwork into the generative model, the quality of the generated fused images is\neffectively improved. Our method can generate fused images from only\nsingle-focus or few-focus images, thereby avoiding the problem of collecting\nmultiple images of different focus depths with increased time and hardware\ncosts. Furthermore, our model is designed to learn the direct mapping of input\nsource images to fused images without the need to manually design complex\nactivity level measurements and fusion rules as in traditional methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jan 2020 02:13:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Geng", "Xiebo", "", "1 and 4"], ["Liua", "Sibo", "", "1 and 4"], ["Han", "Wei", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Li", "Xu", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Ma", "Jiabo", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Yu", "Jingya", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Liu", "Xiuli", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Zeng", "Sahoqun", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Chen", "Li", "", "2 and\n  3"], ["Cheng", "Shenghua", "", "1 and 3"]]}, {"id": "2001.01006", "submitter": "Shixiong Zhang", "authors": "Shixiong Zhang, Xiangtao Li, Qiuzhen Lin, and Ka-Chun Wong", "title": "Review of Single-cell RNA-seq Data Clustering for Cell Type\n  Identification and Characterization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, the advances in single-cell RNA-seq techniques have enabled\nus to perform large-scale transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution in\na high-throughput manner.

It is our main aim in this\npaper, and for the first time, we want to present a fully analytical and\nphysics-based ion transport 3D and non-Linear model for large deformable IPMC.\nIn this direction, based on three dimensional Nernst-Plank PDE we will find a\nwell-defined and valid relationship between input voltage and output tip\ndisplacement of IPMC for large deformation situation and with four provable\npieces of evidence it will be proven that proposed model has chosen a proper\nway and it is more complete than previous benchmark and well-known\nphysics-based models for IPMC, and also it is valid and accurate enough for\nlarge deformation modeling of IPMC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Oct 2019 10:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Annabestani", "Mohsen", ""], ["Naghavi", "Nadia", ""], ["Nejad", "Mohammad Maymandi", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.03693", "submitter": "Mason Youngblood", "authors": "Mason Youngblood", "title": "A Raspberry Pi-based, RFID-equipped birdfeeder for the remote monitoring\n  of wild bird populations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an increasingly popular wireless\ntechnology that allows researchers to monitor wild bird populations from fixed\nlocations in the field.

Recently, a novel notion of \"dense\" (\"sparse\")\ntree, and in particular spanning tree (DST and SST respectively), is introduced\nas the structure that have a large (small) number of subtrees, or small (large)\nsum of distances between vertices. We show that finding DST and SST reduces to\nsolving the discrete optimization problems. New and efficient approaches to\nfind such spanning trees is achieved by imposing certain conditions on the\nvertex degrees which are then used to define an objective function that is\nminimized over all spanning trees of the graph under consideration. Solving\nthis minimization problem exactly may be prohibitively time consuming for large\ngraphs. Hence, we propose to use genetic algorithm (GA) which is one of well\nknown metaheuristics methods to solve DST and SST approximately. As far as we\nare aware this is the first time GA has been used in this context. We also\ndemonstrate on a number of applications that GA approach is well suited for\nthese types of problems both in computational efficiency and accuracy of the\napproximate solution.

The low quality data assessment is based on using a\nrelatively imprecise eye-tracker, the absence of head restraint for any\nsubjects, and the use of infants as the majority of subjects (60 of 70\nsubjects). Allowing subjects with more than 50% missing data (as much as 95%)\nis also evidence of low quality data. The error-filled assessment is based on\nevidence that a number of the \"fixations\" classified by \"experts\" have obvious\nsaccades within them, and that, apparently, a number of fixations were\nclassified on the basis of no signal at all. The evidence for non-optimal data\npresentation stems from the fact that, in a number of cases, perfectly good\ndata was not presented to the coders. The flaws in the analysis are evidenced\nby the fact that entire stretches of missing data were considered classified,\nand that the measurement of saccade amplitude was based on many cases in which\nthere was no saccade at all. Without general evidence to the contrary, it is\ncorrect to assume that some human classifiers under some conditions may meet\nthe criteria for a gold standard, and classifiers under other conditions may\nnot. This conditionality is not recognized by Hooge et al. A fair assessment\nwould conclude that whether or not humans can be considered a gold standard is\nstill very much an open question.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jan 2020 18:59:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 19:24:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 12:04:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Friedman", "Lee", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.07824", "submitter": "Fernando Alarid-Escudero", "authors": "Fernando Alarid-Escudero, Eline M.

As cardiac models\nadvance towards use in personalised medicine to inform clinical\ndecision-making, it is critical to understand the uncertainty hidden in\nparameter estimates from their calibration to experimental data. This study\napplies approximate Bayesian computation to re-calibrate the gating kinetics of\nfour ion channels in two existing human atrial cell models to their original\ndatasets, providing a measure of uncertainty and indication of potential issues\nwith selecting a single unique value given the available experimental data. Two\napproaches are investigated to reduce the uncertainty present: re-calibrating\nthe models to a more complete dataset and using a less complex formulation with\nfewer parameters to constrain. The re-calibrated models are inserted back into\nthe full cell model to study the overall effect on the action potential. The\nuse of more complete datasets does not eliminate uncertainty present in\nparameter estimates. The less complex model, particularly for the fast sodium\ncurrent, gave a better fit to experimental data alongside lower parameter\nuncertainty and improved computational speed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 16:57:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Houston", "C.", ""], ["Marchand", "B.", ""], ["Engelbert", "L.", ""], ["Cantwell", "C.

However, there is disagreement as to the statistical significance of\nthese motifs, and there are potential problems with standard methods for\nestimating this significance. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a\nclass of statistical model that can overcome some of the shortcomings of\ncommonly used methods for testing the statistical significance of motifs. ERGMs\nwere first introduced into the bioinformatics literature over ten years ago but\nhave had limited application to biological networks, possibly due to the\npractical difficulty of estimating model parameters. Advances in estimation\nalgorithms now afford analysis of much larger networks in practical time. We\nillustrate the application of ERGM to both an undirected protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI) network and directed gene regulatory networks. ERGM models\nindicate over-representation of triangles in the PPI network, and confirm\nresults from previous research as to over-representation of transitive\ntriangles (feed-forward loop) in an E. coli and a yeast regulatory network. We\nalso confirm, using ERGMs, previous research showing that under-representation\nof the cyclic triangle (feedback loop) can be explained as a consequence of\nother topological features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 23:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 05:27:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2021 23:36:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:11:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Stivala", "Alex", ""], ["Lomi", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11547", "submitter": "Lee Cooper", "authors": "Sanghoon Lee, Mohamed Amgad, Deepak R.

In addition, we use the uncertainty information\nprovided by the PHiSeg network in a novel automated quality control (QC) step\nto identify uncertain T1 values. The PHiSeg network and QC were validated\nagainst manual analysis on a cohort of the UK Biobank containing healthy\nsubjects and chronic cardiomyopathy patients. We used the proposed method to\nobtain reference T1 ranges for the left ventricular myocardium in healthy\nsubjects as well as common clinical cardiac conditions. T1 values computed from\nautomatic and manual segmentations were highly correlated (r=0.97).\nBland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the automated and manual\nmeasurements. The average Dice metric was 0.84 for the left ventricular\nmyocardium. The sensitivity of detection of erroneous outputs was 91%. Finally,\nT1 values were automatically derived from 14,683 CMR exams from the UK Biobank.\nThe proposed pipeline allows for automatic analysis of myocardial native T1\nmapping and includes a QC process to detect potentially erroneous results.
