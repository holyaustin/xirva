The full dynamic range of complex dynamical inputs\nhas to be compressed into a set of discrete spike times and the question,\nfacing any sensory system, arises: which features of the stimulus are thereby\nencoded and how does the animal decode them to recover its external sensory\nworld?\n  Here we study this issue for the two motion-sensitive H1 neurons of the fly's\noptical system, which are sensitive to horizontal velocity stimuli, each neuron\nresponding to oppositely pointing preferred directions. They constitute an\nefficient detector for rotations of the fly's body about a vertical axis.\nSurprisingly the spike trains $\\rho_B(t)$ generated by an empoverished stimulus\n$S_B(t)$, containing just the instants when the of velocity $S(t)$ reverses its\ndirection, convey the same amount of global (Shannon) information as spike\ntrains $\\rho(t)$ generated by the complete stimulus $S(t)$. This amount of\ninformation is just enough to encode the instants of velocity reversal. Yet\nthis suffices to give the motor system just one, yet vital order: go left or\nright, turning the H1 neurons into efficient analog-to-digital converters.\nFurthermore also probability distributions computed from $\\rho(t)$ and\n$\\rho_B(t)$ are identical. Still there are regions in the spike trains\nfollowing velocity reversals, 80 msec long and containing about 3-6 msec long\nspike intervals, where detailed stimulus properties are encoded. We suggest a\ndecoding scheme - how to reconstruct the stimulus from the spike train, which\nis fast and works in real time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 15:11:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Esteves", "Ingrid M.", ""], ["Fernandes", "Nelson M.", ""], ["K\u00f6berle", "Roland", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0740", "submitter": "Lorenzo Bongini", "authors": "Pasquale Bianco, Lorenzo Bongini, Luca Melli, Mario Dolfi, Vincenzo\n  Lombardi", "title": "Kinetics of double stranded DNA overstretching revealed by 0.5-2 pN\n  force steps", "comments": "13 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A detailed description of the conformational plasticity of double stranded\nDNA (ds) is a necessary framework for understanding protein-DNA interactions.\nUntil now, however structure and kinetics of the transition from the basic\nconformation of ds-DNA (B state) to the 1.7 times longer and partially unwound\nconformation (S state) have not been defined.

New\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\nODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem\nbecause each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one\ntimeslice. A \"loopy belief propagation\" algorithm solves this factorized\napproximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage\nof the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial\nin the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the\nbiochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,\nand we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods.

Whilst undoubtedly useful,\nseveral such methods suffer from issues of non-uniqueness and inconsistency.\nThese problems are solved by an approach based on the maximisation of entropy,\nwhich is motivated, derived and implemented in this article. A series of\nnumerical experiments are also presented, detailing the application of the\nmethod to the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered model of epidemics, as well as\ncautionary examples showing the sensitivity of moment-closure techniques in\ngeneral.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Mar 2011 14:24:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 10:32:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Rogers", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5181", "submitter": "Ying Ding", "authors": "Huijun Wang, Ying Ding, Jie Tang, Xiao Dong, Bing He, Judy Qiu, David\n  J.

Recent tests have shown that selective 2'-hydroxyl\nacylation by primer extension (SHAPE) can give near-zero error rates (0-2%) in\nmodeling the helices of RNA secondary structure. Here, we benchmark the method\nusing six molecules for which crystallographic data are available: tRNA(phe)\nand 5S rRNA from Escherichia coli, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I\nribozyme, and ligand-bound domains from riboswitches for adenine, cyclic\ndi-GMP, and glycine. SHAPE-directed modeling of these highly structured RNAs\ngave an overall false negative rate (FNR) of 17% and a false discovery rate\n(FDR) of 21%, with at least one helix prediction error in five of the six\ncases. Extensive variations of data processing, normalization, and modeling\nparameters did not significantly mitigate modeling errors. Only one varation,\nfiltering out data collected with deoxyinosine triphosphate during primer\nextension, gave a modest improvement (FNR = 12%, and FDR = 14%). The residual\nstructure modeling errors are explained by the insufficient information content\nof these RNAs' SHAPE data, as evaluated by a nonparametric bootstrapping\nanalysis. Beyond these benchmark cases, bootstrapping suggests a low level of\nconfidence (<50%) in the majority of helices in a previously proposed\nSHAPE-directed model for the HIV-1 RNA genome. Thus, SHAPE-directed RNA\nmodeling is not always unambiguous, and helix-by-helix confidence estimates, as\ndescribed herein, may be critical for interpreting results from this powerful\nmethodology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2011 19:58:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2011 00:30:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 17:05:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kladwang", "Wipapat", ""], ["VanLang", "Christopher C.", ""], ["Cordero", "Pablo", ""], ["Das", "Rhiju", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5490", "submitter": "Andre X.

The relative importance of indirect effects is central to\nthis understanding, and the ratio of indirect flow to direct flow (I/D) is one\nindicator of their importance. Two methods have been proposed for calculating\nthis indicator. The unit approach shows what would happen if each system member\nhad a unit input or output, while the realized technique determines the ratio\nusing the observed system inputs or outputs. When using the unit method, the\ninput oriented and output oriented ratios can be different, potentially leading\nto conflicting results. However, we show that the input and output oriented I/D\nratios are identical using the realized method when the system is at steady\nstate. This work is a step in the maturation of Ecological Network Analysis\nthat will let it be more readily testable empirically and ultimately more\nuseful for environmental assessment and management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 19:38:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""], ["Freeze", "Michael A.", ""], ["Salas", "Andria K.", ""]]}]
