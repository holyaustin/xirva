Methods: In May 2011, ten male volunteers (age\nrange: 29 to 53 years, mean: 37 years) underwent DW-MRI of the upper abdomen on\n1.5T and 3.0T magnetic resonance scanners. Regions of interest in the left and\nright liver lobe, pancreas, spleen, renal cortex, and renal medulla were\ndelineated independently by two readers. DNNs were trained for IVIM model\nfitting using these data; results were compared to least-squares and Bayesian\napproaches to IVIM fitting. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were used\nto assess consistency of measurements between readers. Intersubject variability\nwas evaluated using Coefficients of Variation (CV). The fitting error was\ncalculated based on simulated data and the average fitting time of each method\nwas recorded. Results: DNNs were trained successfully for IVIM parameter\nestimation. This approach was associated with high consistency between the two\nreaders (ICCs between 50 and 97%), low intersubject variability of estimated\nparameter values (CVs between 9.2 and 28.4), and the lowest error when compared\nwith least-squares and Bayesian approaches. Fitting by DNNs was several orders\nof magnitude quicker than the other methods but the networks may need to be\nre-trained for different acquisition protocols or imaged anatomical regions.\nConclusion: DNNs are recommended for accurate and robust IVIM model fitting to\nDW-MRI data.

In this work, a top-down\napproach is employed to realize micron-sized polymeric particles, called\nmicroPlates (uPLs), for the sustained release of therapeutic agents. uPLs are\nsquare hydrogel particles, with an edge length of 20 um and a height of 5 um,\nmade out of poly (lactic co glycolic acid) (PLGA). During the synthesis\nprocess, the uPL Young's modulus can be varied from 0.6 to 5 MPa by changing\nPLGA amounts from 1 to 7.5 mg, without affecting the uPL geometry. Within the\nporous uPL matrix, different classes of therapeutic payloads can be\nincorporated including molecular agents, such as the anti-inflammatory\ndexamethasone (DEX), and nanoparticles, containing themselves imaging and\ntherapeutic molecules. As a proof of principle, uPLs are loaded with free DEX\nand 200 nm spherical polymeric nanoparticles, carrying DEX molecules\n(DEX-SPNs).

Current EBMs only handle scalar biomarkers, such as\nregional volumes, as inputs. However, regional aggregates are a crude summary\nof the underlying high-resolution images, potentially limiting the accuracy of\nEBM. Therefore, we propose a novel method that exploits high-dimensional\nvoxel-wise imaging biomarkers: n-dimensional discriminative EBM (nDEBM). nDEBM\nis based on an insight that mixture modeling, which is a key element of\nconventional EBMs, can be replaced by a more scalable semi-supervised support\nvector machine (SVM) approach. This SVM is used to estimate the degree of\nabnormality of each region which is then used to obtain subject-specific\ndisease progression patterns. These patterns are in turn used for estimating\nthe mean ordering by fitting a generalized Mallows model. In order to validate\nthe biomarker ordering obtained using nDEBM, we also present a framework for\nSimulation of Imaging Biomarkers' Temporal Evolution (SImBioTE) that mimics\nneurodegeneration in brain regions. SImBioTE trains variational auto-encoders\n(VAE) in different brain regions independently to simulate images at varying\nstages of disease progression.

In both\nexperiments, nDEBM using high-dimensional features gave better performance than\nstate-of-the-art EBM methods using regional volume biomarkers.

This allows to model and study the evolution of \"traffic jams\" of\nparticles along the chain. A unique feature of these two new models is that\neach site along the chain can have a different size.\n  Although the models are nonlinear, they are amenable to rigorous asymptotic\nanalysis. In particular, we show that the dynamics always converges to a\nsteady-state, and that the steady-state densities along the chain and the\nsteady-state output flow rate from the chain can be derived from the spectral\nproperties of a suitable matrix, thus eliminating the need to numerically\nsimulate the dynamics until convergence. This spectral representation also\nallows for powerful sensitivity analysis, i.e. understanding how a change in\none of the parameters in the models affects the steady-state.\n  We show that the site sizes and the transition rates from site to site play\ndifferent roles in the dynamics, and that for the purpose of maximizing the\nsteady-state output (or production) rate the site sizes are more important than\nthe transition rates. We also show that the problem of finding parameter values\nthat maximize the production rate is tractable.\n  We believe that the models introduced here can be applied to study various\nnatural and artificial processes including ribosome flow during mRNA\ntranslation, the movement of molecular motors along filaments of the\ncytoskeleton, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, evacuation dynamics, and more.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2019 18:44:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bar-Shalom", "Eyal", ""], ["Ovseevich", "Alexander", ""], ["Margaliot", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05615", "submitter": "Pablo Rodr\\'iguez-S\\'anchez", "authors": "Pablo Rodr\\'iguez-S\\'anchez, Egbert H. van Nes, Marten Scheffer", "title": "Climbing Escher's stairs: a way to approximate stability landscapes in\n  multidimensional systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Rodriguez-Sanchez P. at al.

In this approach, a\nhigh-resolution quadrupole-ToF mass spectrometer acquires thousands of MS/MS\ndata by selecting not just a single precursor at a time, but by allowing a\nbroad m/z range to be fragmented. This acquisition window is then sequentially\nmoved from the lowest to the highest mass selection range. This technique\nenables the acquisition of thousands of high-resolution MS/MS spectra per\nminute in a standard LC-MS run. In the subsequent data analysis phase, the\ncorresponding dataset is searched in a triple quadrupole-like mode, thus not\nconsidering the whole MS/MS scan spectrum, but by searching for several\nprecursor to fragment transitions that identify and quantify the corresponding\npeptide. This search is made possible with the use of an ion library,\npreviously acquired in a classical data dependent, full-spectrum mode. The\nSWATH protocol, combining the protein identification power of high-resolution\nMS/MS spectra with the robustness and accuracy in analyte quantification of\ntriple-quad targeted workflows, has become very popular in proteomics research.\nThe major drawback lies in the ion library itself, which is normally demanding\nand time-consuming to build.

We are thus hereby sharing with the worldwide proteomics community\nour newly acquired ion library of mouse adult hippocampal neural stem cells.\nGiven the growing effort in neuroscience research involving proteomics\nexperiments, we believe that this data might be of great help for the\nneuroscience community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 15:21:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Braccia", "Clarissa", ""], ["Espinal", "Meritxell Pons", ""], ["Pini", "Mattia", ""], ["Tonelli", "Davide De Pietri", ""], ["Armirotti", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.07076", "submitter": "Farshid Mohammad-Rafiee", "authors": "Amir Khosravanizadeh, Pierre Sens, Farshid Mohammad-Rafiee", "title": "Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis of a Cylindrical Nanoparticle in the\n  Presence of Cytoskeleton Substrate", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Soft Matter, 2019, 15, 7490", "doi": "10.1039/c9sm00618d", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Internalization of particles by cells plays a crucial role for adsorbing\nnutrients and fighting infection.

In the natural sciences, well-controlled perturbation\nexperiments are widely used to probe the structure of complex networks.\nHowever, our understanding of how and why perturbations aid inference remains\nheuristic, and we lack automated procedures that determine network structure by\ncombining inference and perturbation.

Using the formulation of information geometry, our framework\nquantifies the difficulty of inference and the information gain from\nperturbations through the curvature of the underlying parameter manifold,\nmeasured by Fisher information. We apply the framework to the inference of spin\nnetwork models and find that designed perturbations can reduce the sampling\ncomplexity by $10^6$-fold across a variety of network architectures.\nPhysically, our framework reveals that perturbations boost inference by causing\na network to explore previously inaccessible states. Optimal perturbations\nbreak spin-spin correlations within a network, increasing the information\navailable for inference and thus reducing sampling complexity by orders of\nmagnitude.

This two-stage maximum-likelihood approach can be used to\n(iii) produce a compact set of stable features that (iv) can be directly used\nin any (regression-based) classifier or predictor.
