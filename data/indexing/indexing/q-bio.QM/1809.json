The 5060 CHD patients (2365 men and 2695\nwomen) were 1 to 97 years old at baseline with 8 years (2009-2017) of medical\nrecords, 5051 health check-ups and 5075 cases of other diseases.

We built a dataset with 15,000 routine\nblood tests results. Using this dataset, we trained the two-layer GBDT model to\nclassify healthy status, coronary heart disease and other diseases.

Given traction\nforce timelapse movies, as obtained by traction force microscopy of in vitro\ncellular sheets, we show that the tissue stress field can be estimated by\nKalman filtering. After validation using numerical data, we apply Kalman\ninversion stress microscopy to experimental data. We combine the inferred\nstress field with velocity and cell shape measurements to quantify the rheology\nof epithelial cell monolayers in physiological conditions, found to be close to\nthat of an elastic and active material.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 06:04:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Nier", "V.", ""], ["Peyret", "G.", ""], ["d'Alessandro", "J.", ""], ["Ishihara", "S.", ""], ["Ladoux", "B.", ""], ["Marcq", "P.", ""]]}]
