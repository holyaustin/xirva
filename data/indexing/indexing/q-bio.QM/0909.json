Applications range widely from comparative\ngene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of\nthe underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example\nthe genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction\naccuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus\nkey to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications.\n  Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one\nfor Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM)\ntraining, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence\nlength. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training\nwhich require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one\nstep and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these\ntwo new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM\ntraining into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-Converter and examine their\nrespective practical merits for three small example models.\n  Conclusions: Bioinformatics applications employing hidden Markov models can\nuse the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM\ntraining more computationally efficient. Using these algorithms, parameter\ntraining can thus be attempted for more complex models and longer training\nsequences. The two new algorithms have the added advantage of being easier to\nimplement than the corresponding default algorithms for Viterbi training and\nstochastic EM training.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2009 19:29:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Oct 2012 21:57:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lam", "Tin Yin", ""], ["Meyer", "Irmtraud M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1370", "submitter": "Conrad Burden", "authors": "Sylvain Foret, Susan R.
