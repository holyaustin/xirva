Most sequence-function\nrelationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental\ntechniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The\nadvent of such \"massively parallel\" experiments presents an exciting\nopportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the\nstudy of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental\nadvances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of\nsequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments.\nSpecifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that\ninference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based\napproach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these\nmodels. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of \"diffeomorphic\nmodes\" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data\nthan likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in\nphysics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the\ninference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel\nexperiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these\nfundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an\noutlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing\nstudies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2015 01:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 15:47:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Atwal", "Gurinder S.", ""], ["Kinney", "Justin B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.00219", "submitter": "Nikolai Slavov", "authors": "Alexander Franks, Edoardo Airoldi, Nikolai Slavov", "title": "Post-transcriptional regulation across human tissues", "comments": "30 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS Comput Biol 13(5): e1005535 (2017)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005535", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM q-bio.TO stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape\ntissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain\ncontested.

The evolution of biological networks is studied by considering a\nnetwork of a few nodes embedded in a larger context. Taking into account this\nfact that any network under study is actually embedded in a larger context, we\ndefine network architecture, not on the basis of physical interactions alone,\nbut rather as a specification of the manner in which constraints are placed\nupon the states of its nodes. We show that such network architectures\npossessing cycles in their topology, in contrast to those that do not, may be\nsubjected to unsatisfiable constraints. This may be a significant factor\nleading to selection biased against those network architectures where such\ninconsistent constraints are more likely to arise. We proceed to quantify the\nlikelihood of inconsistency arising as a function of network architecture\nfinding that, in the absence of sampling bias over the space of possible\nconstraints and for a given network size, networks with a larger number of\ncycles are more likely to have unsatisfiable constraints placed upon them. Our\nresults identify a constraint that, at least in isolation, would contribute to\na bias in the evolutionary process toward more hierarchical-modular versus\ncompletely connected network architectures. Together, these results highlight\nthe context-dependence of the functionality of biological networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 02:29:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Smith", "Cameron", ""], ["Pechuan", "Ximo", ""], ["Puzio", "Raymond S.", ""], ["Biro", "Daniel", ""], ["Bergman", "Aviv", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.02975", "submitter": "Vincent Zhao", "authors": "Vincent Zhao, Steven W.

Although robust behaviours\nsuch as genetic oscillators have been designed and implemented in prokaryotic\nand eukaryotic organisms, a priori genetic engineering of even simple networks\nremains difficult, and many aspects of cell and molecular biology critical to\nengineering robust networks are still inadequately characterized. Particularly,\nperiodic processes such as gene doubling and cell division are rarely\nconsidered in gene regulatory models, which may become more important as\nsynthetic biologists utilize new tools for chromosome integration. We studied a\nchromosome-integrated, negative-feedback circuit based upon the bacteriophage\n{\\lambda} transcriptional repressor Cro and observed strong, feedback-dependent\noscillations in single-cell time traces. This finding was surprising due to a\nlack of cooperativity, long delays or fast protein degradation. We further show\nthat oscillations are synchronized to the cell cycle by gene duplication, with\nphase shifts predictably correlating with estimated gene doubling times.\nFurthermore, we characterized the influence of negative feedback on the\nmagnitude and dynamics of noise in gene expression. Our results show that\ncell-cycle effects must be accounted for in accurate, predictive models for\neven simple gene circuits. Cell-cycle-periodic expression of {\\lambda} Cro also\nsuggests an explanation for cell-size dependence in lysis probability and an\nevolutionary basis for site-specific {\\lambda} integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 12:00:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hensel", "Zach", ""], ["Marquez-Lago", "Tatiana T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08903", "submitter": "Nina Otter", "authors": "Nina Otter, Mason A.

It\nis robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and\ncoordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features\nof the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and\nfascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and\nnew algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a\nrapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and\ncomputational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and\n(2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation\nof PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the\ncomputation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of\nsynthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source\nimplementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we\nindicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different\ntypes of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the\ncomputation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the\ntutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in\nthe benchmarking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 00:00:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 12:40:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2015 13:03:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 12:47:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 00:48:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 21:08:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:10:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Otter", "Nina", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Tillmann", "Ulrike", ""], ["Grindrod", "Peter", ""], ["Harrington", "Heather A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08977", "submitter": "Maurice Roux", "authors": "Maurice Roux", "title": "A comparative study of divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "J. of Classification 35 (2018): 345-366", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A general scheme for divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms is proposed.\nIt is made of three main steps : first a splitting procedure for the\nsubdivision of clusters into two subclusters, second a local evaluation of the\nbipartitions resulting from the tentative splits and, third, a formula for\ndetermining the nodes levels of the resulting dendrogram.
