Great efforts have recently been\nmade on developing new methods for feature selection that handle the above data\ncharacteristics, but almost all methods were evaluated based on performance of\nmodel predictions. However, little attention has been paid to address a\nfundamental question: how appropriate are those evaluation criteria? Most\nfeature selection methods often control the model fit, but the ability to\nidentify meaningful subsets of features cannot be evaluated simply based on the\nprediction accuracy. If tiny changes to the training data would lead to large\nchanges in the chosen feature subset, then many of the biological features that\nan algorithm has found are likely to be a data artifact rather than real\nbiological signal. This crucial need of identifying relevant and reproducible\nfeatures motivated the reproducibility evaluation criterion such as Stability,\nwhich quantifies how robust a method is to perturbations in the data. In our\npaper, we compare the performance of popular model prediction metric MSE and\nproposed reproducibility criterion Stability in evaluating four widely used\nfeature selection methods in both simulations and experimental microbiome\napplications. We conclude that Stability is a preferred feature selection\ncriterion over MSE because it better quantifies the reproducibility of the\nfeature selection method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 22:23:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Lingjing", ""], ["Haiminen", "Niina", ""], ["Carrieri", "Anna-Paola", ""], ["Huang", "Shi", ""], ["Vazquez-Baeza", "Yoshiki", ""], ["Parida", "Laxmi", ""], ["Kim", "Ho-Cheol", ""], ["Swafford", "Austin D.", ""], ["Knight", "Rob", ""], ["Natarajan", "Loki", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.00094", "submitter": "Lagnajit Pattanaik", "authors": "Lagnajit Pattanaik, Octavian-Eugen Ganea, Ian Coley, Klavs F.

Among others, physiologically-based\npharmacokinetic models are used to describe drug absorption, distribution and\nmetabolism in human. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is gaining interest in\nthe pharmacological M\\&S community as an important element for quality\nassessment of model-based inference. Physiological models often present\ninter-correlated parameters. The inclusion of correlated factors in GSA and the\nsensitivity indices interpretation has proven an issue for these models. Here\nwe devise and evaluate a latent variable approach for dealing with correlated\nfactors in GSA. This approach describes the correlation between two model\ninputs through the causal relationship of three independent factors: the latent\nvariable and the unique variances of the two correlated parameters. Then, GSA\nis performed with the classical variance-based method. We applied the latent\nvariable approach to a set of algebraic models and a case from\nphysiologically-based pharmacokinetics. Then, we compared our approach to\nSobol's GSA assuming no correlations, Sobol's GSA with groups and the\nKucherenko approach. The relative ease of implementation and interpretation\nmakes this a simple approach for carrying out GSA for models with correlated\ninput factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 10:03:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Melillo", "Nicola", ""], ["Darwich", "Adam S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02577", "submitter": "Abu Mohammed Raisuddin", "authors": "Abu Mohammed Raisuddin, Elias Vaattovaara, Mika Nevalainen, Marko\n  Nikki, Elina J\\\"arvenp\\\"a\\\"a, Kaisa Makkonen, Pekka Pinola, Tuula Palsio,\n  Arttu Niemensivu, Osmo Tervonen, Aleksei Tiulpin", "title": "Critical Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks for Wrist Fracture Detection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Wrist Fracture is the most common type of fracture with a high incidence\nrate.

Due to the\nrapid growth of both the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and the number\nof unique mutations, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates\nfaces an emergent large-data challenge. We introduce a dimension-reduced\n$k$-means clustering strategy to tackle this challenge. We examine the\nperformance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms:\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding\n(t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). By using\nfour benchmark datasets, we found that UMAP is the best-suited technique due to\nits stable, reliable, and efficient performance, its ability to improve\nclustering accuracy, especially for large Jaccard distanced-based datasets, and\nits superior clustering visualization. The UMAP-assisted $k$-means clustering\nenables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome\nisolates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 18:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hozumi", "Yuta", ""], ["Wang", "Rui", ""], ["Yin", "Changchuan", ""], ["Wei", "Guo-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15647", "submitter": "Franz Franchetti", "authors": "Yoko Franchetti, Thomas D.

We develop\nthe method by focusing on estimating hepatic enzyme and drug transporter\nactivity through breath-biopsy samples clinically obtained via the erythromycin\nbreath test (EBT): a small dose of radio-labeled drug is injected and the\nsubsequent content of radio-labeled CO$_2$ is measured repeatedly in exhaled\nbreath; the resulting time series is analyzed. To model EBT we developed a\n14-variable non-linear reduced order dynamical model that describes the\nbehavior of the drug and its metabolites in the human body well enough to\ncapture all biological phenomena of interest. Based on this system of coupled\nnon-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we treat the measurement\nproblem as inverse problem: we estimate the ODE parameters of individual\npatients from the measured EBT time series. These estimates then provide a\nmeasurement of the liver activity of interest. The parameters are hard to\nestimate as the ODEs are stiff and the problem needs to be regularized to\nensure stable convergence. We develop a formal operator framework to capture\nand treat the specific non-linearities present, and perform perturbation\nanalysis to establish properties of the estimation procedure and its solution.\nDevelopment of the method required 150,000 CPU hours at a supercomputing\ncenter, and a single production run takes CPU 24 hours. We introduce and\nanalyze the method in the context of future precision dosing of drugs for\nvulnerable patients (e.g., oncology, nephrology, or pediatrics) to eventually\nensure efficacy and avoid toxicity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 15:09:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Franchetti", "Yoko", ""], ["Nolin", "Thomas D.", ""], ["Franchetti", "Franz", ""]]}]
