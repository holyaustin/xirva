The basic\nassumption is that coalescent events occur at a rate inversely proportional to\nthe effective population size $N_{e}(t)$, a time-varying measure of genetic\ndiversity. When the sampling process (collection of samples over time) depends\non $N_{e}(t)$, the coalescent and the sampling processes can be jointly modeled\nto improve estimation of $N_{e}(t)$. Failing to do so can lead to bias due to\nmodel misspecification. However, the way that the sampling process depends on\nthe effective population size may vary over time. We introduce an approach\nwhere the sampling process is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with\nrate equal to the product of $N_{e}(t)$ and a time-varying coefficient, making\nminimal assumptions on their functional shapes via Markov random field priors.\nWe provide scalable algorithms for inference, show the model performance\nvis-a-vis alternative methods in a simulation study, and apply our model to\nSARS-CoV-2 sequences from Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties.

Over\nthe past two decades, target decoy approaches (TDAs) and decoy-free approaches\n(DFAs), have been widely used to estimate FDR. TDAs use a database of decoy\nspecies to faithfully model score distributions of incorrect peptide-spectrum\nmatches (PSMs). DFAs, on the other hand, fit two-component mixture models to\nlearn the parameters of correct and incorrect PSM score distributions. While\nconceptually straightforward, both approaches lead to problems in practice,\nparticularly in experiments that push instrumentation to the limit and generate\nlow fragmentation-efficiency and low signal-to-noise-ratio spectra. Results: We\nintroduce a new decoy-free framework for FDR estimation that generalizes\npresent DFAs while exploiting more search data in a manner similar to TDAs. Our\napproach relies on multi-component mixtures, in which score distributions\ncorresponding to the correct PSMs, best incorrect PSMs, and second-best\nincorrect PSMs are modeled by the skew normal family. We derive EM algorithms\nto estimate parameters of these distributions from the scores of best and\nsecond-best PSMs associated with each experimental spectrum. We evaluate our\nmodels on multiple proteomics datasets and a HeLa cell digest case study\nconsisting of more than a million spectra in total.

Individual deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were\noptimised to predict the expression of 17,695 genes from hematoxylin and eosin\n(HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs). Predictions for 9,334 (52.75%) genes\nwere significantly associated with RNA-sequencing estimates (FDR adjusted\np-value < 0.05). 1,011 of the genes were brought forward for validation, with\n876 (87%) and 908 (90%) successfully replicated in internal and external test\ndata, respectively. Predicted spatial intra-tumour variabilities in expression\nwere validated in 76 genes, out of which 59 (77.6%) had a significant\nassociation (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05) with spatial transcriptomics\nestimates. These results suggest that the proposed methodology can be applied\nto predict both tumour average gene expression and intra-tumour spatial\nexpression directly from morphology, thus providing a scalable approach to\ncharacterise intra-tumour heterogeneity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2020 16:27:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yinxi", ""], ["Kartasalo", "Kimmo", ""], ["Valkonen", "Masi", ""], ["Larsson", "Christer", ""], ["Ruusuvuori", "Pekka", ""], ["Hartman", "Johan", ""], ["Rantalainen", "Mattias", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.09317", "submitter": "Janani Ravi", "authors": "Kewalin Samart, Phoebe Tuyishime, Arjun Krishnan, Janani Ravi", "title": "Reconciling Multiple Connectivity Scores for Drug Repurposing", "comments": "KS and PT contributed equally to this work.

This principle was defined and popularized by the\ninfluential 'connectivity map' study in 2006 regarding reversal relationships\nbetween disease- and drug-induced gene expression profiles, quantified by a\ndisease-drug 'connectivity score.' Over the past 15 years, several studies have\nproposed variations in calculating connectivity scores towards improving\naccuracy and robustness in light of massive growth in reference drug profiles.\nHowever, these variations have been formulated inconsistently using various\nnotations and terminologies even though they are based on a common set of\nconceptual and statistical ideas. Therefore, we present a systematic\nreconciliation of multiple disease-drug similarity metrics (ES, css, Sum,\nCosine, XSum, XCor, XSpe, XCos, EWCos) and connectivity scores (CS, RGES, NCS,\nWCS, Tau, CSS, EMUDRA) by defining them using consistent notation and\nterminology. In addition to providing clarity and deeper insights, this\ncoherent definition of connectivity scores and their relationships provides a\nunified scheme that newer methods can adopt, enabling the computational\ndrug-development community to compare and investigate different approaches\neasily.

In this paper, we apply a recently developed\nmethod named contrastive explanations method (CEM) to explain why a chemical or\nmolecule is predicted to be toxic or not. In contrast to popular methods that\nprovide explanations based on what features are present in the molecule, the\nCEM provides additional explanation on what features are missing from the\nmolecule that is crucial for the prediction, known as the pertinent negative.\nThe CEM does this by optimizing for the minimum perturbation to the model using\na projected fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). We\nverified that the explanation from CEM matches known toxicophores and findings\nfrom other work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 23:34:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Lim", "Kar Wai", ""], ["Sharma", "Bhanushee", ""], ["Das", "Payel", ""], ["Chenthamarakshan", "Vijil", ""], ["Dordick", "Jonathan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.12277", "submitter": "Lisa Lamberti", "authors": "Holger Eble, Michael Joswig, Lisa Lamberti and Will Ludington", "title": "Higher-order interactions in fitness landscapes are sparse", "comments": "71 pages, various figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM math.MG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biological fitness arises from interactions between molecules, genes, and\norganisms.
