As a result, after induction of gene expression, the time at which a\nspecific protein count is reached is stochastic as well. Therefore events\ntaking place at a critical protein level will see stochasticity in their\ntiming. First-passage time (FPT), the time at which a stochastic process hits a\ncritical threshold, provides a framework to model such events. Here, we\ninvestigate stochasticity in FPT. Particularly, we consider events for which\ncontrolling stochasticity is advantageous. As a possible regulatory mechanism,\nwe also investigate effect of auto-regulation, where the transcription rate of\ngene depends on protein count, on stochasticity of FPT. Specifically, we\ninvestigate for an optimal auto-regulation which minimizes stochasticity in\nFPT, given fixed mean FPT and threshold.\n  For this purpose, we model the gene expression at a single cell level. We\nfind analytic formulas for statistical moments of the FPT in terms of model\nparameters. Moreover, we examine the gene expression model with\nauto-regulation.

Although methods exist for\nunsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative\nto clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the\nclustering algorithm and number of clusters. Results: We propose a novel\nmethod, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive\ntesting of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE\nfirst computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal\ncomponents (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE)\nmethod. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the\nspectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level\np-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled\nby Tracey-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE\nalgorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To\nillustrate the utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques\nfor testing the association between MSigDB gene sets and the variance structure\nof microarray gene expression data.

Limited control over ecological parameters has\nhindered progress in understanding of what enables species to colonise new\narea, as well as the importance of inter-species interactions. Such control is\nnecessary to construct reliable mathematical models of ecosystems. In our work,\nwe studied dispersal in the context of bacterial range expansions and\nidentified the major determinants of species coexistence for a bacterial model\nsystem of three Escherichia coli strains (toxin producing, sensitive, and\nresistant). Genetic engineering allowed us to tune strain growth rates and to\ndesign different ecological scenarios (cyclic and hierarchical). We found that\ncoexistence of all strains depended on three strongly interdependent factors:\ncomposition of inoculum, relative strain growth rates, and effective toxin\nrange. Robust agreement between our experiments and a thoroughly calibrated\ncomputational model enabled us to extrapolate these intricate interdependencies\nin terms of phenomenological biodiversity laws. Our mathematical analysis also\nsuggested that cyclic dominance between strains is not a prerequisite for\ncoexistence in competitive range expansions. Instead, robust three-strain\ncoexistence required a balance between growth rates and either a reduced\ninitial ratio of the toxin-producing strain, or a sufficiently short toxin\nrange.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 10:38:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Markus F.", ""], ["Poxleitner", "Gabriele", ""], ["Hebisch", "Elke", ""], ["Frey", "Erwin", ""], ["Opitz", "Madeleine", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5246", "submitter": "Zhenyu Li", "authors": "Baichen Li, Lin Li, Allan Guan, Quan Dong, Kangcheng Ruan, Ronggui Hu\n  and Zhenyu Li", "title": "A Smartphone Controlled Handheld Microfluidic Liquid Handling System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ins-det q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technologies have made it possible to\nmanipulate small volume liquids with unprecedented resolution, automation and\nintegration.

As a demonstration, we show that the system can\nautomatically perform all the liquid handling steps of a bead-based sandwich\nimmunoassay on a multi-layer PDMS chip without any human intervention. The\nfootprint of the system is 6 by 10.5 by 16.5cm, and the total weight is 829g\nincluding battery. Powered by a 12.8V 1500mAh Li battery, the system consumed\n2.2W on average during the immunoassay and lasted for 8.7 hrs. This handheld\nmicrofluidic liquid handling platform is generally applicable to many\nbiochemical and cell-based assays requiring complex liquid manipulation and\nsample preparation steps such as FISH, PCR, flow cytometry and nucleic acid\nsequencing.

In this paper we consider the problem of the Persistent\nPerfect Phylogeny (referred as P-PP) recently introduced to extend the perfect\nphylogeny model allowing persistent characters, that is characters can be\ngained and lost at most once. We define a natural generalization of the P-PP\nproblem obtained by requiring that for some pairs (character, species), neither\nthe species nor any of its ancestors can have the character. In other words,\nsome characters cannot be persistent for some species. This new problem is\ncalled Constrained P-PP (CP-PP).\n  Based on a graph formulation of the CP-PP problem, we are able to provide a\npolynomial time solution for the CP-PP problem for matrices having an empty\nconflict-graph. In particular we show that all such matrices admit a persistent\nperfect phylogeny in the unconstrained case. Using this result, we develop a\nparameterized algorithm for solving the CP-PP problem where the parameter is\nthe number of characters. A preliminary experimental analysis of the algorithm\nshows that it performs efficiently and it may analyze real haplotype data not\nconforming to the classical perfect phylogeny model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 08:45:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bonizzoni", "Paola", ""], ["Carrieri", "Anna Paola", ""], ["Della Vedova", "Gianluca", ""], ["Trucco", "Gabriella", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7856", "submitter": "Jose Vilar", "authors": "Jose M.
