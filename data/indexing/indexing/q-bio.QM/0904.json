Several mechanisms are at work towards the formation of the\nspindle, one of which is the `capture' of chromosome pairs, held together by\nkinetochores, by randomly searching microtubules. Although the entire cell\ncycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less\nthan an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit?\nPrevious theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and\ncapture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize\nthe search time. In this paper, we examine this conjecture. We compute the mean\nsearch time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site,\nusing a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic\nparameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by\nphysical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for\ndifferent cells using experimental data. In yeast and mammalian cells, the\nobserved changes in microtubule kinetics between interphase and mitosis are\nbeneficial in reducing the search time. In {\\it Xenopus} extracts, by contrast,\nthe opposite effect is observed, in agreement with the current understanding\nthat large cells use additional mechanisms to regulate the duration of the\nmitotic phase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2009 09:32:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 03:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 09:12:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"], ["Govindan", "Bindu S.", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"]]}, {"id": "0904.0506", "submitter": "Zhou Tianshou", "authors": "Jiajun Zhang, Zhanjiang Yuan, Tianshou Zhou", "title": "Synchronization and clustering of synthetic genetic networks: A role for\n  cis-regulatory modules", "comments": "30 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Glycans are involved\nin fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance,\ncell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and\npathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by\nsequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of\nenzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as\nsubstrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their\nintermingled pathways.

The N-linked glycosylation\npathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological\nmodules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan\nsynthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between\nmodules to be controlled by the upstream region.

We describe an extension of the deterministic\nmetabolic control analysis (MCA) to the stochastic regime. We introduce\nstochastic sensitivities for mean and covariance values of reactant\nconcentrations and reaction fluxes and show that there exist MCA-like summation\ntheorems among these sensitivities. The summation theorems for flux variances\nare shown to depend on the size of the measurement time window ($\\epsilon$),\nwithin which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. The\ndegree of the $\\epsilon$-dependency can become significant for processes\ninvolving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new\nmeasure of time scale separation. This $\\epsilon$-dependency is shown to be\nclosely related to the power-law scaling observed in flux fluctuations in\nvarious complex networks. We propose a systematic way to control fluctuations\nof reactant concentrations while minimizing changes in mean concentration\nlevels. Such orthogonal control is obtained by introducing a control vector\nindicating the strength and direction of parameter perturbations leading to a\nsensitive control. We also propose a possible implication in the control of\nflux fluctuation: The control distribution for flux fluctuations changes with\nthe measurement time window size, $\\epsilon$. When a control engineer applies a\nspecific control operation on a reaction system, the system can respond\ncontrary to what is expected, depending on the time window size $\\epsilon$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2009 21:43:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2009 20:12:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 20:05:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Kyung Hyuk", ""], ["Sauro", "Herbert M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3253", "submitter": "Joel Miller", "authors": "Joel C Miller", "title": "Percolation in clustered networks", "comments": "The first version is being separated into multiple papers.

Our predictions are based on flexible\ndefect excitations resulted from local melting or unstacking of DNA base pairs.\nWe found that the reduced bending rigidity alone can lead to measurable changes\nof the variance of linking number distribution of short circular DNAs. If the\ndefect is accompanied by local unwinding, the effect becomes much more\nprominent. The predictions can be easily investigated in experiments, providing\na new method to study the micromechanics of sharply bent DNAs and the thermal\nstability of specific DNA sequences.
