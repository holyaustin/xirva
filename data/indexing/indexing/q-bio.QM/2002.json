SSMs are popular\nbecause they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological\nprocesses separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows\necologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear\nor nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the\ntwo sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate\nbetween biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the\nsampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological\nquantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly\nmodeled.
