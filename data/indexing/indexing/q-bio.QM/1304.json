In the fields\nof population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation\nare commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that\nthese measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow\nis common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as\nwind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow\namong populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the\ndistribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not\nbe overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from\ngenetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches\ngenerally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new\nsimpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is\npresented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of\ngenetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,\nusing any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These\ndirectional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to\ncalculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow\npatterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called\ndivMigrate-online introduced in this paper. Using simulated data sets with\nknown gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving\ncomplex migration patterns under a range of study designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Mar 2013 15:30:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 04:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 13:56:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sundqvist", "Lisa", ""], ["Keenan", "Kevin", ""], ["Zackrisson", "Martin", ""], ["Prod\u00f6hl", "Paulo", ""], ["Kleinhans", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.0122", "submitter": "Prashanth Alluvada", "authors": "Prashanth Alluvada", "title": "Color Perception: Opening up the Chromaticity Cone", "comments": "20 pages, 31 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the XYZ color space, the subset of the tri-stimuli corresponding to\nspike-type (monochromatic) impingement of energy is the chromaticity cone, CC.\nUsing a family of concentric spheres, we describe a nonlinear transformation\nover the CC and construct a bijection from the CC onto the flat plane.

We first test the method\nwith simulated data, assuming a typical sigmoidal dose-response curve and\nassuming imperfect imaging that includes artifactual baseline signal drift and\nrandom error. With these few assumptions, rapid quantitative pharmacodynamic\nimaging reliably estimates EC50 from the simulated data, except when noise\noverwhelms the drug effect or when the effect occurs only at high doses. In\npreliminary fMRI studies of primate brain using a dopamine agonist, the\nobserved noise level is modest compared with observed drug effects, and a\nquantitative EC50 can be obtained from some regional time-signal curves.

These (local)\nunfolding events result in a large number of conformers that differ from each\nother very slightly.

Furthermore, we combine our\nFIRST-ensemble rigidity predictions with the ensemble solvent accessibility\ndata of the backbone amides and propose a novel computational method which uses\nboth rigidity and solvent accessibility for predicting hydrogen-deuterium\nexchange (HDX).
