However, the problem is\ncomputationally hard; as a result, virtually all the existing pipelines use\nfast but approximate scoring functions, in spite of the fact that they have\nbeen shown to systematically produce incorrect results. A few interesting exact\napproaches are known, but they are very slow and hence not practical in the\ncase of realistic sequences. Results: We give an exact solution, solely based\non deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), to the problem of finding not\nonly the p-value, but the whole relevant part of the Markovian probability\ndistribution function of a motif in a biological sequence. In particular, the\ntime complexity of the algorithm in the most interesting regimes is far better\nthan that of Nuel (2006), which was the fastest similar exact algorithm known\nto date; in many cases, even approximate methods are outperformed. Conclusions:\nDFAs are a standard tool of computer science for the study of patterns, but so\nfar they have been sparingly used in the study of biological motifs. Previous\nworks do propose algorithms involving automata, but there they are used\nrespectively as a first step to build a Finite Markov Chain Imbedding (FMCI),\nor to write a generating function: whereas we only rely on the concept of DFA\nto perform the calculations.

Motivated specifically by\nthese problems of biological information, we propose here a class of measures\nto quantify the contextual nature of the information in sets of objects, based\non Kolmogorov's intrinsic complexity. Such measures discount both random and\nredundant information and are inherent in that they do not require a defined\nstate space to quantify the information. The maximization of this new measure,\nwhich can be formulated in terms of the universal information distance, appears\nto have several useful and interesting properties, some of which we illustrate\nwith examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2008 20:58:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Galas", "David J.", ""], ["Nykter", "Matti", ""], ["Carter", "Gregory W.", ""], ["Price", "Nathan D.", ""], ["Shmulevich", "Ilya", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.4122", "submitter": "Tie Shen", "authors": "Tie Shen, Ying Xiong, Haoran Zheng, Xiaosong Pan, Rui Bin, Jianping\n  Liu, Jihui Wu, Weiqun Shen", "title": "Plotting Calibration Curve Using Biosynthetic Specifically Labeled\n  Compounds for Accurate Mass Isotopomer Analysis", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.BM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author(s), due to the requirement of the\njournal it currently submitted to\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jan 2008 09:30:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 13:36:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2008 15:55:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Tie", ""], ["Xiong", "Ying", ""], ["Zheng", "Haoran", ""], ["Pan", "Xiaosong", ""], ["Bin", "Rui", ""], ["Liu", "Jianping", ""], ["Wu", "Jihui", ""], ["Shen", "Weiqun", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.4164", "submitter": "Matthias Kaschube", "authors": "Matthias Kaschube, Michael Schnabel, Siegrid L\\\"owel and Fred Wolf", "title": "Inter-areal coordination of columnar architectures during visual\n  cortical development", "comments": "30 pages, 1 table, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0901615106", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC q-bio.QM", "license": null, "abstract": "  The occurrence of a critical period of plasticity in the visual cortex has\nlong been established, yet its function in normal development is not fully\nunderstood.

Using a\nsuitably robust algorithm these signatures can potentially be used to connect\nmolecules with similar pharmacological or toxicological properties. The\nConnectivity Map was a novel concept and innovative tool first introduced by\nLamb et al to connect small molecules, genes, and diseases using genomic\nsignatures [Lamb et al (2006), Science 313, 1929-1935]. However, the\nConnectivity Map had some limitations, particularly there was no effective\nsafeguard against false connections if the observed connections were considered\non an individual-by-individual basis. Further when several connections to the\nsame small-molecule compound were viewed as a set, the implicit null hypothesis\ntested was not the most relevant one for the discovery of real connections.\nHere we propose a simple and robust method for constructing the reference\ngene-expression profiles and a new connection scoring scheme, which importantly\nallows the valuation of statistical significance of all the connections\nobserved. We tested the new method with the two example gene-signatures (HDAC\ninhibitors and Estrogens) used by Lamb et al and also a new gene signature of\nimmunosuppressive drugs. Our testing with this new method shows that it\nachieves a higher level of specificity and sensitivity than the original\nmethod. For example, our method successfully identified raloxifene and\ntamoxifen as having significant anti-estrogen effects, while Lamb et al's\nConnectivity Map failed to identify these.

Chemogenomics, which attempts to\ncharacterize interactions between all members of a target class and all small\nmolecules simultaneously, has recently been proposed as an interesting\nalternative to traditional docking or ligand-based virtual screening\nstrategies. We propose new methods for in silico chemogenomics and validate\nthem on the virtual screening of GPCRs.
