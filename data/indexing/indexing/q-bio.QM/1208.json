The model consists of input-output transfer\nfunctions, which are derived from differential equations, using stable\nequilibria. We select a set of 'source' species, which receive input signals.\nSignals are transmitted to all other species in the system (the 'target'\nspecies) with a specific delay and transmission strength. The delay is computed\nas the maximal reaction time until a stable equilibrium for the target species\nis reached, in the context of all other reactions in the system. The\ntransmission strength is the concentration change of the target species. The\ncomputed input-output transfer functions can be stored in a matrix, fitted with\nparameters, and recalled to build discrete dynamical models. By separating\nreaction time and concentration we can greatly simplify the model,\ncircumventing typical problems of complex dynamical systems. The transfer\nfunction transformation can be applied to mass-action kinetic models of signal\ntransduction. The paper shows that this approach yields significant insight,\nwhile remaining an executable dynamical model for signal transduction.

Despite its\npotential, the intrinsic long scan times of these sequences have hampered their\nuse in clinical practice. For this reason, a large variety of methods have been\nrecently proposed to shorten the acquisition times. Among them, spherical\ndeconvolution approaches have gained a lot of interest for their ability to\nreliably recover the intra-voxel fiber configuration with a relatively small\nnumber of data samples. To overcome the intrinsic instabilities of\ndeconvolution, these methods use regularization schemes generally based on the\nassumption that the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) to be recovered in\neach voxel is sparse. The well known Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)\napproach resorts to Tikhonov regularization, based on an l2-norm prior, which\npromotes a weak version of sparsity. Also, in the last few years compressed\nsensing has been advocated to further accelerate the acquisitions and l1-norm\nminimization is generally employed as a means to promote sparsity in the\nrecovered FODs. In this paper, we provide evidence that the use of an l1-norm\nprior to regularize this class of problems is somewhat inconsistent with the\nfact that the fiber compartments all sum up to unity. To overcome this l1\ninconsistency while simultaneously exploiting sparsity more optimally than\nthrough an l2 prior, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as a constrained\nformulation between a data term and and a sparsity prior consisting in an\nexplicit bound on the l0 norm of the FOD, i.e. on the number of fibers. The\nmethod has been tested both on synthetic and real data.

Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of\nprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein\ndomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global\nstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.\nHowever, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to\nthe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult\nproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.\n  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph\nregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to\nregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold\nof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the\nregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and\nautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an\niterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP\nprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking\nperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise\nsimilarity based ranking methods.\n  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph\nregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining\nmultiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in\napplying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:32:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 14:19:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 06:21:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jim Jing-Yan", ""], ["Bensmail", "Halima", ""], ["Gao", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.3782", "submitter": "Maxim Berezovski", "authors": "Mahmoud Labib, Nasrin Khan, Jenny Cheng, John Paul Pezacki, Maxim V.\n  Berezovski", "title": "Three-Way Electrochemical Sensing of Ultra-Low MicroRNA Levels", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to errors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1021/ja308216z", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an emerging class of biomarkers that are frequently\nderegulated in cancer cells and have shown a great promise for cancer\nclassification and prognosis.

For\ndecades, research in this area has relied upon multimetric indices of various\nforms. Although indices may be numbers, many are constructed based on\nprocedures that are highly qualitative in nature, thus limiting the\nquantitative rigour of the practical interpretations made from these indices.\nThe statistical modelling approach to construct the latent health factor index\n(LHFI) was recently developed to express ecological data, collected to\nconstruct conventional multimetric health indices, in a rigorous quantitative\nmodel that integrates qualitative features of ecosystem health and preconceived\necological relationships among such features. This hierarchical modelling\napproach allows (a) statistical inference of health for observed sites and (b)\nprediction of health for unobserved sites, all accompanied by formal\nuncertainty statements. Thus far, the LHFI approach has been demonstrated and\nvalidated on freshwater ecosystems. The goal of this paper is to adapt this\napproach to modelling estuarine ecosystem health, particularly that of the\npreviously unassessed system in Richibucto in New Brunswick, Canada. Field data\ncorrespond to biotic health metrics that constitute the AZTI marine biotic\nindex (AMBI) and abiotic predictors preconceived to influence biota. We also\nbriefly discuss related LHFI research involving additional metrics that form\nthe infaunal trophic index (ITI). Our paper is the first to construct a\nscientifically sensible model to rigorously identify the collective explanatory\ncapacity of salinity, distance downstream, channel depth, and silt-clay content\n--- all regarded a priori as qualitatively important abiotic drivers ---\ntowards site health in the Richibucto ecosystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2012 07:21:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 12:09:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 13:13:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 07:29:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Margaret", ""], ["Chiu", "Grace S.", ""], ["Lu", "Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5476", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "On characteristics of an ordinary differential equation and a related\n  inverse problem in epidemiology", "comments": "8 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we examine the properties of a recently described ordinary\ndifferential equation that relates the age-specific prevalence of a chronic\ndisease with the incidence and mortalities of the diseased and healthy persons.\nThe equation has been used to estimate the incidence from prevalence data,\nwhich is an inverse problem.
