I argue that exact equations require calibrated multiscale analysis to\ndeal with ions. Exact theories in biochemistry must use mathematics of\ninteractions because biological ionic solutions, derived from seawater, are\ncomplex (not simple) fluids. The activity of one ion depends on every other\nion. Mathematics of conservative interactions is well understood but friction\nis another matter. Mathematicians now have now an energetic variational\ncalculus dealing with friction. Complex fluids need variational methods because\neverything interacts with everything else. Mathematics designed to handle\ninteractions is needed to produce exact equations. If interactions are not\naddressed with variational mathematics, they are bewildering. The mathematics\nmust include the global properties of the electric field. Flow of charge in one\nplace changes the flow everywhere by Kirchoff and Maxwell laws. Charge changes\nphysical nature as it flows through a circuit. It is ions in salt water; it is\nelectrons in a vacuum tube; it is quasi-particles in a semiconductor; and it is\nnothing much in a vacuum capacitor (i.e., displacement current). Charge is\nabstract. The physical nature of charge and current is strikingly diverse; yet,\nthe flow of current is exactly the same in every element in a series circuit.\nThe global nature of electric flow prevents the law of mass action from being\nexact. The law of mass action (with rate constants that are constant) does not\nknow about charge. The law of mass action is about mass conservation. I believe\nthe law of mass action must be modified to be consistent with the Kirchoff\ncurrent law if biochemistry is to be an exact science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Aug 2014 18:22:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenberg", "Bob", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0269", "submitter": "Zvi Rosen", "authors": "Adam L.

As such, approximate stochastic simulation\nalgorithms such as the tau-leap algorithm are often used.

The bias inherent in this estimator is then reduced using a\nnumber of corrections. Each correction term is estimated using a collection of\npaired sample paths where one path of each pair is generated at a higher\naccuracy compared to the other (and so more expensive). By sharing random\nvariables between these paired paths the variance of each correction estimator\ncan be reduced. This renders the multi-level method very efficient as only a\nrelatively small number of paired paths are required to calculate each\ncorrection term.

By\nstartling schools of fish with a simulated attack in an experimental arena, we\ndemonstrate that changes in the direction and speed by a small percentage of\nindividuals that detect the danger initiate an escape wave. This escape wave\nconsists of a densely packed band of individuals that causes other school\nmembers to change direction. In the majority of cases this wave passes through\nthe entire group. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that this mechanism\ncan, through local interactions alone, produce arbitrarily large escape waves.\nIn the model, when we set the group density to that seen in real fish schools,\nwe find that the risk to the members at the edge of the group is roughly equal\nto the risk of those within the group.

In addition to an improved camera detective\nquantum efficiency, acquisition of DDD movies allows for correction of movement\nof the specimen, due both to instabilities in the microscope specimen stage and\nelectron beam-induced movement. Unlike specimen stage drift, beam-induced\nmovement is not always homogeneous within an image. Local correlation in the\ntrajectories of nearby particles suggests that beam-induced motion is due to\ndeformation of the ice layer. Algorithms have already been described that can\ncorrect movement for large regions of frames and for > 1 MDa protein particles.\nAnother algorithm allows individual < 1 MDa protein particle trajectories to be\nestimated, but requires rolling averages to be calculated from frames and fits\nlinear trajectories for particles. Here we describe an algorithm that allows\nfor individual < 1 MDa particle images to be aligned without frame averaging or\nlinear trajectories. The algorithm maximizes the overall correlation of the\nshifted frames with the sum of the shifted frames. The optimum in this single\nobjective function is found efficiently by making use of analytically\ncalculated derivatives of the function. To smooth estimates of particle\ntrajectories, rapid changes in particle positions between frames are penalized\nin the objective function and weighted averaging of nearby trajectories ensures\nlocal correlation in trajectories.
