Analysis and interpretation of such data represents a challenge: the\ntiming of animal behaviors may be stochastic and modulated by kinematic\nvariables, by the interaction with the environment or with the conspecifics\nwithin the animal group, and dependent on internal cognitive or behavioral\nstate of the individual. Existing models for collective motion typically fail\nto incorporate the discrete, stochastic, and internal-state-dependent aspects\nof behavior, while models focusing on individual animal behavior typically\nignore the spatial aspects of the problem. Here we propose a probabilistic\nmodeling framework to address this gap. Each animal can switch stochastically\nbetween different behavioral states, with each state resulting in a possibly\ndifferent law of motion through space. Switching rates for behavioral\ntransitions can depend in a very general way, which we seek to identify from\ndata, on the effects of the environment as well as the interaction between the\nanimals. We represent the switching dynamics as a Generalized Linear Model and\nshow that: (i) forward simulation of multiple interacting animals is possible\nusing a variant of the Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm; (ii)\nformulated properly, the maximum likelihood inference of switching rate\nfunctions is tractably solvable by gradient descent; (iii) model selection can\nbe used to identify factors that modulate behavioral state switching and to\nappropriately adjust model complexity to data. To illustrate our framework, we\napply it to two synthetic models of animal motion and to real zebrafish\ntracking data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 14:09:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bodova", "Katarina", ""], ["Mitchell", "Gabriel J.", ""], ["Harpaz", "Roy", ""], ["Schneidman", "Elad", ""], ["Tkacik", "Gasper", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.00574", "submitter": "Chrysafis Vogiatzis", "authors": "Chrysafis Vogiatzis, Mustafa Can Camur", "title": "Identification of Essential Proteins Using Induced Stars in\n  Protein-Protein Interaction Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we propose a novel centrality metric, referred to as star\ncentrality, which incorporates information from the closed neighborhood of a\nnode, rather than solely from the node itself, when calculating its topological\nimportance.

Often these imaging studies require us to compare\nbiological species or mutants, and to do this we need to quantitatively\ncharacterise their behaviour. Mathematical models offer a quantitative\ndescription of a system that enables us to perform this comparison, but to\nrelate these mechanistic mathematical models to imaging data, we need to\nestimate the parameters of the models. In this work, we study the impact of\ncollecting data at different temporal resolutions on parameter inference for\nbiological transport models by performing exact inference for simple velocity\njump process models in a Bayesian framework. This issue is prominent in a host\nof studies because the majority of imaging technologies place constraints on\nthe frequency with which images can be collected, and the discrete nature of\nobservations can introduce errors into parameter estimates. In this work, we\navoid such errors by formulating the velocity jump process model within a\nhidden states framework. This allows us to obtain estimates of the\nreorientation rate and noise amplitude for noisy observations of a simple\nvelocity jump process. We demonstrate the sensitivity of these estimates to\ntemporal variations in the sampling resolution and extent of measurement noise.\nWe use our methodology to provide experimental guidelines for researchers\naiming to characterise motile behaviour that can be described by a velocity\njump process.

Results: We thus developed the proFIA package, which\nimplements a suite of innovative algorithms to preprocess FIA-HRMS raw files,\nand generates the table of peak intensities. The workflow consists of 3 steps:\ni) noise estimation, peak detection and quantification, ii) peak grouping\nacross samples, and iii) missing value imputation. In addition, we have\nimplemented a new indicator to quantify the potential alteration of the feature\npeak shape due to matrix effect. The preprocessing is fast (less than 15 s per\nfile), and the value of the main parameters (ppm and dmz) can be easily\ninferred from the mass resolution of the instrument. Application to two\nmetabolomics datasets (including spiked serum samples) showed high precision\n(96%) and recall (98%) compared with manual integration.

Extensive numerical\nexperiments involving more than 4,000 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBBind\ndatabase and near 100,000 ligands and decoys in the DUD database are performed\nto test respectively the scoring power and the virtual screening power of the\nproposed topological approaches. It is demonstrated that the present approaches\noutperform the modern machine learning based methods in protein-ligand binding\naffinity predictions and ligand-decoy discrimination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Aug 2017 20:41:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cang", "Zixuan", ""], ["Mu", "Lin", ""], ["Wei", "Guowei", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08160", "submitter": "Umut Eser", "authors": "Kaan Aygen, Berkay Celik and Umut Eser", "title": "Determining Positive Cancer Rescue Mutations in p53 Based Cancers by\n  using Artificial Intelligence", "comments": "4 pages, 5 figures.

Particularly the\nchange of cortisol secretion due to stress exposure has been discussed as an\nendophenotype of many psychosomatic health outcomes. To assess its process\ncomponents, a large variety of non-compartmental parameters (i.e., composite\nmeasures of substance concentrations at different points in time) like the area\nunder the concentration-time curve (AUC) are utilized. However, a systematic\nevaluation and validation of these parameters based on a physiologically\nplausible model of cortisol secretion has not been performed so far. Thus, a\npopulation pharmacokinetic (mixed-effects SDE) model was developed and fitted\nto densely sampled salivary cortisol data of 10 males from Montreal, Canada,\nand sparsely sampled data of 200 mixed-sex participants from Dresden, Germany,\nwho completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Besides the two major\nprocess components representing (1) stress-related cortisol secretion\n(reactivity) and (2) cortisol elimination (recovery), the model incorporates\ntwo additional, often disregarded components: (3) the secretory delay after\nstress onset, and (4) deviations from the projected steady-state concentration.\nThe fitted model (R2 = 99%) was thereafter used to investigate the correlation\nstructure of the four individually varying, and readily interpretable model\nparameters and eleven popular non-compartmental parameters. Based on these\nanalyses, we recommend to use the minimum-maximum cortisol difference and the\nminimum concentration as proxy measures of reactivity and recovery,\nrespectively. Finally, statistical power analyses of the reactivity-related sex\neffect illustrate the consequences of using impure non-compartmental measures\nof the different process components that underlie the cortisol stress response.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 19:54:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Feb 2018 10:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Robert", ""], ["Wojtyniak", "Jan-Georg", ""], ["Weckesser", "Lisa", ""], ["Alexander", "Nina", ""], ["Engert", "Veronika", ""], ["Lehr", "Thorsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09097", "submitter": "Kazunori Yamada", "authors": "Kazunori D Yamada", "title": "Optimizing scoring function of dynamic programming of pairwise profile\n  alignment using derivative free neural network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1186/s13015-018-0123-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A profile comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is\none of the most accurate alignment methods.

However, while\nparticle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately\ndescribe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used\nto simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency\nand accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact\nalgorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system\ninto M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical\nsolutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven\nparticle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and\nspace while retaining access to their state variables at any moment.

Several studies have used phylogenetics to investigate Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) transmission among Men who have Sex with Men\n(MSMs) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, revealing many transmission clusters. The\nQuebec HIV genotyping program sequence database now includes viral sequences\nfrom close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as MSMs. In this paper,\nwe investigate clustering in those data by comparing results from several\nmethods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods,\nand two more recent algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces\na measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast\ndistance-based approach. We estimate cluster growth by focusing on recent cases\nin the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage. Results. The analyses reveal\nconsiderable overlap between cluster estimates obtained from conventional\nmethods. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus rely on different cluster definitions\nand as a result, suggest moderately different partitions. All estimates lead to\nsimilar conclusions about cluster expansion: several large clusters have\nexperienced sizeable growth, and a few new transmission clusters are likely\nemerging. Conclusions. The lack of a gold standard measure for clustering\nquality makes picking a best estimate among those proposed difficult. Work\naiming to refine clustering criteria would be required to improve estimates.\nNevertheless, the results unanimously stress the role that clusters play in\npromoting HIV incidence among MSMs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 19:39:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Villandr\u00e9", "Luc", ""], ["Labbe", "Aur\u00e9lie", ""], ["Ibanescu", "Ruxandra-Ilinca", ""], ["Brenner", "Bluma", ""], ["Roger", "Michel", ""], ["Stephens", "David A", ""]]}]
