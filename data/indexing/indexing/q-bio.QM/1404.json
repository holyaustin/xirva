Its accurate tuning leads to a remarkable ability to combat\npathogens in all their variety, while systemic failures may lead to severe\nconsequences like autoimmune diseases. Here we develop and make use of a\nnon-parametric statistical approach to assess T cell clonal size distributions\nfrom recent next generation sequencing data. For 41 healthy individuals and a\npatient with ankylosing spondylitis, who undergone treatment, we invariably\nfind power law scaling over several decades and for the first time calculate\nquantitatively meaningful values of decay exponent. It has proved to be much\nthe same among healthy donors, significantly different for an autoimmune\npatient before the therapy, and converging towards a typical value afterwards.\nWe discuss implications of the findings for theoretical understanding and\nmathematical modeling of adaptive immunity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Apr 2014 17:07:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2014 18:05:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bolkhovskaya", "O.

Here, we address\nspecifically the problem of what interaction responses support different\nnearest neighbour configurations in terms of mutual position and distance.\nResults: We find that the different interaction rules observed in different\nanimal species may be a simple consequence of the relative positions that\nindividuals assume when they move together, and of the noise inherent with the\nmovement of animals, or associated with tracking inaccuracy. Conclusions: The\nanisotropic positioning of individuals with respect to their neighbours, in\ncombination with noise, can explain several aspects of the movement responses\nobserved in real animal groups, and should be considered explicitly in future\nmodels of flocking and schooling. By making a distinction between interaction\nresponses involved in maintaining a preferred flock configuration, and\ninteraction responses directed at changing it, we provide a frame to\ndiscriminate movement interactions that signal directional conflict from those\nunderlying consensual group motion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 21:58:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2014 08:37:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Perna", "Andrea", ""], ["Gregoire", "Guillaume", ""], ["Mann", "Richard P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7197", "submitter": "Xiaoquan Wen", "authors": "Xiaoquan Wen", "title": "Bayesian Model Comparison in Genetic Association Analysis: Linear Mixed\n  Modeling and SNP Set Testing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problems of hypothesis testing and model comparison under a\nflexible Bayesian linear regression model whose formulation is closely\nconnected with the linear mixed effect model and the parametric models for SNP\nset analysis in genetic association studies.
