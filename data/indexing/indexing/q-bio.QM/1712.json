This study compares the performance of three commercial dyes for\nthe direct quantification of unfractionated heparin and the widely used\nlow-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin. Two traditional metachromatic dyes,\nAzure A and Toluidine Blue, and the more recently developed fluorescent dye\nHeparin Red were applied in a mix-and-read microplate assay to the same\nheparin-spiked human plasma samples. In the clinically most relevant\nconcentration range below 1 IU (international units) per mL, only Heparin Red\nis a useful tool for the determination of both heparins. Heparin Red is at\nleast 9 times more sensitive than the metachromatic dyes which can not reliably\nquantify the heparins in this concentration range. Unfractionated heparin\nlevels between 2 and 10 IU per mL can be determined by all dyes, Heparin Red\nbeing the most sensitive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Dec 2017 11:41:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Warttinger", "Ulrich", ""], ["Giese", "Christina", ""], ["Kr\u00e4mer", "Roland", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03891", "submitter": "Cameron Smith", "authors": "Cameron A.

Here, we\nintroduce PyPhi, a Python software package that implements this framework for\ncausal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete\ndynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study\nthese structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the\nformalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research\non complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an\noverview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi's functionality in the\ncourse of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the\nalgorithm's design and implementation.\n  PyPhi can be installed with Python's package manager via the command 'pip\ninstall pyphi' on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher.\nPyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on\nGitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi .
