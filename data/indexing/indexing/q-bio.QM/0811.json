This implies that myosin heads form a shell around\nthe filament axis, consistent with F-actin binding. A motor density of ~50 -\n100 heads/micron is further estimated but with an average of 32% more motors on\none half of any given filament compared to the other, regardless of length. A\npurely entropic pyramidal lattice model is developed that qualitatively\ncaptures this lack of length dependence and the distribution of filament\nasymmetries.
