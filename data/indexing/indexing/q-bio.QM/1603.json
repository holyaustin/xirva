Existing methods to estimate the reproduction\nnumber generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few\ndisease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in. In reality,\noutbreaks can display sub-exponential (i.e., polynomial) growth in the first\nfew disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial\neffects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behavior changes, or other mechanisms.\nHere, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early\ngrowth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number,\nwith no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth. We\ndemonstrate this phenomenologic approach using analytical results and\nsimulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of\nempirical disease datasets. Our results suggest that sub-exponential growth in\nthe early phase of an epidemic is the rule rather the exception. For empirical\noutbreaks, the generalized-growth model consistently outperforms the\nexponential model for a variety of directly and indirectly transmitted diseases\ndatasets with model estimates supporting sub-exponential growth dynamics. The\nrapid decline in effective reproduction number predicted by analytical results\nand observed in real and synthetic datasets within 3-5 disease generations\ncontrasts with the expectation of invariant reproduction number in epidemics\nobeying exponential growth.

In this\npaper, we introduce and test a new concept, prediction correlation, to estimate\neffective connectivity in functional brain networks from rs-fMRI. In this\napproach, the correlation between two BOLD signals is replaced by a correlation\nbetween one BOLD signal and a prediction of this signal via a causal system\ndriven by another BOLD signal. Three validations are described: (1) Prediction\ncorrelation performed well on simulated data where the ground truth was known,\nand outperformed four other methods. (2) On simulated data designed to display\nthe \"common driver\" problem, prediction correlation did not introduce false\nconnections between non-interacting driven ROIs. (3) On experimental data,\nprediction correlation recovered the previously identified network organization\nof human brain. Prediction correlation scales well to work with hundreds of\nROIs, enabling it to assess whole brain interregional connectivity at the\nsingle subject level. These results provide an initial validation that\nprediction correlation can capture the direction of information flow and\nestimate the duration of extended temporal delays in information flow between\nregions of interest based on BOLD signal. This approach not only maintains the\nhigh sensitivity to network connectivity provided by the correlation analysis,\nbut also performs well in the estimation of causal information flow in the\nbrain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 22:54:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2016 20:24:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:43:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Nan", ""], ["Spreng", "R.

In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of\nST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were\nfound to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with\npathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity\n(NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed\nas a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that\nafter HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently\nrestored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally\nlack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant\nremains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information\nprocessing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the\ncomparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear.

We suggest that stochastic resonance (SR) plays a key\nrole in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory system and is the\nultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neuroscience and\nrefers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be\ntransmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves\nto lift signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently\ndecreasing thresholds again. The increased amount of internal noise is the\ncorrelate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to\nneuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway.

First, we\nreplace $D$ with a nonlocal operator $\\tilde D$ that integrates $Xf$ along a\ncurve in the data space. The result $\\tilde D Xf$ resembles the generalized\nRadon transform $R$ of $f$. The function $\\tilde D Xf$ is defined on pairs\n$(x_0,\\Theta)\\in U\\times S^2$, where $U\\subset\\mathbb R^3$ is an open set\ncontaining the support of $f$, and $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\\mathbb R^3$.\nSecond, we replace $X^*$ with a backprojection operator $R^*$ that integrates\nwith respect to $\\Theta$ over $S^2$. It turns out that if $\\tilde D$ and $R^*$\nare appropriately selected, then the composition $R^* \\tilde D X$ is an\nelliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero with principal symbol 1.\nThus, we obtain an approximate reconstruction formula that recovers all the\nsingularities correctly and does not produce artifacts. The advantage of our\napproach is that by inserting $\\tilde D$ we get access to the frequency\nvariable $\\Theta$. In particular, we can incorporate suitable cut-offs in $R^*$\nto eliminate bad directions $\\Theta$, which lead to added singularities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 01:16:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Katsevich", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08386", "submitter": "Chantriolnt-Andreas Kapourani", "authors": "Chantriolnt-Andreas Kapourani and Guido Sanguinetti", "title": "Higher order methylation features for clustering and prediction in\n  epigenomic studies", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Bioinformatics (2016) 32 (17): i405-i412", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btw432", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its\nfunctional role is incompletely understood.
