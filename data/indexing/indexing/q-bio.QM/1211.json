What is the effect of the\ncontinuous slowdown of Earth's rotation on the operation of the cyanobacterial\noscillator? To answer this question we derived the oscillator's equation of\nmotion directly from experimental data, coupled it with Earth's rotation and\ncomputed its natural periods and its resonance curve.

The success of proteomics studies depends on the ability to\naccurately and efficiently identify proteins. Many methods have been proposed\nto facilitate the identification of proteins from the results of peptide\nidentification. However, the relationship between protein identification and\npeptide identification has not been thoroughly explained before.\n  In this paper, we are devoted to a combinatorial perspective of the protein\ninference problem. We employ combinatorial mathematics to calculate the\nconditional protein probabilities (Protein probability means the probability\nthat a protein is correctly identified) under three assumptions, which lead to\na lower bound, an upper bound and an empirical estimation of protein\nprobabilities, respectively. The combinatorial perspective enables us to obtain\na closed-form formulation for protein inference.\n  Based on our model, we study the impact of unique peptides and degenerate\npeptides on protein probabilities. Here, degenerate peptides are peptides\nshared by at least two proteins. Meanwhile, we also study the relationship of\nour model with other methods such as ProteinProphet. A probability confidence\ninterval can be calculated and used together with probability to filter the\nprotein identification result. Our method achieves competitive results with\nProteinProphet in a more efficient manner in the experiment based on two\ndatasets of standard protein mixtures and two datasets of real samples.\n  We name our program ProteinInfer.

This litter-to-litter variation, or \"litter\neffects\", can influence the results in addition to the experimental factors of\ninterest. Furthermore, an experimental treatment can be applied to whole\nlitters rather than to individual offspring.

With this type of experiment the sample\nsize is the number of litters and not the total number of offspring. If such\nexperiments are not appropriately designed and analysed, the results can be\nseverely biased as well as extremely underpowered.\n  Results: A review of the VPA literature showed that only 9% (3/34) of studies\ncorrectly determined that the experimental unit (n) was the litter and\ntherefore made valid statistical inferences. In addition, litter effects\naccounted for up to 61% (p <0.001) of the variation in behavioural outcomes,\nwhich was larger than the treatment effects. In addition, few studies reported\nusing randomisation (12%) or blinding (18%), and none indicated that a sample\nsize calculation or power analysis had been conducted.\n  Conclusions: Litter effects are common, large, and ignoring them can make\nreplication of findings difficult and can contribute to the low rate of\ntranslating preclinical in vivo studies into successful therapies.
