Gel-based analysis of cDNA fragments\nallows to detect alterations in gene expression for genes which have neither\nbeen sequenced yet nor are available in cDNA libraries. Commonly used protocols\nare cDNA Differential Display (DDRT-PCR) and cDNA-AFLP. Both methods have been\nused merely as qualitative gene discovery tools so far. Results: We developed\nprocedures for the conversion of DDRT-PCR data into quantitative transcription\nprofiles. Amplified cDNA fragments are separated on a DNA sequencer. Data\nprocessing consists of four steps: (i) cDNA bands in lanes corresponding to\nsamples treated with the same primer combination are matched in order to\nidentify fragments originating from the same transcript, (ii) intensity of\nbands is determined by densitometry, (iii) densitometric values are normalized,\nand (iv) intensity ratio is calculated for each pair of corresponding bands.\nTranscription profiles are represented by sets of intensity ratios (control vs.\ntreatment) for cDNA fragments defined by primer combination and DNA mobility.\nWe demonstrated the procedure by analyzing DDRT-PCR data on the effect of\nsecondary metabolites of oilseed rape Brassica napus on the transcriptome of\nthe pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans.

The JCM procedure has been\nproposed as a method for the unsupervised classification of cells within a\nsample into a number of clusters and in the case of multiple samples, the\nmatching of these clusters across the samples. The two tasks of clustering and\nmatching of the clusters are performed simultaneously within the JCM framework.\nIn this paper, we consider the case where there is a number of distinct classes\nof samples whose class of origin is known, and the problem is to classify a new\nsample of unknown class of origin to one of these predefined classes. For\nexample, the different classes might correspond to the types of a particular\ndisease or to the various health outcomes of a patient subsequent to a course\nof treatment. We show and demonstrate on some real datasets how the JCM\nprocedure can be used to carry out this supervised classification task. A\nmixture distribution is used to model the distribution of the expressions of a\nfixed set of markers for each cell in a sample with the components in the\nmixture model corresponding to the various populations of cells in the\ncomposition of the sample. For each class of samples, a class template is\nformed by the adoption of random-effects terms to model the inter-sample\nvariation within a class. The classification of a new unclassified sample is\nundertaken by assigning the unclassified sample to the class that minimizes the\nKullback-Leibler distance between its fitted mixture density and each class\ndensity provided by the class templates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 14:22:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Sharon X.", ""], ["McLachlan", "Geoffrey J.", ""], ["Pyne", "Saumyadipta", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.3507", "submitter": "Antonio Celani", "authors": "Antonio Celani, Emmanuel Villermaux and Massimo Vergassola", "title": "Odor Landscapes in Turbulent Environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

Recent advances in high-throughput serial section\nelectron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale\nbrain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual\nneurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering\nneuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is\nunmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image\nprocessing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the\nsolution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse\nidentification).\n  In this manuscript we present the first fully automated images-to-graphs\npipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue\nand produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall\nperformance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a\nmetric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of\nalgorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the\nbest available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a\nreference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available\ndata set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis\nand future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives\nhave been made publicly available toward eventually unlocking new biofidelic\ncomputational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2014 14:37:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 06:04:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Roncal", "William Gray", ""], ["Kleissas", "Dean M.", ""], ["Vogelstein", "Joshua T.", ""], ["Manavalan", "Priya", ""], ["Lillaney", "Kunal", ""], ["Pekala", "Michael", ""], ["Burns", "Randal", ""], ["Vogelstein", "R.
