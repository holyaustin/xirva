Some patients with MD\nexperience vestibular drop attacks (VDAs), which are violent falls caused by\nspurious vestibular signals from the utricle and/or saccule. Recent surgical\nwork has shown that patients who experience VDAs also show distrupted utricular\notolithic membranes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if\notolithic membrane damage alone is sufficient to induce spurious vestibular\nsignals, thus potentially eliciting VDAs and the vestibular dysfunction seen in\npatients with MD. METHODS: We use a previously developed numerical model to\ndescribe the nonlinear dynamics of an array of active, elastically coupled hair\ncells. We then reduce the coupling strength of a selected region of the\nmembrane to model the effects of tissue damage. RESULTS: As we reduce the\ncoupling strength, we observe large and abrupt spikes in hair bundle position.\nAs bundle displacements from the equilibrium position have been shown to lead\nto depolarization of the hair-cell soma and hence trigger neural activity, this\nspontaneous activity could elicit false detection of a vestibular signal.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this numerical model suggest that otolithic\nmembrane damage alone may be sufficient to induce VDAs and the vestibular\ndysfunction seen in patients with MD.

This in silico study uses\nstructural similarity to clinical trial drugs to identify two drugs with\npotential applications to treat early COVID-19. We apply in silico validation\nto suggest a possible mechanism of action for both. Triamcinolone is a\ncorticosteroid structurally similar to Dexamethasone. Gallopamil is a calcium\nchannel blocker structurally similar to Verapamil. We propose that both these\ndrugs could be useful to treat early COVID-19 infection due to the proximity of\ntheir targets within a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein-protein interaction network\nto kinases active in early infection, and the APOA1 protein which is linked to\nthe spread of COVID-19.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2021 13:08:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["MacMahon", "M\u00e9abh", ""], ["Hwang", "Woochang", ""], ["Yim", "Soorin", ""], ["MacMahon", "Eoghan", ""], ["Abraham", "Alexandre", ""], ["Barton", "Justin", ""], ["Tharmakulasingam", "Mukunthan", ""], ["Bilokon", "Paul", ""], ["Gaddi", "Vasanthi Priyadarshini", ""], ["Han", "Namshik", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.02906", "submitter": "Alessandro Casa", "authors": "Maria Frizzarin, Antonio Bevilacqua, Bhaskar Dhariyal, Katarina\n  Domijan, Federico Ferraccioli, Elena Hayes, Georgiana Ifrim, Agnieszka\n  Konkolewska, Thach Le Nguyen, Uche Mbaka, Giovanna Ranzato, Ashish Singh,\n  Marco Stefanucci, Alessandro Casa", "title": "Mid infrared spectroscopy and milk quality traits: a data analysis\n  competition at the \"International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics\n  2021\"", "comments": "17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  A chemometric data analysis challenge has been arranged during the first\nedition of the \"International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics\",\norganized by the Vistamilk SFI Research Centre and held online in April 2021.\nThe aim of the competition was to build a calibration model in order to predict\nmilk quality traits exploiting the information contained in mid-infrared\nspectra only.

We\ninvestigate whether machine learning models can predict subsequent serum\nlactate changes.\n  Methods. We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III\nand eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU\ncohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the\ninitial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4\nmmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L).

Some of the\nmost effective algorithms for clustering HD data are based on representing the\ndata by nodes in a graph, with edges connecting neighbouring nodes according to\nsome measure of similarity or distance. However, users of graph-based\nalgorithms are typically faced with the critical but challenging task of\nchoosing the value of an input parameter that sets the size of neighbourhoods\nin the graph, e.g. the number of nearest neighbours to which to connect each\nnode or a threshold distance for connecting nodes. The burden on the user could\nbe alleviated by a measure of inter-node similarity that can have value 0 for\ndissimilar nodes without requiring any user-defined parameters or thresholds.\nThis would determine the neighbourhoods automatically while still yielding a\nsparse graph. To this end, I propose a new method called ASTRICS to measure\nsimilarity between clusters of HD data points based on local dimensionality\nreduction and triangulation of critical alpha shapes. I show that my ASTRICS\nsimilarity measure can facilitate both clustering and visualization of HD data\nby using it in Stage 2 of a three-stage pipeline: Stage 1 = perform an initial\nclustering of the data by any method; Stage 2 = let graph nodes represent\ninitial clusters instead of individual data points and use ASTRICS to\nautomatically define edges between nodes; Stage 3 = use the graph for further\nclustering and visualization. This trades the critical task of choosing a graph\nneighbourhood size for the easier task of essentially choosing a resolution at\nwhich to view the data. The graph and consequently downstream clustering and\nvisualization are then automatically adapted to the chosen resolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jul 2021 20:51:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Scurll", "Joshua M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.07881", "submitter": "Philipp Dechent", "authors": "Philipp Dechent, Samuel Greenbank, Felix Hildenbrand, Saad Jbabdi,\n  Dirk Uwe Sauer, David A.

This modeling approach suggests that stochasticity in the\ninternalization of TGF-$\\beta$ receptors into endosomes plays a key role in the\nobserved temporal bursting. Further, the model predicts the single-cell\ndynamics of TGF-$\\beta$/SMAD signaling in untested conditions, e.g.,\nsuccessfully reflects memory effects of signaling noise and cellular\nsensitivity towards repeated stimulation.

It has been\nsuggested that the RG formalism may be useful in finding and interpreting\nemergent low-dimensional structure in complex systems outside of the\ntraditional physics context, such as in biology or computer science. In such\ncontexts, one common dimensionality-reduction framework already in use is\ninformation bottleneck (IB), in which the goal is to compress an ``input''\nsignal $X$ while maximizing its mutual information with some stochastic\n``relevance'' variable $Y$. IB has been applied in the vertebrate and\ninvertebrate processing systems to characterize optimal encoding of the future\nmotion of the external world. Other recent work has shown that the RG scheme\nfor the dimer model could be ``discovered'' by a neural network attempting to\nsolve an IB-like problem. This manuscript explores whether IB and any existing\nformulation of RG are formally equivalent. A class of soft-cutoff\nnon-perturbative RG techniques are defined by families of non-deterministic\ncoarsening maps, and hence can be formally mapped onto IB, and vice versa. For\nconcreteness, this discussion is limited entirely to Gaussian statistics (GIB),\nfor which IB has exact, closed-form solutions. Under this constraint, GIB has a\nsemigroup structure, in which successive transformations remain IB-optimal.\nFurther, the RG cutoff scheme associated with GIB can be identified.

Movement is the primary means by which animals obtain resources and avoid\nhazards. Most movement exhibits directional bias that is related to\nenvironmental features (taxis), such as the location of food patches,\npredators, ocean currents, or wind. Numerous behaviours with directional bias\ncan be characterized by maintaining orientation at an angle relative to the\nenvironmental stimuli (menotaxis), including navigation relative to sunlight or\nmagnetic fields and energy-conserving flight across wind. However, no\nstatistical methods exist to flexibly classify and characterise such\ndirectional bias. 2. We propose a biased correlated random walk model that can\nidentify menotactic behaviours by predicting turning angle as a trade-off\nbetween directional persistence and directional bias relative to environmental\nstimuli without making a priori assumptions about the angle of bias. We apply\nthe model within the framework of a multi-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and\ndescribe methods to remedy information loss associated with coarse\nenvironmental data to improve the classification and parameterization of\ndirectional bias. 3. Using simulation studies, we illustrate how our method\nmore accurately classifies behavioural states compared to conventional\ncorrelated random walk HMMs that do not incorporate directional bias. We\nillustrate the application of these methods by identifying cross wind olfactory\nforaging and drifting behaviour mediated by wind-driven sea ice drift in polar\nbears (Ursus maritimus) from movement data collected by satellite telemetry. 4.\nThe extensions we propose can be readily applied to movement data to identify\nand characterize behaviours with directional bias toward any angle, and open up\nnew avenues to investigate more mechanistic relationships between animal\nmovement and the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:14:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Togunov", "Ron R.", ""], ["Derocher", "Andrew E.", ""], ["Lunn", "Nicholas J.", ""], ["Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9", "Marie", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.14066", "submitter": "Christoph Schmal", "authors": "Christoph Schmal, Gregor M\\\"onke, Adri\\'an E.
