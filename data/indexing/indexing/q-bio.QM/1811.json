Methods: Three-dimensional models of sinonasal cavities were constructed\nfrom computed tomography (CT) scans of three subjects with CRS refractory to\nmedical therapy using imaging software. Assuming steady-state inspiratory\nairflow at resting rate, CFD was used to simulate 1-120 {\\mu}m sprayed droplet\ndeposition in the left and right sinuses and OMC with spray nozzle positioning\nas in current nasal spray use instructions. Zero-velocity nebulization\nsimulations were performed for 1-30 {\\mu}m droplet sizes, maximal sinus and OMC\ndeposition fractions (MSDF) were obtained, and sizes that achieved at least 50%\nof MSDF were identified. Nebulized MSDF was compared to sprayed droplet\ndeposition. We also validated CFD framework through in vitro experiments.\nResults: Among nebulized droplet sizes, 11-14 {\\mu}m droplets achieved at least\n50% of MSDF in all six sinonasal cavities. Five of six sinonasal cavities had\ngreater sinus and OMC deposition with nebulized droplets than with sprayed\ndroplets at optimal sizes. Conclusions: Nebulized droplets may target the\nsinuses and OMC more effectively than sprayed particles at sizes achieving best\ndeposition.

Notably, the method uses the\nlatest and fastest freely-available software, and the entire protocol can be\ncompleted in a few hours with data from organisms with relatively small\ngenomes, such as yeast or bacteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2018 21:29:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Meyer", "Jesse G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.11885", "submitter": "Huseyin Coskun", "authors": "Huseyin Coskun", "title": "Nonlinear Decomposition Principle and Fundamental Matrix Solutions for\n  Dynamic Compartmental Systems", "comments": "52 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "Discrete & Continuous Dynamical Systems - B (2019)", "doi": "10.3934/dcdsb.2019155", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY math.DS math.OC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A decomposition principle for nonlinear dynamic compartmental systems is\nintroduced in the present paper. This theory is based on the mutually exclusive\nand exhaustive, analytical and dynamic, novel system and subsystem partitioning\nmethodologies. A deterministic mathematical method is developed for the dynamic\nanalysis of nonlinear compartmental systems based on the proposed theory. The\ndynamic method enables tracking the evolution of all initial stocks, external\ninputs, and arbitrary intercompartmental flows, as well as the associated\nstorages derived from these stocks, inputs, and flows individually and\nseparately within the system. The transient and the dynamic direct, indirect,\nacyclic, cycling, and transfer (diact) flows and associated storages\ntransmitted along a particular flow path or from one compartment--directly or\nindirectly--to any other are then analytically characterized, systematically\nclassified, and mathematically formulated. Thus, the dynamic influence of one\ncompartment, in terms of flow and storage transfer, directly or indirectly on\nany other compartment is ascertained. Consequently, new mathematical system\nanalysis tools are formulated as quantitative system indicators. The proposed\nmathematical method is then applied to various models from literature to\ndemonstrate its efficiency and wide applicability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 00:06:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2019 03:57:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2019 00:47:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2019 05:58:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 7 Sep 2019 08:03:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Coskun", "Huseyin", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12490", "submitter": "Derek Curtis", "authors": "Derek John Curtis, Pauline Holbrook, Sarah Bew, Lynne Ford, Penny\n  Butler", "title": "Functional change in children with cerebral palsy", "comments": "14 pages, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Introduction There is increasing focus on the association between trunk\ncontrol and functional abilities in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The\npurpose of this study was to determine the extent of functional change in\nchildren with CP who participated in specific trunk and head postural control\ntraining combined with physical therapy treatment as usual (TAU).\n  Methods This study included 140 consecutive referrals to a centre\nspecialising in head and trunk postural control (Targeted Training (TT))\nbetween 2009 and 2016. Twenty-five children discontinued therapy due to\nsurgery, health, family issues or poor attendance. The remaining 115 children\n(46 girls, 69 boys) had a mean age of 6 y 6 mo (SD 2 y 8 mo) with participants\nfrom all GMFCS levels. The intervention was a program of TT and ongoing TAU\nwith a mean duration of 11 months. Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM),\nPediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory functional skills, Chailey Levels\nof Ability and Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control were administered before\nand after the intervention.\n  Results There were significant improvements in all outcomes. GMFM\nimprovements exceeded those predicted from the published reference curves,\nespecially for the children with more severe cerebral palsy.\n  Conclusions Functional improvement exceeded the expected norm, especially in\nthose children with more severe gross motor function disability. The other\noutcomes also showed significant improvements. These findings support the case\nfor further studies and, if needed, tool development to facilitate\ndetermination of the critical elements in a combined therapy approach of TT\nwith TAU.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Nov 2018 13:56:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Curtis", "Derek John", ""], ["Holbrook", "Pauline", ""], ["Bew", "Sarah", ""], ["Ford", "Lynne", ""], ["Butler", "Penny", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12499", "submitter": "Kevin Keys", "authors": "Alfonso Landeros, Timothy Stutz, Kevin L.

Moreover, rare events, such as mutation and\nextinction, complicate system dynamics. Stochastic simulation algorithms are\nuseful in generating time-evolution trajectories for these systems because they\ncan adequately capture the influence of random fluctuations and quantify rare\nevents. We present a simple and flexible package, BioSimulator.jl, for\nimplementing the Gillespie algorithm, $\\tau$-leaping, and related stochastic\nsimulation algorithms. The objective of this work is to provide scientists\nacross domains with fast, user-friendly simulation tools. We used the\nhigh-performance programming language Julia because of its emphasis on\nscientific computing. Our software package implements a suite of stochastic\nsimulation algorithms based on Markov chain theory. We provide the ability to\n(a) diagram Petri Nets describing interactions, (b) plot average trajectories\nand attached standard deviations of each participating species over time, and\n(c) generate frequency distributions of each species at a specified time.\nBioSimulator.jl's interface allows users to build models programmatically\nwithin Julia. A model is then passed to the simulate routine to generate\nsimulation data. The built-in tools allow one to visualize results and compute\nsummary statistics. Our examples highlight the broad applicability of our\nsoftware to systems of varying complexity from ecology, systems biology,\nchemistry, and genetics. The user-friendly nature of BioSimulator.jl encourages\nthe use of stochastic simulation, minimizes tedious programming efforts, and\nreduces errors during model specification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 21:38:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Landeros", "Alfonso", ""], ["Stutz", "Timothy", ""], ["Keys", "Kevin L.", ""], ["Alekseyenko", "Alexander", ""], ["Sinsheimer", "Janet S.", ""], ["Lange", "Kenneth", ""], ["Sehl", "Mary", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12750", "submitter": "Michael Kalyuzhny", "authors": "Michael Kalyuzhny, Tom Haran and Dror Hawlena", "title": "The observation resolution -- a neglected aspect with critical influence\n  on movement-based foraging indices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Movement-based indices such as moves per minute (MPM) and proportion time\nmoving (PTM) are common methodologies to quantify foraging behaviour. Hundreds\nof studies have reported these indices without specifying the temporal\nresolution of their original data, despite the likelihood that the minimal stop\nand move durations can affect MPM and PTM estimates. Our goal was to\nempirically determine the sensitivity of these foraging indices to changes in\nthe temporal resolution of the observation. We used a high speed camera to\nrecord movement sequences of 20 Acanthodactylus boskianus lizards. We gradually\ndecreased the data resolution by ignoring short stops and either ignoring,\nelongating or leaving short moves unchanged. We then used the manipulated data\nto calculate the foraging indices at different temporal resolutions. We found\nthat movement-based indices are very sensitive to the observation resolution,\nso that realistic variation in the minimal duration of stops and moves could\nlead to 68 percent and 48 percent difference in MPM and PTM estimates,\nrespectively. When using the highest resolution, our estimate of MPM was an\norder of magnitude higher than all prior reported values for lizards. Also, the\ndistribution of stop durations was well described by a single heavy tailed\ndistribution above 0.35 seconds. This suggests that for A. boskianus there is\nno reason to ignore short stops above this threshold. Our results raise major\nconcerns regarding the use of already published movement based indices, and\nenable us to recommend how new foraging data should be collected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 12:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kalyuzhny", "Michael", ""], ["Haran", "Tom", ""], ["Hawlena", "Dror", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12938", "submitter": "Marek Rei", "authors": "Marek Rei, Joshua Oppenheimer, Marek Sirendi", "title": "Advance Prediction of Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias using Patient\n  Metadata and Multi-Task Networks", "comments": "Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "ML4H/2018/158", "categories": "cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe a novel neural network architecture for the prediction of\nventricular tachyarrhythmias.
