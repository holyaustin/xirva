In order to obtain\nsignificant improvement in classification accuracy under supervised learning\nsettings, it is a common practice to train a neural network architecture with a\nmassive data and thereafter, test the resulting network on a comparatively\nsmaller amount of data. However, given a highly imbalanced dataset, it is often\nchallenging to achieve a high class 1 (true CHD prediction rate) accuracy as\nthe testing data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we employ\nleast absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature weight\nassessment followed by majority-voting based identification of important\nfeatures. Next, the important features are homogenized by using a fully\nconnected layer, a crucial step before passing the output of the layer to\nsuccessive convolutional stages. We also propose a training routine per epoch,\nakin to a simulated annealing process, to boost the classification accuracy.\nDespite a 35:1 (Non-CHD:CHD) ratio in the NHANES dataset, the investigation\nconfirms that our proposed CNN architecture has the classification power of 77%\nto correctly classify the presence of CHD and 81.8% the absence of CHD cases on\na testing data, which is 85.70% of the total dataset.

The task of PubMedQA is to answer research\nquestions with yes/no/maybe (e.g.: Do preoperative statins reduce atrial\nfibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?) using the corresponding\nabstracts. PubMedQA has 1k expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k\nartificially generated QA instances. Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1)\na question which is either an existing research article title or derived from\none, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion,\n(3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the abstract and, presumably,\nanswers the research question, and (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes\nthe conclusion. PubMedQA is the first QA dataset where reasoning over\nbiomedical research texts, especially their quantitative contents, is required\nto answer the questions. Our best performing model, multi-phase fine-tuning of\nBioBERT with long answer bag-of-word statistics as additional supervision,\nachieves 68.1% accuracy, compared to single human performance of 78.0% accuracy\nand majority-baseline of 55.2% accuracy, leaving much room for improvement.\nPubMedQA is publicly available at https://pubmedqa.github.io.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Sep 2019 11:18:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Qiao", ""], ["Dhingra", "Bhuwan", ""], ["Liu", "Zhengping", ""], ["Cohen", "William W.", ""], ["Lu", "Xinghua", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.06326", "submitter": "Justin Krogue", "authors": "Justin D Krogue, Kaiyang V Cheng, Kevin M Hwang, Paul Toogood, Eric G\n  Meinberg, Erik J Geiger, Musa Zaid, Kevin C McGill, Rina Patel, Jae Ho Sohn,\n  Alexandra Wright, Bryan F Darger, Kevin A Padrez, Eugene Ozhinsky, Sharmila\n  Majumdar, Valentina Pedoia", "title": "Automatic Hip Fracture Identification and Functional Subclassification\n  with Deep Learning", "comments": "Presented at Orthopaedic Research Society, Austin, TX, Feb 2, 2019,\n  currently in submission for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV physics.med-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Purpose: Hip fractures are a common cause of morbidity and mortality.\nAutomatic identification and classification of hip fractures using deep\nlearning may improve outcomes by reducing diagnostic errors and decreasing time\nto operation.

To investigate the nature of multiscale coordination in\nliving systems, one needs a meaningful and systematic way to quantify the\ncomplex dynamics, a challenge in both theoretical and empirical realms. The\npresent work shows how integrating approaches from computational algebraic\ntopology and dynamical systems may help us meet this challenge. In particular,\nwe focus on the application of multiscale topological analysis to coordinated\nrhythmic processes. First, theoretical arguments are introduced as to why\ncertain topological features and their scale-dependency are highly relevant to\nunderstanding complex collective dynamics. Second, we propose a method to\ncapture such dynamically relevant topological information using persistent\nhomology, which allows us to effectively construct a multiscale topological\nportrait of rhythmic coordination. Finally, the method is put to test in\ndetecting transitions in real data from an experiment of rhythmic coordination\nin ensembles of interacting humans. The recurrence plots of topological\nportraits highlight collective transitions in coordination patterns that were\nelusive to more traditional methods. This sensitivity to collective transitions\nwould be lost if the behavioral dynamics of individuals were treated as\nseparate degrees of freedom instead of constituents of the topology that they\ncollectively forge. Such multiscale topological portraits highlight collective\naspects of coordination patterns that are irreducible to properties of\nindividual parts.

Though most road traffic is local, a small number of\nlong-distance trips can suffice to move an invasion or disease front forward.\nTherefore, understanding how many agents travel over long distances and which\nroutes they choose is key to successful management of diseases and invasions.\nStochastic gravity models have been used to estimate the distribution of trips\nbetween origins and destinations of agents. However, in large-scale systems it\nis hard to collect the data required to fit these models, as the number of\nlong-distance travellers is small, and origins and destinations can have\nmultiple access points.

By exploring a database of user-tracked\nobservations from the Clue app by BioWink of over 378,000 users and 4.9 million\nnatural cycles, we show that self-reported menstrual tracker data can reveal\nstatistically significant relationships between per-person cycle length\nvariability and self-reported qualitative symptoms. A concern for self-tracked\ndata is that they reflect not only physiological behaviors, but also the\nengagement dynamics of app users. To mitigate such potential artifacts, we\ndevelop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing\nus to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We\nuncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability\nspectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit\nstatistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and\nsymptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics\nare stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The\nsymptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with\ntiming data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle\nvariability from symptoms or as potential health indicators for conditions like\nendometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal,\nhigh-resolution self-tracked data to improve understanding of menstruation and\nwomen's health as a whole.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Apr 2020 23:41:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2020 22:57:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Kathy", ""], ["Urteaga", "I\u00f1igo", ""], ["Wiggins", "Chris H.", ""], ["Druet", "Anna", ""], ["Shea", "Amanda", ""], ["Vitzthum", "Virginia J.", ""], ["Elhadad", "No\u00e9mie", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.11212", "submitter": "Rajath Soans", "authors": "Julianna D.

Missing values are\ntaken into account by this method directly, without the need to impute them. We\nillustrate the performance of the new method on two distinct datasets and show\nthat it is robust to missing values and, at the same time, provides results\nthat are otherwise similar to those obtained with edgeR which is a state-of-art\ndifferential expression analysis method. The new method for the differential\nexpression analysis of proteomic data is available as an easy to use Python\npackage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 13:05:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Medo", "Matus", ""], ["Aebersold", "Daniel M.", ""], ["Medova", "Michaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13868", "submitter": "Alexander  Mathis", "authors": "Mackenzie W.
