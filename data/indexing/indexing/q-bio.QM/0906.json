A two-time-scale function captures the\nnon-exponential character of backbone structural relaxations. One is attributed\nto the collective segmental motions and the other to local relaxations. The\nformer is well-defined by a single-exponential, nanosecond decay, operative at\nall temperatures. The latter is described by a set of processes that display a\ndistribution of time-scales. Though their average remains on the picosecond\ntime-scale, the distribution is markedly contracted at the onset of the\ntransition. The collective motions are shown to impose bounds on time-scales\nspanned by local dynamical processes. The piecewise stationary character below\nthe transition implicates the presence of a collection of sub-states whose\ninteractions are restricted. At these temperatures, a wide distribution of\nlocal motion time-scales, extending beyond that of nanoseconds is observed. At\nphysiological temperatures, local motions are confined to time-scales faster\nthan nanoseconds.
