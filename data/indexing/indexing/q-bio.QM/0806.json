The cortical networks were estimated\nfrom high-resolution EEG recordings in a group of spinal cord injured patients\nand in a group of healthy subjects, during the preparation of a limb movement.\nWe first evaluate global and local efficiency, as indicators of the structural\nconnectivity respectively at a global and local scale. Then, we use the Markov\nClustering method to analyse the division of the network into community\nstructures. The results indicate large differences between the injured patients\nand the healthy subjects. In particular, the networks of spinal cord injured\npatient exhibited a higher density of efficient clusters. In the Alpha (7-12\nHz) frequency band, the two observed largest communities were mainly composed\nby the cingulate motor areas with the supplementary motor areas, and by the\npre-motor areas with the right primary motor area of the foot. This functional\nseparation strengthens the hypothesis of a compensative mechanism due to the\npartial alteration in the primary motor areas because of the effects of the\nspinal cord injury.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2008 17:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sinatra", "Roberta", ""], ["Fallani", "Fabrizio De Vico", ""], ["Astolfi", "Laura", ""], ["Babiloni", "Fabio", ""], ["Cincotti", "Febo", ""], ["Latora", "Vito", ""], ["Mattia", "Donatella", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2888", "submitter": "Joel Miller", "authors": "Joel C.

We adopt a stochastic individual-based description where\nindividuals are represented by nodes of a graph and contact is defined by the\nlinks of the graph. Mapping the underlying Master equation into a quantum\nformulation in terms of spin operators, the hierarchy of evolution equations\ncan be solved exactly for arbitrary initial conditions on a linear chain. In\ncase of uncorrelated random initial conditions the exact time evolution for all\nthree individuals of the SIR model is given analytically. Depending on the\ninitial conditions and reaction rates $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, the $I$-population\nmay increase initially before decaying to zero. Due to fluctuations, isolated\nregions of susceptible individuals evolve and unlike in the standard mean-field\nSIR model one observes a finite stationary distribution of the $S$-type even\nfor large population size. The exact results for the ensemble averaged\npopulation size are compared with simulations for single realizations of the\nprocess and also with standard mean field theory which is expected to be valid\non large fully-connected graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2008 07:36:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00fctz", "Gunter M.", ""], ["Brandau", "Marian", ""], ["Trimper", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4565", "submitter": "Nico  Stollenwerk", "authors": "Nico Stollenwerk, Maira Aguiar", "title": "The SIRI stochastic model with creation and annihilation operators", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We generalize the well known formulation of the susceptibles, infected,\nsusceptibles (SIS) spatial epidemics with creation and annihilation operators\nto the reinfection model including recovered which can be reinfected, the SIRI\nmodel, using ladder operators constructed from the Gell-Mann matrices known in\nquantum chromodynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2008 20:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Stollenwerk", "Nico", ""], ["Aguiar", "Maira", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4576", "submitter": "Nico  Stollenwerk", "authors": "Maira Aguiar, Nico Stollenwerk, Bob W.

Such models show a rich variety of dynamics through bifurcations up to\ndeterministic chaos. Including temporary cross-immunity even enlarges the\nparameter range of such chaotic attractors, and also gives rise to various\ncoexisting attractors, which are difficult to identify by standard numerical\nbifurcation programs using continuation methods. A combination of techniques,\nincluding classical bifurcation plots and Lyapunov exponent spectra has to be\napplied in comparison to get further insight into such dynamical structures.\nHere we present for the first time multi-parameter studies in a range of\nbiologically plausible values for dengue.
