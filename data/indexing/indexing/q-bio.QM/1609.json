This paper\npresents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both\nevolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an\nultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual networks. This deep\nneural network allows us to model very complex sequence-contact relationship as\nwell as long-range inter-contact correlation.

Using our predicted contacts as restraints, we can (ab\ninitio) fold 208 of the 398 membrane proteins with TMscore>0.5. By contrast,\nwhen the training proteins of our method are used as templates, homology\nmodeling can only do so for 10 of them. One interesting finding is that even if\nwe do not train our prediction models with any membrane proteins, our method\nworks very well on membrane protein prediction.

We suggest that the best way to assess\ntemporal persistence is to perform a test-retest study, and assess test-retest\nreliability. For ratio-scale features that are normally distributed, this is\nbest done using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). For 10 distinct\ndata sets (8 eye-movement related, and 2 gait related), we calculated the\ntest-retest reliability ('Temporal persistence') of each feature, and compared\nbiometric performance of high-ICC features to lower ICC features, and to the\nset of all features. We demonstrate that using a subset of only high-ICC\nfeatures produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance\nin 9 of 10 databases (p = 0.01, one-tailed). For Equal Error Rate (EER), using\na subset of only high-ICC features produced superior performance in 8 of 10\ndatabases (p = 0.055, one-tailed). In general, then, prescreening potential\nbiometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features will yield\nbetter performance than lower ICC features or than the set of all features\ncombined. We hypothesize that this would likely be the case for any biometric\nmodality where the features can be expressed as quantitative values on an\ninterval or ratio scale, assuming an adequate number of relatively independent\nfeatures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 17:38:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Friedman", "Lee", ""], ["Rigas", "Ioannis", ""], ["Nixon", "Mark S.", ""], ["Komogortsev", "Oleg V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.04316", "submitter": "Carlo Nicolini", "authors": "Carlo Nicolini, C\\'ecile Bordier, Angelo Bifone", "title": "Community detection in weighted brain connectivity networks beyond the\n  resolution limit", "comments": "27 pages with 6 figures and 1 table.

Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function\nrooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied\nto brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in\ncontrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to\nbinary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a\ncontinuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain\nregions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of\nSurprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate\nthis approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular\nstructure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection\nmethods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of\nsmall modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such\nas those observed in fMRI data.
