Yet published scientific\nliterature reflects a very limited understanding of the effects of these drugs,\nespecially for newer synthetic compounds. The number of clinical trials and\nrange of drugs formally studied is dwarfed by the number of written\ndescriptions of the many drugs taken by people. Analysis of these descriptions\nusing machine-learning techniques can provide a framework for learning about\nthese drug use experiences. Methods: We collected 1000 reports of 10 drugs from\nthe drug information website Erowid.org and formed a term-document frequency\nmatrix. Using variable selection and a random-forest classifier, we identified\na subset of words that differentiated between drugs. Results: A random forest\nusing a subset of 110 predictor variables classified with accuracy comparable\nto a random forest using the full set of 3934 predictors. Our estimated\naccuracy was 51.1%, which compares favorably to the 10% expected from chance.\nReports of MDMA had the highest accuracy at 86.9%; those describing DPT had the\nlowest at 20.1%. Hierarchical clustering suggested similarities between certain\ndrugs, such as DMT and Salvia divinorum.

This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory\ncircuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA\nlocated inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic\nmicroRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our\nbioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its\nsimple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions.

Dynamic changes of the\nC-DB density were observed in real time, where the rate of density change was\naccelerated during initial irradiation and then became constant over time. It\nis noteworthy that C-DBs were formed synergistically by irradiation with both\nvacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and atomic hydrogen. The in situ real-time ESR\ntechnique is useful to elucidate synergistic roles during plasma surface\nmodification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 00:26:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ishikawa", "Kenji", ""], ["Sumi", "Naoya", ""], ["Kono", "Akihiko", ""], ["Horibe", "Hideo", ""], ["Takeda", "Keigo", ""], ["Kondo", "Hiroki", ""], ["Sekine", "Makoto", ""], ["Hori", "Masaru", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6980", "submitter": "Laurent Jacob", "authors": "Laurent Jacob, Pierre Neuvial, Sandrine Dudoit", "title": "More power via graph-structured tests for differential expression of\n  gene networks", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AOAS528 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org). arXiv admin note:\n  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1009.5173", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2012, Vol. 6, No. 2, 561-600", "doi": "10.1214/11-AOAS528", "report-no": "IMS-AOAS-AOAS528", "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider multivariate two-sample tests of means, where the location shift\nbetween the two populations is expected to be related to a known graph\nstructure. An important application of such tests is the detection of\ndifferentially expressed genes between two patient populations, as shifts in\nexpression levels are expected to be coherent with the structure of graphs\nreflecting gene properties such as biological process, molecular function,\nregulation or metabolism. For a fixed graph of interest, we demonstrate that\naccounting for graph structure can yield more powerful tests under the\nassumption of smooth distribution shift on the graph. We also investigate the\nidentification of nonhomogeneous subgraphs of a given large graph, which poses\nboth computational and multiple hypothesis testing problems. The relevance and\nbenefits of the proposed approach are illustrated on synthetic data and on\nbreast and bladder cancer gene expression data analyzed in the context of KEGG\nand NCI pathways.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 10:37:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jacob", "Laurent", ""], ["Neuvial", "Pierre", ""], ["Dudoit", "Sandrine", ""]]}]
