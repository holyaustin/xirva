To close this gap, we studied the\nperformance of parallel trajectory analysis with MPI and the Python MDAnalysis\nlibrary on three different XSEDE supercomputers where trajectories were read\nfrom a Lustre parallel file system. Strong scaling performance was impeded by\nstragglers, MPI processes that were slower than the typical process. Stragglers\nwere less prevalent for compute-bound workloads, thus pointing to file reading\nas a bottleneck for scaling. However, a more complicated picture emerged in\nwhich both the computation and the data ingestion exhibited close to ideal\nstrong scaling behavior whereas stragglers were primarily caused by either\nlarge MPI communication costs or long times to open the single shared\ntrajectory file. We improved overall strong scaling performance by either\nsubfiling (splitting the trajectory into separate files) or MPI-IO with\nParallel HDF5 trajectory files. The parallel HDF5 approach resulted in near\nideal strong scaling on up to 384 cores (16 nodes), thus reducing trajectory\nanalysis times by two orders of magnitude compared to the serial approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 22:22:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 31 Aug 2019 00:05:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 2 Feb 2020 20:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2020 23:32:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Khoshlessan", "Mahzad", ""], ["Paraskevakos", "Ioannis", ""], ["Fox", "Geoffrey C.", ""], ["Jha", "Shantenu", ""], ["Beckstein", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.00118", "submitter": "Colin Targonski", "authors": "Colin Targonski, Benjamin T.

To address this\nquestion, time must be considered as a formal variable of the problem and not\njust a simple repeated observation.

We explain this behavior in terms of how the\nconcentration profile of the polymer length distribution adjusts to changes in\nprotomer concentration and affinity.

Our\napproach generalizes to other drug design applications. We measure minimum\ninhibitory concentrations of compounds in two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nwith variable permeability barriers and use them as an input to the Hunting FOX\nalgorithm to identify molecular fragments responsible for enhanced outer\nmembrane permeation properties and candidate molecules from an external library\nthat demonstrate good permeation ability. Overall, we present proof of concept\nfor a novel method that is expected to be valuable for rational design of\nhybrid drugs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:33:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mansbach", "Rachael A.", ""], ["Leus", "Inga V.", ""], ["Mehla", "Jitender", ""], ["Lopez", "Cesar A.", ""], ["Walker", "John K.", ""], ["Rybenkov", "Valentin V.", ""], ["Hengartner", "Nicolas W.", ""], ["Zgurskaya", "Helen I.", ""], ["Gnanakaran", "S.", ""]]}]
