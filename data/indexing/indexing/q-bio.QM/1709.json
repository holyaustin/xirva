These results show that having access to\none extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states,\nis sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a\nthermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed\nform of the master equation.

Previous studies have highlighted a number of problems with\nthe moment-closure approach used to obtain such approximations, calling it an\nad-hoc method. In this article, we give a new variational derivation of\nmoment-closure equations which provides us with an intuitive understanding of\ntheir properties and failure modes and allows us to correct some of these\nproblems. We use mixtures of product-Poisson distributions to obtain a flexible\nparametric family which solves the commonly observed problem of divergences at\nlow system sizes. We also extend the recently introduced entropic matching\napproach to arbitrary ansatz distributions and Markov processes, demonstrating\nthat it is a special case of variational moment closure. This provides us with\na particularly principled approximation method. Finally, we extend the above\napproaches to cover the approximation of multi-time joint distributions,\nresulting in a viable alternative to process-level approximations which are\noften intractable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 15:17:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Nov 2017 15:12:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bronstein", "Leo", ""], ["Koeppl", "Heinz", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03028", "submitter": "Mohammadhassan Izadyyazdanabadi", "authors": "Mohammadhassan Izadyyazdanabadi, Evgenii Belykh, Michael Mooney,\n  Nikolay Martirosyan, Jennifer Eschbacher, Peter Nakaji, Mark C.

MH provides unique\nantibacterial activity when compared with conventional honeys, owing partly to\none of its constituents, methylglyoxal (MGO). Aiming to investigate an\nantibiotic-free antimicrobial strategy, we studied the antibacterial activity\nof both MH and MGO (at equivalent MGO concentrations) when applied as a\nphysical coating to a nonwoven fabric wound dressing. When physically coated on\nto a cellulosic hydroentangled nonwoven fabric, it was found that\nconcentrations of 0.0054 mg cm-2 of MGO in the form of MH and MGO was\nsufficient to achieve 100 CFU% bacteria reduction against gram-positive\nStaphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, based on BS EN\nISO 20743:2007. A 3- to 20- fold increase in MGO concentration (0.0170 - 0.1 mg\ncm-2) was required to facilitate a good antibacterial effect (based on BS EN\nISO 20645:2004) in terms of zone of inhibition and lack of growth under the\nsample. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal\nconcentration (MBC) was also assessed for MGO in liquid form against three\nprevalent wound and healthcare-associated pathogens, i.e. Staphylococcus\naureus, gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive Enterococcus\nfaecalis. Other than the case of MGO-containing fabrics, solutions with much\nhigher MGO concentrations (128 mg L-1 - 1024 mg L-1) were required to provide\neither a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect. The results presented in this\nstudy therefore demonstrate the relevance of MGO-based coating as an\nenvironment-friendly strategy for the design of functional dressings with\nantibiotic-free antimicrobial chemistries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Aug 2017 11:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bulman", "Sophie E.

Large-scale, multi-institution\nclinical studies are the typical examples of such datasets. These sets make\npossible the search for multi-parametric relations since from the plenty of the\ndata one is likely to find a satisfying number of subjects with the required\nparameter ensembles. Specifically, finding combinatorial biomarkers for some\ngiven condition also needs a very large dataset to analyze. For this goal,\nstatistical regression analysis is not the preferred tool of choice, since (i)\nthe {\\em a priori} knowledge of the parameter-sets to analyze is missing, and\n(ii) typically relatively few subjects have the interesting parameter-value\nensembles for the analysis. For fast and automatic multi-parametric relation\ndiscovery association-rule finding tools are used for more than two decades in\nthe data-mining community. Here we present the SCARF webserver for {\\em\ngeneralized} association rule mining. Association rules are of the form: $a$\nAND $b$ AND ... AND $x \\rightarrow y$, meaning that the presence of properties\n$a$ AND $b$ AND ... AND $x$ implies property $y$; our algorithm finds\ngeneralized association rules, since it also finds logical disjunctions (i.e.,\nORs) at the left-hand side, allowing the discovery of more complex rules in a\nmore compressed form in the database. This feature also helps reducing the\ntypically very large result-tables of such studies, since allowing ORs in the\nleft-hand side of a single rule could include dozens of classical rules. The\ncapabilities of the SCARF algorithm were demonstrated in mining the Alzheimer's\ndatabase of the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) in our recent\npublication (Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Vol. 73, pp. 300-307,\n2017).

While voxel-based\nanalysis (VBA) of preclinical magnetic resonance images is widely-used, a\nthorough examination of the statistical robustness, stability, and error rates\nis hindered by high computational demands of processing large arrays, and the\nmany parameters involved. Thus, workflows are often based on intuition or\nexperience, while preclinical validation studies remain scarce. To increase\nthroughput and reproducibility of quantitative small animal brain studies, we\nhave developed a publicly shared, high throughput VBA pipeline in a\nhigh-performance computing environment, called SAMBA. The increased\ncomputational efficiency allowed large multidimensional arrays to be processed\nin 1-3 days, a task that previously took ~1 month. To quantify the variability\nand reliability of preclinical VBA in rodent models, we propose a validation\nframework consisting of morphological phantoms, and four metrics. This\naddresses several sources that impact VBA results, including registration and\ntemplate construction strategies. We have used this framework to inform the VBA\nworkflow parameters in a VBA study for a mouse model of epilepsy. We also\npresent initial efforts towards standardizing small animal neuroimaging data in\na similar fashion with human neuroimaging. We conclude that verifying the\naccuracy of VBA merits attention, and should be the focus of a broader effort\nwithin the community. The proposed framework promotes consistent quality\nassurance of VBA in preclinical neuroimaging; facilitating the creation and\ncommunication of robust results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 16:28:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2018 13:50:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Anderson", "Robert J", ""], ["Cook", "James J", ""], ["Delpratt", "Natalie A", ""], ["Nouls", "John C", ""], ["Gu", "Bin", ""], ["McNamara", "James O", ""], ["Avants", "Brian B", ""], ["Johnson", "G Allan", ""], ["Badea", "Alexandra", ""]]}]
