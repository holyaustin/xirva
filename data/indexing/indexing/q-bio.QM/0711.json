Imafuku et al., Biophys. J. 70 (1996) 878-886; N. Noda et\nal., Biophys. 1 (2005) 45-53]. This anomalous fluctuation can be an evidence\nfor cooperativity among the motors in action because fluctuation should be\naveraged out for a long filament if the action of each motor is independent. In\norder to understand the nature of the fluctuation in molecular motors, we\nperform numerical simulations and analyse velocity correlation in three\nexisting models that are known to show some kind of cooperativity and/or large\ndiffusion coefficient, i.e. Sekimoto-Tawada model [K. Sekimoto and K. Tawada,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 75 (1995) 180], Prost model [J. Prost et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n72 (1994) 2652], and Duke model [T. Duke, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96 (1999)\n2770]. It is shown that Prost model and Duke model do not give a finite\ndiffusion in the long filament limit in spite of collective action of motors.\nOn the other hand, Sekimoto-Tawada model has been shown to give the diffusion\ncoefficient that is independent of filament length, but it comes from the long\ntime correlation whose time scale is proportional to filament length, and our\nsimulations show that such a long correlation time conflicts with the\nexperimental time scales. We conclude that none of the three models do not\nrepresent experimental findings. In order to explain the observed anomalous\ndiffusion, we have to seek for the mechanism that should allow both the\namplitude and the time scale of the velocity correlation to be independent of\nthe filament length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 13:53:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Imafuku", "Yasuhiro", ""], ["Mitarai", "Namiko", ""], ["Tawada", "Katsuhisa", ""], ["Nakanishi", "Hiizu", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4512", "submitter": "Marco Morelli", "authors": "M.J.

Various coarse-graining methods have\nbeen proposed, but it remains unclear which methods are reliable and which\nreactions can safely be eliminated. We address these issues for a model gene\nregulatory network that is particularly sensitive to dynamical fluctuations: a\nbistable genetic switch. We remove protein-DNA and/or protein-protein\nassociation-dissociation reactions from the reaction set, using various\ncoarse-graining strategies. We determine the effects on the steady-state\nprobability distribution function and on the rate of fluctuation-driven switch\nflipping transitions. We find that protein-protein interactions may be safely\neliminated from the reaction set, but protein-DNA interactions may not.

Regulatory motifs are groups of\nnodes with the same connectivity structure, capable of processing information.\nThe bifan motif, made of two source nodes directly cross-regulating two target\nnodes, is an over-represented motif in a mammalian cell signaling network and\nin transcriptional networks. One example of a bifan is the two MAP-kinases, p38\nand JNK that phosphorylate and activate the two transcription factors ATF2 and\nElk-1. We have used a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to\nanalyze the regulatory capability of this bifan motif by itself, and when it\ninteracts with other motifs such as positive and negative feedback loops. Our\nresults indicate that bifans provide temporal regulation of signal propagation\nand act as signal sorters, filters, and synchronizers. Bifans that have OR gate\nconfigurations show rapid responses while AND gate bifans can introduce delays\nand allow prolongation of signal outputs. Bifans that are AND gates can filter\nnoisy signal inputs. The p38/JNK-ATF2/Elk-1bifan synchronizes the output of\nactivated transcription factors. Synchronization is a robust property of bifans\nand is exhibited even when the bifan is adjacent to a positive feedback loop.\nThe presence of the bifan promotes the transcription and translation of the\ndual specificity protein phosphatase MKP-1 that inhibits p38 and JNK thus\nenabling a negative feedback loop. These results indicate that bifan motifs in\ncell signaling networks can contribute to signal processing capability both\nintrinsically and by enabling the functions of other regulatory motifs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2007 14:15:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lipshtat", "Azi", ""], ["Purushothaman", "Sudarshan P.", ""], ["Iyengar", "Ravi", ""], ["Ma'ayan", "Avi", ""]]}]
