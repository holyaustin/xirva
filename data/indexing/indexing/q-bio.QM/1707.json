Motifs are compositional: a\nlarge-scale motif is a chain of smaller-scale ones, folded in (some behavioral)\nspace in a specific manner.

We found that\ntransitions between motifs were modulated by rats' location in the environment,\nleading to non-Markovian transitions. To test the ethological relevance of\nmotifs we discovered, we compared their usage between rats with differences in\na high-level trait, prosociality.

In this way, any complicated biomolecular\nstructure can be reduced to several simple 1D PBFs for comparison. Persistent\nsimilarity is then defined as the quotient of sizes of intersect areas and\nunion areas between two correspondingly PBFs.

To\nevaluate our method, we propose a case study to detect and summarize SLRs\ndeveloped for bioinformatics data. We used two databases: PubMed and\nScienceDirect. A total of 207 papers were screened in four steps: title,\nabstract, diagonal and full-text reading. Four evaluators performed the SLR\nindependently to reduce bias risk. A total of 8 papers was included in the SLR\ncase study. The case study demonstrates how to implement the methods of BiSLR\nto procedure SLR for bioinformatics.

Since its direct\nsolution rapidly becomes intractable due to the increasing size of the state\nspace, truncation of the state space is necessary for solving most dCMEs. It is\ntherefore important to assess the consequences of state space truncations so\nerrors can be quantified and minimized. Here we describe a novel method for\nstate space truncation. By partitioning a reaction network into multiple\nmolecular equivalence groups (MEG), we truncate the state space by limiting the\ntotal molecular copy numbers in each MEG. We further describe a theoretical\nframework for analysis of the truncation error in the steady state probability\nlandscape using reflecting boundaries. By aggregating the state space based on\nthe usage of a MEG and constructing an aggregated Markov process, we show that\nthe truncation error of a MEG can be asymptotically bounded by the probability\nof states on the reflecting boundary of the MEG. Furthermore, truncating states\nof an arbitrary MEG will not undermine the estimated error of truncating any\nother MEGs. We then provide an error estimate for networks with multiple MEGs.\nTo rapidly determine the appropriate size of an arbitrary MEG, we introduce an\na priori method to estimate the upper bound of its truncation error, which can\nbe rapidly computed from reaction rates, without costly trial solutions of the\ndCME. We show results of applying our methods to four stochastic networks. We\ndemonstrate how truncation errors and steady state probability landscapes can\nbe computed using different sizes of the MEG(s) and how the results validate\nout theories. Overall, the novel state space truncation and error analysis\nmethods developed here can be used to ensure accurate direct solutions to the\ndCME for a large class of stochastic networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:58:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Youfang", ""], ["Terebus", "Anna", ""], ["Liang", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.08504", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Willie Yu", "title": "Mutation Clusters from Cancer Exome", "comments": "84 pages", "journal-ref": "Genes 8(8) (2017) 201", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We apply our statistically deterministic machine learning/clustering\nalgorithm *K-means (recently developed in https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908286) to\n10,656 published exome samples for 32 cancer types.
