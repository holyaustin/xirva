The second contribution consists of the analysis,\ncarried out by using BiNS2, of a specific communication process happening\ninside blood vessels, the atherogenesis, which is the initial phase of the\nformation of atherosclerotic plaques, due to the abnormal signaling between\nplatelets and endothelium. From a communication point of view, platelets act as\nmobile transmitters, endothelial cells are fixed receivers, sticky to the\nvessel walls, and the transmitted signal is made of bursts of molecules emitted\nby platelets. The simulator allows evaluating the channel latency and the\nfootprint on the vessel wall of the transmitted signal as a function of the\ntransmitter distance from the vessels wall, the signal strength, and the\nreceiver sensitivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 21:05:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Felicetti", "Luca", ""], ["Femminella", "Mauro", ""], ["Reali", "Gianluca", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0180", "submitter": "Roland Bouffanais", "authors": "Roland Bouffanais, Jianmin Sun and Dick K.

These operations are performed in the Fourier domain with high\ncomputational efficiency, allowing to obtain the 3D traction stresses from raw\nmicroscopy images virtually in real time. We also characterize the error of\nprevious two-dimensional (2D) TFM methods that neglect the out-of-plane\ncomponent of the traction stresses. This analysis reveals that, under certain\ncombinations of experimental parameters (\\ie cell size, substratums' thickness\nand Poisson's ratio), the accuracy of 2D TFM methods is minimally affected by\nneglecting the out-of-plane component of the traction stresses. Finally, we\nconsider the cell's mechanosensing of substratum thickness by 3D traction\nstresses, finding that, when cells adhere on thin substrata, their out-of-plane\ntraction stresses can reach four times deeper into the substratum than their\nin-plane traction stresses. It is also found that the substratum stiffness\nsensed by applying out-of-plane traction stresses may be up to 10 times larger\nthan the stiffness sensed by applying in-plane traction stresses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Jun 2013 22:04:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["del Alamo", "Juan C", ""], ["Meili", "Ruedi", ""], ["Alvarez-Gonzalez", "Bego\u00f1a", ""], ["Alonso-Latorre", "Baldomero", ""], ["Bastounis", "Effie", ""], ["Firtel", "Richard", ""], ["Lasheras", "Juan C", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.4493", "submitter": "Ezio Bartocci", "authors": "Ezio Bartocci, Luca Bortolussi, and Laura Nenzi", "title": "A temporal logic approach to modular design of synthetic biological\n  circuits", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.ET q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new approach for the design of a synthetic biological circuit\nwhose behaviour is specified in terms of signal temporal logic (STL) formulae.\nWe first show how to characterise with STL formulae the input/output behaviour\nof biological modules miming the classical logical gates (AND, NOT, OR).

Signals with long-range\ntemporal correlations are typically defined as having a power law decay in\ntheir autocorrelation function. The output of DFA is an exponent, which is the\nslope obtained by linear regression of a log-log fluctuation plot against\nwindow size. However, if this fluctuation plot is not linear, then the\nunderlying signal is not self-similar, and the exponent has no meaning. There\nis currently no method for assessing the linearity of a DFA fluctuation plot.\nHere we present such a technique, called ML-DFA. We scale the DFA fluctuation\nplot to construct a likelihood function for a set of alternative models\nincluding polynomial, root, exponential, logarithmic and spline functions. We\nuse this likelihood function to determine the maximum likelihood and thus to\ncalculate values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, which\nidentify the best fit model when the number of parameters involved is taken\ninto account and over-fitting is penalised. This ensures that, of the models\nthat fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit. We apply\nML-DFA to synthetic data from FARIMA processes and sine curves with DFA\nfluctuation plots whose form has been analytically determined, and to\nexperimentally collected neurophysiological data. ML-DFA assesses whether the\nhypothesis of a linear fluctuation plot should be rejected, and thus whether\nthe exponent can be considered meaningful. We argue that ML-DFA is essential to\nobtaining trustworthy results from DFA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 08:38:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Botcharova", "Maria", ""], ["Farmer", "Simon F", ""], ["Berthouze", "Luc", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.5148", "submitter": "Antonio Scialdone", "authors": "Antonio Scialdone (1), Sam T.
