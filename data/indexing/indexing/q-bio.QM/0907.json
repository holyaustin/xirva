Each part in this hierarchy consists of a set of\nattributes that define the part, such as sequence or rate constants. Models\nthat are constructed using these parts can be analyzed using various C and\nPython programs that are hosted by TinkerCell via an extensive C and Python\nAPI. TinkerCell supports the notion of a module, which are networks with\ninterfaces. Such modules can be connected to each other, forming larger modular\nnetworks. Because TinkerCell associates parameters and equations in a model\nwith their respective part, parts can be loaded from databases along with their\nparameters and rate equations. The modular network design can be used to\nexchange modules as well as test the concept of modularity in biological\nsystems. The flexible modeling framework along with the C and Python API allows\nTinkerCell to serve as a host to numerous third-party algorithms.
