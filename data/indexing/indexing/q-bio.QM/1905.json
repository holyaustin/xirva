Given the costs (time, money, human resources) of\ndetermining protein structures via experimental means such as X-ray\ncrystallography, can we better describe and compare protein 3D structures in a\nrobust and efficient manner, so as to gain meaningful biological insights? We\nbegin by considering a relatively simple problem, limiting ourselves to just\nprotein secondary structural elements. Historically, many computational methods\nhave been devised to classify amino acid residues in a protein chain into one\nof several discrete secondary structures, of which the most well-characterized\nare the geometrically regular $\\alpha$-helix and $\\beta$-sheet; irregular\nstructural patterns, such as 'turns' and 'loops', are less understood. Here, we\npresent a study of Deep Learning techniques to classify the loop-like end cap\nstructures which delimit $\\alpha$-helices. Previous work used highly empirical\nand heuristic methods to manually classify helix capping motifs. Instead, we\nuse structural data directly--including (i) backbone torsion angles computed\nfrom 3D structures, (ii) macromolecular feature sets (e.g., physicochemical\nproperties), and (iii) helix cap classification data (from CAPS-DB)--as the\nground truth to train a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to\nclassify helix cap residues. We tried different network architectures and\nscanned hyperparameters in order to train and assess several models; we also\ntrained a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to use as a baseline.

Currently, the selection of the\nbest quality cells and colonies for propagation is typically performed by eye,\nin terms of the displayed morphological features, such as prominent/abundant\nnucleoli and a colony with a tightly packed appearance and a well-defined edge.\nUsing image analysis and computational tools, we precisely quantify these\nproperties using phase-contrast images of hESC colonies of different sizes (0.1\n-- 1.1$\\, \\text{mm}^2$) during days 2, 3 and 4 after plating. Our analyses\nreveal noticeable differences in their structure influenced directly by the\ncolony area $A$. Large colonies ($A > 0.6 \\, \\text{mm}^2$) have cells with\nsmaller nuclei and a short intercellular distance when compared with small\ncolonies ($A < 0.2 \\, \\text{mm}^2$). The gaps between the cells, which are\npresent in small and medium sized colonies with $A \\le 0.6 \\, \\text{mm}^2$,\ndisappear in large colonies ($A > 0.6 \\, \\text{mm}^2$) due to the proliferation\nof the cells in the bulk. This increases the colony density and the number of\nnearest neighbours.\n  We also detect the self-organisation of cells in the colonies where newly\ndivided (smallest) cells cluster together in patches, separated from larger\ncells at the final stages of the cell cycle. This might influence directly\ncell-to-cell interactions and the community effects within the colonies since\nthe segregation induced by size differences allows the interchange of\nneighbours as the cells proliferate and the colony grows. Our findings are\nrelevant to efforts to determine the quality of hESC colonies and establish\ncolony characteristics database.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2019 14:11:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Orozco-Fuentes", "Sirio", ""], ["Neganova", "Irina", ""], ["Wadkin", "Laura E.", ""], ["Baggaley", "Andrew W.", ""], ["Barrio", "Rafael A.", ""], ["Lako", "Majlinda", ""], ["Shukurov", "Anvar", ""], ["Parker", "Nicholas G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.07818", "submitter": "Junzhong Xu", "authors": "Junzhong Xu, Xiaoyu Jiang, Hua Li, Lori R.

Unfortunately, cell size can only be\nobtained by pathologic evaluation of the tumor in the current standard of care.\nPrevious imaging approaches can be implemented on only animal MRI scanners or\nrequire relatively long acquisition times that are undesirable for clinical\nimaging. There is a need to develop cell size imaging for clinics. Experimental\nDesign: We propose a new method, IMPULSED (Imaging Microstructural Parameters\nUsing Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion) that can characterize mean cell\nsizes in solid tumors. We report the use of combined sequences with different\ngradient waveforms on human MRI and analytical equations that link DWI signals\nof real gradient waveforms and specific microstructural parameters such as cell\nsize. We also describe comprehensive validations using computer simulations,\ncell experiments in vitro, and animal experiments in vivo and finally\ndemonstrate applications in pre-operative breast cancer patients. Results: With\nfast acquisitions (~ 7 mins), IMPULSED can provide high-resolution (1.3 mm\nin-plane) mapping of mean cell size of human tumors in vivo on\ncurrently-available 3T MRI scanners. All validations suggest IMPULSED provide\naccurate and reliable measurements of mean cell size.

It is used to\ndefine two imaging progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease\nscore. These markers can be computed locally in any brain region. The approach\nis evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the ADNI\ndatabase. The generative model is first estimated on a control population,\nthen, for each subject, the markers are computed for each acquisition. The\nlongitudinal evolution of these markers is then studied in relation with the\nclinical diagnosis of the subjects and used to generate possible morphological\nevolution. In the model, the morphological changes associated with normal aging\nare mainly found around the ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific\nchanges are more located in the temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The\nstatistical analysis of these markers highlights differences between clinical\nconditions even though the inter-subject variability is quiet high. In this\ncontext, the model can be used to generate plausible morphological trajectories\nassociated with the disease. Our method gives two interpretable scalar imaging\nbiomarkers assessing the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology at\nthe individual and population level.

It consists of\na fluidic device with an apical and a basal flow compartment separated by a\nsemi-permeable membrane. The main features of the device are the integration of\na transepithelial electrical impedance (TEEI) meter and transparent windows for\noptical monitoring within a dual flow system. Caco-2 cells were cultured in the\nTEEI bioreactor under both flow and static conditions. Although no differences\nin the expression of peripheral actin and occludin were visible, the cells in\ndynamic conditions developed higher impedance values at low frequencies,\nindicative of a higher paracellular electrical impedance and thus suggesting\naccelerated barrier and tight junction formation with respect to the static\ncultures. TEEI measurements at high frequency also enabled monitoring the\nevolution of transcellular impedance during culture. The cells subject to flow\nshowed a typical RC behaviour, while the controls showed minimal capacitive\nbehaviour, again highlighting the differences between flow and static\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2019 15:30:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cacopardo", "Ludovica", ""], ["Costa", "Joana", ""], ["Giusti", "Serena", ""], ["Buoncompagni", "Lucia", ""], ["Meucci", "Sandro", ""], ["Corti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Mattei", "Giorgio", ""], ["Ahluwalia", "Arti", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11800", "submitter": "Kelin Xia", "authors": "Kelin Xia, D Vijay Anand, Shikhar Saxena, Yuguang Mu", "title": "Persistent homology analysis of osmolyte molecular aggregation and their\n  hydrogen-bonding networks", "comments": "19 pages; 9 figures; 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1039/C9CP03009C", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.BM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two types of osmolytes, i.e., trimethylamin N-oxide (TMAO) and urea,\ndemonstrate dramatically different properties in a protein folding process.\nEven with the great progresses in revealing the potential underlying mechanism\nof these two osmolyte systems, many problems still remain unsolved. In this\npaper, we propose to use the persistent homology, a newly-invented topological\nmethod, to systematically study the osmolytes molecular aggregation and their\nhydrogen-bonding network from a global topological perspective. It has been\nfound that, for the first time, TMAO and urea show two extremely different\ntopological behaviors, i.e., extensive network and local cluster. In general,\nTMAO forms highly consistent large loop or circle structures in high\nconcentrations. In contrast, urea is more tightly aggregated locally. Moreover,\nthe resulting hydrogen-bonding networks also demonstrate distinguishable\nfeatures. With the concentration increase, TMAO hydrogen-bonding networks vary\ngreatly in their total number of loop structures and large-sized loop\nstructures consistently increase. In contrast, urea hydrogen-bonding networks\nremain relatively stable with slight reduce of the total loop number. Moreover,\nthe persistent entropy (PE) is, for the first time, used in characterization of\nthe topological information of the aggregation and hydrogen-bonding networks.\nThe average PE systematically increases with the concentration for both TMAO\nand urea, and decreases in their hydrogen-bonding networks. But their PE\nvariances have totally different behaviors. Finally, topological features of\nthe hydrogen-bonding networks are found to be highly consistent with those from\nthe ion aggregation systems, indicating that our topological invariants can\ncharacterize intrinsic features of the \"structure making\" and \"structure\nbreaking\" systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 13:26:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Xia", "Kelin", ""], ["Anand", "D Vijay", ""], ["Saxena", "Shikhar", ""], ["Mu", "Yuguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11848", "submitter": "Martin Weigt", "authors": "Kai Shimagaki, Martin Weigt", "title": "Selection of sequence motifs and generative Hopfield-Potts models for\n  protein familiesilies", "comments": "26 pages, 16 figures, to app. in PRE", "journal-ref": "Phys.

These models are typically requested\nto reproduce the one- and two-point statistics of the amino-acid usage in a\nprotein family, {\\em i.e.}~to capture the so-called residue conservation and\ncovariation statistics of proteins of common evolutionary origin. Pairwise\nPotts models are the maximum-entropy models achieving this.

Here we propose an approach to\nparameter reduction, which is based on selecting collective sequence motifs. It\nnaturally leads to the formulation of statistical sequence models in terms of\nHopfield-Potts models. These models can be accurately inferred using a mapping\nto restricted Boltzmann machines and persistent contrastive divergence. We show\nthat, when applied to protein data, even 20-40 patterns are sufficient to\nobtain statistically close-to-generative models. The Hopfield patterns form\ninterpretable sequence motifs and may be used to clusterize amino-acid\nsequences into functional sub-families.

The\nobserved difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal\nincreases as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account.
