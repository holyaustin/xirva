Because of\nthe inability of any single neuroimaging techniques to cover all aspects at\nonce, there is a growing interest to combine signals from multiple modalities\nin order to benefit from the advantages of each acquisition method. Due to the\ncomplexity and unknown parameterization of any suggested complete model of BOLD\nresponse in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the development of a\nreliable ultimate fusion approach remains difficult. But besides the primary\ngoal of superior temporal and spatial resolution, conjoint analysis of data\nfrom multiple imaging modalities can alternatively be used to segregate neural\ninformation from physiological and acquisition noise. In this paper we suggest\na novel methodology which relies on constructing a quantifiable mapping of data\nfrom one modality (electroencephalography; EEG) into another (fMRI), called\ntransmodal analysis of neural signals (TRANSfusion). TRANSfusion attempts to\nmap neural data embedded within the EEG signal into its reflection in fMRI\ndata. Assessing the mapping performance on unseen data allows to localize brain\nareas where a significant portion of the signal could be reliably\nreconstructed, hence the areas neural activity of which is reflected in both\nEEG and fMRI data. Consecutive analysis of the learnt model allows to localize\nareas associated with specific frequency bands of EEG, or areas functionally\nrelated (connected or coherent) to any given EEG sensor. We demonstrate the\nperformance of TRANSfusion on artificial and real data from an auditory\nexperiment.

A $k-$sample drawn from the $n-$species abundances vector is the\none obtained while conditioning it on summing to $k$% . We discuss the sampling\nformulae (species occupancy distributions, frequency of frequencies) in this\ncontext. We then develop some aspects of the estimation of $n$ problem from the\nsize $k$ of the sample and the observed value of $P_{n,k}$, the number of\ndistinct sampled species.

From this extension, a parameter\n$\\gamma $ naturally appears, which is a measure of richness or diversity of\nspecies. We rederive the sampling formulae for a population with infinitely\nmany species, together with the distribution of the number $P_{k}$ of distinct\nsampled species. We investigate the estimation of $\\gamma $ problem from the\nsample size $k$ and the observed value of $P_{k}$.

The distinct Itk PH domain\nability to oligomerize is consistent with a cooperative-allosteric mode of IP4\naction.

However, a third type of network exists, defined here as the\nmixture network. Just like a bipartite network, a mixture network also consists\nof two sets of nodes, but some nodes may simultaneously belong to two sets,\nwhich breaks the nonoverlapping restriction of a bipartite network. The mixture\nnetwork can be considered as a general case, with unipartite and bipartite\nnetworks viewed as its limiting cases. A mixture network can represent not only\nall the unipartite and bipartite networks, but also a wide range of real-world\nnetworks that cannot be properly represented as either unipartite or bipartite\nnetworks in fields such as biology and social science. Based on this\nobservation, we first propose a probabilistic model that can find modules in\nunipartite, bipartite, and mixture networks in a unified framework based on the\nlink community model for a unipartite undirected network [B Ball et al (2011\nPhys.
