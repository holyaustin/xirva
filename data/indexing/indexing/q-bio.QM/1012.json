There is thus a\npressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level\ndifferences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS\nanalysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses\nGWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways\nthat permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is\nbased upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases\nwill appear more similar to other cases than to controls for the SNPs\nassociated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all\npathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis\nholds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit\ngreater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves\non existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses in that it does not\nrequire the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits\nPoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drives risk. In this\npaper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWA studies: one of breast\ncancer, and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest\nthat there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease\nsusceptibility. PoDA thus provides an analytical tool that is complementary to\nexisting techniques and has the power to enrich our understanding of disease\ngenomics at the systems-level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Dec 2010 16:50:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2011 22:09:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Braun", "Rosemary", ""], ["Buetow", "Kenneth", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.4978", "submitter": "Salvatore De Martino", "authors": "E.
