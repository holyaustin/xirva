Most theoretical studies take a searcher-centric viewpoint,\nfocusing on the first passage time (FTP) problem to find a target. This single\nsearch-and-capture event then triggers a downstream process or provides the\nsearcher with some resource such as food. In this paper we take a\ntarget-centric viewpoint, by considering the accumulation of resources in one\nor more targets due to multiple rounds of search-and-capture events combined\nwith resource degradation; whenever a searcher finds a target it delivers a\nresource packet to the target, after which it escapes and returns to its\ninitial position. The searcher is then resupplied with cargo and a new search\nprocess is initiated after a random delay. It has previously been show how\nqueuing theory can be used to derive general expressions for the steady-state\nmean and variance of the resulting resource distributions. Here we apply the\ntheory to some classical FPT problems involving diffusion in simple geometries\nwith absorbing boundaries, including concentric spheres, wedge domains, and\nbranching networks. In each case, we determine how the resulting Fano factor\ndepends on the degradation rate, the delay distribution, and various geometric\nparameters. We thus establish that the Fano factor can deviate significantly\nfrom Poisson statistics and exhibits a non-trivial dependence on model\nparameters, including non-monotonicity and crossover behavior.

However, in high concentration regions, a sub-linear\ndependence was often observed, which could be explained by a universal\nsaturation mechanism. In this paper, we modeled the saturated elongation\nprocess through a Michaelis-Menten like mechanism, which is constituted by two\nsub-steps -- unspecific association and dissociation of a monomer with the\nfibril end, and subsequent conformational change of the associated monomer to\nfit itself to the fibrillar structure. Typical saturation concentrations were\nfound to be $7-70\\mu M$ for A$\\beta$40, $\\alpha$-synuclein and etc.\nFurthermore, by using a novel Hamiltonian formulation, analytical solutions\nvalid for both weak and strong saturated conditions were constructed and\napplied to the fibrillation kinetics of $\\alpha$-synuclein and silk fibroin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Nov 2020 06:21:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hong", "Liu", ""], ["Liu", "Xizhou", ""], ["Michaels", "Thomas C.

It can be used to\ncalculate such information-theoretic quantities as the mutual information\nbetween the stochastic stimulus and various internal states of the neuron\n(e.g., membrane potential), as well as various spiking statistics. When random\nexcitations are modeled as Gaussian white noise, the joint PDF of neuron states\nsatisfies exactly a Fokker-Planck equation. However, most biologically\nplausible noise sources are correlated (colored). In this case, the resulting\nPDF equations require a closure approximation. We propose two methods for\nclosing such equations: a modified nonlocal large-eddy-diffusivity closure and\na data-driven closure relying on sparse regression to learn relevant features.\nThe closures are tested for stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) and\nFitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons driven by sine-Wiener noise.

Therefore, the present study proposes a computational\nmodel to describe the effect of the predictability of dynamics or the pattern\nof motion stimuli on motion sickness. In the proposed model, a submodel, in\nwhich a recursive Gaussian process regression is used to represent human\nfeatures of online learning and future prediction of motion dynamics, is\ncombined with a conventional model of motion sickness based on an observer\ntheory. A simulation experiment was conducted in which the proposed model\npredicted motion sickness caused by a 900 s horizontal movement. The movement\nwas composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause.\nRegarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were\nvaried as follows: a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and\nduration of the pause were set to 8 s; b) Motion with unpredicted direction\n(M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (P), but the motion direction was\nrandomly determined; c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion\ndirection was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected\nfrom 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that\nthe predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for\n(M_dU) and (M_tU). This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in\na previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to\nmotion conditions similar to those used in our simulations.

There is a bidirectional flow of ants: the forward\nflow proceeds along forward edges from source (e.g. the nest) to sink (e.g. a\nfood source), and the backward flow in the opposite direction. Some fraction of\nants are lost as they pass through each node (modeling the loss of ants due to\nexploration).

Here, we\nshow that the process converges to the path with minimum leakage when the\nforward and backward flows do not change over time. When the forward and\nbackward flows increase over time (caused by positive reinforcement from the\ndiscovery of a food source, for example), we show that the process converges to\nthe shortest path.
