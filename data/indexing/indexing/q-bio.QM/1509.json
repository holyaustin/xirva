Despite these statistics, prognosis is\nrelatively good with a sufficiently early diagnosis, making fast and reliable\nprostate cancer detection crucial. As imaging-based prostate cancer screening,\nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), requires an experienced medical\nprofessional to extensively review the data and perform a diagnosis,\nradiomics-driven methods help streamline the process and has the potential to\nsignificantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, and thus improving\npatient survival rates. These radiomics-driven methods currently rely on\nhand-crafted sets of quantitative imaging-based features, which are selected\nmanually and can limit their ability to fully characterize unique prostate\ncancer tumour phenotype. In this study, we propose a novel \\textit{discovery\nradiomics} framework for generating custom radiomic sequences tailored for\nprostate cancer detection. Discovery radiomics aims to uncover abstract\nimaging-based features that capture highly unique tumour traits and\ncharacteristics beyond what can be captured using predefined feature models. In\nthis paper, we discover new custom radiomic sequencers for generating new\nprostate radiomic sequences using multi-parametric MRI data. We evaluated the\nperformance of the discovered radiomic sequencer against a state-of-the-art\nhand-crafted radiomic sequencer for computer-aided prostate cancer detection\nwith a feedforward neural network using real clinical prostate multi-parametric\nMRI data. Results for the discovered radiomic sequencer demonstrate good\nperformance in prostate cancer detection and clinical decision support relative\nto the hand-crafted radiomic sequencer. The use of discovery radiomics shows\npotential for more efficient and reliable automatic prostate cancer detection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 01:40:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 01:17:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 01:49:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "Audrey G.", ""], ["Shafiee", "Mohammad Javad", ""], ["Kumar", "Devinder", ""], ["Khalvati", "Farzad", ""], ["Haider", "Masoom A.", ""], ["Wong", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00415", "submitter": "Marco Scutari", "authors": "Marco Scutari, Ian Mackay, David Balding", "title": "Using Genetic Distance to Infer the Accuracy of Genomic Prediction", "comments": "36 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS Genetics 2016, 12(9):e1006288, 1-19", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The prediction of phenotypic traits using high-density genomic data has many\napplications such as the selection of plants and animals of commercial\ninterest; and it is expected to play an increasing role in medical diagnostics.\nStatistical models used for this task are usually tested using\ncross-validation, which implicitly assumes that new individuals (whose\nphenotypes we would like to predict) originate from the same population the\ngenomic prediction model is trained on.

A Gaussian model is shown to be as effective in picking\nparticles as a single projection view of the imaged molecule in the tested\ncases. For both simulated micrographs and real cryo-EM data of the 173-kDa\nglucose isomerase complex, we found that the use of a Gaussian model to\ninitialize the target functions suppressed the detrimental effect of reference\nbias in template-based particle selection. Given a sufficient signal-to-noise\nratio in the images and the appropriate choice of references, the DTF approach\ncan expedite the automated assembly of single-particle data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 07:13:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Zhou", ""], ["Wang", "Wei Li", ""], ["Castillo-Menendez", "Luis R.", ""], ["Sodroski", "Joseph", ""], ["Mao", "Youdong", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.06926", "submitter": "Matthias Chung", "authors": "Matthias Chung, Justin Krueger, and Mihai Pop", "title": "Robust Parameter Estimation for Biological Systems: A Study on the\n  Dynamics of Microbial Communities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM math.OC q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Interest in the study of in-host microbial communities has increased in\nrecent years due to our improved understanding of the communities' significant\nrole in host health.

We put forward\na principled mathematical formalism that describes human movements using an\noptimal control model in which the subject controls the jerk of the movement.\nWe construct the formalism by assuming that the movement a subject chooses to\nmake is better than the alternatives. We quantify the relative quality of\nmovements mathematically by specifying a cost functional that assigns a\nnumerical value to every possible movement; the subject makes the movement that\nminimizes the cost functional. We develop the mathematical structure of\nmovements that minimize a cost functional, and observe that this development\nparallels the development of analytical mechanics from the Principle of Least\nAction. We derive a constant of the motion for human movements that plays a\nrole that is analogous to the role that the energy plays in classical\nmechanics. We apply the formalism to the description of two movements: (1)\nrapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, and (2) finger-tapping, and show\nthat the constant of the motion that we have derived provides a useful value\nwith which we can characterize the performance of the movements. In the case of\nrapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, we show how the model of human\nmovement that we have developed can be made to agree with Fitts' law, and we\nshow how Fitts' law is related to the constant of the motion that we have\nderived. We finally show that solutions exist within the model of human\nmovements that exhibit an oscillatory character reminiscent of tremor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 16:11:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2018 19:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hagler", "Stuart", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07028", "submitter": "Imane Boudellioua", "authors": "Imane Boudellioua, Rabie Saidi, Maria Martin, Robert Hoehndorf, and\n  Victor Solovyev", "title": "Prediction of Metabolic Pathways Involvement in Prokaryotic UniProtKB\n  Data by Association Rule Mining", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE. 11(7) 2016 (1-16)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0158896", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The widening gap between known proteins and their functions has encouraged\nthe development of methods to automatically infer annotations.
