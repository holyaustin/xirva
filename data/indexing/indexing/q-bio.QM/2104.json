An effective solution is to\nbuild a computational model over the diverse omics data, including genomic,\nmolecular, and environmental information. However, choosing informative and\nreliable data sources from among the different types of data is a challenging\nproblem. We propose DIVERSE, a framework of Bayesian importance-weighted tri-\nand bi-matrix factorization(DIVERSE3 or DIVERSE2) to predict drug responses\nfrom data of cell lines, drugs, and gene interactions. DIVERSE integrates the\ndata sources systematically, in a step-wise manner, examining the importance of\neach added data set in turn. More specifically, we sequentially integrate five\ndifferent data sets, which have not all been combined in earlier bioinformatic\nmethods for predicting drug responses.

We first provide a\nreview of methodology involved in three main processing steps that are common\nacross most approaches for quantitative analysis of tractography, including\nmethods for tractography correction, segmentation and quantification. For each\nstep, we aim to describe methodological choices, their popularity, and\npotential pros and cons. We then review studies that have used quantitative\ntractography approaches to study the brain's white matter, focusing on\napplications in neurodevelopment, aging, neurological disorders, mental\ndisorders, and neurosurgery. We conclude that, while there have been\nconsiderable advancements in methodological technologies and breadth of\napplications, there nevertheless remains no consensus about the \"best\"\nmethodology in quantitative analysis of tractography, and researchers should\nremain cautious when interpreting results in research and clinical\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:50:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Fan", ""], ["Daducci", "Alessandro", ""], ["He", "Yong", ""], ["Schiavi", "Simona", ""], ["Seguin", "Caio", ""], ["Smith", "Robert", ""], ["Yeh", "Chun-Hung", ""], ["Zhao", "Tengda", ""], ["O'Donnell", "Lauren J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11674", "submitter": "Tianyue Cheng", "authors": "Tianyue Cheng, Tianchi Fan, Landi Wang", "title": "Genetic Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoder for COVID-19 Drug\n  Discovery", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  In the past several months, COVID-19 has spread over the globe and caused\nsevere damage to the people and the society.

Several optimization algorithms,\nincluding valency masking and genetic algorithm, are deployed to fine tune our\nmodel. According to the simulation, our generated molecules have great\neffectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. We quantitatively calculated the scores\nof our generated molecules and compared it with the scores of existing drugs,\nand the result shows our generated molecules scores much better than those\nexisting drugs. Moreover, our model can be also applied to generate effective\ndrugs for treating other viruses given their protein structure, which could be\nused to generate drugs for future viruses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:10:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Tianyue", ""], ["Fan", "Tianchi", ""], ["Wang", "Landi", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11834", "submitter": "Hannes Eriksson", "authors": "Hannes Eriksson, Christos Dimitrakakis, Lars Carlsson", "title": "High-dimensional near-optimal experiment design for drug discovery via\n  Bayesian sparse sampling", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of performing automated experiment design for drug\nscreening through Bayesian inference and optimisation.

The domain has two subregions which share a single common boundary.\nEach of the subregions is further partitioned into a finite number of\ncompartments. Chemical reactions can occur within a compartment, whereas\ndiffusion is represented as movement between adjacent compartments. Inspired by\nbiology, we study both 1) the case where the reactions on each side of the\nboundary are different and only certain species diffuse across the boundary as\nwell as 2) the case with spatially homogenous reactions and diffusion. We write\nthe stoichiometry matrix for these two classes of systems using a Kronecker\nproduct formulation. For the first scenario, we apply linear perturbation\ntheory to derive an approximate singular value decomposition in the limit as\ndiffusion becomes much faster than reactions. For the second scenario, we\nderive an exact analytical singular value decomposition for all relative\ndiffusion and reaction time scales. By writing the stoichiometry matrix using\nKronecker products, we show that the singular vectors and values can also be\nwritten concisely using Kronecker products.\n  Ultimately, we find that the singular value decomposition of the\nreaction-diffusion stoichiometry matrix depends on the singular value\ndecompositions of smaller matrices. These smaller matrices represent modified\nversions of the reaction-only stoichiometry matrices and the analytically known\ndiffusion-only stoichiometry matrix.

While there is a positive\ncorrelation between ACR and empirical robustness, ACR is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for empirical robustness, a fact that can be noticed even in simple\nbiochemical systems. To develop a stronger connection with empirical\nrobustness, we define dynamic ACR, a property related to dynamics, rather than\nonly to equilibrium behavior, and one that guarantees convergence to a robust\nvalue. We distinguish between wide basin and narrow basin versions of dynamic\nACR, related to the size of the set of initial values that do not result in\nconvergence to the robust value. We give numerous examples which help\ndistinguish the various flavors of ACR as well as clearly illustrate and\ncircumscribe the conditions that appear in the definitions. We discuss general\ndynamical systems with ACR properties as well as parametrized families of\ndynamical systems related to reaction networks. We discuss connections between\nACR and complex balance, two notions central to the theory of reaction\nnetworks.

This issue is especially prominent when radiomic features are\ncalculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans.\nIn this article, we investigate the possibility of improving the\nreproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs by using\ngenerative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method - non-local\nmeans - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and\nconditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test\nmodels. We added noise to the sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs\nwith two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and high-noise CT. Models were\ntrained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without\nre-training. We also test the performance of our model in real data, using\ndataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs to assess the reproducibility of\nradiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved the\nconcordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise\nimages from 0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92\nrespectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN improved the test-retest\nreliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94) based\non real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can\nimprove the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs.\nMoreover, images with different noise levels can be denoised to improve the\nreproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the noise\nintensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs.
