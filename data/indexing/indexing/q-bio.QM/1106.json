While traditional linkage analysis and modern\nhigh-throughput techniques often provide long lists of tens or hundreds of\ndisease gene candidates, the identification of disease genes among the\ncandidates remains time-consuming and expensive. Efficient computational\nmethods are therefore needed to prioritize genes within the list of candidates,\nby exploiting the wealth of information available about the genes in various\ndatabases. Here we propose ProDiGe, a novel algorithm for Prioritization of\nDisease Genes. ProDiGe implements a novel machine learning strategy based on\nlearning from positive and unlabeled examples, which allows to integrate\nvarious sources of information about the genes, to share information about\nknown disease genes across diseases, and to perform genome-wide searches for\nnew disease genes.

We now know that living cells take\nadvantage of stochasticity in some cases and counteract stochastic effects in\nothers. The source of intrinsic stochasticity in biomolecular systems are\nrandom timings of individual reactions, which cumulatively drive the\nvariability in outputs of such systems. Despite the acknowledged relevance of\nstochasticity in the functioning of living cells no rigorous method have been\nproposed to precisely identify sources of variability. In this paper we propose\na novel methodology that allows us to calculate contributions of individual\nreactions into the variability of a system's output.

A single gene with negative transcriptional\nfeedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the\ntransmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A\nsingle gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce\noscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction\nwith a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine\na model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive\nfeedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and\nactivates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a\nrepressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A\nstochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic\nstudy identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two\ntypes of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and\nthis protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual\nnegative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting\non the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient\ncondition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive\ntranscriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor\ngene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop\nis not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the\nformation of protein multimers.

In this study, we approach the problem of parameter estimation in\nconductance-based models of single neurons from a different perspective. By\nadopting a hidden-dynamical-systems formalism, we expressed parameter\nestimation as an inference problem in these systems, which can then be tackled\nusing well-established statistical inference methods. The particular method we\nused was Kitagawa's self-organizing state-space model, which was applied on a\nnumber of Hodgkin-Huxley models using simulated or actual electrophysiological\ndata. We showed that the algorithm can be used to estimate a large number of\nparameters, including maximal conductances, reversal potentials, kinetics of\nionic currents and measurement noise, based on low-dimensional experimental\ndata and sufficiently informative priors in the form of pre-defined constraints\nimposed on model parameters. The algorithm remained operational even when very\nnoisy experimental data were used. Importantly, by combining the\nself-organizing state-space model with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to\nthe Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy we achieved a significant\nreduction in the variance of parameter estimates. The algorithm did not require\nthe explicit formulation of a cost function and it was straightforward to apply\non compartmental models and multiple data sets.

Integration of these sets creates large networks of information.\nWe have previously described a tool called WENDI for aggregating information\npertaining to new chemical compounds, effectively creating evidence paths\nrelating the compounds to genes, diseases and so on. In this paper we examine\nthe utility of automatically inferring new compound-disease associations (and\nthus new links in the network) based on semantically marked-up versions of\nthese evidence paths, rule-sets and inference engines.\n  Results Through the implementation of a semantic inference algorithm, rule\nset, Semantic Web methods (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and new interfaces, we have\ncreated a new tool called Chemogenomic Explorer that uses networks of\nontologically annotated RDF statements along with deductive reasoning tools to\ninfer new associations between the query structure and genes and diseases from\nWENDI results. The tool then permits interactive clustering and filtering of\nthese evidence paths.\n  Conclusions We present a new aggregate approach to inferring links between\nchemical compounds and diseases using semantic inference. This approach allows\nmultiple evidence paths between compounds and diseases to be identified using a\nrule-set and semantically annotated data, and for these evidence paths to be\nclustered to show overall evidence linking the compound to a disease.
