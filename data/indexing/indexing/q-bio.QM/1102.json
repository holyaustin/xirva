A fundamental question in Statistics, Data Analysis and\nClassification, is the prediction of the number of clusters in a dataset,\nusually established via internal validation measures. Despite the wealth of\ninternal measures available in the literature, new ones have been recently\nproposed, some of them specifically for microarray data. In this dissertation,\na study of internal validation measures is given, paying particular attention\nto the stability based ones. Indeed, this class of measures is particularly\nprominent and promising in order to have a reliable estimate the number of\nclusters in a dataset. For those measures, a new general algorithmic paradigm\nis proposed here that highlights the richness of measures in this class and\naccounts for the ones already available in the literature. Moreover, some of\nthe most representative validation measures are also considered. Experiments on\n12 benchmark datasets are performed in order to assess both the intrinsic\nability of a measure to predict the correct number of clusters in a dataset and\nits merit relative to the other measures. The main result is a hierarchy of\ninternal validation measures in terms of precision and speed, highlighting some\nof their merits and limitations not reported before in the literature. This\nhierarchy shows that the faster the measure, the less accurate it is. In order\nto reduce the time performance gap between the fastest and the most precise\nmeasures, the technique of designing fast approximation algorithms is\nsystematically applied. The end result is a speed-up of many of the measures\nstudied here that brings the gap between the fastest and the most precise\nwithin one order of magnitude in time, with no degradation in their prediction\npower.

We also implemented a\ngeneric probabilistic scoring scheme that can be trained automatically for a\ndataset of annotated spectra and is independent of the mass spectrometer type.\nEvaluations on benchmark data show that Antilope is competitive to the popular\nstate-of-the-art programs PepNovo and NovoHMM both in terms of run time and\naccuracy. Furthermore, it offers increased flexibility in the number of\nconsidered ion types.

One of the\ncentral goals of systems biology is the unraveling of the as yet poorly\ncharacterized complex web of interactions among these components. This work is\nmade harder by the fact that new species and interactions are continuously\ndiscovered in experimental work, necessitating the development of adaptive and\nfast algorithms for network construction and updating. Thus, the\n\"reverse-engineering\" of networks from data has emerged as one of the central\nconcern of systems biology research.\n  A variety of reverse-engineering methods have been developed, based on tools\nfrom statistics, machine learning, and other mathematical domains. In order to\neffectively use these methods, it is essential to develop an understanding of\nthe fundamental characteristics of these algorithms. With that in mind, this\nchapter is dedicated to the reverse-engineering of biological systems.\n  Specifically, we focus our attention on a particular class of methods for\nreverse-engineering, namely those that rely algorithmically upon the so-called\n\"hitting-set\" problem, which is a classical combinatorial and computer science\nproblem, Each of these methods utilizes a different algorithm in order to\nobtain an exact or an approximate solution of the hitting set problem.

Following the initial publication of the human\ngenome sequence in 2001, advances in high-throughput measurement technologies\nand efficient sharing of research material through community databases have\nopened up new views to the study of living organisms and the structure of life.\nIn this thesis, novel computational strategies have been developed to\ninvestigate a key functional layer of genetic information, the human\ntranscriptome, which regulates the function of living cells through protein\nsynthesis. The key contributions of the thesis are general exploratory tools\nfor high-throughput data analysis that have provided new insights to\ncell-biological networks, cancer mechanisms and other aspects of genome\nfunction.\n  A central challenge in functional genomics is that high-dimensional genomic\nobservations are associated with high levels of complex and largely unknown\nsources of variation. By combining statistical evidence across multiple\nmeasurement sources and the wealth of background information in genomic data\nrepositories it has been possible to solve some the uncertainties associated\nwith individual observations and to identify functional mechanisms that could\nnot be detected based on individual measurement sources. Statistical learning\nand probabilistic models provide a natural framework for such modeling tasks.\nOpen source implementations of the key methodological contributions have been\nreleased to facilitate further adoption of the developed methods by the\nresearch community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Feb 2011 14:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lahti", "Leo", ""]]}]
