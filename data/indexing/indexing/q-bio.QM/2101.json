Then, an AC-MOFOA based on the concepts of\nnon-dominated sorting, crowding distance, chaos theory, and adaptive operators\nis presented. AC-MOFOA as a wrapper method aimed at reducing dataset\ndimensions, optimizing KELM, and increasing the accuracy of the classification,\nsimultaneously. Next, in this method, an ensemble classifier model is presented\nusing AC-MOFOA results to classify microarray data. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm was evaluated on nine public microarray datasets, and its\nresults were compared in terms of the number of selected genes, classification\nefficiency, execution time, time complexity, and hypervolume indicator\ncriterion with five hybrid multi-objective methods.

After a short literature review, our goal\nwas to determine the velocity of the exhaled air during vocal exercises.\nMethods A propylene glycol cloud produced by 2 e-cigarettes' users allowed\nvisualization of the exhaled air emitted during vocal exercises. Airflow\nvelocities were measured during the first 200 ms of a long exhalation, a\nsustained vowel /a/ and varied vocal exercises. For the long exhalation and the\nsustained vowel /a/, the decrease of airflow velocity was measured until 3 s.\nResults were compared with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study using\nboundary conditions consistent with our experimental study. Results Regarding\nthe production of vowels, higher velocities were found in loud and whispered\nvoices than in normal voice. Voiced consonants like /3/ or /v/ generated higher\nvelocities than vowels. Some voiceless consonants, e.g., /t/ generated high\nvelocities, but long exhalation had the highest velocities. Semi-occluded vocal\ntract exercises generated faster airflow velocities than loud speech, with a\ndecreased velocity during voicing. The initial velocity quickly decreased as\nwas shown during a long exhalation or a sustained vowel /a/. Velocities were\nconsistent with the CFD data. Conclusion Initial velocity of the exhaled air is\na key factor influencing droplets trajectory. Our study revealed that vocal\nexercises produce a slower airflow than long exhalation.

The counting of plaques or foci at a given dilution intuitively and\ndirectly provides the concentration of infectious doses in the undiluted\nsample. However, it has many technical and experimental limitations. For\nexample, it relies on one's judgement in distinguishing between two merged\nplaques and a larger one, or between small plaques and staining artifacts. In\nthis regard, ED assays are more robust because one need only determine whether\ninfection occurred. The output of the ED assay, the 50% infectious dose\n(ID$_{50}$), is calculated using either the Spearman-Karber (SK, 1908,1931) or\nReed-Muench (RM, 1938) mathematical approximations.

Modeling the underlying mechanics of such morphological changes has\ntraditionally relied on reduced order axisymmetric representations of membrane\ngeometry and deformation.

The fast expansion of available biological data enables\ncomputational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them,\ndeep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as\nprotein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement\nby learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and\ndrug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally\nobtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational\nmethods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that\nhamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel\nsupervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby\nimprove the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In\nthis research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI.\nBridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different\nproteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised\nlearned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end\nlearning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of\nDPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the\neffectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification,\nBridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various\nantiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the\nWorld Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the\nvalidity and reliability of BridgeDPI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 12:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Yifan", ""], ["Gao", "Min", ""], ["Zeng", "Min", ""], ["Chen", "Feiyang", ""], ["Li", "Min", ""], ["Zhang", "Jie", ""]]}]
