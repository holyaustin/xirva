KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of\ntwo domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the\nCII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.\nWhile this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven\nthermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 16:25:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Lubensky", "David K", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.02812", "submitter": "Shihao Yang", "authors": "Shihao Yang, S.

High angular resolution diffusion imaging\n(HARDI) can produce better estimates of fiber orientation than the popularly\nused diffusion tensor imaging, but the high number of samples needed to\nestimate diffusivity requires longer patient scan times. To accelerate dMRI,\ncompressed sensing (CS) has been utilized by exploiting a sparse dictionary\nrepresentation of the data, discovered through sparse coding. The sparser the\nrepresentation, the fewer samples are needed to reconstruct a high resolution\nsignal with limited information loss, and so an important area of research has\nfocused on finding the sparsest possible representation of dMRI.

In this paper we propose an\nadaptive model which performs feature selection for each test sample\nindividually based on the distribution of the input data. The method can be\nseen as partially blind domain adaptation. We apply the model to the problem of\nage prediction based on DNA methylation data from a variety of tissues, and\ncompare it to a standard model, which does not take heterogeneity into account.\nThe standard approach has particularly bad performance on one tissue type on\nwhich we show substantial improvement with our new adaptive approach even\nthough no samples of that tissue were part of the training data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 13:26:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Handl", "Lisa", ""], ["Jalali", "Adrin", ""], ["Scherer", "Michael", ""], ["Pfeifer", "Nico", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.06921", "submitter": "Kim Whoriskey", "authors": "Kim Whoriskey, Marie Auger-M\\'eth\\'e, Christoffer Moesgaard Albertsen,\n  Frederick G.

Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement\nthrough time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific\nmovement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available\nspace, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal\ntracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model\ncalled the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching (DCRWS) has\noften been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate\ntracking data of animal movement are now becoming more common.\n  2. We developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identifying behavioral\nstates from animal tracks with negligible error, which we called the Hidden\nMarkov Movement Model (HMMM). We implemented as the basis for the HMMM the\nprocess equation of the DCRWS, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and\nthe R package TMB for rapid model fitting.\n  3. We compared the HMMM to a modified version of the DCRWS for highly\naccurate tracks, the DCRWSnome, and to a common HMM for animal tracks fitted\nwith the R package moveHMM. We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable\nfor multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout,\nand blue shark, as well as to simulated data.\n  4. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from\nanimal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the\npopular DCRWS implementation for highly accurate tracking data. It additionally\nprovides a groundwork for development of more complex modelling of animal\nmovement with TMB. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R\npackage swim.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 23:33:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Whoriskey", "Kim", ""], ["Auger-M\u00e9th\u00e9", "Marie", ""], ["Albertsen", "Christoffer Moesgaard", ""], ["Whoriskey", "Frederick G.", ""], ["Binder", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Krueger", "Charles C.", ""], ["Flemming", "Joanna Mills", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.07468", "submitter": "Sang Kwan Choi", "authors": "Sang Kwan Choi, Chaiho Rim and Hwajin Um", "title": "RNA substructure as a random matrix ensemble", "comments": "8 pages, 12 figures; v2: data set and figure added, comments added,\n  references updated; v3: appendix and references added, few sentences\n  including abstract paraphrased for clarification, remarks added in the\n  conclusion; v4: published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In\ncontrast, star hyperedges represent highly localized subnetworks centered on a\nsmall set of regions, and are distributed across the entire cortex. Finally,\nbridge hyperedges link clusters and stars in a core-periphery organization.\nNotably, developmental changes within hyperedges are ordered in a similar\ncore-periphery fashion, with the greatest developmental effects occurring in\nnetworked hyperedges within the functional core.

Hence, recovering the system\ndynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple\nsingle-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward\nunderstanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space\nrepresentation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing\nequations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a\ncomputationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has\nbeen extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems\nperspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation\nscheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of\nstate space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent\ndynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is\nused to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace\napproximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the\nprocedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the\nrodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical\nworking memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to\nbe sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task\nperformance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models\nwere rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the\nvicinity of a bifurcation point. In summary, the present work advances a\nsemi-analytical (thus reasonably fast) maximum-likelihood estimation framework\nfor PLRNNs that may enable to recover the relevant dynamics underlying observed\nneuronal time series, and directly link them to computational properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 01:01:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Durstewitz", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08058", "submitter": "Danielle Bassett", "authors": "Lia Papadopoulos, Pablo Blinder, Henrik Ronellenfitsch, Florian Klimm,\n  Eleni Katifori, David Kleinfeld, Danielle S.
