We show the analogy with nonlinear mean field\nFokker-Planck equations and generalized thermodynamics. As an illustration, we\nintroduce a new model of chemotaxis incorporating both effects of anomalous\ndiffusion and exclusion principle (volume filling). We also discuss the analogy\nbetween biological populations described by the Keller-Segel model and\nself-gravitating Brownian particles described by the Smoluchowski-Poisson\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2008 15:15:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chavanis", "Pierre-Henri", ""]]}]
