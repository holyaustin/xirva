In order to obtain improved trackings of local\nshape features we discuss an additional correction step based on active\ncontours and the image Laplacian which we optimize for an example class of\ntransformed renal epithelial (MDCK-F) cells.

Here we investigate some energetic aspects of the sliding-helix model\nof the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear dielectrics and\nwhole-body motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions\nare solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical\nconsequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain\ninsight into the sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured\nensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage.\nThose consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for two alternate\nS4 configurations, \\alpha- and 3(10)-helical. Both forms of VS are found to\nhave an inherent electrostatic stability. Maximal charge displacement is\nlimited by geometry, specifically the range of movement where S4 charges and\ncounter-charges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. Charge displacement\nresponds more steeply to voltage in the \\alpha-helical than the 3(10)-helical\nsensor. This difference is due to differences on the order of 0.1 eV in the\nlandscapes of electrostatic energy. As a step toward integrating these VS\nmodels into a full-channel model, we include a hypothetical external load in\nthe Hamiltonian of the system and analyze the energetic in/output relation of\nthe VS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2012 13:40:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 23:08:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 21:13:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2012 08:46:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Peyser", "Alexander", ""], ["Nonner", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6233", "submitter": "Seyed Abolfazl Motahari", "authors": "Abolfazl Motahari, Guy Bresler and David Tse", "title": "Information Theory of DNA Shotgun Sequencing", "comments": "Revised Version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  DNA sequencing is the basic workhorse of modern day biology and medicine.\nShotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short\nfragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are\nassembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a\nsequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the\nminimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number\nprovides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\\em any} assembly\nalgorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read\nprocess, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomena in the asymptotic\nlimit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold,\nreconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the\nread length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA\nsequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of\nthe Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence.

Its internal consistency can be demonstrated via the zero mass\nlimit of a generalized Klein-Kramers equation. Moreover, the connection to\nother integrations becomes evident: the obtained Fokker-Planck equation defines\na new type of stochastic calculus that in general differs from the\n{\\alpha}-type interpretation. A unique advantage of this new approach is a\nnatural correspondence between stochastic and deterministic dynamics, which is\nuseful or may even be essential in practice. The core of the framework is a\ntransformation from the usual Langevin equation to a form that contains a\npotential function with two additional dynamical matrices, which reveals an\nunderlying symplectic structure. The framework has a direct physical meaning\nand a straightforward experimental realization. A recent experiment has offered\na first empirical validation of this new stochastic integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 17:28:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 12:58:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 14:38:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Ruoshi", ""], ["Ao", "Ping", ""]]}]
