Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor\nsequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the\ndistribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the\nimmune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from\nreceptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating\nevery possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a\nHidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can\ngenerate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on\nthe Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the\ndifferent events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on\nsequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To\ntest the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences\nproduced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be\naccurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to\ngenerate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any\nreceptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We\nestimate this diversity to be $\\approx 10^{23}$ for human T cells.

The objective is to decrease its vulnerability to\nsmall data variations by removing variables corresponding to unstable local\nphenomena. Our study is twofold: i) from a methodological perspective comparing\nthe performances and the stability of the three previous methods, i.e L1LR,\nclassification trees and L1LR-Tree, for the classification of severe forms of\nimported malaria, and ii) from an applied perspective improving the actual\nclassification of severe forms of imported malaria by identifying more\npersonalized profiles predictive of several clinical criteria based on\nvariables dismissed for the clinical definition of the disease. The main\nmethodological results show that the combined method L1LR-Tree builds sparse\nand stable models that significantly predicts the different severity criteria\nand outperforms all the other methods in terms of accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:12:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Talenti", "Luca", ""], ["Luck", "Margaux", ""], ["Yartseva", "Anastasia", ""], ["Argy", "Nicolas", ""], ["Houz\u00e9", "Sandrine", ""], ["Damon", "Cecilia", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.06754", "submitter": "Lauren Assour", "authors": "Lauren A.

While these two approaches have been developed for\ndifferent purposes, we describe how some gene set analysis methods can be used\nto conduct feature selection. Here we adapt the gene set analysis method,\nsignificance analysis of microarray gene set reduction (SAMGSR), for feature\nselection, and propose two extensions-simple SAMGSR and two-level SAMGSR to\nidentify relevant features for longitudinal microarray data.\n  Results and Discussion: When applied to a real-world application, both simple\nand two-level SAMGSR work comparably well. Using simulated data, we further\ndemonstrate that both SAMGSR extensions have the ability to identify the true\nrelevant genes. If the relevant genes are not highly correlated with the\nirrelevant ones, the final models given by the two SAMGSR extensions are\nparsimonious as well.\n  Conclusions: By adapting SAMGSR for feature selection and applying the\nproposed algorithms on a longitudinal gene expression dataset, we demonstrate\nthat a gene set analysis method can be used for the purpose of feature\nselection. We believe this work paves the way for more research to bridge\nfeature selection and gene set analysis with the development of novel\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 02:31:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Suyan", ""], ["Wang", "Chi", ""], ["Chang", "Howard H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08317", "submitter": "Pierre Peterlongo", "authors": "Maillet Nicolas, Collet Guillaume, Vanier Thomas, Lavenier Dominique,\n  Pierre Peterlongo", "title": "Commet: comparing and combining multiple metagenomic datasets", "comments": "IEEE BIBM 2014, Nov 2014, Belfast, United Kingdom. 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Metagenomics offers a way to analyze biotopes at the genomic level and to\nreach functional and taxonomical conclusions.

Our experimental tests show that for many test\nproteins, the best out of 5 solutions generated by our method has accuracy at\nleast 0.1 better than the first one when the top L/5 or L/10 (L is the sequence\nlength) predicted long-range contacts are evaluated, especially for protein\nfamilies with a small number of sequence homologs.

In red drum, the\ncontrol hook outcaught the magnetic hook by 32 - 18 for chi-squared = 3.92 and\na P-value of 0.048. Black drum showed a significant attraction for the magnetic\nhook, which prevailed over the control hook by 11 - 3 for chi-squared = 4.57\nand a P-value of 0.033.
