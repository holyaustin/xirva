Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to\nregular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural network. Predictive\ncapabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental\ndata. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to\nmap body surface impulses to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for\nreconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across the heart surface were\npredicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\\pm1.4$%.\nPredicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to\ndisplacement and rotation of the heart within the torso were bounded and\npredictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted in a 4\\%\nincrease in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse\nfunction data could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded\nHSPs from in-vitro pig hearts were reliably decomposed using space-time\nGaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular pacing had a mean\nabsolute error of $10.4\\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with\nsimilar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are\npotentially an effective and robust way to train simple neural network data\nmodels for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the\nneural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively\nidentify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent\ntreatment options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2021 00:25:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2021 23:05:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Tommy", ""], ["Malik", "Avinash", ""], ["Bear", "Laura", ""], ["Trew", "Mark L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.00637", "submitter": "James Lu", "authors": "Sameer Sundrani and James Lu", "title": "Computing the Hazard Ratios Associated with Explanatory Variables Using\n  Machine Learning Models of Survival Data", "comments": "27 pages, 5 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics, 2021", "doi": "10.1200/CCI.20.00172", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Purpose: The application of Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) models to\nsurvival data and the derivation of Hazard Ratio (HR) is well established.\nWhile nonlinear, tree-based Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed\nand applied to the survival analysis, no methodology exists for computing HRs\nassociated with explanatory variables from such models. We describe a novel way\nto compute HRs from tree-based ML models using the Shapley additive explanation\n(SHAP) values, which is a locally accurate and consistent methodology to\nquantify explanatory variables' contribution to predictions.\n  Methods: We used three sets of publicly available survival data consisting of\npatients with colon, breast or pan cancer and compared the performance of CoxPH\nto the state-of-art ML model, XGBoost. To compute the HR for explanatory\nvariables from the XGBoost model, the SHAP values were exponentiated and the\nratio of the means over the two subgroups calculated. The confidence interval\nwas computed via bootstrapping the training data and generating the ML model\n1000 times. Across the three data sets, we systematically compared HRs for all\nexplanatory variables.

While several aspects\nof this complex problem are computationally assisted, the drafting of catalytic\nmechanisms, i.e. the specification of the chemical steps-and hence intermediate\nstates-that the enzyme is meant to implement, is largely left to human\nexpertise. The ability to capture specific chemistries of multi-step catalysis\nin a fashion that enables its computational construction and design is\ntherefore highly desirable and would equally impact the elucidation of existing\nenzymatic reactions whose mechanisms are unknown. Results: We use the\nmathematical framework of graph transformation to express the distinction\nbetween rules and reactions in chemistry. We derive about 1000 rules for amino\nacid side chain chemistry from the M-CSA database, a curated repository of\nenzymatic mechanisms. Using graph transformation we are able to propose\nhundreds of hypothetical catalytic mechanisms for a large number of unrelated\nreactions in the Rhea database. We analyze these mechanisms to find that they\ncombine in chemically sound fashion individual steps from a variety of known\nmulti-step mechanisms, showing that plausible novel mechanisms for catalysis\ncan be constructed computationally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2021 17:06:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Mar 2021 13:02:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Andersen", "Jakob L.", ""], ["Fagerberg", "Rolf", ""], ["Flamm", "Christoph", ""], ["Fontana", "Walter", ""], ["Kol\u010d\u00e1k", "Juraj", ""], ["Laurent", "Christophe V.

To\ndetermine the relative contribution of each mode of infection to HCV\ndissemination, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) that explicitly\nincorporates both distal and local modes of infection. The ABM tracks the\nconcentration of extracellular infectious virus in the supernatant and the\nnumber of intracellular HCV RNA segments within each infected cell over the\ncourse of simulated in vitro HCV infections. Experimental data for in vitro HCV\ninfections conducted in the presence and absence of free-virus neutralizing\nantibodies was used to validate the ABM and constrain the value of its\nparameters. We found that direct, cell-to-cell infection accounts for 99%\n(84%$-$100%, 95% credible interval) of infection events, making it the dominant\nmode of HCV dissemination in vitro. Yet, when infection via the free-virus\nroute is blocked, a 57% reduction in the number of infection events at 72 hpi\nis observed experimentally; a result consistent with that found by our ABM.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that while HCV spread via cell-free\nvirus contributes little to the total number of infection events in vitro, it\nplays a critical role in enhancing cell-to-cell HCV dissemination by providing\naccess to distant, uninfected areas, away from the already established large\ninfection foci.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:21:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Blahut", "Kenneth", ""], ["Quirouette", "Christian", ""], ["Feld", "Jordan J.", ""], ["Iwami", "Shingo", ""], ["Beauchemin", "Catherine A.

ECG-derived FHR\nwas digitized at the sampling rate of 1000 Hz and resampled to 4Hz, as used in\nclinical routine. We focused on four FHR variability features which are tunable\nto temporal scales of FHR dynamics, robustly computable from FHR sampled at\n$4$Hz and within short-time sliding windows, hence permitting a time-dependent,\nor local, analysis of FHR which helps dealing with signal noise. Results show\nthe sensitivity of the proposed features for early detection of CVD,\ncorrelation to metabolites and pH, useful for early acidosis detection and the\nimportance of coarse time scales (2.5 to 8 seconds) which are not disturbed by\nthe low FHR sampling rate. Further, we introduce the performance of an\nindividualized self-referencing metric of the distance to healthy state, based\non a combination of the four features. We demonstrate that this novel metric,\napplied to clinically available FHR temporal dynamics alone, accurately\npredicts the time occurrence of CVD which heralds a clinically significant\ndegradation of the fetal health reserve to tolerate the trial of labor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Feb 2021 09:39:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Roux", "St\u00e9phane G.", ""], ["Garnier", "Nicolas B.", ""], ["Abry", "Patrice", ""], ["Gold", "Nathan", ""], ["Frasch", "Martin G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.08213", "submitter": "Edilson Arruda", "authors": "Edilson F.

However, the systematic structural recognition and recovery of\nmacromolecules captured by cryo-ET are difficult due to high structural\ncomplexity and imaging limits. Deep learning based subtomogram classification\nhave played critical roles for such tasks. As supervised approaches, however,\ntheir performance relies on sufficient and laborious annotation on a large\ntraining dataset.\n  Results: To alleviate this major labeling burden, we proposed a Hybrid Active\nLearning (HAL) framework for querying subtomograms for labelling from a large\nunlabeled subtomogram pool. Firstly, HAL adopts uncertainty sampling to select\nthe subtomograms that have the most uncertain predictions. Moreover, to\nmitigate the sampling bias caused by such strategy, a discriminator is\nintroduced to judge if a certain subtomogram is labeled or unlabeled and\nsubsequently the model queries the subtomogram that have higher probabilities\nto be unlabeled. Additionally, HAL introduces a subset sampling strategy to\nimprove the diversity of the query set, so that the information overlap is\ndecreased between the queried batches and the algorithmic efficiency is\nimproved. Our experiments on subtomogram classification tasks using both\nsimulated and real data demonstrate that we can achieve comparable testing\nperformance (on average only 3% accuracy drop) by using less than 30% of the\nlabeled subtomograms, which shows a very promising result for subtomogram\nclassification task with limited labeling resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 03:10:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2021 17:21:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Du", "Xuefeng", ""], ["Wang", "Haohan", ""], ["Zhu", "Zhenxi", ""], ["Zeng", "Xiangrui", ""], ["Chang", "Yi-Wei", ""], ["Zhang", "Jing", ""], ["Xu", "Min", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.12374", "submitter": "Kasey Laurent", "authors": "Kasey M.

Further\napplication to longitudinal data revealed two distinct progression pathways:\nP1$\\rightarrow$P2$\\rightarrow$P4 and P1$\\rightarrow$P3$\\rightarrow$P4.

While few studies\nemployed deep-learning in a mixed low/high grade glioma population, a\nGBM-specific model is still lacking in the literature. Our objective was to\ndevelop a deep-learning model for IDH prediction in GBM by using Convoluted\nNeural Networks (CNN) on multiparametric MRI. Methods: We included 100 adult\npatients with pathologically proven GBM and IDH testing. MRI data included:\nmorphologic sequences, rCBV and ADC maps. Tumor area was obtained by a bounding\nbox function on the axial slice with widest tumor extension on T2 images and\nwas projected on every sequence. Data was split into training and test (80:20)\nsets. A 4 block 2D - CNN architecture was implemented for IDH prediction on\nevery MRI sequence. IDH mutation probability was calculated with softmax\nactivation function from the last dense layer. Highest performance was\ncalculated accounting for model accuracy and categorical cross-entropy loss\n(CCEL) in the test cohort. Results: Our model achieved the following\nperformance: T1 (accuracy 77%, CCEL 1.4), T2 (accuracy 67%, CCEL 2.41), FLAIR\n(accuracy 77%, CCEL 1.98), MPRAGE (accuracy 66%, CCEL 2.55), rCBV (accuracy\n83%, CCEL 0.64). ADC achieved lower performance. Conclusion: We built a\nGBM-tailored deep-learning model for IDH mutation prediction, achieving\naccuracy of 83% with rCBV maps. High predictivity of perfusion images may\nreflect the known correlation between IDH, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and\nneoangiogenesis. This model may set a path for non-invasive evaluation of IDH\nmutation in GBM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:09:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Pasquini", "Luca", ""], ["Napolitano", "Antonio", ""], ["Tagliente", "Emanuela", ""], ["Dellepiane", "Francesco", ""], ["Lucignani", "Martina", ""], ["Vidiri", "Antonello", ""], ["Ranazzi", "Giulio", ""], ["Stoppacciaro", "Antonella", ""], ["Moltoni", "Giulia", ""], ["Nicolai", "Matteo", ""], ["Romano", "Andrea", ""], ["Di Napoli", "Alberto", ""], ["Bozzao", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13278", "submitter": "Eric Lock", "authors": "Elise F.

However, existing methods\nthat do both are presently limited because they either (1) only consider data\nstructure shared by all datasets while ignoring structures unique to each\nsource, or (2) they extract underlying structures first without consideration\nto the outcome. We propose a method called supervised joint and individual\nvariation explained (sJIVE) that can simultaneously (1) identify shared (joint)\nand source-specific (individual) underlying structure and (2) build a linear\nprediction model for an outcome using these structures. These two components\nare weighted to compromise between explaining variation in the multi-source\ndata and in the outcome. Simulations show sJIVE to outperform existing methods\nwhen large amounts of noise are present in the multi-source data. An\napplication to data from the COPDGene study reveals gene expression and\nproteomic patterns that are predictive of lung function.
