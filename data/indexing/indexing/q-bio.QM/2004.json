Integrated information theory (IIT) (Oizumi et al.,\n2014) offers a quantitative account of causation based on a set of causal\nprinciples, including notions such as causal specificity, composition, and\nirreducibility, that challenges the reductionist perspective in multiple ways.\nFirst, the IIT formalism provides a complete account of a system's causal\nstructure, including irreducible higher-order mechanisms constituted of\nmultiple system elements. Second, a system's amount of integrated information\n($\\Phi$) measures the causal constraints a system exerts onto itself and can\npeak at a macro level of description (Hoel et al., 2016; Marshall et al.,\n2018). Finally, the causal principles of IIT can also be employed to identify\nand quantify the actual causes of events (\"what caused what\"), such as an\nagent's actions (Albantakis et al., 2019). Here, we demonstrate this framework\nby example of a simulated agent, equipped with a small neural network, that\nforms a maximum of $\\Phi$ at a macro scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:51:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Albantakis", "Larissa", ""], ["Massari", "Francesco", ""], ["Beheler-Amass", "Maggie", ""], ["Tononi", "Giulio", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00156", "submitter": "Dongya Jia", "authors": "Bin Huang, Mingyang Lu, Madeline Galbraith, Herbert Levine, Jose N.\n  Onuchic, Dongya Jia", "title": "Decoding the mechanisms underlying cell-fate decision-making during stem\n  cell differentiation by Random Circuit Perturbation", "comments": "28 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.CB q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Stem cells can precisely and robustly undergo cellular differentiation and\nlineage commitment, referred to as stemness.

To address this question, we applied a recently developed\ncomputational method, Random Circuit Perturbation (RACIPE), to a nine-component\ngene regulatory network (GRN) governing stemness, from which we identified\nfifteen robust gene states.

We propose that stem cell populations, instead of being viewed as\nall having a specific cellular state, can be regarded as a heterogeneous\nmixture including cells in various states. Upon perturbations by external\nsignals, stem cells lose the capacity to access certain cellular states,\nthereby becoming differentiated.

Building on the prior work on cough-based\ndiagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-powered screening solution for COVID-19 infection that is\ndeployable via a smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends\nthree 3-second cough sounds to an AI engine running in the cloud, and returns a\nresult within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom of over thirty\nnon-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19\ninfection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We\naddress this problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological\nalterations in the respiratory system induced by COVID-19 infection when\ncompared to other respiratory infections.

To reduce the misdiagnosis\nrisk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a\nmulti-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results\nshow AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among COVID-19 coughs and several types of\nnon-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage a\nlarge-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization\ncapability of AI4COVID-19.

The digital ecosystem represents a\nsetting where movement data, environmental layers, and analysis methods are\ndiscoverable and available for efficient storage, manipulation, and analysis.\nWe argue that such a system which will help mature the field of movement\necology by engendering collaboration, facilitating replication, expanding the\nspatiotemporal range of potential analyses, and limiting redundancy in method\ndevelopment.

This ignorance\nstems from the lack of objective, pragmatic approaches for measuring training\ndoses in rehabilitation activities. Here, to develop a measurement approach, we\ntook the critical first step of automatically identifying functional\nprimitives, the basic building block of activities. Forty-eight individuals\nwith chronic stroke performed a variety of rehabilitation activities while\nwearing inertial measurement units (IMUs) to capture upper body motion.\nPrimitives were identified by human labelers, who labeled and segmented the\nassociated IMU data. We performed automatic classification of these primitives\nusing machine learning. We designed a convolutional neural network model that\noutperformed existing methods. The model includes an initial module to compute\nseparate embeddings of different physical quantities in the sensor data. In\naddition, it replaces batch normalization (which performs normalization based\non statistics computed from the training data) with instance normalization\n(which uses statistics computed from the test data). This increases robustness\nto possible distributional shifts when applying the method to new patients.\nWith this approach, we attained an average classification accuracy of 70%.\nThus, using a combination of IMU-based motion capture and deep learning, we\nwere able to identify primitives automatically.

SPL values indicated improvement in postural performance over the\ntrial periods. Significant variation in absolute power values (ASP) was found\nin assessing postural adaptation: an increase in theta band ASP in the\nfrontal-central region for closed-eyes trials, an increase in theta and beta\nband ASP in the parietal region for open-eyes trials. In habituation, no\nsignificant variations in ASP were observed during closed-eyes trials, whereas\nan increase in theta, alpha, and beta band ASP was observed with open eyes.\nFurthermore, open-eyed trials generally yielded a greater number of significant\nASP differences across all bands during both adaptation and habituation,\nsuggesting that following cortical activity during postural perturbation may be\nup-regulated with the availability of visual feedback.

Diagnosis is commonly performed with\nmagnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Survival biomarkers are\nchallenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumour\ntypes, especially for rare tumour types such as atypical rhabdoid tumours.\n  Methods 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumours were recruited into\nthis study. All participants had both perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging\nperformed at diagnosis. Data were processed using conventional methods, and a\nBayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine\nlearning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel\nsub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand\ndifferences in imaging features, which pertain to survival.\n  Findings Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and\nperfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumours\nwith different survival characteristics (p <0.01), which were subsequently\nclassified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Further analysis of\nhigh-grade tumours showed a marked difference in survival (p=0.029) between the\ntwo clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.\n  Interpretation This study has developed a novel model of survival for\npaediatric brain tumours, with an implementation ready for integration into\nclinical practice.

We develop a mathematical model representing the cell as\na cylindrical pressure vessel and the cell wall as a fibre-reinforced viscous\nsheet, explicitly including the mechano-sensitive angle of CMF deposition. The\nmodel incorporates interactions between turgor, external forces, CMF\nreorientation during wall extension, and matrix stiffening. Using the model, we\nreinterpret some recent experimental findings, and reexamine the popular\nhypothesis of CMF/microtubule alignment. We explore how the handedness of\ntwisting cell growth depends on external torque and intrinsic wall properties,\nand find that cells twist left-handedly `by default' in some suitable sense.\nOverall, this study provides a unified mechanical framework for understanding\nleft- and right-handed twist-growth as seen in many plants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:48:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2021 09:27:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2021 17:16:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Jeevanjyoti", ""], ["Luo", "Jingxi", ""], ["Dyson", "Rosemary J", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.11372", "submitter": "Ajitesh Srivastava", "authors": "Ajitesh Srivastava, Viktor K.

However, it is common that the time series vital sign\ninformation from patients to be both sparse and irregularly collected, which\nposes a significant challenge for machine / deep learning techniques to analyze\nand facilitate the clinicians to improve the human health outcome. To deal with\nthis problem, We propose a novel deep interpolation network to extract latent\nrepresentations from sparse and irregularly sampled time-series vital signs\nmeasured within six hours of hospital admission. Methods: We created a\nsingle-center longitudinal dataset of electronic health record data for all\n(n=75,762) adult patient admissions to a tertiary care center lasting six hours\nor longer, using 55% of the dataset for training, 23% for validation, and 22%\nfor testing.

A deep interpolation network is proposed to learn from such irregular\nand sparse multivariate time series data to extract the fixed low-dimensional\nlatent patterns. We use k-means clustering algorithm to clusters the patient\nadmissions resulting into 7 clusters.

What is needed\nis near direct measurement of epidemic size by PCR and/or antibody testing of\nrandom samples of the at risk population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:46:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2020 12:43:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Wood", "Simon N.", ""], ["Wit", "Ernst C.", ""], ["Fasiolo", "Matteo", ""], ["Green", "Peter J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14580", "submitter": "Md Navid Akbar", "authors": "Md Navid Akbar, Marianna La Rocca, Rachael Garner, Dominique Duncan,\n  Deniz Erdo\\u{g}mu\\c{s}", "title": "Prediction of Epilepsy Development in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients\n  from Diffusion Weighted MRI", "comments": "2 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a life-long complication of traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI) and is a major public health problem that has an estimated\nincidence that ranges from 2%-50%, depending on the severity of the TBI.\nCurrently, the pathomechanism that in-duces epileptogenesis in TBI patients is\nunclear, and one of the most challenging goals in the epilepsy community is to\npredict which TBI patients will develop epilepsy.

RT-PCR (reverse\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction) tests are accurate but costly, making\nregular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for\nall countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be\nachieved by combining samples and testing them in groups. We propose an\nalgorithm for grouping subsamples, prior to testing, based on the geometry of a\nhypercube. At low prevalence, this testing procedure uniquely identifies\ninfected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group\nsize and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease,\nparallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in\nwhich a positive sample was detected even when diluted a hundred-fold with\nnegative samples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be\nreduced by a factor of ten to a hundred or more. If infected individuals are\nquickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the\ncosts of regularly testing everyone.
