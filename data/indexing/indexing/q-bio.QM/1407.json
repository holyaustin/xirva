The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good\nmatch for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling\nthe genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address\ninvolve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors.\nUnfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not\nan easy solution to apply.

The EEG source\nlocalization study was conducted with a simulated single active dipole, as well\nas with two spatially separated simultaneously active dipoles, as a function of\ndipole positions across the neocortex, with several different noise levels in\nthe EEG signals registered on the scalp. The results indicate that while the\nreconstruction accuracy and precision of the sLORETA method are consistently\nhigh in the case of a single active dipole, even with the low-resolution EEG\nconfigurations considered in the present study, successful localization is much\nmore problematic in the case of two simultaneously active dipoles. The\nquantitative analysis of the width of the reconstructed distributions of the\nelectrical activity allows us to specify the lower bound for the spatial\nresolution of the sLORETA-based 3D source localization in the considered cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 06:31:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sajib", ""], ["Nesterets", "Yakov I.", ""], ["Tahtali", "Murat", ""], ["Gureyev", "Timur E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8177", "submitter": "Jake Taylor-King", "authors": "Jake P.
