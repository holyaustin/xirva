In silico\ntreatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the\nbrain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and\npotential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external\nstimulation.

We show, for neural\nsystems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via\nexternal stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be\napplied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas\nadjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'.

In in\nvitro assays, JMV2009 exhibited high binding affinity for both NTS1 and NTS2,\nimproved proteolytic resistance as well as agonistic activities similar to NT,\ninducing sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK and receptor internalization.\nIntrathecal injection of JMV2009 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive\nresponses in the tail-flick test and almost completely abolished the\nnociceptive-related behaviors induced by chemical somatic and visceral noxious\nstimuli.

For instance, at a\nprevalence of up to 2%, Dorfman testing gives an efficiency gain of 3.5--8; at\n1% prevalence, Gibbs-Gower testing gives an efficiency gain of 18, even when\ncapping the pool size at a feasible number .\n  This note is intended as a helpful handbook for labs implementing group\ntesting methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 18:01:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2020 21:18:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Batson", "J.", ""], ["Bottman", "N.", ""], ["Cooper", "Y.", ""], ["Janda", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.03093", "submitter": "Marcus Kaiser", "authors": "Marcus Kaiser", "title": "Functional compensation after lesions: Predicting site and extent of\n  recovery", "comments": "Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In some cases, the function of a lesioned area can be compensated for by\nanother area.

A poor and highly variable grey matter and white matter contrast on\nT1-weighted MR scans of developing brains complicates the automatic\ncategorization of voxels into major tissue classes using state-of-the-art\nclassification methods (Partial Volume Estimation). Varying intensities across\nbrain tissues and possible tissue artifacts further contribute to\nmisclassification. In order to improve the accuracy of automatic detection of\nmajor tissue types and the cerebrospinal fluid in infant's brains within the\nage range from 10 days to 4.5 years, we propose a new classification method\nbased on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) for pattern recognition,\ncombined with an objective structural similarity index (SSIM) for perceptual\nimage quality assessment. The proposed method performs an optimal partitioning\nof the image domain into subdomains having different average intensity values\nand relatively homogeneous tissue intensity. In the KFDA-based framework, a\ncomplex non-linear structure of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal\nfluid intensity clusters in a 3D (T1W, T2W, PDW)-space is exploited to find an\naccurate classification. Based on Computer Vision hypothesis that the Human\nVisual System is an optimal structural information extractor, the SSIM finds a\nnew role in the evaluation of the quality of classification. A comparison with\nthe state-of-the-art Partial Volume Estimation method using the SSIM index\ndemonstrates superior performance of the local KFDA-based algorithm in low\ncontrast subdomains and more accurate detection of grey matter, white matter,\nand cerebrospinal fluid patterns in the brain volume.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2020 05:47:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Portman", "Nataliya", "", "Brain\n  Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal,\n  QC, Canada"], ["Toussaint", "Paule-J", "", "Brain\n  Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal,\n  QC, Canada"], ["McConnell", "Alan C.

In line with the large number of secondary\ninfections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the\nmodel includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious\nindividuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A\nBayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the\nrelevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new\ndata on the number of new infections and disease related death become\navailable. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate\nis dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of\nthe pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The\nsequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the\nuncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction\nnumber, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a\ndimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and\nsymptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the\nquantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that\nplays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we\napply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from\nseveral counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the\nproposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within\nboth states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the\nmitigation measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2020 05:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 17:21:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Calvetti", "Daniela", ""], ["Hoover", "Alexander", ""], ["Rose", "Johnie", ""], ["Somersalo", "Erkki", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.04954", "submitter": "Tatsuya Hayashi", "authors": "Tatsuya Hayashi and Atsuyoshi Nakamura", "title": "Propagation Graph Estimation by Pairwise Alignment of Time Series\n  Observation Sequences", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Various things propagate through the medium of individuals.

Although close\nmonitoring and dynamic assessment of patient acuity are key aspects of ICU\ncare, both are limited by the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers.\nMethods: Using the University of Florida Health (UFH) Integrated Data\nRepository as Honest Broker, we created a database with electronic health\nrecords data from a retrospective study cohort of 38,749 adult patients\nadmitted to ICU at UF Health between 06/01/2014 and 08/22/2019. This repository\nincludes demographic information, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory\nvalues, medications with date and timestamps, and diagnoses and procedure codes\nfor all index admission encounters as well as encounters within 12 months prior\nto index admission and 12 months follow-up. We developed algorithms to identify\nacuity status of the patient every four hours during each ICU stay. Results: We\nhad 383,193 encounters (121,800 unique patients) admitted to the hospital, and\n51,073 encounters (38,749 unique patients) with at least one ICU stay that\nlasted more than four hours. These patients requiring ICU admission had longer\nmedian hospital stay (7 days vs. 1 day) and higher in-hospital mortality (9.6%\nvs. 0.4%) compared with those not admitted to the ICU. Among patients who were\nadmitted to the ICU and expired during hospital admission, more deaths occurred\nin the ICU than on general hospital wards (7.4% vs. 0.8%, respectively).\nConclusions: We developed phenotyping algorithms that determined patient acuity\nstatus every four hours while admitted to the ICU.

To address this\nproblem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban\nsettings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the\npandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The\nsetting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2\ntransmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency\nof contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may\nchange over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an\nuninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other\ncommunities where the infection is present. To account for these important\naspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact\nbetween its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census\nand cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network,\nwhich can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation\nmeasures.

Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the\ninput is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of\nviral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load.\nWhile other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry\nobtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing, at\nclinically acceptable false positive or false negative rates. We also propose\ndesigns for pooling matrices that facilitate good prediction of the infected\nsamples while remaining practically viable. When testing $n$ samples out of\nwhich $k \\ll n$ are infected, our method needs only $O(k \\log n)$ tests when\nusing random binary pooling matrices, with high probability. However, we also\nuse deterministic binary pooling matrices based on combinatorial design ideas\nof Kirkman Triple Systems to balance between good reconstruction properties and\nmatrix sparsity for ease of pooling. In practice, we have observed the need for\nfewer tests with such matrices than with random pooling matrices. This makes\nTapestry capable of very large savings at low prevalence rates, while\nsimultaneously remaining viable even at prevalence rates as high as 9.5\\%.\nEmpirically we find that single-round Tapestry pooling improves over two-round\nDorfman pooling by almost a factor of 2 in the number of tests required. We\nvalidate Tapestry in simulations and wet lab experiments with oligomers in\nquantitative RT-PCR assays.

Specifically, in the\nadult cohort (n=10), percentage time in target range [70, 180] mg/dL improved\nfrom 77.6% to 80.9% with single-hormone control, and to $85.6\\%$ with\ndual-hormone control. In the adolescent cohort (n=10), percentage time in\ntarget range improved from 55.5% to 65.9% with single-hormone control, and to\n78.8% with dual-hormone control. In all scenarios, a significant decrease in\nhypoglycemia was observed.

This report outlines the\nrationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations\nand examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss\nlibrary supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as\nmaster equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run\ntransitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental\nsubdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and\nallows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and\nforecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as\navailable, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be\nweighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact\nof idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological\ndata, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to\noptimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are\nincluded. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed\npopulations will in future reports be extended to include compartments\nstructured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes\nrelevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such\ncompartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be\ncombined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,\ncould enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to\ndetailed epidemic modelling.

One promising route is to exploit the\nmolecular graph structure through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well\nknown that both atoms and bonds significantly affect the chemical properties of\na molecule, so an expressive model shall be able to exploit both node (atom)\nand edge (bond) information simultaneously. Guided by this observation, we\npresent Multi-View Graph Neural Network (MV-GNN), a multi-view message passing\narchitecture to enable more accurate predictions of molecular properties. In\nMV-GNN, we introduce a shared self-attentive readout component and disagreement\nloss to stabilize the training process. This readout component also renders the\nwhole architecture interpretable. We further boost the expressive power of\nMV-GNN by proposing a cross-dependent message passing scheme that enhances\ninformation communication of the two views, which results in the MV-GNN^cross\nvariant. Lastly, we theoretically justify the expressiveness of the two\nproposed models in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphism graphs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MV-GNN models achieve remarkably superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art models on a variety of challenging\nbenchmarks.

This\nscheme is called adaptive, because the composition of the pools at each stage\ndepends on results from previous stages, and nested because each pool is a\nsubset of a pool of the previous stage. Is the infection probability $p$ is not\nsmaller than $1-3^{-1/3}$ it is best to test each sample (no pooling).

This is the\nsame order as that of the cost of the optimal scheme, and the difference of\nthese costs is explicitly bounded.

Modeling patient-variable interactions as a bipartite\nnetwork, TC first extracts communities of co-expressing disease variables at\ndifferent stages of progression.

This work clusters trajectories across two types of layers: (a)\ntemporal, and (b) ranges of independent outcome variable (representative of\ndisease severity), both of which yield four distinct subtypes. The former\nsubtypes exhibit differences in progression of disease domains (Cognitive,\nMental Health etc.), whereas the latter subtypes exhibit different degrees of\nprogression, i.e., some remain mild, whereas others show significant\ndeterioration after 5 years. The TC approach is validated through statistical\nanalyses and consistency of the identified subtypes with medical literature.\nThis generalizable and robust method can easily be extended to other\nprogressive multi-variate disease datasets, and can effectively assist in\ntargeted subtype-specific treatment in the field of personalized medicine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 09:44:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:12:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnagopal", "Sanjukta", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.14669", "submitter": "Guo-Wei Wei", "authors": "Jiahui Chen, Rui Wang, Menglun Wang, and Guo-Wei Wei", "title": "Mutations strengthened SARS-CoV-2 infectivity", "comments": "24 pages, 2 tables and 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is a\nmajor concern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and economic\nreopening.
