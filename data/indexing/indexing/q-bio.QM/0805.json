OR) operator only. The main results of this\npaper describe network dynamics in terms of the structure of the network\ndependency graph (topology). For a given such network, all possible limit cycle\nlengths are computed and lower and upper bounds for the number of cycles of\neach length are given. In particular, the exact number of fixed points is\nobtained. The bounds are in terms of structural features of the dependency\ngraph and its partially ordered set of strongly connected components.
