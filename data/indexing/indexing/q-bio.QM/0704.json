Materials and methods: We have used\nmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds of\nindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonal\npopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logistic\nequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among different\nclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rate\nof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of their\noffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclones\ndid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggesting\nthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observed\ndistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic model\nassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successive\ncell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,\nwe have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average number\nof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observed\ndistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria were\nrendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonal\ngrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cell\npopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate.

We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning\nsystem that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes\navailable. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread\nmachine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection\nand combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with\nthe incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable\nas a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the\nG-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%.

The aim of the study presented\nis twofold: On the one hand, the evaluation of the influence of polarization\nand diffuse functions in the basis set, distinguishing between those placed at\n1st-row atoms and those placed at hydrogens, as well as the effect of different\ncontraction and valence splitting schemes. On the other hand, the investigation\nof the heterolevel assumption, which is defined here to be that which states\nthat heterolevel MCs are more efficient than homolevel MCs. The heterolevel\napproximation is very commonly used in the literature, but it is seldom\nchecked. As far as we know, the only tests for peptides or related systems,\nhave been performed using a small number of conformers, and this is the first\ntime that this potentially very economical approximation is tested in full\nPESs.
