However, because this approach attempts\nto identify any non-trivial relationship no matter how weak, it often\nidentifies too many relationships to be useful. What is needed is a way of\nidentifying a smaller set of relationships that merit detailed further\nanalysis.\n  Here we formally present and characterize equitability, a property of\nmeasures of dependence that aims to overcome this challenge. Notionally, an\nequitable statistic is a statistic that, given some measure of noise, assigns\nsimilar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types [Reshef et al.\n2011]. We begin by formalizing this idea via a new object called the\ninterpretable interval, which functions as an interval estimate of the amount\nof noise in a relationship of unknown type. We define an equitable statistic as\none with small interpretable intervals.\n  We then draw on the equivalence of interval estimation and hypothesis testing\nto show that under moderate assumptions an equitable statistic is one that\nyields well powered tests for distinguishing not only between trivial and\nnon-trivial relationships of all kinds but also between non-trivial\nrelationships of different strengths. This means that equitability allows us to\nspecify a threshold relationship strength $x_0$ and to search for relationships\nof all kinds with strength greater than $x_0$. Thus, equitability can be\nthought of as a strengthening of power against independence that enables\nfruitful analysis of data sets with a small number of strong, interesting\nrelationships and a large number of weaker ones.

A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of\ndependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for\nfollow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the\npopulation value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.\n2011], as a canonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information, and as the supremum of\nan infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of\nthe marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then\nintroduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a\ntrivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful\nindependence testing rather than equitability.\n  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power\nagainst independence respectively.

[2015a]: MICe, which\nhas equitability as its primary goal, and TICe, which has power against\nindependence as its goal. Regarding equitability, our analysis finds that MICe\nis the most equitable method on functional relationships in most of the\nsettings we considered, although mutual information estimation proves the most\nequitable at large sample sizes in some specific settings. Regarding power\nagainst independence, we find that TICe, along with Heller and Gorfine's S^DDP,\nis the state of the art on the relationships we tested. Our analyses also show\na trade-off between power against independence and equitability consistent with\nthe theory in Reshef et al. [2015b].

When k = 1, this\nmethod is equivalent to computing IF using the average of all voxel activities\nin each RSN. For k greater than one our method calculates the k-multivariate IF\nbetween the different RSNs. We find that the average IF among RSNs is\ndimension-dependent, increasing from k =1 (i.e., the average voxels activity)\nup to a maximum occurring at k =5 to finally decay to zero for k greater than\n10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to 5) is sufficient\nto describe the IF pattern between RSNs. Our method - addressing differences in\nIF between RSNs for any generic data - can be used for group comparison in\nhealth or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the interRSNs IF in a\ndataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to find that the most significant\ndifferences between AD and controls occurred for k =2, in addition to AD\nshowing increased IF w.r.t. controls.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2015 21:45:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Diez", "Ibai", ""], ["Erramuzpe", "Asier", ""], ["Escudero", "Inaki", ""], ["Mateos", "Beatriz", ""], ["Cabrera", "Alberto", ""], ["Marinazzo", "Daniele", ""], ["Sanz-Arigita", "Ernesto J.", ""], ["Stramaglia", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Cortes", "Jesus M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.03705", "submitter": "Thomas Risler", "authors": "Johannes Baumgart, Andrei S.

Single molecule experiments have demonstrated that the unwinding\nvelocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the\nexternal force, while others show little response.

However, low-order Markov models may not\naccurately represent the underlying biology. For example, specifying a\n(time-independent) first-order Markov process assumes that the dwell time in\neach state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric\ndistribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. Specifying\ntime-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional flexibility, but\nat the expense of a potentially significant number of additional model\nparameters.
