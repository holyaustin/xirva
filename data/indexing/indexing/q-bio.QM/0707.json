A gene index was defined and analysed after the\ncollection of over 48,785 high quality sequences. Partial cDNA sequences were\nobtained from an embryonic head and retina library (30,272 sequences) and from\na metamorphic brain and spinal cord library (27,602 sequences).

Further\nannotation included Gene Ontology functional classification, InterPro domain\nanalysis, alternative splicing and non-coding RNA identification.

Moreover, these ESTs allowed\nidentification of a set of 225 polymorphic microsatellites that can be used as\ngenetic markers.

In particular, RNA secondary structures\nare 2-noncrossing RNA structures. In this paper we prove a central and a local\nlimit theorem for the distribution of the numbers of 3-noncrossing RNA\nstructures over n nucleotides with exactly h bonds. We will build on the\nresults of \\cite{Reidys:07rna1} and \\cite{Reidys:07rna2}, where the generating\nfunction of k-noncrossing RNA pseudoknot structures and the asymptotics for its\ncoefficients have been derived. The results of this paper explain the findings\non the numbers of arcs of RNA secondary structures obtained by molecular\nfolding algorithms and predict the distributions for k-noncrossing RNA folding\nalgorithms which are currently being developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jul 2007 09:27:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2007 03:34:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Emma Y.", ""], ["Reidys", "Christian M.", ""]]}]
