Our approach extends the method of maximum entropy to\nuse measurement scale as a type of information constraint. We argue that a very\ncommon measurement scale is linear at small magnitudes grading into logarithmic\nat large magnitudes, leading to observations that often follow Student's\nprobability distribution which has a Gaussian shape for small fluctuations from\nthe mean and a power law shape for large fluctuations from the mean. An inverse\nscaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to\nlinear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observations\nthat often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a\npower law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large\nmagnitudes. The two measurement scales are natural inverses connected by the\nLaplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling\npatterns commonly found in nature. We also show that superstatistics is a\nspecial case of an integral transform, and thus can be understood as a\nparticular way in which to change the scale of measurement. Incorporating\ninformation about measurement scale into maximum entropy provides a general\napproach to the relations between measurement, information and probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 22:49:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""], ["Smith", "D.

A number of alternative procedures have been developed, including\nplug-in procedures that aim at gaining power by incorporating an estimate of\nthe proportion of true null hypotheses. In this paper, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of a class of plug-in procedures based on kernel estimators of the\ndensity of the $p$-values, as the number $m$ of tested hypotheses grows to\ninfinity. In a setting where the hypotheses tested are independent, we prove\nthat these procedures are asymptotically more powerful in two respects: (i) a\ntighter asymptotic FDR control for any target FDR level and (ii) a broader\nrange of target levels yielding positive asymptotic power. We also show that\nthis increased asymptotic power comes at the price of slower, non-parametric\nconvergence rates for the FDP.

We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks\n(MLNs), as a framework for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical\nanalysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we have been able to\nreplicate the results of traditional statistical methods. Moreover, we show\nthat even with simple models we are able to go beyond finding independent\nmarkers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference that avoids an\nindependence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast\nsporulation, a phenotype governed by non-linear gene interactions. In addition\nto detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation,\nour method is able to identify four loci with small effects. Since their effect\non sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do\nnot account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions.

Here, using an\nadvection-reaction-diffusion model, we investigate the distribution and\ncompetition of phytoplankton species in a water column, in which inverse\nresource gradients of light and a nutrient can limit growth of the biomass.\nThis problem poses a challenge for ecologists, as the location of a production\nlayer is not fixed, but rather depends on many internal parameters and\nenvironmental factors. In particular, we study the influence of an upper mixed\nlayer (UML) in this system and show that it leads to a variety of dynamic\neffects: (i) Our model predicts alternative density profiles with a maximum of\nbiomass either within or below the UML, thereby the system may be bistable or\nthe relaxation from an unstable state may require a long-lasting transition.\n(ii) Reduced mixing in the deep layer can induce oscillations of the biomass;\nwe show that a UML can sustain these oscillations even if the diffusivity is\nless than the critical mixing for a sinking phytoplankton population. (iii) A\nUML can strongly modify the outcome of competition between different\nphytoplankton species, yielding bistability both in the spatial distribution\nand in the species composition.

We present the \\emph{a\npriori} folding algorithm \\texttt{ripalign}, whose input consists of two\n(given) multiple sequence alignments (MSA). \\texttt{ripalign} outputs (1) the\npartition function, (2) base-pairing probabilities, (3) hybrid probabilities\nand (4) a set of Boltzmann-sampled suboptimal structures consisting of\ncanonical joint structures that are compatible to the alignments. Compared to\nthe single sequence-pair folding algorithm \\texttt{rip}, \\texttt{ripalign}\nrequires negligible additional memory resource. Furthermore, we incorporate\npossible structure constraints as input parameters into our algorithm. The\nalgorithm described here is implemented in C as part of the \\texttt{rip}\npackage.

These\nrecommendations have paved the way for the measurement of nitric oxide to\nbecome a diagnostic tool for specific clinical applications. It would be\ndesirable to develop similar guidelines for the sampling of other trace gases\nin exhaled breath, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which reflect\nongoing metabolism. The concentrations of water-soluble, blood-borne substances\nin exhaled breath are influenced by: (i) breathing patterns affecting gas\nexchange in the conducting airways; (ii) the concentrations in the\ntracheo-bronchial lining fluid; (iii) the alveolar and systemic concentrations\nof the compound. The classical Farhi equation takes only the alveolar\nconcentrations into account. Real-time measurements of acetone in end-tidal\nbreath under an ergometer challenge show characteristics which cannot be\nexplained within the Farhi setting. Here we develop a compartment model that\nreliably captures these profiles and is capable of relating breath to the\nsystemic concentrations of acetone. By comparison with experimental data it is\ninferred that the major part of variability in breath acetone concentrations\n(e.g., in response to moderate exercise or altered breathing patterns) can be\nattributed to airway gas exchange, with minimal changes of the underlying blood\nand tissue concentrations. Moreover, it is deduced that measured end-tidal\nbreath concentrations of acetone determined during resting conditions and free\nbreathing will be rather poor indicators for endogenous levels. Particularly,\nthe current formulation includes the classical Farhi and the Scheid series\ninhomogeneity model as special limiting cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2010 17:26:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2010 16:34:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 27 Jan 2011 10:02:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Julian", ""], ["Unterkofler", "Karl", ""], ["Teschl", "Gerald", ""], ["Teschl", "Susanne", ""], ["Koc", "Helin", ""], ["Hinterhuber", "Hartmann", ""], ["Amann", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5535", "submitter": "Max Little", "authors": "Max A.

During fly development in early\nDrosophila embryos, the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient is established within\nthe first hour after fertilization. Bcd acts as a transcription factor,\ninitiating the expression of a cascade of genes that determine the segmentation\npattern of the embryo, which serves as a blueprint for the future adult\norganism. A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this\nsegmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative\nmeasurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual\nplayers of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a\nseries of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification\nusing Bcd as an example. We describe the generation of a transgenic fly line\nexpressing a Bcd-eGFP fusion protein, and we use this line to carefully analyze\nthe Bcd concentration dynamics and to measure absolute Bcd expression levels in\nliving fly embryos using two-photon microscopy. These experiments have proven\nto be a fruitful tool generating new insights into the mechanisms that lead to\nthe establishment and the readout of the Bcd gradient. Generalization of these\nmethods to other genes in the Drosophila segmentation cascade is\nstraightforward and should further our understanding of the early patterning\nprocesses and the architecture of the underlying genetic network structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2010 15:29:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Apr 2010 13:21:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 13:37:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dubuis", "Julien", ""], ["Morrison", "Alexander H", ""], ["Scheeler", "Martin", ""], ["Gregor", "Thomas", ""]]}]
