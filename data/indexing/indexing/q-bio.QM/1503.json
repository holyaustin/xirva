The elastic object is\nrepresented as a Lagrangian structure, exerting point forces on the fluid. The\nforces on the structure are often determined by a bending or tension model,\npreviously calculated using finite difference approximations. In this paper, we\nstudy Spherical Basis Function (SBF), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and\nLagrange-Chebyshev parametric models to represent and calculate forces on\nelastic structures that can be represented by an open curve, motivated by the\nstudy of cilia and flagella. The evaluation error for static open curves for\nthe different interpolants, as well as errors for calculating normals and\nsecond derivatives using different types of clustered parametric nodes, are\ngiven for the case of an open planar curve. We determine that SBF and RBF\ninterpolants built on clustered nodes are competitive with Lagrange-Chebyshev\ninterpolants for modeling twice-differentiable open planar curves. We propose\nusing SBF and RBF parametric models within the MRS for evaluating and updating\nthe elastic structure.

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that\nthe diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,\nthe buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous\nstudies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which\nalternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case\nin mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these\nprolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy\ncost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare\nthem with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into\naccount the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion\ntransformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the\ncorresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them\nwith observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through\nneutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the\npresence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the\nbuoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy\ncost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,\n2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the\nenergy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model\nconfirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other\nbreath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for\nexample). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of\noptimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings\n(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal\nspeed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can\nbe further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers\nclose to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for\nthe observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive\nenergy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a\nreduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:52:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 14:55:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 09:39:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 12:40:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Trassinelli", "Martino", "", "INSP"]]}, {"id": "1503.03373", "submitter": "Arni S.R.

While these alterations are believed to converge on genes in key\ncellular signaling and regulatory pathways, our knowledge of these pathways\nremains incomplete, making it difficult to identify driver alterations by their\nrecurrence across genes or known pathways. We introduce Combinations of\nMutually Exclusive Alterations (CoMEt), an algorithm to identify combinations\nof alterations de novo, without any prior biological knowledge (e.g. pathways\nor protein interactions). CoMEt searches for combinations of mutations that\nexhibit mutual exclusivity, a pattern expected for mutations in pathways. CoMEt\nhas several important feature that distinguish it from existing approaches to\nanalyze mutual exclusivity among alterations. These include: an exact\nstatistical test for mutual exclusivity that is more sensitive in detecting\ncombinations containing rare alterations; simultaneous identification of\ncollections of one or more combinations of mutually exclusive alterations;\nsimultaneous analysis of subtype-specific mutations; and summarization over an\nensemble of collections of mutually exclusive alterations. These features\nenable CoMEt to robustly identify alterations affecting multiple pathways, or\nhallmarks of cancer. We show that CoMEt outperforms existing approaches on\nsimulated and real data. Application of CoMEt to hundreds of samples from four\ndifferent cancer types from TCGA reveals multiple mutually exclusive sets\nwithin each cancer type. Many of these overlap known pathways, but others\nreveal novel putative cancer genes. *Equal contribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 20:39:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Leiserson", "Mark D.

In this manuscript, we show that\npatient-to-patient variability sets a fundamental limit on outcome prediction\naccuracy for a general class of mathematical models for the immune response to\ninfection. However, accuracy can be increased at the expense of delayed\nprognosis. We investigate several systems of ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) that model the host immune response to a pathogen load. Advantages of\nsystems of ODEs for investigating the immune response to infection include the\nability to collect data on large numbers of `virtual patients', each with a\ngiven set of model parameters, and obtain many time points during the course of\nthe infection. We implement patient-to-patient variability $v$ in the ODE\nmodels by randomly selecting the model parameters from Gaussian distributions\nwith variance $v$ that are centered on physiological values. We use logistic\nregression with one-versus-all classification to predict the discrete\nsteady-state outcomes of the system. We find that the prediction algorithm\nachieves near $100\\%$ accuracy for $v=0$, and the accuracy decreases with\nincreasing $v$ for all ODE models studied. The fact that multiple steady-state\noutcomes can be obtained for a given initial condition, i.e. the basins of\nattraction overlap in the space of initial conditions, limits the prediction\naccuracy for $v>0$. Increasing the elapsed time of the variables used to train\nand test the classifier, increases the prediction accuracy, while adding\nexplicit external noise to the ODE models decreases the prediction accuracy.\nOur results quantify the competition between early prognosis and high\nprediction accuracy that is frequently encountered by clinicians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Mar 2015 16:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mai", "Manuel", ""], ["Wang", "Kun", ""], ["Huber", "Greg", ""], ["Kirby", "Michael", ""], ["Shattuck", "Mark D.", ""], ["O'Hern", "Corey S.", ""]]}]
