Reducing the spatial coverage to the DGM\nvicinity can substantially shorten the scan time or enhance the spatial\nresolution without increasing scan time; however, this may lead to significant\nDGM susceptibility underestimation. Method: A recently proposed deep\nlearning-based QSM method, namely xQSM, is investigated to assess the accuracy\nof dipole inversion on reduced brain coverages. Pre-processed magnetic field\nmaps are extended symmetrically from the centre of globus pallidus in the\ncoronal plane to simulate QSM acquisitions of difference spatial\ncoverages.Results: The proposed xQSM network led to the lowest DGM contrast\nlost with the smallest susceptibility variation range across all spatial\ncoverages. For the digital brain phantom simulation, xQSM improved the DGM\nsusceptibility underestimation more than 20% in small spatial coverages. For\nthe in vivo acquisition, less than 5% DGM susceptibility error was achieved in\n48 mm axial slabs using the xQSM network, while a minimum of 112 mm coverage\nwas required for conventional methods. It is also shown that the background\nfield removal process performed worse in reduced brain coverages, which further\ndeteriorated the subsequent dipole inversion. Conclusion: The recently proposed\ndeep learning-based xQSM method significantly improves the accuracy of DGM QSM\nfrom small spatial coverages as compared with conventional QSM algorithms,\nwhich can shorten DGM QSM acquisition time substantially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Xuanyu", ""], ["Gao", "Yang", ""], ["Liu", "Feng", ""], ["Crozier", "Stuart", ""], ["Sun", "Hongfu", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.00628", "submitter": "Martin Frasch", "authors": "Martin G.

Simulation-based approaches are typically used to support design\nand Verification and Validation (V&V) of CPSs in several domains such as:\naerospace, defence, automotive, smart grid and healthcare. Accordingly, many\nsimulation-based tools are available, and this poses huge interoperability\nchallenges. To overcome them, in 2010 the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)\nwas proposed as an open standard to support both Model Exchange (ME) and\nCo-Simulation (CS). Models adhering to such a standard are called Functional\nMock-up Units (FMUs). FMUs play an essential role in defining complex CPSs\nthrough, e.g., the SSP standard. Simulation-based V&V of CPSs typically\nrequires exploring different scenarios (i.e., exogenous CPS input sequences),\nmany of them showing a shared prefix. Accordingly, the simulator state at the\nend of a shared prefix is saved and then restored and used as a start state for\nthe simulation of the next scenario. In this context, an important FMI feature\nis the capability to save and restore the internal FMU state on demand.\nUnfortunately, the implementation of this feature is not mandatory and it is\navailable only within some commercial software. This motivates developing such\na feature for open-source CPS simulation environments. In this paper, we focus\non JModelica, an open-source modelling and simulation environment for CPSs\ndefined in the Modelica language. We describe how we have endowed JModelica\nwith our open-source implementation of the FMI 2.0 functions to save and\nrestore internal states of FMUs for ME. Furthermore, we present results\nevaluating, through 934 benchmark models, correctness and efficiency of our\nextended JModelica. Our results show that simulation-based V&V is, on average,\n22 times faster with our get/set functionality than without it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 00:20:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sinisi", "Stefano", ""], ["Alimguzhin", "Vadim", ""], ["Mancini", "Toni", ""], ["Tronci", "Enrico", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.01455", "submitter": "Tobias Wenzel", "authors": "Anna Pryszlak, Tobias Wenzel, Kiley West Seitz, Falk Hildebrand, Ece\n  Kartal, Marco Raffaele Cosenza, Vladimir Benes, Peer Bork, Christoph Merten", "title": "Enrichment of gut microbiome strains for cultivation-free genome\n  sequencing using droplet microfluidics", "comments": "18 pages incl. references, 4 main figures and one supplementary\n  figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We report a droplet microfluidic method to target and sort individual cells\ndirectly from complex microbiome samples, and to prepare these cells for bulk\nwhole genome sequencing without cultivation.

Auto-regressive models,\nwhich usually construct graphs following sequential actions of adding nodes and\nedges at the atom-level, have made rapid progress in recent years. However,\nthese atom-level models ignore high-frequency subgraphs that not only capture\nthe regularities of atomic combination in molecules but also are often related\nto desired chemical properties. In this paper, we propose a method to\nautomatically discover such common substructures, which we call {\\em graph\npieces}, from given molecular graphs. Based on graph pieces, we leverage a\nvariational autoencoder to generate molecules in two phases: piece-level graph\ngeneration followed by bond completion. Experiments show that our graph piece\nvariational autoencoder achieves better performance over state-of-the-art\nbaselines on property optimization and constrained property optimization tasks\nwith higher computational efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 05:26:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kong", "Xiangzhe", ""], ["Tan", "Zhixing", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15365", "submitter": "Catharina Elisabeth Graafland", "authors": "Catharina Elisabeth Graafland and Jos\\'e Manuel Guti\\'errez", "title": "Learning complex dependency structure of gene regulatory networks from\n  high dimensional micro-array data with Gaussian Bayesian networks", "comments": "20 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Gene expression datasets consist of thousand of genes with relatively small\nsamplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various\norders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical\nModel (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high\ndimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its\nmodifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from\nmicro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the\nanalytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which\nboth directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.\n  We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC\nalgorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously\nmodelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting\nin the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model\nunnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the\nnetwork and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved\nincluding many parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:04:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Graafland", "Catharina Elisabeth", ""], ["Guti\u00e9rrez", "Jos\u00e9 Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15372", "submitter": "Lo\\\"ic Paulev\\'e", "authors": "Lo\\\"ic Paulev\\'e, Sylvain Sen\\'e", "title": "Non-deterministic updates of Boolean networks", "comments": "Accepted at AUTOMATA 2021", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.4230/OASIcs.AUTOMATA.2021.10", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS cs.FL q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Boolean networks are discrete dynamical systems where each automaton has its\nown Boolean function for computing its state according to the configuration of\nthe network. The updating mode then determines how the configuration of the\nnetwork evolves over time. Many of updating modes from the literature,\nincluding synchronous and asynchronous modes, can be defined as the composition\nof elementary deterministic configuration updates, i.e., by functions mapping\nconfigurations of the network. Nevertheless, alternative dynamics have been\nintroduced using ad-hoc auxiliary objects, such as that resulting from binary\nprojections of Memory Boolean networks, or that resulting from additional\npseudo-states for Most Permissive Boolean networks. One may wonder whether\nthese latter dynamics can still be classified as updating modes of finite\nBoolean networks, or belong to a different class of dynamical systems. In this\npaper, we study the extension of updating modes to the composition of\nnon-deterministic updates, i.e., mapping sets of finite configurations. We show\nthat the above dynamics can be expressed in this framework, enabling a better\nunderstanding of them as updating modes of Boolean networks. More generally, we\nargue that non-deterministic updates pave the way to a unifying framework for\nexpressing complex updating modes, some of them enabling transitions that\ncannot be computed with elementary and non-elementary deterministic updates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 12:57:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Paulev\u00e9", "Lo\u00efc", ""], ["Sen\u00e9", "Sylvain", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15733", "submitter": "Aritro Sinha Roy", "authors": "Aritro Sinha Roy", "title": "Optimal Background Correction in Double Quantum Coherence Electron Spin\n  Resonance Spectroscopy for Accurate Data Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM physics.chem-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electron spin resonance (ESR) pulsed dipolar spectroscopy (PDS) is used in\nprotein 3D structure determination.
