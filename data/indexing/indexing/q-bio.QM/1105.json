In this review, we investigate\nthe accuracy of constrained models at the level of the equilibrium statistical\nmechanics distributions produced by the different dynamics. We carefully derive\nthe canonical equilibrium distributions of both the constrained and\nunconstrained dynamics, comparing the two of them by means of a \"stiff\"\napproximation to the latter. We do so both in the case of flexible and hard\nconstraints, i.e., when the value of the constrained coordinates depends on the\nconformation and when it is a constant number. We obtain the different\ncorrecting terms associated with the kinetic energy mass-metric tensor\ndeterminants, but also with the details of the potential energy in the vicinity\nof the constrained subspace (encoded in its first and second derivatives). This\nallows us to directly compare, at the conformational level, how the imposition\nof constraints changes the thermal equilibrium of molecular systems with\nrespect to the unconstrained case. We also provide an extensive review of the\nrelevant literature, and we show that all models previously reported can be\nconsidered special cases of the most general treatments presented in this work.\nFinally, we numerically analyze a simple methanol molecule in order to\nillustrate the theoretical concepts in a practical case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 May 2011 16:25:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Echenique", "Pablo", ""], ["Cavasotto", "Claudio N.", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Risue\u00f1o", "Pablo", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.0780", "submitter": "Amparo Baillo", "authors": "Amparo Ba\\'illo, Laura Mart\\'inez-Mu\\~noz and Mario Mellado", "title": "Homogeneity tests for Michaelis-Menten curves with application to\n  fluorescence resonance energy transfer data", "comments": "26 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Resonance energy transfer methods are in wide use for evaluating\nprotein-protein interactions and protein conformational changes in living\ncells.

These models account for diffusion and self-induced degration of\nlocally produced chemical signals. When production starts, the signal\nconcentration is equal to zero throughout the system. We found that in the\nlimit of infinitely large signal production strength the solution of this\nproblem is given by the product of the steady state concentration profile and a\nfunction of the diffusion similarity variable. We derived a nonlinear boundary\nvalue problem satisfied by this function and used a variational approach to\nprove that this problem has a unique solution in a natural setting. Using the\nasymptotic behavior of the solutions established by the analysis, we\nconstructed these solutions numerically by the shooting method. Finally, we\ndemonstrated that the obtained solutions may be easily approximated by simple\nanalytical expressions, thus providing an accurate global characterization of\nthe dynamics in an important class of non-linear models of morphogen gradient\nformation. Our results illustrate the power of analytical approaches to\nstudying nonlinear models of biophysical processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2011 23:11:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Muratov", "Cyrill B.", ""], ["Gordon", "Peter V.", ""], ["Shvartsman", "Stanislav Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.3514", "submitter": "Joel Nishimura", "authors": "Joel Nishimura and Eric J.

For this purpose, we review various decision-theoretic\nframeworks, which have been proposed in the literature in relation to the\noptimisation of different aspects of the empirical distribution of a parameter\nensemble. This includes the constrained Bayes (CB), weighted-rank squared error\nloss (WRSEL), and triple-goal (GR) ensembles of point estimates. In addition,\nwe also consider the set of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the\nensemble of posterior means --the latter being optimal under the summed squared\nerror loss (SSEL). Firstly, we test the performance of these different sets of\npoint estimates as plug-in estimators for the empirical quantiles and empirical\nQR under a range of synthetic scenarios encompassing both spatial and\nnon-spatial simulated data sets. Performance evaluation is here conducted using\nthe posterior regret. Secondly, two threshold classification losses (TCLs)\n--weighted and unweighted-- are formulated and formally optimised.

A typical structure of\nthese islands consists in a macrophage (white cell) surrounded by immature\nerythroid cells (progenitors), with more mature cells on the periphery of the\nisland, ready to leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream. A hybrid\nmodel, coupling a continuous model (ordinary differential equations) describing\nintracellular regulation through competition of two key proteins, to a discrete\nspatial model describing cell-cell interactions, with growth factor diffusion\nin the medium described by a continuous model (partial differential equations),\nis proposed to investigate the role of the central macrophage in normal\nerythropoiesis. Intracellular competition of the two proteins leads the\nerythroid cell to either proliferation, differentiation, or death by apoptosis.\nThis approach allows considering spatial aspects of erythropoiesis, involved\nfor instance in the occurrence of cellular interactions or the access to\nexternal factors, as well as dynamics of intracellular and extracellular scales\nof this complex cellular process, accounting for stochasticity in cell cycle\ndurations and orientation of the mitotic spindle. The analysis of the model\nshows a strong effect of the central macrophage on the stability of an\nerythroblastic island, when assuming the macrophage releases pro-survival\ncytokines. Even though it is not clear whether or not erythroblastic island\nstability must be required, investigation of the model concludes that stability\nimproves responsiveness of the model, hence stressing out the potential\nrelevance of the central macrophage in normal erythropoiesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 May 2011 19:19:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fischer", "Stephan", "", "LIRIS / INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / INSA Lyon /\n  UCB Lyon"], ["Kurbatova", "Polina", "", "ICJ"], ["Bessonov", "Nikolai", "", "IPME"], ["Gandrillon", "Olivier", "", "ICJ"], ["Volpert", "Vitaly", "", "ICJ"], ["Crauste", "Fabien", "", "ICJ"]]}, {"id": "1105.5821", "submitter": "Anil Raj", "authors": "Anil Raj, Michael Dewar, Gustavo Palacios, Raul Rabadan and Chris H.\n  Wiggins", "title": "Identifying Hosts of Families of Viruses: A Machine Learning Approach", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0027631", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Identifying viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission is\nessential to developing effective public health measures in response to a\npandemic.
