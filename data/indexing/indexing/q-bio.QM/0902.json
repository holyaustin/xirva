Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are appropriate\nespecially in the case of conformational states that are hardly\ndistinguishable. However, the evolution of the conformational states of\nproteins mostly shows non-Markovian behavior, recognizable by\nnon-monoexponential state dwell time histograms. The application of a Hidden\nMarkov Model technique to a cyclic system demonstrating semi-Markovian dynamics\nis presented in this paper and the required extension of the model design is\ndiscussed. As standard ranking criteria of models cannot deal with these\nsystems properly, a new approach is proposed considering the shape of the dwell\ntime histograms. We observed the rotational kinetics of a single F1-ATPase\nalpha3beta3gamma sub-complex over six orders of magnitude of different ATP to\nADP and Pi concentration ratios, and established a general model describing the\nkinetics for the entire range of concentrations. The HMM extension described\nhere is applicable in general to the accurate analysis of protein dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 21:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kovalev", "A.", ""], ["Zarrabi", "N.", ""], ["Werz", "F.", ""], ["Boersch", "M.", ""], ["Ristic", "Z.", ""], ["Lill", "H.", ""], ["Bald", "D.", ""], ["Tietz", "C.", ""], ["Wrachtrup", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0847", "submitter": "Dean Gull", "authors": "C.

It can have immediate\nimplications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.\nBased on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful\nquantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S\nWright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology\nand by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by\nmainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found\nits increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the\nmodeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous\nnetwork of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe\nthe robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five\nlandmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important\ncommon thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few\nrecent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of\nadaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what\nneeded for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive\nlandscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an\nessential aspect of biological dynamical processes. Still, many important open\nproblems remain to be solved.
