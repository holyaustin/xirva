Here, we develop\na novel method that combines Linear Filtering (LF) and Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to infer host-virus associations. Using this method, we\nrecovered highly plausible undiscovered interactions with a strong signal of\nviral coevolutionary history, and revealed a global hotspot of unusually unique\nbut unsampled (or unrealized) host-virus interactions in the Amazon rainforest.\nWe finally show that graph embedding of the imputed network can be used to\nimprove predictions of human infection from viral genome features, showing that\nthe global structure of the mammal-virus network provides additional insights\ninto human disease emergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 14:00:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Poisot", "Timoth\u00e9e", ""], ["Ouellet", "Marie-Andr\u00e9e", ""], ["Mollentze", "Nardus", ""], ["Farrell", "Maxwell J.", ""], ["Becker", "Daniel J.", ""], ["Albery", "Gregory F.", ""], ["Gibb", "Rory J.", ""], ["Seifert", "Stephanie N.", ""], ["Carlson", "Colin J.", ""]]}]
