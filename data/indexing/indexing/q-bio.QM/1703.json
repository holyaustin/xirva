The rest is stored\nelsewhere, and calcium signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of\ninformation propagation in the body. Yet, many questions remain open. In this\nwork, we initially consider the mathematical model proposed in Atri et al.\n\\cite{ atri1993single}. Omitting diffusion, the model is a system of two\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the calcium concentration,\nand the fraction of $IP_3$ receptors that have not been inactivated by the\ncalcium. We analyse in detail the system as the $IP_3$ concentration, the\n\\textit{bifurcation parameter}, increases presenting some new insights. We\nanalyse asymptotically the relaxation oscillations of the model by exploiting a\nseparation of timescales. Furthermore, motivated by experimental evidence that\ncells release calcium when mechanically stimulated and that, in turn, calcium\nrelease affects the mechanical behaviour of cells, we propose an extension of\nthe Atri model to a 3D nonlinear ODE mechanochemical model, where the\nadditional equation, derived consistently from a full viscoelastic\n\\emph{ansatz}, models the evolution of cell/tissue dilatation. Furthermore, in\nthe calcium dynamics equation we introduce a new \"stretch-activation\" source\nterm that induces calcium release and which involves a new bifurcation\nparameter, the \"strength\" of the source. Varying the two bifurcation\nparameters, we analyse in detail the interplay of the mechanical and the\nchemical effects, and we find that as the strength of the mechanical stimulus\nis increased, the $IP_3$ parameter range for which oscillations emerge\ndecreases, until oscillations eventually vanish at a critical value. Finally,\nwe analyse the model when the calcium dynamics are assumed faster than the\ndynamics of the other two variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 22:57:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kaouri", "Katerina", ""], ["Maini", "Philip K.", ""], ["Chapman", "S.

In general, these algorithms require a high\ncomputational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the major challenges\nin phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal likelihood. This quantity is\ncommonly used for comparing different evolutionary models, but its calculation,\neven for simple models, incurs high computational cost. Another interesting\nchallenge relates to the estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long\nMarkov chains are required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter\ninference, especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are\naddressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS) is a\nBayesian computation algorithm which provides the means to estimate marginal\nlikelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to sample from the posterior\ndistribution at no extra cost. The methods currently used in phylogenetics for\nmarginal likelihood estimation lack in practicality due to their dependence on\nmany tuning parameters and the inability of most implementations to provide a\ndirect way to calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates. To\naddress these issues, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is\nassessed under different scenarios and compared to established methods.
