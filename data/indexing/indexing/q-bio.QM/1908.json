Methods: The U-Net convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture was adapted to learn pixelwise axon count density\nestimates, which were then integrated over the image area to determine axon\ncounts. The tool, termed AxoNet, was trained and evaluated using a dataset\ncontaining images of optic nerve regions randomly selected from complete cross\nsections of intact rat optic nerves and manually annotated for axon count and\nlocation. Both control and damaged optic nerves were used. This rat-trained\nnetwork was then applied to a separate dataset of non-human primate (NHP) optic\nnerve images. AxoNet was then compared to two existing automated axon counting\ntools, AxonMaster and AxonJ, using both datasets. Results: AxoNet outperformed\nthe existing tools on both the rat and NHP optic nerve datasets as judged by\nmean absolute error, R2 values when regressing automated vs. manual counts, and\nBland-Altman analysis. Conclusion: The proposed tool allows for accurate\nquantification of axon numbers as a measure of glaucomatous damage. AxoNet is\nrobust to variations in optic nerve tissue damage extent, image quality, and\nspecies of mammal. Significance: The deep learning method does not rely on\nhand-crafted image features for axon recognition. Therefore, this approach is\nnot species-specific and can be extended to quantify additional optic nerve\nfeatures.

We propose an\nefficient uncertainty quantification framework utilizing a multilevel\nmultifidelity Monte Carlo estimator to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic\nquantities of interest while maintaining reasonable computational cost. This is\nachieved by leveraging three cardiovascular model fidelities, each with varying\nspatial resolution to rigorously quantify the variability in hemodynamic\noutputs.

Our goal is to investigate and compare the efficiency of estimators\nbuilt from combinations of these low-fidelity and high-fidelity models.

We seek to demonstrate that for this application it is\npossible to accelerate the convergence of the estimators by utilizing a MLMF\nparadigm. Therefore, we compare our approach to Monte Carlo and multilevel\nMonte Carlo estimators based only on three-dimensional simulations. We\ndemonstrate significant reduction in total computational cost with the MLMF\nestimators. We also examine the differing properties of the MLMF estimators in\nhealthy versus diseased models, as well as global versus local quantities of\ninterest. As expected, global quantities and healthy models show larger\nreductions than local quantities and diseased model, as the latter rely more\nheavily on the highest fidelity model evaluations.

When IAV advection and\ndiffusion are both considered, the former is found to dominate infection\nkinetics, and a 10-fold increase in the virus production rate is required to\ncounter its effects. The MM predicts that advection prevents infection from\ndisseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Because virus is\nentrained upwards, the upper HRT sees the most virus, whereas the lower HRT\nsees far less. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than\nin the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the\nupper towards the lower HRT. When the spatial MM is expanded to include\ncellular regeneration and an immune response, it can capture the time course of\ninfection with a seasonal and an avian IAV strain by shifting parameters in a\nmanner consistent with what is expected to differ between these two types of\ninfection. The impact of antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors was\nalso investigated.

We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over\ntraditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We\nanticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types.\nMore generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and\nartificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as\nimage or pattern recognition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:00:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2019 18:58:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pichler", "Maximilian", ""], ["Boreux", "Virginie", ""], ["Klein", "Alexandra-Maria", ""], ["Schleuning", "Matthias", ""], ["Hartig", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.09993", "submitter": "Min Xu", "authors": "Ziqian Luo, Xiangrui Zeng, Zhipeng Bao, Min Xu", "title": "Deep Learning-Based Strategy for Macromolecules Classification with\n  Imbalanced Data from Cellular Electron Cryotomography", "comments": "13 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1710.09412,\n  arXiv:1710.05381, arXiv:1708.02002 by other authors", "journal-ref": "2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Deep learning model trained by imbalanced data may not work satisfactorily\nsince it could be determined by major classes and thus may ignore the classes\nwith small amount of data.

Subsurface irrigation can be an\nalternative to surface irrigation as a means of losing less irrigation water,\nbut the application timing and amount are often difficult to determine.\nWell-defined soil and crop models are useful for assisting decision support,\nbut most of the models developed to date have been for surface irrigation. The\npresent study examines whether the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\nTransfer (DSSAT, version 4.5) cropping system model is applicable for the\nproduction of processing tomatoes with subsurface irrigation, and it revises\nthe soil module to simulate irrigation schemes with subsurface irrigation. Five\nfarmed fields in California, USA, are used to test the performance of the\nmodel. The original DSSAT model fails to produce fruit yield by overestimating\nthe water deficiency. The soil water module is then revised by introducing the\nmovement of soil moisture due to a vertical soil moisture gradient. Moreover,\nan external parameter optimization system is constructed to minimize the error\nbetween the simulation and observations. The revised module reduces the errors\nin the soil moisture profile at each field compared to those by the original\nDSSAT model. The average soil moisture error decreases from 0.065m^3/m^3 to\n0.029m^3/m^3. The yields estimated by the modified model are in a reasonable\nrange from 80 to 150 ton/ha, which is commonly observed under well-managed\nconditions.

Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and\nlong short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and\nbreathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest\nrespiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in\ncombination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the best performance\nfor staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.600 (95% confidence\ninterval 0.599 -- 0.602); and 0.762 (0.760 -- 0.763) for discriminating awake\nvs. rapid eye movement vs. non-rapid eye movement sleep. The performance is\nbetter for young participants and for those with a low apnea-hypopnea index,\nwhile it is robust for commonly used outpatient medications.
