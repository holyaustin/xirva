This protocol can be applied to a large set of primary data: live,\nfixed or even paleobotanical material. For tissue reconstruction, we have also\ndeveloped a protocol of cell lineage tracing based on the geometrical\nproperties of plant cells. For the tissue sample consisting of $n$ cells, this\napproach allows the reconstruction of up to $n-1$ cell divisions from the\nprevious cell generations. Our protocol complements the limitations of clonal\nanalysis and recent real-time approaches of lineage tracing. It works well in\nthe case of tissues with directed and non-directed growth. Using these\nprotocols, the subcellular relations between the complex surface of plastids\nwith stromules and mitochondria in the tuber parenchyma cells in\n\\textit{Corydalis bracteata} have been revealed.

Three relatively independent cell lineages with stem cells\nlocated at the surface of the shoot apex have been found.

Taylor's power\nlaw (Taylor 1961: Nature, 189:732-) is well recognized as one of the\nfundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological\npopulations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal\nheterogeneity of population abundance distribution in habitat. Obviously, the\nheterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the\ndistributions of population abundances but also the proportions of the species\ncomposition in the community are often heterogeneous.

In data from\nArabidopsis thaliana and mouse, our method is able to find a genetic cause for\nsignificantly greater fractions of phenotype variation in 91% of the phenotypes\nconsidered. At the same time, our model dissects this variability into\ncomponents that result from individual SNP effects and population structure. In\naddition to this increase of genetic heritability, enrichment of known\ncandidate genes suggests that the associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are more\nlikely to be genuine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 05:43:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2012 12:52:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rakitsch", "Barbara", ""], ["Lippert", "Christoph", ""], ["Stegle", "Oliver", ""], ["Borgwardt", "Karsten", ""]]}]
