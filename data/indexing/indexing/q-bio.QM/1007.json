The dynamics of these games,\nmodeling cooperation dilemmas, is characterized by a coexistence fixed point\nseparating two absorbing states. We are particularly interested in the problem\nof fixation that refers to the possibility that a few mutants take over the\nentire population. Here, the fixation phenomenon is induced by large\nfluctuations and is investigated by a semi-classical WKB\n(Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) theory generalized to treat stochastic systems\npossessing multiple absorbing states. Importantly, this method allows us to\nanalyze the combined influence of selection and random fluctuations on the\nevolutionary dynamics \\textit{beyond} the weak selection limit often considered\nin previous works. We accurately compute, including pre-exponential factors,\nthe probability distribution function in the long-lived coexistence state and\nthe mean fixation time necessary for a few mutants to take over the entire\npopulation in anti-coordination games, and also the fixation probability in the\ncoordination class. Our analytical results compare excellently with extensive\nnumerical simulations.

Experiments demonstrate a high sensitivity of integrin\nsignaling to ligand density and this has been accounted mainly to avidity\neffects. Based on experimental data we have developed a quantitative Monte\nCarlo model for integrin signal initiation. We show that within the\nphysiological ligand density range avidity effects cannot explain the\nsensitivity of cellular signaling to small changes in ligand density. Src\nkinases are among the first proteins to be activated, possibly by trans\nauto-phosphorylation. We calculate the extent of integrin and ligand clustering\nas well as the speed and extent of Src kinase activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or direct binding at different experimentally monitored\nligand densities. We find that the experimentally observed ligand density\ndependency can be reproduced if Src kinases are activated by trans\nauto-phosphorylation or some other mechanism limits integrin-dependent Src\nkinase activation. We propose that Src kinase and thus cell activation by trans\nauto-phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enable ligand-density dependent\nresponses at physiological ligand densities.

Some argue that the specific form of the code with its twenty\namino-acids might be a 'frozen accident' because of the overwhelming effects of\nany further change. Others see it as a consequence of primordial biochemical\npathways and their evolution. Here we examine a scenario in which evolution\ndrives the emergence of a genetic code by selecting for an amino-acid map that\nminimizes the impact of errors. We treat the stochastic mapping of codons to\namino-acids as a noisy information channel with a natural fitness measure.\nOrganisms compete by the fitness of their codes and, as a result, a genetic\ncode emerges at a supercritical transition in the noisy channel, when the\nmapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom. At the phase transition, a\nsmall expansion is valid and the emergent code is governed by smooth modes of\nthe Laplacian of errors. These modes are in turn governed by the topology of\nthe error-graph, in which codons are connected if they are likely to be\nconfused. This topology sets an upper bound - which is related to the classical\nmap-coloring problem - on the number of possible amino-acids. The suggested\nscenario is generic and may describe a mechanism for the formation of other\nerror-prone biological codes, such as the recognition of DNA sites by proteins\nin the transcription regulatory network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 13:13:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Tlusty", "Tsvi", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4124", "submitter": "Tsvi Tlusty", "authors": "Tsvi Tlusty", "title": "A simple model for the evolution of molecular codes driven by the\n  interplay of accuracy, diversity and cost", "comments": "Keywords: molecular codes, rate-distortion theory, biological\n  information channels, stochastic maps, genetic code, genetic networks", "journal-ref": "Tsvi Tlusty 2008 Phys.
