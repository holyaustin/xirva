These elements structure the\nlinker between the RNAs' double aptamers. Chemical mapping on the F. nucleatum\nriboswitch with SHAPE, DMS, and CMCT probing, mutate-and-map studies, and\nmutation/rescue experiments all provide strong evidence for the structured\nlinker. Under solution conditions that separate two glycine binding\ntransitions, disrupting this helix-junction-helix structure gives 120-fold and\n6- to 30-fold poorer association constants for the two transitions,\ncorresponding to an overall energetic impact of 4.3 \\pm 0.5 kcal/mol.

For instance, using uncontrolled population-scale EHR data to verify the\noutcome of time dependent behavior of mechanistic, constructive models can be\ndifficult because: (i) aggregation of the population can obscure or generate a\nsignal, (ii) there is often no control population, and (iii) diversity in how\nthe population is measured can make the data difficult to fit into conventional\nanalysis techniques.

In these approaches, new composite features are typically constructed\nby aggregating the expression levels of several genes. The secondary data\nsources are employed to guide this aggregation. Although many studies claim\nthat these approaches improve classification performance over single gene\nclassifiers, the gain in performance is difficult to assess. This stems mainly\nfrom the fact that different breast cancer data sets and validation procedures\nare employed to assess the performance. Here we address these issues by\nemploying a large cohort of six breast cancer data sets as benchmark set and by\nperforming an unbiased evaluation of the classification accuracies of the\ndifferent approaches. Contrary to previous claims, we find that composite\nfeature classifiers do not outperform simple single gene classifiers.

Strikingly, we find that randomization of\nsecondary data sources, which destroys all biological information in these\nsources, does not result in a deterioration in performance of composite feature\nclassifiers. Finally, we show that when a proper correction for gene set size\nis performed, the stability of single gene sets is similar to the stability of\ncomposite feature sets.

It has long been\nsuggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at\ndifferent sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within\nthe tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to\ndisentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently\nintroduced Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (Weigt et al.

Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA,\nwhich allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a\nlarge number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is\nshown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating\nthe global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains\nexamined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intra- domain\nresidue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations,\nligand- mediated residue couplings, and inter-domain interactions in protein\noligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a\nreliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein\nconformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of\nprotein domain structures, provided the existence of a large number of\nhomologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in\ngenome sequencing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 13:10:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2011 11:26:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Morcos", "Faruck", ""], ["Pagnani", "Andrea", ""], ["Lunt", "Bryan", ""], ["Bertolino", "Arianna", ""], ["Marks", "Debora S.", ""], ["Sander", "Chris", ""], ["Zecchina", "Riccardo", ""], ["Onuchic", "Jose' N.", ""], ["Hwa", "Terence", ""], ["Weigt", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6044", "submitter": "Somdeb Ghose", "authors": "Soma Saha, Somdeb Ghose, R.
