This raises a fundamental biophysical question: to what extent can the\nwhole-cell behavior of a large metabolic network be controlled by constraining\nthe flux of one or more reactions in the network? This touches upon the issue\nof the number of degrees of freedom contained by one such network. Using the\nmetabolic network of Escherichia coli as a model system, here we address this\nquestion theoretically by exploring not only reaction deletions, but also a\ncontinuum of all possible reaction expression levels. We show that the behavior\nof the metabolic network can be largely manipulated by the pinned expression of\na single reaction. In particular, a relevant fraction of the metabolic\nreactions exhibits canalizing interactions, in that the specification of one\nreaction flux determines cellular growth as well as the fluxes of most other\nreactions in optimal steady states. The activity of individual reactions can\nthus be used as surrogates to monitor and possibly control cellular growth and\nother whole-cell behaviors. In addition to its implications for the study of\ncontrol processes, our methodology provides a new approach to study how the\nintegrated dynamics of the entire metabolic network emerges from the\ncoordinated behavior of its component parts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 21:27:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Dong-Hee", ""], ["Motter", "Adilson E.", ""]]}]
