We introduce\nquadratic programming approaches to the problem. To find an approximate\nsolution, we convert a density map into an overlapping matrix, which is\ngenerally indefinite. Since the matrix is indefinite, the optimization problem\nfor the corresponding quadratic form is non-convex.

In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques.

We go on to show that connecting\nindividuals due to shared membership of a group, a commonly used method, biases\ntowards assortativity unless a large enough number of censuses of the network\nare taken. We present a number of solutions to overcoming this bias by drawing\non advances in sociological and biological fields. Adoption of these methods\nacross all fields can greatly enhance our understanding of social networks and\nnetworks in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 16:08:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Fisher", "David N", ""], ["Silk", "Matthew J", ""], ["Franks", "Daniel W", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08673", "submitter": "Roland Langrock", "authors": "Jennifer Pohle and Roland Langrock and Floris van Beest and Niels\n  Martin Schmidt", "title": "Selecting the Number of States in Hidden Markov Models - Pitfalls,\n  Practical Challenges and Pragmatic Solutions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss the notorious problem of order selection in hidden Markov models,\ni.e. of selecting an adequate number of states, highlighting typical pitfalls\nand practical challenges arising when analyzing real data. Extensive\nsimulations are used to demonstrate the reasons that render order selection\nparticularly challenging in practice despite the conceptual simplicity of the\ntask. In particular, we demonstrate why well-established formal procedures for\nmodel selection, such as those based on standard information criteria, tend to\nfavor models with numbers of states that are undesirably large in situations\nwhere states shall be meaningful entities. We also offer a pragmatic\nstep-by-step approach together with comprehensive advice for how practitioners\ncan implement order selection. Our proposed strategy is illustrated with a\nreal-data case study on muskox movement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 16:11:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 19:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Pohle", "Jennifer", ""], ["Langrock", "Roland", ""], ["van Beest", "Floris", ""], ["Schmidt", "Niels Martin", ""]]}]
