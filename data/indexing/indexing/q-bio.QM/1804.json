The chapter\naddresses the construction of ergodic diffusions with stationary distributions\nequal to well-known directional distributions, which can be regarded as\ntoroidal analogues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The important challenges\nthat arise in the estimation of the diffusion parameters require the\nconsideration of tractable approximate likelihoods and, among the several\napproaches introduced, the one yielding a specific approximation to the\ntransition density of the wrapped normal process is shown to give the best\nempirical performance on average. This provides the methodological building\nblock for Evolutionary Torus Dynamic Bayesian Network (ETDBN), a hidden Markov\nmodel for protein evolution that emits a wrapped normal process and two\ncontinuous-time Markov chains per hidden state. The chapter describes the main\nfeatures of ETDBN, which allows for both \"smooth\" conformational changes and\n\"catastrophic\" conformational jumps, and several empirical benchmarks.

We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the\ntopological approach to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We\nthen study the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the novelty profile using\nbarcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary\nhistory can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree,\nwhich differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in\nthis regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the $1^\\mathrm{st}$ barcode\nyields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of\nrecombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty. In\naddition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones\nwhich hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish\nthese results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations\narising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step towards\na probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a\nfixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the\nintervals of the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ barcode are independent random variables.\nUsing simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to\nrecombination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 14:56:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:46:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lesnick", "Michael", ""], ["Rabad\u00e1n", "Ra\u00fal", ""], ["Rosenbloom", "Daniel I.

In Part I of this paper, we provide a unified\nframework for measuring, comparing and partitioning diversity that incorporates\nall of these aspects. A new principle called the Nesting Principle is\nestablished, stating that diversity remains invariant under arbitrary nesting\nor partitioning of the constituent categories or individual elements. An\nimportant consequence of this principle is that the weight on the category\nprevalence must be set such that the diversity function depends quadratically\non the relative abundances of categories, while the other weight on the\nbetween-category dissimilarity can be adjusted independently and continuously.\nThe resulting diversity index has a unique interpretation in terms of a certain\ncorrelation sum defined within the assemblage whose diversity is to be\nmeasured.

It is often solved with model\nconstruction in a controllable computational environment. In spite of that, the\nthroughput of in-silico simulation-based observations become similarly\nintractable for thorough analysis. This is especially the case in molecular\nbiology, which served as a subject for this study. In this project, we aimed to\ntest some approaches developed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Among\nthese we found dimension reduction techniques especially appealing. They can be\nused to identify irrelevant variability and help to understand critical\nprocesses underlying high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we subjected our\ndata sets to nonlinear time series analysis, as those are well established\nmethods for results comparison. To investigate the usefulness of dimension\nreduction methods, we decided to base our study on a concrete sample set. The\nexample was taken from the domain of systems biology concerning dynamic\nevolution of sub-cellular signaling. Particularly, the dataset relates to the\nyeast pheromone pathway and is studied in-silico with a stochastic model. The\nmodel reconstructs signal propagation stimulated by a mating pheromone. In the\npaper, we elaborate on the reason of multidimensional analysis problem in the\ncontext of molecular signaling, and next, we introduce the model of choice,\nsimulation details and obtained time series dynamics.

Multiscale modeling can benefit from both the\nexpressive power of declarative modeling languages and the application of model\nreduction methods to link models across scale.

There exists only a handful of methods which classify\npatients by viral load patterns. Most methods place limits on the use of viral\nload measurements, are often specific to a particular study design, and do not\naccount for complex, temporal variation. To address this issue, we propose a\nset of four unambiguous computable characteristics (features) of time-varying\nHIV viral load patterns, along with a novel centroid-based classification\nalgorithm, which we use to classify a population of 1,576 HIV positive clinic\npatients into one of five different viral load patterns (clusters) often found\nin the literature: durably suppressed viral load (DSVL), sustained low viral\nload (SLVL), sustained high viral load (SHVL), high viral load suppression\n(HVLS), and rebounding viral load (RVL). The centroid algorithm summarizes\nthese clusters in terms of their centroids and radii. We show that this allows\nnew viral load patterns to be assigned pattern membership based on the distance\nfrom the centroid relative to its radius, which we term radial normalization\nclassification. This method has the benefit of providing an objective and\nquantitative method to assign viral load pattern membership with a concise and\ninterpretable model that aids clinical decision making. This method also\nfacilitates meta-analyses by providing computably distinct HIV categories.\nFinally we propose that this novel centroid algorithm could also be useful in\nthe areas of cluster comparison for outcomes research and data reduction in\nmachine learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2018 22:40:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Farooq", "Samir", ""], ["Weisenthal", "Samuel J.", ""], ["Trayhan", "Melissa", ""], ["White", "Robert J.", ""], ["Bush", "Kristen", ""], ["Mariuz", "Peter R.", ""], ["Zand", "Martin S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.11226", "submitter": "Ali Haidar T.", "authors": "Ali T.

To estimate the relative abundance (%)\nof a given species, it is necessary to estimate in advance the minimum number\nof specimens to be used in the count (n). This requires an a priori assumption\nabout a specified level of confidence, and about the species population\nproportion (p). It is common use to apply the binomial distribution to\ndetermine n to detect the presence of more than one species in the same sample,\nalthough the multinomial distribution should necessarily be used instead.\n  The mathematical theory of sample size computation using the multinomial\ndistribution is adapted to the computation of n for any number of species to be\ndetected together (K) at any level of confidence. Easy-to-use extensive tables\nshow n, for a combination of K and p. These tables indicate a large difference\nfor n between that indicated by the binomial and those by the multinomial\ndistribution when many species are to be detected simultaneously. Counting only\n300 specimens (with 95 % confidence level) or 500 (99 %) is not enough to\ndetect more than one taxon.\n  The reconstructed history of the micro-biosphere may therefore, in many\ninstances, need to be largely revised. This revision should affect our\nunderstanding of the ecological and evolutionary relationships between the past\nchanges in the biosphere and the other major reservoirs (hydrosphere, geosphere\nand atmosphere).
