Our most important result is that\nendogenous peroxidase inhibition by 0.3% H2O2 coincided with an apparently\npositive IDE staining in an investigated breast cancer specimen whereas\ncombining a block by 3% H2O2 with an incubation of the biotinylated secondary\nantibody at RT, yet not at 37 degrees Celsius, revealed this specimen as almost\nentirely IDE-negative.

The theory also provides a simple means of tracking the\nevolution of the degree distribution among susceptibles or infecteds. The\nequations are used to demonstrate the dramatic effects that the degree\ndistribution plays on the final size of an epidemic as well as the speed with\nwhich it spreads through the population. Power law degree distributions are\nobserved to generate an almost immediate expansion phase yet have a smaller\nfinal size compared to homogeneous degree distributions such as the Poisson.\nThe equations are compared to stochastic simulations, which show good agreement\nwith the theory.

Recently, a powerful new\nalgorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques\nwas proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified\nby a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and\nexemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint\naffinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to\nmore stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is\nintroduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is\nreduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter\nselection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,\nincluding in particular microarray data related to various cancer types.

Given a\nclass of empirical networks, reconstruction schemes for elucidating the\nevolutionary dynamics leading to those particular data can then be developed.\nThis method is exemplified for protein-protein interaction networks. Traces of\ntheir evolutionary history of duplication and divergence processes are\nidentified. In particular, we can identify typical specific features that\nrobustly distinguish protein-protein interaction networks from other classes of\nnetworks, in spite of possible statistical fluctuations of the underlying data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2007 13:34:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Anirban", ""], ["Jost", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3473", "submitter": "Alex Barnett", "authors": "A.

We\nfind a closed-form solution for the steady-state (equilibrium) probability\ndistribution u* using a factorization of the redistribution operator into\nsymmetric and diagonal parts. How space use is controlled by the preference\nfunction w then depends on the characteristic width of the redistribution\nkernel: when w changes rapidly compared to this width, u* ~ w, whereas on\nglobal scales large compared to this width, u* ~ w^2. We analyse the behavior\nat discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries. We simulate the\ndynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data and explore\nthe effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such\nnumerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the\ncomputationally-intensive task of model parameter fitting and inverse modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2007 21:53:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Barnett", "A.

The concept\nof selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in\nheterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in\nheterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical\ntopology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the\nstatistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects\nof superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel\npathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew\ndistributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show\nthat feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as\ncan discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective\ncontrol are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second\nis a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the\nsignaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically\nyields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations\nsusceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general\ncontrol strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the\nleast sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control\nof robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive\nnodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be\ndesigned in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating\nthe selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2007 15:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Calzolari", "Diego", ""], ["Paternostro", "Giovanni", ""], ["Harrington", "Patrick L.", "Jr."], ["Piermarocchi", "Carlo", ""], ["Duxbury", "Phillip M.", ""]]}]
