Mechanisms of this type of neuroinflammation are\nstill not understood well. Recent experimental and theoretical results point\nout possible role of the diffusion species in this process. The paper considers\na model of anomalous diffusion occurring in the glial scar around a chronic\nimplant in two simple geometries -- a separable rectilinear electrode and a\ncylindrical electrode, which are solvable exactly. We describe a hypothetical\nextended source of diffusing species and study its concentration profile in\nsteady-state conditions. Diffusion transport is assumed to obey a\nfractional-order Fick law, which is derived from physically realistic\nassumptions using a fractional calculus approach. The derived fractional-order\ndistribution morphs into regular order diffusion in the case of integer\nfractional exponents. The model presented here demonstrates that accumulation\nof diffusing species can occur and the scar properties (i.e. tortuosity,\nfractional order, scar thickness) can influence such accumulation. The observed\nshape of the concentration profile corresponds qualitatively with GFAP profiles\nreported in the literature. The main difference with respect to the previous\nstudies is the explicit incorporation of the apparatus of fractional calculus\nwithout assumption of an ad hoc tortuosity parameter.

Many important interactions are conserved\nacross a large variety of species. The need to maintain interaction leads to a\nhigh degree of co-evolution between residues in the interface between partner\nproteins. The inference of protein-protein interaction networks from the\nrapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in\nsystems biology today.

In the trp operon, it assigns the two largest interaction scores\nto the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue\ninteractions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit\nour approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive\nrate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions.

We show that this\nmodel is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely\nand go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the\nwhole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a\ncentral role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the\ndynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood\npressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to\nthe dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ within the muscle cell, and that self-sustaining\nCa$^{2+}$ waves are not necessary to cause whole-vessel radius oscillations\nconsistent with vasomotion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 21:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Catherall", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09347", "submitter": "Min Xu", "authors": "Min Xu, Elitza I Tocheva, Yi-Wei Chang, Grant J Jensen, Frank Alber", "title": "De novo visual proteomics in single cells through pattern mining", "comments": "60 pages, 27 figures.

However,\nextracting this information is very challenging and current methods usually\nrely on templates of known structure. Here, we formulate a template-free visual\nproteomics analysis as a de novo pattern mining problem and propose a new\nframework called \"Multi Pattern Pursuit\" for supporting proteome-scale de novo\ndiscovery of macromolecular complexes in cellular tomograms without using\ntemplates of known structures. Our tests on simulated and experimental\ntomograms show that our method is a promising tool for template-free visual\nproteomics analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 19:18:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 18:08:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 03:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Min", ""], ["Tocheva", "Elitza I", ""], ["Chang", "Yi-Wei", ""], ["Jensen", "Grant J", ""], ["Alber", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09368", "submitter": "Pascal Wallisch", "authors": "Pascal Wallisch", "title": "Brighter than the sun: Powerscape visualizations illustrate power needs\n  in neuroscience and psychology", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Participant needs to achieve a given power are frequently underestimated.\nThis is particularly problematic when effect sizes are small, such as is common\nin neuroscience and psychology.
