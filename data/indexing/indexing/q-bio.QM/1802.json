The study\nreanalyzed a dataset of trunk accelerations from 100 healthy adults walking at\npreferred speed on a treadmill for 10 minutes. By interpolation, the stride\nintervals were modified within the acceleration signals for the purpose of\nconserving the original shape of the signal, while imposing a known\nstride-to-stride fluctuation structure. 4 types of hybrid signals with\ndifferent noise structures were built: constant, anti-correlated, random, and\ncorrelated (fractal). Short- and long-term DEs were then computed. The results\nshow that long-term DEs, but not short-term DEs, are sensitive to the noise\nstructure of stride intervals. It was that observed that random hybrid signals\nexhibited significantly lower long-term DEs than hybrid correlated signals did\n(0.100 vs 0.144, i.e. a 44% difference).

When sufficient system details are not known, one typically turns\nto machine learning, which builds a black-box model of the system using a large\ndataset of input sample features and outputs.

We then demonstrate this method in\nmeasuring biological cooperativity of molecular binding networks: in\nparticular, ligand molecules binding to cell surface receptor proteins. Our\nresults show how the non-statistical uncertainties lead to invalid\nidentification of the measured cooperativity. Through this computational\nscheme, the biological interpretation can be more objectively evaluated and\nunderstood under a specific experimental configuration of interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 00:29:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 01:14:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Mar 2018 04:51:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:29:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2019 00:46:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Watabe", "Masaki", ""], ["Arjunan", "Satya N.

Understanding these responses requires measures that characterize\nhow the information on these response patterns are represented across multiple\ntemporal resolutions. In this paper we propose a metric -- which we call\nmultiscale relevance (MSR) -- to capture the dynamical variability of the\nactivity of single neurons across different time scales. The MSR is a\nnon-parametric, fully featureless indicator in that it uses only the time\nstamps of the firing activity without resorting to any a priori covariate or\ninvoking any specific structure in the tuning curve for neural activity. When\napplied to neural data from the mEC and from the ADn and PoS regions of\nfreely-behaving rodents, we found that neurons having low MSR tend to have low\nmutual information and low firing sparsity across the correlates that are\nbelieved to be encoded by the region of the brain where the recordings were\nmade. In addition, neurons with high MSR contain significant information on\nspatial navigation and allow to decode spatial position or head direction as\nefficiently as those neurons whose firing activity has high mutual information\nwith the covariate to be decoded and significantly better than the set of\nneurons with high local variations in their interspike intervals. Given these\nresults, we propose that the MSR can be used as a measure to rank and select\nneurons for their information content without the need to appeal to any a\npriori covariate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:56:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2019 10:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cubero", "Ryan John", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Roudi", "Yasser", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10548", "submitter": "Carlos Xavier Hernandez", "authors": "Carlos X.

For this reason,\nthese data are increasingly collected in large cohorts, driving a need for the\ndevelopment of novel methods for their integration. Of note,\nclinical/translational studies typically provide snapshot gene and metabolite\nprofiles and, oftentimes, most metabolites are not identified. Thus, in these\ntypes of studies, pathway/network approaches that take into account the\ncomplexity of gene-metabolite relationships may neither be applicable nor\nreadily uncover novel relationships. With this in mind, we propose a simple\nlinear modeling approach to capture phenotype-specific gene-metabolite\nassociations, with the assumption that co-regulation patterns reflect\nfunctionally related genes and metabolites. The proposed linear model,\nmetabolite ~ gene + phenotype + gene:phenotype, specifically evaluates whether\ngene-metabolite relationships differ by phenotype, by testing whether the\nrelationship in one phenotype is significantly different from the relationship\nin another phenotype (via an interaction gene:phenotype p-value). Interaction\np-values for all possible gene-metabolite pairs are computed and significant\npairs are clustered by the directionality of associations. We implemented our\napproach as an R package, IntLIM, which includes a user-friendly Shiny app. We\napplied IntLIM to two published datasets, collected in NCI-60 cell lines and in\nhuman breast tumor and non-tumor tissue. We demonstrate that IntLIM captures\nrelevant tumor-specific gene-metabolite associations involved in cancer-related\npathways. and also uncover novel relationships that could be tested\nexperimentally. The IntLIM R package is publicly available in GitHub\n(https://github.com/mathelab/IntLIM).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 18:55:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Siddiqui", "Jalal K.", ""], ["Baskin", "Elizabeth", ""], ["Liu", "Mingrui", ""], ["Cantemir-Stone", "Carmen Z.", ""], ["Zhang", "Bofei", ""], ["Bonneville", "Russell", ""], ["McElroy", "Joseph P.", ""], ["Coombes", "Kevin R.", ""], ["Math\u00e9", "Ewy A.", ""]]}]
