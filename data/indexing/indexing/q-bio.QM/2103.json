Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic inflammatory\ncondition of the esophagus associated with elevated numbers of eosinophils.\nDisease diagnosis and monitoring requires determining the concentration of\neosinophils in esophageal biopsies, a time-consuming, tedious and somewhat\nsubjective task currently performed by pathologists. Methods. Herein, we aimed\nto use machine learning to identify, quantitate and diagnose EoE.

PECNet segmented\nboth intact and not-intact eosinophils with a mean intersection over union\n(mIoU) of 0.93.

Accurate recognition or identification of\nnematodes are of great importance for pest control, soil ecology,\nbio-geography, habitat conservation and against climate changes. Computer\nvision and image processing have witnessed a few successes in species\nrecognition of nematodes; however, it is still in great demand. In this paper,\nwe identify two main bottlenecks: (1) the lack of a publicly available imaging\ndataset for diverse species of nematodes (especially the species only found in\nnatural environment) which requires considerable human resources in field work\nand experts in taxonomy, and (2) the lack of a standard benchmark of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques on this dataset which demands the\ndiscipline background in computer science. With these in mind, we propose an\nimage dataset consisting of diverse nematodes (both laboratory cultured and\nnaturally isolated), which, to our knowledge, is the first time in the\ncommunity. We further set up a species recognition benchmark by employing\nstate-of-the-art deep learning networks on this dataset. We discuss the\nexperimental results, compare the recognition accuracy of different networks,\nand show the challenges of our dataset. We make our dataset publicly available\nat: https://github.com/xuequanlu/I-Nema\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2021 12:29:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Xuequan", ""], ["Wang", "Yihao", ""], ["Fung", "Sheldon", ""], ["Qing", "Xue", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.08509", "submitter": "Songting Shi", "authors": "Songting Shi", "title": "Visualizing Data Velocity using DSNE", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG math.OC q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new technique called \"DSNE\" which learns the velocity embeddings\nof low dimensional map points when given the high-dimensional data points with\nits velocities.

Herein, we report a systematic and quantitative study\nof the direct effect of the antibiotic-cargo released from MSNs on\nGram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms. Levofloxacin (LVX),\ngentamicin (GM) and rifampin (RIF) were separately loaded into pure-silica and\namino-modified MSNs. This accounts for the versatility of these nanosystems\nsince they were able to load and release different antibiotic molecules of\ndiverse chemical nature. Biological activity curves of the released antibiotic\nwere determined for both bacterial strains, which allowed to calculate the\nactive doses that are effective against bacterial biofilms. Furthermore, in\nvitro biocompatibility assays on osteoblast-like cells were carried out at\ndifferent periods of times. Albeit a slight decrease in cell viability was\nobserved at the very initial stage, due to the initial burst antibiotic\nrelease, the biocompatibility of these nanosystems is evidenced since a\nrecovery of cell viability was achieved after 72 h of assay. Biological\nactivity curves for GM released from MSNs exhibited sustained patterns and\nantibiotic doses in the 2-6 {\\mu}g/mL range up to 100 h, which were not enough\nto eradicate biofilm. In the case of LVX and RIF first-order kinetics featuring\nan initial burst effect followed by a sustained release above the MIC up to 96\nh were observed.

NMR software should allow researchers to flexibly implement\nvarious functionality according to the requirement of applications. Scripting\nsystem can offer an open environment for NMR users to write custom programs\nwith basic libraries. Emerging technologies, especially multivariate\nstatistical analysis and artificial intelligence, have been successfully\napplied to NMR applications such as metabolomics and biomacromolecules.\nScripting system should support more complex NMR libraries, which will enable\nthe emerging technologies to be easily implemented in the scripting\nenvironment. Result: Here, a novel NMR scripting system named \"NMRPy\" is\nintroduced. In the scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original\nCPython based libraries are supported. A module was built as a bridge to\nintegrate the runtime environment of Java and CPython. It works as an extension\nin CPython environment, as well as interacts with Java part by Java Native\nInterface. Leveraging the bridge, Java based instrument control and data\nprocessing methods can be called as a CPython style.

We provide examples' code with simulated\ndata in the supplementary materials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:22:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Martino", "Sara", ""], ["Pace", "Daniela Silvia", ""], ["Moro", "Stefano", ""], ["Casoli", "Edoardo", ""], ["Ventura", "Daniele", ""], ["Frachea", "Alessandro", ""], ["Silvestri", "Margherita", ""], ["Arcangeli", "Antonella", ""], ["Giacomini", "Giancarlo", ""], ["Ardizzone", "Giandomenico", ""], ["Lasinio", "Giovanna Jona", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.17137", "submitter": "Yutaka Shikano", "authors": "Masazumi Fujiwara, Yutaka Shikano", "title": "Diamond quantum thermometry: From foundations to applications", "comments": "27 pages, 13 figures, Comments are welcome", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Diamond quantum thermometry exploits the optical and electrical spin\nproperties of colour defect centres in diamonds and, acts as a quantum sensing\nmethod exhibiting ultrahigh precision and robustness. Compared to the existing\nluminescent nanothermometry techniques, a diamond quantum thermometer can be\noperated over a wide temperature range and a sensor spatial scale ranging from\nnanometres to micrometres. Further, diamond quantum thermometry is employed in\nseveral application, including electronics and biology, to explore these fields\nwith nanoscale temperature measurements. This review covers the operational\nprinciples of diamond quantum thermometry for spin-based and all-optical\nmethods, material development of diamonds with a focus on thermometry, and\nexamples of applications in electrical and biological systems with demand-based\ntechnological requirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 15:00:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fujiwara", "Masazumi", ""], ["Shikano", "Yutaka", ""]]}]
