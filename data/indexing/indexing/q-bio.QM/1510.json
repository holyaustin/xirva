Spatial and temporal disturbances lead to adverse and hazardous\nmicroenvironments for cellular systems that is reflected in the phenotypic\nheterogeneity within the system. In this paper, we study the effect of\nmicroenvironment on the invasive capability of species, or mutants, on\nstructured grids under the influence of site-dependent random proliferation in\naddition to a migration potential. We discuss both continuous and discrete\nfitness distributions. Our results suggest that the invasion probability is\nnegatively correlated with the variance of fitness distribution of mutants (for\nboth advantageous and neutral mutants) in the absence of migration of both\ntypes of cells. A similar behaviour is observed even in the presence of a\nrandom fitness distribution of host cells in the system with neutral fitness\nrate. In the case of a bimodal distribution, we observe zero invasion\nprobability until the system reaches a (specific) proportion of advantageous\nphenotypes. Also, we find that the migrative potential amplifies the invasion\nprobability as the variance of fitness of mutants increases in the system,\nwhich is the exact opposite in the absence of migration. Our computational\nframework captures the harsh microenvironmental conditions through quenched\nrandom fitness distributions and migration of cells, and our analysis shows\nthat they play an important role in the invasion dynamics of several biological\nsystems such as bacterial micro-habitats, epithelial dysplasia, and metastasis.\nWe believe that our results may lead to more experimental studies, which can in\nturn provide further insights into the role and impact of heterogeneous\nenvironments on invasion dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 23:49:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 22:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Manem", "Venkata.

Most of the earlier two-state models\ncombined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we\nsuggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with\nthe zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated\nand zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step\nis a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process.

Upon\nnucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double\nstranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall\nrenaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates\nmainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled\nincorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the\nrenaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from\nthe incorrect-contact formation step.

In our study the\ndifferent fragmentation of fetal and maternal DNA molecules present in maternal\ncirculation was utilized in identification of contaminated samples.\nAmplification of Y-chromosome specific assays different in size was tested on\ncirculating DNA samples.\n  Of the four tested assays two shorter (84 and 177 bp) showed expected qPCR\nefficiency and have comparable amplification profiles. The difference in Ct\nvalues between these two assays was found to be statistically significant in\ncomparison of fetal male and normal male samples (p<0.0001) as well as in\nblinded pilot study performed on 10 artificially contaminated and 10\nnon-contaminated samples (F=34.4, p<0.0001) that were all identified correctly.\n  Our results showed that differently sized assays performed well in detection\nof external contamination of samples in noninvasive prenatal fetal gender test\nand could be of help in clinical laboratories to minimize the risk of false\npositive results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:56:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Min\u00e1rik", "Gabriel", ""], ["Nagyov\u00e1", "Em\u00edlia", ""], ["Repisk\u00e1", "Gabriela", ""], ["Szemes", "Tom\u00e1\u0161", ""], ["Vlkov\u00e1-Izrael", "Barbora", ""], ["Celec", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09037", "submitter": "Krist\\'of Tak\\'acs", "authors": "Krist\\'of Tak\\'acs", "title": "Multiple sequence alignment for short sequences", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) has been one of the most important problems\nin bioinformatics for more decades and it is still heavily examined by many\nmathematicians and biologists. However, mostly because of the practical\nmotivation of this problem, the research on this topic is focused on aligning\nlong sequences. It is understandable, since the sequences that need to be\naligned (usually DNA or protein sequences) are generally quite long (e. g., at\nleast 30-40 characters). Nevertheless, it is a challenging question that\nexactly where MSA starts to become a real hard problem (since it is known that\nMSA is NP-complete [2]), and the key to answer this question is to examine\nshort sequences. If the optimal alignment for short sequences could be\ndetermined in polynomial time, then these results may help to develop faster or\nmore accurate heuristic algorithms for aligning long sequences. In this work,\nit is shown that for length-1 sequences using arbitrary metric, as well as for\nlength-2 sequences using unit metric, the optimum of the MSA problem can be\nachieved by the trivial alignment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 10:16:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 09:58:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tak\u00e1cs", "Krist\u00f3f", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09155", "submitter": "Momoko Hayamizu", "authors": "Momoko Hayamizu, Hiroshi Endo, and Kenji Fukumizu", "title": "A characterization of minimum spanning tree-like metric spaces", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.DM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent years have witnessed a surge of biological interest in the minimum\nspanning tree (MST) problem for its relevance to automatic model construction\nusing the distances between data points.
