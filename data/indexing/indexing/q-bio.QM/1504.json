The model was based on continuum theory\nfor fibre-reinforced composite materials. Here we simulated contractions for an\nidealized medial gastrocnemius muscle in man, using the model. Simulations were\nperformed to test the force-length relation of the whole muscle, to evaluate\nthe changes in internal fascicle geometry during contractions, and to assess\nthe importance of material formulations for the aponeurosis and tendon. The\nsimulation results were compared to previously published experimental values.\nThe force-length profile for the whole muscle showed a realistic profile. As\nthe muscle contracted the fascicles curved into S-shaped trajectories and\ncurled around 3D paths, both of which matched previous experimental findings.\nAs the fascicles shortened they increased in their cross-sectional area, but\nthis increase was asymmetric with the smaller increase occurring within the\nfascicle-plane: the Poisson's ratio in this plane matched that previously shown\nfrom ultrasound imaging. The distribution of strains in the aponeurosis and\ntendon was shown to be a function of their material properties. This study\ndemonstrated that the model could replicate realistic patterns of whole\nmuscle-force, and changes to the internal muscle geometry, and so will be\nuseful for testing mechanisms that affect the structural changes within\ncontracting muscle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 23:16:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rahemi", "Hadi", ""], ["Nigam", "Nilima", ""], ["Wakeling", "James M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.00525", "submitter": "Jean-Baptiste Masson dr.", "authors": "Mohamed El Beheiry, Maxime Dahan and Jean-Baptiste Masson", "title": "InferenceMAP: Mapping of Single-Molecule Dynamics with Bayesian\n  Inference", "comments": "56 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.2580", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Single-particle tracking (SPT) grants unprecedented insight into cellular\nfunction at the molecular scale [1].

While neurofilament accumulation suggests the\nimpairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of\ntheir segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30\nyears. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for\nthe cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons.\nThe model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting\nparticles in a 2D cross-section, and incorporates the stochastic interactions\nthese particles through molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate\nthat organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of\nneurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from\nneurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic\nneuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation is\nsimply a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport.\nThe model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and\nextent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles\nas well as the density of their traffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 09:04:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xue", "Chuan", ""], ["Shtylla", "Blerta", ""], ["Brown", "Anthony", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.06249", "submitter": "Hector Zenil", "authors": "Hector Zenil, Narsis A.

Knowing sparse Bayesian learning is\nan important member in the family of sparse recovery, and a superior choice\nwhen the projection matrix is highly coherent (which is typical the case for\nEEG), in this work we evaluate the performance of block sparse Bayesian\nlearning (BSBL) method for EEG source localization.

A realistic head model is used for\nthe experiment, which was obtained from segmentation of MRI images. When the\nnumber of simultaneously active blocks is 2, the BSBL produces overall\nlocalization accuracy of less than 5 mm without the presence of noise.

We study the combined effect of the two\nnon-Markovian waiting time probability densities and show that even for very\nshort times the decay of the fraction of occupied receptors deviates from an\nexponential. For long times, dissociation is slower than an exponential and the\nfate of the the steady-state bound receptor fraction critically depends on the\nextent of the deviation, relative to the rebinding time density, from the\nMarkovian limit: The population of occupied receptors may either decay\ncompletely or assume a non-vanishing value for small and strong deviations,\nrespectively.
