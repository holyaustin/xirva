The most popular family of random graph null models, called\nconfiguration models, are defined as uniform distributions over a space of\ngraphs with a fixed degree sequence. Commonly, properties of an empirical\nnetwork are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a\nconfiguration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties\nare meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the\nparticular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important\ndecisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and\ninvestigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a\nsuite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of\nspecifying the appropriate graph labeling (stub-labeled or vertex-labeled)\nunder which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study\nof random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the\nchoice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but\ncan have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with\nself-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of\nthree vignettes, analyzing network datasets under many different configuration\nmodels and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under\ndifferent models. We argue that in each case, only one of the possible\nconfiguration models is appropriate. While our work focuses on undirected\nstatic networks, it aims to guide the study of directed networks, dynamic\nnetworks, and all other network contexts that are suitably studied through the\nlens of random graph null models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 20:44:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 21:26:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:37:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Fosdick", "Bailey K.", ""], ["Larremore", "Daniel B.", ""], ["Nishimura", "Joel", ""], ["Ugander", "Johan", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00941", "submitter": "Tatsuaki Okamoto", "authors": "Tatsuaki Okamoto", "title": "A Unified Paradigm of Organized Complexity and Semantic Information\n  Theory", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT nlin.AO nlin.CG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the most fundamental problems in science is to define {\\it\nquantitatively} the complexity of organized matters, i.e., {\\it organized\ncomplexity}.

Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop and explore\nseveral new phylogenetic inference methods.

Thus, it is generally thought to be destructive, obscuring signals and\ninterfering with function. However, early in the 20th century, mechanical\nengineers found that mechanisms inducing additional vibration in mechanical\nsystems could prevent sticking and hysteresis. This so-called \"dither\" noise\nwas later introduced in an entirely different context at the advent of digital\ninformation transmission and recording in the early 1960s. Ironically, the\naddition of noise allows one to preserve information that would otherwise be\nlost when the signal or image is digitized. As we shall see, the benefits of\nadded noise in these contexts are closely related to the phenomenon which has\ncome to be known as stochastic resonance, the original version of which\nappealed to noise to explain how small periodic fluctuations in the\neccentricity of the earth's orbit might be amplified in such a way as to bring\nabout the observed periodic transitions in climate from ice age to temperate\nage and back. These noise-induced transitions have since been invoked to\nexplain a wide array of biological phenomena, including the foraging and\ntracking behavior of ants. Many biological phenomena, from foraging to gene\nexpression, are noisy, involving an element of randomness.

Here we present a hybrid geometric and\ninformation-theoretic approach to quantifying spiral wave dynamics. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to numerical\nsimulations of a two-dimensional excitable medium with different numbers and\nspatial patterns of spiral waves. We show that, by defining information flow\nover the excitable medium, hidden coherent structures emerge that effectively\nquantify the information transport underlying spiral wave dynamics. Most\nimportantly, we find that some coherent structures become more clearly defined\nover a longer observation period. These findings validate our approach to\nquantitatively characterize spiral wave dynamics by focusing on information\ntransport. Our approach is computationally efficient and is applicable to many\nexcitable media of interest in distinct physical, chemical and biological\nsystems. Our approach could ultimately contribute to an improved therapy of\nclinical conditions such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmia by identifying\npotential targets of interventional therapies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Aug 2016 15:34:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ashikaga", "Hiroshi", ""], ["James", "Ryan G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.06897", "submitter": "Les Hatton", "authors": "Les Hatton and Gregory Warr", "title": "Full Computational Reproducibility in Biological Science: Methods,\n  Software and a Case Study in Protein Biology", "comments": "17 pages, 1 figure, extends cited PlOS ONE paper demonstrating how to\n  reproduce it precisely", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Independent computational reproducibility of scientific results is rapidly\nbecoming of pivotal importance in scientific progress as computation itself\nplays a more and more central role in so many branches of science.\nHistorically, reproducibility has followed the familiar Popperian [38] model\nwhereby theory cannot be verified by scientific testing, it can only be\nfalsified.

Results: We provide a\nMatlab-compatible implementation of the adap- tive explicit-implicit\n{\\tau}-leaping algorithm to address the above-mentioned deficits. matLeap\nprovides equal or substantially faster results compared to two widely used\nsimulation packages while maintaining accuracy.

The modular and concise\nsyntax makes ANDy suitable for an easy and natural modelling of time-dependent\nbiological systems (i.e., regulatory pathways). Activities involve entities\nplaying the role of activators, inhibitors or products of biochemical network\noperation. Activities may have given duration, i.e., the time required to\nobtain results. An entity may represent an object (e.g., an agent, a\nbiochemical species or a family of thereof) with a local attribute, a state\ndenoting its level (e.g., concentration, strength). Entities levels may change\nas a result of an activity or may decay gradually as time passes by. The\nsemantics of ANDy is formally given via high-level Petri nets ensuring this way\nsome modularity. As main results we show that ANDy systems have finite state\nrepresentations even for potentially infinite processes and it well adapts to\nthe modelling of toxic behaviours.
