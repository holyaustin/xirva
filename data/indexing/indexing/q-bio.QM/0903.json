However, the\nfact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where\neach and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a\nglobal hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping\ngroups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and\nshow that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic\norganizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to\nthe existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link\ncommunities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical\norganization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including\nmajor biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic\nnetworks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically\norganized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while\nmaintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are\nfundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization\nin networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2009 19:03:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 20:58:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Sep 2010 20:56:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ahn", "Yong-Yeol", ""], ["Bagrow", "James P.", ""], ["Lehmann", "Sune", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.3206", "submitter": "Raphael Gottardo", "authors": "Xuekui Zhang, Gordon Robertson, Martin Krzywinski, Kaida Ning, Arnaud\n  Droit, Steven Jones, and Raphael Gottardo", "title": "PICS: Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq", "comments": "30 pages, 7 figures and 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  ChIP-seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively\nparallel short-read sequencing, can profile in vivo genome-wide transcription\nfactor-DNA association with higher sensitivity, specificity and spatial\nresolution than ChIP-chip. While it presents new opportunities for research,\nChIP-seq poses new challenges for statistical analysis that derive from the\ncomplexity of the biological systems characterized and the variability and\nbiases in its digital sequence data. We propose a method called PICS\n(Probabilistic Inference for ChIP-seq) for extracting information from ChIP-seq\naligned-read data in order to identify regions bound by transcription factors.\nPICS identifies enriched regions by modeling local concentrations of\ndirectional reads, and uses DNA fragment length prior information to\ndiscriminate closely adjacent binding events via a Bayesian hierarchical\nt-mixture model. Its per-event fragment length estimates also allow it to\nremove from analysis regions that have atypical lengths. PICS uses\npre-calculated, whole-genome read mappability profiles and a truncated\nt-distribution to adjust binding event models for reads that are missing due to\nlocal genome repetitiveness. It estimates uncertainties in model parameters\nthat can be used to define confidence regions on binding event locations and to\nfilter estimates. Finally, PICS calculates a per-event enrichment score\nrelative to a control sample, and can use a control sample to estimate a false\ndiscovery rate. We compared PICS to the alternative methods MACS, QuEST, and\nCisGenome, using published GABP and FOXA1 data sets from human cell lines, and\nfound that PICS' predicted binding sites were more consistent with\ncomputationally predicted binding motifs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2009 17:20:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xuekui", ""], ["Robertson", "Gordon", ""], ["Krzywinski", "Martin", ""], ["Ning", "Kaida", ""], ["Droit", "Arnaud", ""], ["Jones", "Steven", ""], ["Gottardo", "Raphael", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.3386", "submitter": "Mike Steel Prof.", "authors": "Laszlo Szekely, Mike Steel", "title": "An improved bound on the Maximum Agreement Subtree problem", "comments": "5 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We improve the lower bound on the extremal version of the Maximum Agreement\nSubtree problem.
