The\nmodel describes the movement of pol-II down the gene body and can be used to\nidentify the time of induction for transcriptionally engaged genes. By\nclustering the inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to\ndetermine which genes respond quickly to stimuli and group genes that share\nactivity profiles and may therefore be co-regulated. We apply our methodology\nto biological data obtained using ChIP-seq to measure pol-II occupancy\ngenome-wide when MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are treated with estradiol\n(E2). The transcription speeds we obtain agree with those obtained previously\nfor smaller numbers of genes with the advantage that our approach can be\napplied genome-wide. We validate the biological significance of the pol-II\npromoter activity clusters by investigating cluster-specific transcription\nfactor binding patterns and determining canonical pathway enrichment. We find\nthat rapidly induced genes are enriched for both estrogen receptor alpha\n(ER$\\alpha$) and FOXA1 binding in their proximal promoter regions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 13:00:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 10:59:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Maina", "Ciira wa", ""], ["Honkela", "Antti", ""], ["Matarese", "Filomena", ""], ["Grote", "Korbinian", ""], ["Stunnenberg", "Hendrik G.", ""], ["Reid", "George", ""], ["Lawrence", "Neil D.", ""], ["Rattray", "Magnus", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.4928", "submitter": "Thomas Dierkes", "authors": "Thomas Dierkes, Susanna R\\\"oblitz, Moritz Wade, and Peter Deuflhard", "title": "Parameter identification in large kinetic networks with BioPARKIN", "comments": "20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables; added 1 figure, and revised section 4", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modelling, parameter identification, and simulation play an important role in\nsystems biology.

Three distinct patterns of symptoms were consistently\nidentified. Although fatigue is a ubiquitous finding, sleep disturbance and\nheadache are each commonly reported without the other. The commonest pattern of\nsymptoms was sleep disturbance and fatigue, with little or no headache. In\nsubjects reporting severe headache, 40% did not report sleep disturbance. Sleep\ndisturbance correlates poorly with other symptoms of AMS (Pearson r = 0.31 vs\nheadache).
