Using the M\\\"obius inversion\nduality between multivariable entropies and multivariable interaction\ninformation, we express the divergence as an additive series in the number of\ninteracting variables, which provides a restricted and simplified set of\ndistributions to use as approximation and with which to model data. Truncations\nof this series yield approximations based on the number of interacting\nvariables. The first few terms of the expansion-truncation are illustrated and\nshown to lead naturally to familiar approximations, including the well-known\nKirkwood superposition approximation. Truncation can also induce a simple\nrelation between the multi-information and the interaction information. A\nmeasure of distance between distributions, based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence, is then described and shown to be a true metric if properly\nrestricted.

However, a key property\nof networks is often neglected: many real-world networks exhibit spatial\nstructure, the tendency of a node to select neighbors with a probability\ndepending on physical distance. Here, we introduce a class of random spatial\nnetworks (RSNs) which generalizes many existing random network models but adds\nspatial structure. In these networks, nodes are placed randomly in space and\njoined in edges with a probability depending on their distance and their\nindividual expected degrees, in a manner that crucially remains analytically\ntractable. We use this network class to propose a new generalization of\nsmall-world networks, where the average shortest path lengths in the graph are\nsmall, as in classical Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, but with close\nspatial proximity of nodes that are neighbors in the network playing the role\nof large clustering. Small-world effects are demonstrated on these spatial\nsmall-world networks without clustering. We are able to derive partial\nintegro-differential equations governing susceptible-infectious-recovered\ndisease spreading through an RSN, and we demonstrate the existence of traveling\nwave solutions. If the distance kernel governing edge placement decays slower\nthan exponential, the population-scale dynamics are dominated by long-range\nhops followed by local spread of traveling waves.

Recently, the Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information\n(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and\nsynergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose\nto apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in\na Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy\nredundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition\nwhich is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can\nreveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that\nare indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective\nalso shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself\nincludes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships\nbetween the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative\ninformation decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This\nreveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset\nof the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in\npart why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows\nseparate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of\nthe system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between\ninputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address.
