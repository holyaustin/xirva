Various evolutionary hypotheses\nare tested. Results of these tests include rejection of the monophyly of Homo\nheidelbergensis, the Multi-Regional hypothesis, and the hypothesis that the\nunusual 12,000 year old (12kya) Iwo Eleru skull represents a modern human.\nRather, by quantitative phylogenetic analyses the latter is seen to be an old\n(200-400kya) lineage that probably represents a novel African species, Homo\niwoelerueensis. It diverged after the lineage leading to Neanderthals, and may\nhave been driven to extinction in the last 10kya by modern humans, Homo\nsapiens, another African species of Homo that appeared about 100kya. Another\nenigmatic skull, Qafzeh 6 from the Middle East about 90kya, appears to be a\nhybrid of two thirds near, but not, anatomically modern human and one third of\nan archaic lineage diverging close to classic European Neanderthals. Overall,\nthe tree clearly implies an accelerating rate of skullcap shape change, and by\nextension, change of the underlying brain, over the last 400kya in Africa. This\nacceleration may have extended right up to the origin of modern humans. Methods\nof distance-based evolutionary tree inference are refined and extended, with\nparticular attention to diagnosing the model and achieving a better fit.

In this study, we combined PET with\noptical projection tomography (OPT) to evaluate its potential for plant root\nphenotyping.

Methods: In\nthis cross-sectional, retrospective study, data from 9,948 US patients between\n2009 and 2012 were used to develop a pre-screening tool to predict current type\n2 diabetes, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared (1) a full EHR\nmodel containing prescribed medications, diagnoses, and traditional predictive\ninformation, (2) a restricted EHR model where medication information was\nremoved, and (3) a conventional model containing only traditional predictive\ninformation (BMI, age, gender, hypertensive and smoking status).

Further exploration of the\ndata reveals additional findings: (1) that LCI grows at approximately the\nsquare root of LSCD, which may provide a clue to the biology; (2) among\ndifferent possible combinations of the primary data, the one maximizing the\ncorrelations with LCI is almost precisely the formula used by Tomasetti and\nVogelstein to estimate LSCD, giving support to stem cell divisions as an\nindependent factor in carcinogenesis, while not excluding other such factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Altenberg", "Lee", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.04621", "submitter": "Rajib Rana", "authors": "Sajib Saha, Frank de Hoog, Ya.I.

In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization\nmethod for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better\nspecify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the\nproposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside\nhuman brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with\nimposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain\nactivity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a\nrealistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head\nand includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity\nvalues. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly\nimproves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed\nmethod was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6\nsimultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,\nthe accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%.\nConclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method\nis potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human\nbrain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 16:11:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sajib", ""], ["de Hoog", "Frank", ""], ["Nesterets", "Ya.

Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the\nenvironment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on\necosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to\nunify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from\navailable habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed\nmovement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization\ndistribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are\neasily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability\ndensity at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that\nposition. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch\nof the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that\npatch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this\nnon-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement\nprocesses, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat\nwhere the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give\nstatistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and\ndemonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in\nNewfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the\nmodel have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of\nthe local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat\nare used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,\nwhereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4.

Dormann et al. (Ecography, 2007, 30,\n609) extended this analysis to auto-Poisson and auto-normal models, reporting\nsimilar anomalies. All the above studies employ neighbourhood weighting schemes\ninconsistent with conditions (Besag, J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B, 1974, 36, 192)\nrequired for auto-model validity; furthermore the auto-Poisson analysis fails\nto exclude cooperative interactions. We show that all \"snouter\" anomalies are\nresolved by correct auto-model implementation. Re-analysis of the red deer data\nshows that invalid neighbourhood weightings generate only small estimation\nerrors for the full dataset, but larger errors occur on geographic subsamples.\nA substantial fraction of papers applying auto-logistic regression to\necological data use these invalid weightings, which are default options in the\nwidely used \"spdep\" spatial dependence package for R. Auto-logistic analyses\nusing invalid neighbourhood weightings will be erroneous to an extent that can\nvary widely. These analyses can easily be corrected by using valid\nneighbourhood weightings available in \"spdep\". The hybrid estimation approach\nfor missing data is readily adapted for valid neighbourhood weighting schemes\nand is implemented here in R for application to sparse presence-absence data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 19:14:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 16:51:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 14:30:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 17:17:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bardos", "David C.", ""], ["Guillera-Arroita", "Gurutzeta", ""], ["Wintle", "Brendan A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06530", "submitter": "David Bardos", "authors": "David C.

The last three studies were based on erroneous numerical evidence,\ndue to violation of conditions (Besag, J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B, 1974, 36, 192)\nfor auto-model validity. Here we show that after correcting these technical\nerrors, a more fundamental conceptual error remains: the comparative studies\nare founded on a mathematically incorrect notion of bias, involving direct\ncomparison of parameter estimates across models differing in mathematical\nstructure. We develop a set of simulation-based measures of covariate influence\nthat are directly comparable across models and apply them to examples from the\nabovementioned studies. We find that in these cases, the effect of auto-model\nparameters is similar to (and consistent with) corresponding linear model\neffects, due to a phenomenon within auto-models that we refer to as \"covariate\namplification\". Thus, simple comparison of parameter magnitudes between\nstructurally different models can be highly misleading. We demonstrate that the\nrecent critique of auto-models is entirely unfounded. Correctly applied and\ninterpreted, autocovariate regression provides a practical approach to\ninference for spatially autocorrelated species distribution or abundance data,\nwhile overcoming well-known limitations of generalized linear models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 19:21:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bardos", "David C.", ""], ["Guillera-Arroita", "Gurutzeta", ""], ["Wintle", "Brendan A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06896", "submitter": "Marco  Kienzle", "authors": "Marco Kienzle, David Sterling, Shijie Zhou and You-Gan Wang", "title": "A maximum likelihood estimate of natural mortality for brown tiger prawn\n  (Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay (Australia)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.008", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The delay difference model was implemented to fit 21 years of brown tiger\nprawn (Penaeus esculentus) catch in Moreton Bay by maximum likelihood to assess\nthe status of this stock.
