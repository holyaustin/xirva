Despite the importance of this\ntransmission route, very little is known about the dynamic patterns of CPIs.\nUsing wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of\nCPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the\nreconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease\ntransmission. At a 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal\ndistance of 3 meters among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high density\nnetwork with typical small world properties and a relatively homogenous\ndistribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects.\nComputer simulations of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted\ncontact graph are in good agreement with absentee data during the most recent\ninfluenza season. Analysis of targeted immunization strategies suggested that\ncontact network data are required to design strategies that are significantly\nmore effective than random immunization. Immunization strategies based on\ncontact network data were most effective at high vaccination coverage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 19:33:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Aug 2010 16:34:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Salath\u00e9", "Marcel", ""], ["Kazandjieva", "Maria", ""], ["Lee", "Jung Woo", ""], ["Levis", "Philip", ""], ["Feldman", "Marcus W.", ""], ["Jones", "James H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4642", "submitter": "Badri Padhukasahasram", "authors": "Badri Padhukasahasram, Eran Halperin, Jennifer Wessel, Daryl Thomas,\n  Elana Silver, Heather Trumbower, Michele Cargill, Dietrich Stephan", "title": "Presymptomatic risk assessment for chronic non-communicable diseases", "comments": "Plos ONE paper.

Common single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tag risk haplotypes across the genome\ncurrently account for a non-trivial portion of the germ-line genetic risk and\nwe will likely continue to identify the remaining missing heritability in the\nform of rare variants, copy number variants and epigenetic modifications. Here,\nwe describe a novel measure for calculating the lifetime risk of a disease,\ncalled the genetic composite index (GCI), and demonstrate its predictive value\nas a clinical classifier. The GCI only considers summary statistics of the\neffects of genetic variation and hence does not require the results of\nlarge-scale studies simultaneously assessing multiple risk factors. Combining\nGCI scores with environmental risk information provides an additional tool for\nclinical decision-making. The GCI can be populated with heritable risk\ninformation of any type, and thus represents a framework for CNCD\npre-symptomatic risk assessment that can be populated as additional risk\ninformation is identified through next-generation technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 20:48:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Oct 2010 06:46:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 Jan 2011 21:56:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2011 19:43:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 28 Jun 2011 06:37:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Padhukasahasram", "Badri", ""], ["Halperin", "Eran", ""], ["Wessel", "Jennifer", ""], ["Thomas", "Daryl", ""], ["Silver", "Elana", ""], ["Trumbower", "Heather", ""], ["Cargill", "Michele", ""], ["Stephan", "Dietrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4847", "submitter": "Pablo Echenique", "authors": "Pablo Echenique, Claudio N.
