A sequence profile is usually represented as a\nposition-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and\naccordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This\npaper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three\nkey components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein\nfamily; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an\nefficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning\ntwo MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue\ncorrelation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus,\nencode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family.\nConsequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much\nmore sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that\nMRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both\nalignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works\nparticularly well for mainly beta proteins.

Using\nclosed population abundance models for illustration, we re-visit a DNA\ncapture-recapture population study of black bears in Michigan, USA and find\nevidence of misidentification due to genotyping error, as well as temporal,\nbehavioral and individual variation in detection probability. We also estimate\na salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating\nthe effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish.\nOur model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and\nprovided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability\nthat is attributable to variable mark quality. Our approach is more\ncomputationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the\nflexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while\nproperly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and\nimperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit\nformulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian\nanalysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 19:14:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2014 18:44:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 20:59:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 12:47:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["McClintock", "Brett T.", ""], ["Bailey", "Larissa L.", ""], ["Dreher", "Brian P.", ""], ["Link", "William A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3531", "submitter": "Ben Fulcher", "authors": "Ben D.

Autonomic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and heart\nrate variability (HRV) metrics were recorded while participants (N = 15) played\nflutes and listened to several styles of music. Flute playing was accompanied\nby an 84% increase in HRV (p < .001). EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity increased\nwhile playing flutes (p = .007) and alpha (8-12 Hz) increased while playing\nlower-pitched flutes (p = .009). Increase in alpha from baseline to the flute\nplaying conditions strongly correlated with experience playing Native American\nflutes (r = +.700). Wide-band beta (12-25 Hz) decreased from the silence\nconditions when listening to solo Native American flute music (p = .013). The\nfindings of increased HRV, increasing slow-wave rhythms, and decreased beta\nsupport the hypothesis that Native American flutes, particularly those with\nlower pitches, may have a role in music therapy contexts. We conclude that the\nNative American flute may merit a more prominent role in music therapy and that\na study of the effects of flute playing on clinical conditions, such as\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (COPD), hypertension, anxiety, and major depressive disorder, is\nwarranted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 02:44:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 03:57:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Eric B.", ""], ["Goss", "Clinton F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6602", "submitter": "Daniel Rabosky", "authors": "Daniel L.

The\ndevelopment of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge. Recent\nprogress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is\ndescribed by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key\nvariables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.\nHere we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we\nfrequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism\nleading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been\nmissed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type\nmechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a\nsaddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over\nsubstantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type\ntransition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological\ndata. This work thus establishes a connection from critical transitions to\nnetworks and an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition.

Short-read alignment and assembly are among the most well-studied\nproblems. Many state-of-the-art aligners, at their core, have used the\nBurrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) as a main-memory index of a reference genome\n(typical example, NCBI human genome). Recently, BWT has also found its use in\nstring-graph assembly, for indexing the reads (i.e., raw data from DNA\nsequencers). In a typical data set, the volume of reads is tens of times of the\nsequenced genome and can be up to 100 Gigabases. Note that a reference genome\nis relatively stable and computing the index is not a frequent task. For reads,\nthe index has to computed from scratch for each given input. The ability of\nefficient BWT construction becomes a much bigger concern than before. In this\npaper, we present a practical method called CX1 for constructing the BWT of\nvery large string collections. CX1 is the first tool that can take advantage of\nthe parallelism given by a graphics processing unit (GPU, a relative cheap\ndevice providing a thousand or more primitive cores), as well as simultaneously\nthe parallelism from a multi-core CPU and more interestingly, from a cluster of\nGPU-enabled nodes. Using CX1, the BWT of a short-read collection of up to 100\nGigabases can be constructed in less than 2 hours using a machine equipped with\na quad-core CPU and a GPU, or in about 43 minutes using a cluster with 4 such\nmachines (the speedup is almost linear after excluding the first 16 minutes for\nloading the reads from the hard disk). The previously fastest tool BRC is\nmeasured to take 12 hours to process 100 Gigabases on one machine; it is\nnon-trivial how BRC can be parallelized to take advantage a cluster of\nmachines, let alone GPUs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chi-Man", ""], ["Luo", "Ruibang", ""], ["Lam", "Tak-Wah", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7492", "submitter": "Nikita Polianskii", "authors": "A.

In this paper, we try to expand on these experimental studies by\nproviding a simple mathematical model of a population of competing vesicles,\nstudied at the level of lipid kinetics. In silico simulations of the model are\nable to reproduce qualitatively and often quantitatively the experimentally\nreported competition effects in both scenarios.
