The goal of MDT is to\nconcentrate MNPs functionalized with therapeutic drugs, in target areas of the\nbody by means of properly focused external magnetic fields. The availability of\nstable, nontoxic MNP-gene vector complexes now offers the opportunity to\ndevelop magnetic gene targeting (MGT), a variant of MDT in which the gene\ncoding for a therapeutic molecule, rather than the molecule itself, is\ndelivered to a therapeutic target area in the body.

Our results demonstrate that the presence of the sink (which\nprovides a quasi--continuum in the energy spectrum) is the dominant effect in\nthe energy transfer which takes place even in absence of a thermal bath. This\napproach allows one to study the effects of finite temperature and the effects\nof any coupling scheme to the reaction center. Moreover, taking into account a\nrealistic electric dipole interaction, we show that the optimal distance from\nthe reaction center to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson system occurs at the\nsuperradiance transition, and we show that this is consistent with available\nexperimental data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Nov 2011 10:02:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 Mar 2012 14:03:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Aug 2012 17:07:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Celardo", "G.

The\nbackbone dihedral angles not only determine the global fold of the protein, but\nalso the details of the local chain organization. Although a wealth of\nstructural information is available in different databases and numerous\nstructural biology softwares have been developed, rapid conformational\ncharacterization remains challenging.\n  We present here RamaDA, a program able to give a synthetic description of the\nconformation of a protein. The RamaDA program is based on a model where the\nRamachadran plot is decomposed into seven conformational domains. Within the\nframework of this model, each amino-acid of a given protein is assigned to one\nof these domains.\n  From this assignment secondary structure elements can be detected with an\naccuracy equivalent to that of the DSSP program for helices and extended\nstrands, and with the added capability of detecting PolyProline II secondary\nstructures. Additionally, the determination of a z-score for each amino-acid of\nthe protein emphasizes any irregularities in the element.\n  It is also possible to use this analysis to detect characteristic\nconformational patterns. In the case of EF-hands, calcium-binding\nhelix-loop-helix domains, it is possible to design a strict consensus for the 9\namino-acids of the loop. 523 calcium binding protein files can be found into\nthe entire PDB with this pattern and only 2.7% false positive hits are\ndetected.\n  The program RamaDA gathers several tools in one and is then able to give a\ncomplete information on a protein structure, including loops and random coil\nregions. Through the example of EF-hands, a promising approach of structural\nbiology is developed.

Examples of equally applicable methods can correspond to those of\ndifferent ancillary statistics in frequentist inference and of different prior\ndistributions in Bayesian inference. More broadly, choices are made between\nparametric and nonparametric methods and between frequentist and Bayesian\nmethods.\n  Rather than choosing a single method, it can be safer, in a game-theoretic\nsense, to combine those that are equally appropriate in light of the available\ninformation. Since methods of combining subjectively assessed probability\ndistributions are not objective enough for that purpose, this paper introduces\na method of distribution combination that does not require any assignment of\ndistribution weights. It does so by formalizing a hedging strategy in terms of\na game between three players: nature, a statistician combining distributions,\nand a statistician refusing to combine distributions. The optimal move of the\nfirst statistician reduces to the solution of a simpler problem of selecting an\nestimating distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler loss maximized over\nthe plausible distributions to be combined. The resulting combined distribution\nis a linear combination of the most extreme of the distributions to be combined\nthat are scientifically plausible. The optimal weights are close enough to each\nother that no extreme distribution dominates the others.\n  The new methodology is illustrated by combining conflicting empirical Bayes\nmethodologies in the context of gene expression data analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Nov 2011 16:31:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bickel", "David R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.6200", "submitter": "Pascal Grange", "authors": "Pascal Grange, Partha P.
