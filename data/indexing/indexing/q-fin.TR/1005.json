The agents follow a noise decision making process where their actions are\nrelated to a stochastic variable, \"the market sentiment\", which we define as a\nmixture of public and private information. The model, despite making just few\nbasic assumptions over the trading strategies of the agents, is able to\nreproduce several empirical features of the high-frequency dynamics of the\nmarket microstructure not only related to the price movements but also to the\ndeposition of the orders in the book.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2010 03:52:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 14:01:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bartolozzi", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1811", "submitter": "Vladimir Vovk", "authors": "A.
