Similarly, complex networks have become very popular\nbecause of the diversity of growth rules giving rise to scale-free behavior.\nHere we study adaptive networks where the agents trade ``wealth'' when they are\nlinked together while links can appear and disappear according to the wealth of\nthe corresponding agents; thus the agents influence the network dynamics and\nvice-versa. Our framework generalizes a multi-agent model of Bouchand and\nMezard, and leads to a steady state with fluctuating connectivities. The system\nspontaneously self-organizes into a critical state where the wealth\ndistribution has a fat tail and the network is scale-free; in addition, network\nheterogeneities lead to enhanced wealth condensation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2008 17:30:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Burda", "Z.", ""], ["Krzywicki", "A.", ""], ["Martin", "O.
