To further understand market behavior, we have\nconducted a series of market experiments on our web-based prediction market\nplatform which allows us to reconstruct transaction networks among traders.\n  From these networks, we are able to record the degree of a trader, the size\nof a community of traders, the transaction time interval among traders and\nother variables that are of interest. The distributions of all these variables\nshow power-law behavior. On the other hand, agent-based models have been\nproposed to study the properties of real financial markets. We here study the\nstatistical properties of these agent-based models and compare them with the\nresults from our web-based market experiments. In this work, three agent-based\nmodels are studied, namely, zero-intelligence (ZI), zero-intelligence-plus\n(ZIP) and Gjerstad-Dickhaut (GD). Computer simulations of variables based on\nthese three agent-based models were carried out. We found that although being\nthe most naive agent-based model, ZI indeed best describes the properties\nobserved in real markets. Our study suggests that the basic ingredient to\nproduce the observed properties from real world markets could in fact be the\nresult of a continuously evolving dynamical system with basic features similar\nto the ZI model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 08:07:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tseng", "Jie-Jun", ""], ["Lin", "Chih-Hao", ""], ["Lin", "Chih-Ting", ""], ["Wang", "Sun-Chong", ""], ["Li", "Sai-Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1653", "submitter": "Fei Ren", "authors": "Fei Ren and Wei-Xing Zhou", "title": "Recurrence interval analysis of trading volumes", "comments": "9 pages, 9 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": "Physical Review E 81 (6), 066107 (2010)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.81.066107", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the statistical properties of the recurrence intervals $\\tau$\nbetween successive trading volumes exceeding a certain threshold $q$.

The model induces a\nsimply-connected but possibly multi-component bipartite graph. A trading\nsession on a fixed graph consists of a sequence of exchanges between connected\nbuyers and sellers until no more exchanges are possible. We deem a trading\nsession \"feasible\" if all of the buyers satisfy their respective demands. If\nall trading sessions are feasible the graph is deemed \"successful\", otherwise\nthe feasibility of a trading session depends on the order of the sequence of\nexchanges. We demonstrate that topology is important for the success of trading\nsessions on graphs. In particular, for the case that supply equals demand for\neach component of the graph, we prove that the graph is successful if and only\nif the graph consists of components each of which are complete bipartite. For\nthe case that supply exceeds demand, we prove that the other topologies also\ncan be made successful but with finite reserve (i.e., excess supply)\nrequirements that may grow proportional to the number of buyers. Finally, with\ncomputations for a small instance of the model, we provide an example of the\nwide range of performance in which only the connectivity varies. These results\ntaken together place limits on the improvements in performance that can be\nexpected from proposals to increase the connectivity of sparse exchange\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2010 21:29:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Vitus J.", ""], ["LaViolette", "Randall A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4744", "submitter": "Yongjoo Baek", "authors": "Yongjoo Baek, Sang Hoon Lee, Hawoong Jeong", "title": "Market behavior and performance of different strategy evaluation schemes", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This study investigates how the strategy evaluation\nschemes adopted by agents affect their performance in conjunction with the\nmarket circumstances. We observe the performance of three strategy evaluation\nschemes, the history-dependent wealth game, the trend-opposing minority game,\nand the trend-following majority game, in a stock market where the price is\nexogenously determined. The price is either directly adopted from the real\nstock market indices or generated with a Markov chain of order $\\le 2$. Each\nscheme's success is quantified by average wealth accumulated by the traders\nequipped with the scheme. The wealth game, as it learns from the history, shows\nrelatively good performance unless the market is highly unpredictable. The\nmajority game is successful in a trendy market dominated by long periods of\nsustained price increase or decrease. On the other hand, the minority game is\nsuitable for a market with persistent zig-zag price patterns. We also discuss\nthe consequence of implementing finite memory in the scoring processes of\nstrategies. Our findings suggest under which market circumstances each\nevaluation scheme is appropriate for modeling the behavior of real market\ntraders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2010 10:49:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Baek", "Yongjoo", ""], ["Lee", "Sang Hoon", ""], ["Jeong", "Hawoong", ""]]}]
