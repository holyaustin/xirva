The effect of the agent's trades on $U$ is referred to as\ncross-impact. By solving the agent's stochastic control problem, we obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal strategy when the agent holds a linear\nposition in $U$. When the exposure to the non-tradable risk factor $\\psi(U_T)$\nis non-linear, we provide an approximation to the optimal strategy in\nclosed-form, and prove that the value function is correctly approximated by\nthis strategy when cross-impact and risk-aversion are small. We further prove\nthat when $\\psi(U_T)$ is non-linear, the approximate optimal strategy can be\nwritten in terms of the optimal strategy for a linear exposure with the size of\nthe position changing dynamically according to the exposure's \"Delta\" under a\nparticular probability measure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 19:00:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2020 18:58:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cartea", "Alvaro", ""], ["Donnelly", "Ryan", ""], ["Jaimungal", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.02646", "submitter": "Yang Zhang", "authors": "Jingyuan Wang, Yang Zhang, Ke Tang, Junjie Wu and Zhang Xiong", "title": "AlphaStock: A Buying-Winners-and-Selling-Losers Investment Strategy\n  using Interpretable Deep Reinforcement Attention Networks", "comments": "Accepted for POSTER presentation at KDD2019 Applied Data Science\n  Track", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3292500.3330647", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent years have witnessed the successful marriage of finance innovations\nand AI techniques in various finance applications including quantitative\ntrading (QT). Despite great research efforts devoted to leveraging deep\nlearning (DL) methods for building better QT strategies, existing studies still\nface serious challenges especially from the side of finance, such as the\nbalance of risk and return, the resistance to extreme loss, and the\ninterpretability of strategies, which limit the application of DL-based\nstrategies in real-life financial markets. In this work, we propose AlphaStock,\na novel reinforcement learning (RL) based investment strategy enhanced by\ninterpretable deep attention networks, to address the above challenges. Our\nmain contributions are summarized as follows: i) We integrate deep attention\nnetworks with a Sharpe ratio-oriented reinforcement learning framework to\nachieve a risk-return balanced investment strategy; ii) We suggest modeling\ninterrelationships among assets to avoid selection bias and develop a\ncross-asset attention mechanism; iii) To our best knowledge, this work is among\nthe first to offer an interpretable investment strategy using deep\nreinforcement learning models. The experiments on long-periodic U.S. and\nChinese markets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of AlphaStock over\ndiverse market states. It turns out that AlphaStock tends to select the stocks\nas winners with high long-term growth, low volatility, high intrinsic value,\nand being undervalued recently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2019 11:52:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jingyuan", ""], ["Zhang", "Yang", ""], ["Tang", "Ke", ""], ["Wu", "Junjie", ""], ["Xiong", "Zhang", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.02847", "submitter": "Oleh Danyliv", "authors": "Oleh Danyliv, Bruce Bland", "title": "An instantaneous market volatility estimation", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Working on different aspects of algorithmic trading we empirically discovered\na new market invariant.

In\nour model, the liquidity taker balances the tradeoff between missing trades and\nthe costs of walking the book.
