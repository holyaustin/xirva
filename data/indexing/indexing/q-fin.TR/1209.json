Both the stock price\nmovement and the investors' global behavior are found to be closely related to\nthe phase region they fall into. Within the region where the market impact is\nsmall, investors' asymmetric response to gains and losses leads to the\noccurrence of herd behavior, when all the investors are prone to behave\nsimilarly in an extreme way and large price fluctuations occur. A linear\nrelation between the standard deviation of stock price changes and the mean\nvalue of strategies is found. With full market impact, the investors tend to\nself-segregate into opposing groups and the introduction of asymmetric\nsensitivity leads to the disappearance of dominant strategies. Compared with\nthe situations in the stock market with little market impact, the stock price\nfluctuations are suppressed and an efficient market occurs. Theoretical\nanalyses indicate that the mechanism of phase transition from clustering to\nself-segregation in the present model is similar to that in the\nmajority-minority game and the occurrence and disappearance of efficient\nmarkets are related to the competition between the trend-following and the\ntrend-aversion forces. The clustering of the strategies in the present model\nresults from the majority-wins effect and the wealth-driven mechanism makes the\nmarket become predictable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Sep 2012 12:42:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 03:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhong", "Li-Xin", ""], ["Xu", "Wen-Juan", ""], ["Ren", "Fei", ""], ["Shi", "Yong-Dong", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4629", "submitter": "Harbir Lamba", "authors": "Harbir Lamba", "title": "The Transition from Brownian Motion to Boom-and-Bust Dynamics in\n  Financial and Economic Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quasi-equilibrium models for aggregate variables are widely-used throughout\nfinance and economics.

It is known that the market completeness is not a robust property:\nsmall random deviations of the coefficients convert a complete market model\ninto a incomplete one. The paper shows that market incompleteness is also\nnon-robust: small deviations can convert an incomplete model into a complete\none. More precisely, it is shown that, for any incomplete market from a wide\nclass of models, there exists a complete market model with arbitrarily close\npaths of the stock prices and the market parameters.
