Using data from the Spanish Stock Market, we find a\nhigh degree of heterogeneity across different market members, both in the\ninstantaneous impact functions and in the time-dependent market response to\ntrades by individual members. This heterogeneity is statistically incompatible\nwith the existence of market-wide universal impact dynamics which apply\nuniformly to all trades and suggests that rather, market dynamics emerge from\nthe complex interaction of different behaviors of market participants. Several\npossible reasons for this are discussed, along with potential extensions one\nmay consider to increase the range of applicability of existing models of\nmarket impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2011 08:05:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bladon", "Alex J.", ""], ["Moro", "Esteban", ""], ["Galla", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0435", "submitter": "Richard Pincak", "authors": "Richard Pincak and Marian Repasan", "title": "The string prediction models as an invariants of time series in forex\n  market", "comments": "SORS Research a.s, 040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic, 14 pages, 11\n  figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 392 (2013) 6414-6426", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2013.07.048", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we apply a new approach of the string theory to the real\nfinancial market. It is direct extension and application of the work [1] into\nprediction of prices. The models are constructed with an idea of prediction\nmodels based on the string invariants (PMBSI). The performance of PMBSI is\ncompared to support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN)\non an artificial and a financial time series. Brief overview of the results and\nanalysis is given. The first model is based on the correlation function as\ninvariant and the second one is an application based on the deviations from the\nclosed string/pattern form (PMBCS). We found the difference between these two\napproaches. The first model cannot predict the behavior of the forex market\nwith good efficiency in comparison with the second one which is, in addition,\nable to make relevant profit per year.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2011 13:15:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2012 13:39:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pincak", "Richard", ""], ["Repasan", "Marian", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.2631", "submitter": "Antje Fruth", "authors": "Antje Fruth and Torsten Schoeneborn and Mikhail Urusov", "title": "Optimal trade execution and price manipulation in order books with\n  time-varying liquidity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In financial markets, liquidity is not constant over time but exhibits strong\nseasonal patterns.

In a first model variant,\nwe propose a trading dependent spread that increases when market orders are\nmatched against the order book. In this model no price manipulation occurs and\nthe optimal strategy is of the wait region - buy region type often encountered\nin singular control problems. In a second model, we assume that there is no\nspread in the order book. Under this assumption we find that price manipulation\ncan occur, depending on the model parameters.
