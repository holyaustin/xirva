For simplicity the\ninterest rate is assumed zero. If the price path is assumed continuous, the\ntrader can become infinitely rich immediately after it becomes non-constant (if\nit ever does). If it is assumed positive, he can become infinitely rich\nimmediately after reaching a point in time such that the variation of the log\nprice is infinite in any right neighbourhood of that point (whereas reaching a\npoint in time such that the variation of the log price is infinite in any left\nneighbourhood of that point is not sufficient). The practical value of these\nschemes is tempered by their use of the Axiom of Choice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 05:46:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2016 10:25:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 08:23:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Vovk", "Vladimir", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.01824", "submitter": "Dieter Hendricks", "authors": "Roger Martins, Dieter Hendricks", "title": "The statistical significance of multivariate Hawkes processes fitted to\n  limit order book data", "comments": "22 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables, added more detailed results", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hawkes processes have seen a number of applications in finance, due to their\nability to capture event clustering behaviour typically observed in financial\nsystems.

We investigate the application of a multivariate\nHawkes process with a sum-of-exponentials kernel and piecewise-linear\nexogeneity factors, fitted to liquidity demand and replenishment events\nextracted from limit order book data. We consider one-, two- and\nthree-exponential kernels, applying various tests to ascertain goodness-of-fit\nand stationarity of residuals, as well as stability of the calibration\nprocedure.

Part I of this\npaper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price\ndynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns\non the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider\nthe order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point\ncorrelations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the\nmodel. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a\nso-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced\noriginally by Raftery (1985). We distinguish between price-changing and non\nprice-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce\nthe order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random\nvariable. The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order\nMarkov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional\ncorrelation functions between signed events for both small and large tick\nstocks and signature plots. From a methodological viewpoint, we discuss a novel\nand flexible way to calibrate a large class of MTD models with a very large\nnumber of parameters. In spite of this large number of parameters, an\nout-of-sample analysis confirms that the model does not overfit the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 07:59:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Taranto", "Damian Eduardo", ""], ["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Toth", "Bence", ""]]}]
