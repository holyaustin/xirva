We find\nthat limit order placement inside the spread is strongly determined by the\ndynamics of the spread size. Most orders, however, arrive outside of the\nspread. While for some stocks order placement on or next to the quotes is\ndominating, deeper price levels are more important for other stocks. As market\norders are usually adjusted to the quote volume, the impact of market orders\ndepends on the orderbook structure, which we find to be quite diverse among the\nanalyzed stocks as a result of the way limit order placement takes place.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 16:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Theissen", "Martin", ""], ["Krause", "Sebastian M.", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.05315", "submitter": "Alessio Sancetta", "authors": "Alessio Sancetta", "title": "Estimation for the Prediction of Point Processes with Many Covariates", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST q-fin.TR stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Estimation of the intensity of a point process is considered within a\nnonparametric framework. The intensity measure is unknown and depends on\ncovariates, possibly many more than the observed number of jumps. Only a single\ntrajectory of the counting process is observed.

The impact of the covariates is\nmodelled by an additive model where each component can be written as a linear\ncombination of possibly unknown functions. The focus is on prediction as\nopposed to variable screening. Conditions are imposed on the coefficients of\nthis linear combination in order to control the estimation error. The rates of\nconvergence are optimal when the number of active covariates is large.

Following closely these authors, our\nmain result shows by a similar argument as usually applied in physics the\nfollowing remarkable fact. If the market impact of a meta-order only depends on\nfour well-defined and financially meaningful variables, then -- up to a\nconstant -- there is only one possible form of this dependence. In particular,\nthe market impact is proportional to the square-root of the size of the\nmeta-order.\n  This theorem can be regarded as a special case of a more general result of\nKyle and Obizhaeva. These authors consider five variables which might have an\ninfluence on the size of the market impact. In this case one finds a richer\nvariety of possible functional relations which we precisely characterize.
