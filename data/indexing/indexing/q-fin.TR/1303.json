Further, magnitudes of price changes are\ncorrelated over long times. These so called stylized facts are quantified by\nscaling laws similar to, for example, turbulent fluids. They are believed to\nreflect the complex interactions of heterogenous agents which give rise to\nirrational herding. Therefore, the stylized facts have been argued to provide\nevidence against the efficient market hypothesis which states that prices\nrapidly reflect available information and therefore are described by a\nmartingale. Here we show, that in very simple bidding processes efficiency is\nnot opposed to, but causative to scaling properties observed in real markets.\nThereby, we link the stylized facts not only to price efficiency, but also to\nthe economic theory of rational bubbles. We then demonstrate effects predicted\nfrom our normative model in the dynamics of groups of real human subjects\nplaying a modified minority game.

A popular idea that is based on this seemingly\nintuitive notion is to dampen electric power fluctuations from fluctuating\nsources (as e.g. wind or solar) via a market mechanism, namely by variable\npower prices that adapt demand to supply. The standard model of an average\neconomic agent predicts that fluctuations are reduced by such an adaptive\npricing mechanism.\n  However, the underlying assumption that the actions of all agents average out\non the time axis is not always true in a market of many agents. We numerically\nstudy an econophysics agent model of an adaptive power market that does not\nassume averaging a priori. We find that when agents are exposed to source noise\nvia correlated price fluctuations (as adaptive pricing schemes suggest), the\nmarket may amplify those fluctuations. In particular, small price changes may\ntranslate to large load fluctuations through catastrophic consumer\nsynchronization. As a result, an adaptive power market may cause the opposite\neffect than intended: Power fluctuations are not dampened but amplified\ninstead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Mar 2013 20:53:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Krause", "Sebastian M.", ""], ["Boerries", "Stefan", ""], ["Bornholdt", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.3133", "submitter": "Shilei Wang", "authors": "Shilei Wang", "title": "Dynamical Trading Mechanism in Limit Order Markets", "comments": "27 pages", "journal-ref": "Algorithm.

Our new model admits several state variables (e.g. market\nspread, stochastic volatility and intensities of market orders) provided the\nfull system is Markov. The solution of the corresponding HJB equation is exact\nin the case of zero inventory risk. The inventory risk enters into play in two\nways: a path-dependent penalty based on the volatility and a penalty at expiry\nbased on the market spread. We perform perturbation methods on the inventory\nrisk parameter and obtain explicitly the solution and its controls up to first\norder. We also include transaction costs; we show that the spread of the\nmarket-maker is widened to compensate the transaction costs, but the expected\ngain per traded spread remains constant. We perform several numerical\nsimulations to assess the effect of the parameters on the PNL, showing in\nparticular how the directional bet and the inventory risk change the shape of\nthe PNL density. Finally, we extend our results to the case of multi-aset\nmarket-making strategies; we show that the correct notion of inventory risk is\nthe L2-norm of the (multi-dimensional) inventory with respect to the inventory\npenalties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 16:59:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 06:50:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fodra", "Pietro", ""], ["Labadie", "Mauricio", ""]]}]
