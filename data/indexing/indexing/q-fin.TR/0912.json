This makes it impossible to validate agent-based models, which are\nthus reverse-engineering attempts. This work is a contribution to the building\nof a set of stylized facts about the traders themselves. Using the client\ndatabase of Swissquote Bank SA, the largest on-line Swiss broker, we find\nempirical relationships between turnover, account values and the number of\nassets in which a trader is invested. A theory based on simple mean-variance\nportfolio optimization that crucially includes variable transaction costs is\nable to reproduce faithfully the observed behaviors. We finally argue that our\nresults bring into light the collective ability of a population to construct a\nmean-variance portfolio that takes into account the structure of transaction\ncosts\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2009 20:28:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Jun 2010 14:26:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Jun 2010 18:21:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["de Lachapelle", "David Morton", ""], ["Challet", "Damien", ""]]}]
