We revisit some modifications of well-known models, starting\nwith the Bak-Paczuski-Shubik model. We look at the four decades old Stigler\nmodel and investigate its variants. One of them is the simplified version of\nthe Genoa artificial market. The list of studied models is completed by the\nmodels of Maslov and Daniels et al. Generically, in all cases we compare the\nreturn distribution, absolute return autocorrelation and the value of the Hurst\nexponent. It turns out that none of the models reproduces satisfactorily all\nthe empirical data, but the most promising candidates for further development\nare the Genoa artificial market and the Maslov model with moderate order\nevaporation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2008 16:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Slanina", "Frantisek", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3043", "submitter": "Mauro Politi", "authors": "Mauro Politi and Enrico Scalas", "title": "Activity spectrum from waiting-time distribution", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 383 (2007) 43-48", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2007.04.086", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  In high frequency financial data not only returns but also waiting times\nbetween trades are random variables.
