To correct a common mistake in the literature, we emphasize that the\nmarket value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky value rather than\na risk-free value.

The joint co-impact of\nmultiple contemporaneous metaorders depends on the total number of metaorders\nand their mutual sign correlation.

Given the vast amount of macroeconomic factors affecting the\nprice of crude oil such as supply of oil from OPEC countries, demand of oil\nfrom OECD countries, geopolitical and geoeconomic changes among many other\nvariables - probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) allow us to understand by\nlearning the graphical structure. This dissertation proposes condensing data\nnumerous Crude Oil factors into a graphical model in the attempt of creating a\naccurate forecast of the price of crude oil.\n  The research project experiments with using different libraries in Python in\norder to construct models of the crude oil market. The experiments in this\nthesis investigate three main challenges commonly presented while trading oil\nin the financial markets. The first challenge it investigates is the process of\nlearning the structure of the oil markets; thus allowing crude oil traders to\nunderstand the different physical market factors and macroeconomic indicators\naffecting crude oil markets and how they are \\textit{causally} related. The\nsecond challenge it solves is the exploration and exploitation of the available\ndata and the learnt structure in predicting the behaviour of the oil markets.\nThe third challenge it investigates is how to validate the performance and\nreliability of the constructed model in order for it to be deployed in the\nfinancial markets.\n  A design and implementation of a probabilistic framework for forecasting the\nprice of crude oil is also presented as part of the research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2018 04:42:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Alvi", "Danish A.", ""]]}]
