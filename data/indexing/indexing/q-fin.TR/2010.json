Other models such as ARIMA were used as benchmark. Empirical results\nmanifest the practical challenges when using LSTM for forecasting stocks. One\nof the main upheavals was a recurring lag which we called \"forecasting lag\".\n  The second purpose is to develop a more general and objective perspective on\nthe task of time series forecasting so that it could be applied to assist in an\narbitrary that of forecasting by ANNs. Thus, attempts are made for\ndistinguishing previous works by certain criteria (introduced by a review paper\nwritten by Ahmed Tealab) so as to summarise those including effective\ninformation. The summarised information is then unified and expressed through a\ncommon terminology that can be applied to different steps of a time series\nforecasting task.\n  The last but not least purpose of this thesis is to elaborate on a\nmathematical framework on which ANNs are based. We are going to use the\nframework introduced in the book \"Neural Networks in Mathematical Framework\" by\nAnthony L. Caterini in which the structure of a generic neural network is\nintroduced and the gradient descent algorithm (which incorporates\nbackpropagation) is introduced in terms of their described framework. In the\nend, we use this framework for a specific architecture, which is recurrent\nneural networks on which we concentrated and our implementations are based.
