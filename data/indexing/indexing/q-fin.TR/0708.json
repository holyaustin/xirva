We prove that an investor can\nessentially force that the asset price path behaves with the variation exponent\nexactly equal to two. Our proof is based on embedding high-frequency\ndiscrete-time games into the continuous-time game and the use of the Bayesian\nstrategy of Kumon, Takemura and Takeuchi (Stoch. Anal. Appl. 26 (2008)\n1161--1180) for discrete-time coin-tossing games. We also show that the main\ngrowth part of the investor's capital processes is clearly described by the\ninformation quantities, which are derived from the Kullback--Leibler\ninformation with respect to the empirical fluctuation of the asset price.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2007 13:16:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 11:42:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Takeuchi", "Kei", ""], ["Kumon", "Masayuki", ""], ["Takemura", "Akimichi", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1756", "submitter": "Alfonsi Aurelien", "authors": "Aur\\'elien Alfonsi (CERMICS), Antje Fruth, Alexander Schied", "title": "Optimal execution strategies in limit order books with general shape\n  functions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider optimal execution strategies for block market orders placed in a\nlimit order book (LOB). We build on the resilience model proposed by Obizhaeva\nand Wang (2005) but allow for a general shape of the LOB defined via a given\ndensity function. Thus, we can allow for empirically observed LOB shapes and\nobtain a nonlinear price impact of market orders. We distinguish two\npossibilities for modeling the resilience of the LOB after a large market\norder: the exponential recovery of the number of limit orders, i.e., of the\nvolume of the LOB, or the exponential recovery of the bid-ask spread. We\nconsider both of these resilience modes and, in each case, derive explicit\noptimal execution strategies in discrete time. Applying our results to a\nblock-shaped LOB, we obtain a new closed-form representation for the optimal\nstrategy, which explicitly solves the recursive scheme given in Obizhaeva and\nWang (2005). We also provide some evidence for the robustness of optimal\nstrategies with respect to the choice of the shape function and the\nresilience-type.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2007 19:11:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2007 13:43:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 15:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Alfonsi", "Aur\u00e9lien", "", "CERMICS"], ["Fruth", "Antje", ""], ["Schied", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.3198", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Universal price impact functions of individual trades in an order-driven\n  market", "comments": "17 pages + supplementary figures.

Econophysical analyses of transaction data for the US and Australian\nstock markets have uncovered market-specific scaling laws, where a master curve\nof price impact can be obtained in each market when stock capitalization $C$ is\nincluded as an argument in the scaling relation. However, the rationale of\nintroducing stock capitalization in the scaling is unclear and the anomalous\nnegative correlation between price change $r$ and trade size $\\omega$ for small\ntrades is unexplained. Here we show that these issues can be addressed by\ntaking into account the aggressiveness of orders that result in trades together\nwith a proper normalization technique. Using order book data from the Chinese\nmarket, we show that trades from filled and partially filled limit orders have\nvery different price impact. The price impact of trades from partially filled\norders is constant when the volume is not too large, while that of filled\norders shows power-law behavior $r\\sim \\omega^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha\\approx2/3$.\nWhen returns and volumes are normalized by stock-dependent averages,\ncapitalization-independent scaling laws emerge for both types of trades.\nHowever, no scaling relation in terms of stock capitalization can be\nconstructed. In addition, the relation $\\alpha=\\alpha_\\omega/\\alpha_r$ is\nverified, where $\\alpha_\\omega$ and $\\alpha_r$ are the tail exponents of trade\nsizes and returns. These observations also enable us to explain the anomalous\nnegative correlation between $r$ and $\\omega$ for small-size trades. We\nanticipate that these regularities may hold in other order-driven markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Aug 2007 16:55:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2008 14:36:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}]
