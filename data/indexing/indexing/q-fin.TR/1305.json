Our model is based on Markov renewal processes. We consider\na point process associated to the timestamps of the price jumps, and marks\nassociated to price increments. By modeling the marks with a suitable Markov\nchain, we can reproduce the strong mean-reversion of price returns known as\nmicrostructure noise. Moreover, by using Markov renewal processes, we can model\nthe presence of spikes in intensity of market activity, i.e. the volatility\nclustering, and consider dependence between price increments and jump times. We\nalso provide simple parametric and nonparametric statistical procedures for the\nestimation of our model. We obtain closed-form formula for the mean signature\nplot, and show the diffusive behavior of our model at large scale limit. We\nillustrate our results by numerical simulations, and that our model is\nconsistent with empirical data on the Euribor future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 06:38:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Fodra", "Pietro", "", "LPMA"], ["Pham", "Huy\u00ean", "", "LPMA"]]}, {"id": "1305.0413", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "title": "Permanent market impact can be nonlinear", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are two schools of thought regarding market impact modeling. On the one\nhand, seminal papers by Almgren and Chriss introduced a decomposition between a\npermanent market impact and a temporary (or instantaneous) market impact. This\ndecomposition is used by most practitioners in execution models. On the other\nhand, recent research advocates for the use of a new modeling framework that\ngoes down to the resilient dynamics of order books: transient market impact.\nOne of the main criticisms against permanent market impact is that it has to be\nlinear to avoid dynamic arbitrage. This important discovery made by Huberman\nand Stanzl and Gatheral favors the transient market impact framework, as linear\npermanent market impact is at odds with reality. In this paper, we reconsider\nthe point made by Gatheral using a simple model for market impact and show that\npermanent market impact can be nonlinear. Also, and this is the most important\npart from a practical point of view, we propose different statistics to\nestimate permanent market impact and execution costs that generalize the ones\nproposed in Almgren at al.

According to the model, in markets\nwith Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient\nliquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations\ncorresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these\nsituations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price.\nHowever this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional\nInvestors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the\nnew situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher\ntrading costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 20:36:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2013 15:28:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 9 Mar 2014 07:42:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 8 Aug 2015 06:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lachapelle", "Aim\u00e9", ""], ["Lasry", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Lions", "Pierre-Louis", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6541", "submitter": "Stefan Ankirchner", "authors": "Stefan Ankirchner and Monique Jeanblanc and Thomas Kruse", "title": "BSDEs with singular terminal condition and control problems with\n  constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a probabilistic solution of a not necessarily Markovian control\nproblem with a state constraint by means of a Backward Stochastic Differential\nEquation (BSDE).
