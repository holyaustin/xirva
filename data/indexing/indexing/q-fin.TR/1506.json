This is especially important for computational finance, where digital\ntraces of human behavior offer a great potential to drive trading strategies.\nWe contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates\nvarious datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to\nderive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading\nstrategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a\ncryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we\ninclude economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of\nthe Bitcoin technology, and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social\nsignals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence,\nand opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more\nthan 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and\nexchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence\nprecedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these\ninsights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very\nhigh profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust\nstatistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming\nthe long-standing hypothesis that trading based social media sentiment has the\npotential to yield positive returns on investment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 09:01:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 10:41:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia", "David", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.02507", "submitter": "Thibault Jaisson", "authors": "Thibault Jaisson", "title": "Liquidity and Impact in Fair Markets", "comments": "19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a theory which applies to any market dynamics that satisfy a fair\nmarket assumption on the nullity of the average profit of simple market making\nstrategies.

Since both curves are generically\nregular, the response to small perturbations is linearly small. However, a\ncrucial ingredient is absent of the theory, namely transactions themselves.\nWhat happens after they occur? To answer the question, we develop a dynamic\ntheory for supply and demand based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs. When\nthe inter-auction time is infinitely long, the Walrasian mechanism is\nrecovered. When transactions are allowed to happen in continuous time, a\npeculiar property emerges: close to the price, supply and demand vanish\nquadratically, which we empirically confirm on the Bitcoin. This explains why\nprice impact in financial markets is universally observed to behave as the\nsquare root of the excess volume. The consequences are important, as they imply\nthat the very fact of clearing the market makes prices hypersensitive to small\nfluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 17:47:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Donier", "Jonathan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.05376", "submitter": "Jonathan Budd", "authors": "Jonathan K.

We derive its Laplace transform, assuming\nthat purchases are made according to a marked point process and that there is a\nsimplified balance control policy in place to prevent the credit limit being\nexceeded. We calculate optimal limits for a compound Poisson process example\nand show that the optimal limit scales with the distribution of the purchasing\nprocess and that the probability of exceeding the optimal limit remains\nconstant. We establish a connection with the classic newsvendor model and use\nthis to calculate bounds on the optimal limit for a more complicated balance\ncontrol policy.
