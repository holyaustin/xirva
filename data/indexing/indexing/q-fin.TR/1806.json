We assume that brokers are risk-neutral and they quote\nspreads so that losses to latency arbitrageurs (LAs) are recovered from other\ntraders in the FX market. These losses are reduced if the broker can reject,\nex-post, loss-making trades by enforcing the Last Look option which is a\nfeature of some trading venues in FX markets. For a given rejection threshold\nthe risk-neutral broker quotes a spread to the market so that her expected\nprofits are zero. When there is only one venue, we find that the Last Look\noption reduces quoted spreads. If there are two venues we show that the market\nreaches an equilibrium where traders have no incentive to migrate. The\nequilibrium can be reached with both venues coexisting, or with only one venue\nsurviving. Moreover, when one venue enforces Last Look and the other one does\nnot, counterintuitively, it may be the case that the Last Look venue quotes\nlarger spreads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2018 12:19:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cartea", "Alvaro", ""], ["Jaimungal", "Sebastian", ""], ["Walton", "Jamie", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.04472", "submitter": "Sebastian Jaimungal", "authors": "Philippe Casgrain, Sebastian Jaimungal", "title": "Trading algorithms with learning in latent alpha models", "comments": "42 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Mathematical Finance, Forthcoming, 2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.ST q-fin.TR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Alpha signals for statistical arbitrage strategies are often driven by latent\nfactors.
