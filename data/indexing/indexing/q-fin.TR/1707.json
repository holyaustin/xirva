We present an\nempirical analysis showing that the type of the last order significantly alters\nthe submission rate of immediate future orders, even after accounting for the\nstate of the LOB. To model these effects jointly we introduce a discrete Markov\nchain model. Then on these improved LOB dynamics, we find the policy for\noptimal order choice and placement in the share purchasing problem by framing\nit as a Markov decision process. The optimal policy derived numerically uses\nlimit orders, cancellations and market orders. It looks to exploit the state of\nthe LOB summarized by the volume at the bid/ask and the type of the most recent\norder to obtain the best execution price, avoiding non-execution and adverse\nselection risk simultaneously. Market orders are used aggressively when the\nmid-price is expected to move adversely. Limit orders are placed under\nfavorable LOB conditions and canceled when non-execution or adverse selection\nprobability is high. Using ultra high-frequency data from the NASDAQ stock\nexchange we compare our optimal policy with other submission strategies that\nuse a subset of all available order types and show that ours significantly\noutperforms them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 22:32:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Oct 2017 20:27:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Gonzalez", "Federico", ""], ["Schervish", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.03498", "submitter": "Yerkin Kitapbayev", "authors": "Yerkin Kitapbayev and Tim Leung", "title": "Mean Reversion Trading with Sequential Deadlines and Transaction Costs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the optimal timing strategies for trading a mean-reverting price\nprocess with afinite deadline to enter and a separate finite deadline to exit\nthe market.
