We find that (i) the volume\ndistribution of off-book transactions has a significantly fatter tail than the\none of on-book transactions, (ii) groups of members and non-members can be\nclassified in categories according to their trading profile (iii) there is a\nstrong anticorrelation between the daily inventory variation of a market member\ndue to the on-book market transactions and inventory variation due to the\noff-book market transactions with non-members, and (iv) the autocorrelation of\nthe sign of the orders of non-members in the off-book market is slowly\ndecaying. We also analyze the on-book price impact function over time, both for\npositive and negative lags, of the electronic trades and of the off-book\ntrades. The unconditional impact curves are very different for the electronic\ntrades and the off-book trades. Moreover there is a small dependence of impact\non the volume for the on-book electronic trades, while the shape and magnitude\nof impact function of off-book transactions strongly depend on volume.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 14:01:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Carollo", "Angelo", ""], ["Vaglica", "Gabriella", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Mantegna", "Rosario N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.4230", "submitter": "Deepak Dhar", "authors": "Deepak Dhar, V.

There are N agents. Each has to\nchoose between one of two alternatives everyday, and there is reward to each\nmember of the smaller group. The agents cannot communicate with each other, but\ntry to guess the choice others will make, based only the past history of number\nof people choosing the two alternatives. We describe a simple probabilistic\nstrategy using which the agents acting independently, can still maximize the\naverage number of people benefitting every day. The strategy leads to a very\nefficient utilization of resources, and the average deviation from the maximum\npossible can be made of order $(N^{\\epsilon})$, for any $\\epsilon >0$. We also\nshow that a single agent does not expect to gain by not following the strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Feb 2011 14:04:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Dhar", "Deepak", ""], ["Sasidevan", "V.", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "Bikas K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5457", "submitter": "Austin Gerig", "authors": "J.

Market impact is empirically observed to be a concave function\nof metaorder size, i.e., the impact per share of large metaorders is smaller\nthan that of small metaorders. We formulate a stylized model of an algorithmic\nexecution service and derive a fair pricing condition, which says that the\naverage transaction price of the metaorder is equal to the price after trading\nis completed. We show that at equilibrium the distribution of trading volume\nadjusts to reflect information, and dictates the shape of the impact function.\nThe resulting theory makes empirically testable predictions for the functional\nform of both the temporary and permanent components of market impact. Based on\nthe commonly observed asymptotic distribution for the volume of large trades,\nit says that market impact should increase asymptotically roughly as the square\nroot of metaorder size, with average permanent impact relaxing to about two\nthirds of peak impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 22:31:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Jan 2012 03:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2013 17:18:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 20:50:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Farmer", "J.
