We find\nthat on relatively large time scales (15 minutes) large price fluctuations are\nconnected to the failure of the subtle mechanism of compensation between the\nflows of market and limit orders: in other words, the missed revelation of the\nlatent order book breaks the dynamical equilibrium between the flows,\ntriggering the large price jumps. On smaller time scales (30 seconds), instead,\nthe static depletion of the limit order book is an indicator of an intrinsic\nfragility of the system, which is related to a strongly non linear enhancement\nof the response. In order to quantify this phenomenon we introduce a measure of\nthe liquidity imbalance present in the book and we show that it is correlated\nto both the sign and the magnitude of the next price movement. These findings\nprovide a quantitative definition of the effective liquidity, which results to\nbe strongly dependent on the considered time scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Apr 2015 11:18:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Corradi", "Francesco", ""], ["Zaccaria", "Andrea", ""], ["Pietronero", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.03100", "submitter": "Thibault Jaisson", "authors": "Thibault Jaisson and Mathieu Rosenbaum", "title": "Rough fractional diffusions as scaling limits of nearly unstable heavy\n  tailed Hawkes processes", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the asymptotic behavior as time goes to infinity of Hawkes\nprocesses whose regression kernel has $L^1$ norm close to one and power law\ntail of the form $x^{-(1+\\alpha)}$, with $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.

The result shows that for SSCI, technical trading\nrules offer significant profitability, while for SHSZ 300, this ability is\nlost. We further partition the SSCI into two sub-series and find that the\nefficiency of technical trading in sub-series, which have exactly the same\nspanning period as that of SHSZ 300, is severely weakened. By testing the\ntrading rules on both indexes with a five-year moving window, we find that the\nfinancial bubble from 2005 to 2007 greatly improve the effectiveness of\ntechnical trading rules.
