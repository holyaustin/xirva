The\nprobability distributions and correlations of recurrence intervals for many\nsystems have been extensively investigated. However, the impacts of microscopic\nrules of a complex system on the macroscopic properties of its recurrence\nintervals are less studied. In this Letter, we adopt an order-driven stock\nmarket model to address this issue for stock returns. We find that the\ndistributions of the scaled recurrence intervals of simulated returns have a\npower law scaling with stretched exponential cutoff and the intervals possess\nmultifractal nature, which are consistent with empirical results. We further\ninvestigate the effects of long memory in the directions (or signs) and\nrelative prices of the order flow on the characteristic quantities of these\nproperties. It is found that the long memory in the order directions (Hurst\nindex $H_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and the\nmultifractal nature. In contrast, the power-law exponent of the interval\ndistribution increases linearly with respect to the Hurst index $H_x$ of the\nrelative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal nature\nfluctuates around a constant value when $H_x<0.7$ and then increases with\n$H_x$. No evident effects of $H_s$ and $H_x$ are found on the long memory of\nthe recurrence intervals. Our results indicate that the nontrivial properties\nof the recurrence intervals of returns are mainly caused by traders' behaviors\nof persistently placing new orders around the best bid and ask prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 18:04:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Hao", "", "ECUST"], ["Ren", "Fei", "", "ECUST"], ["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Yong-Jie", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"]]}, {"id": "1201.3580", "submitter": "Reginald Smith", "authors": "Reginald D.

However, for extremely\nlarge price changes, the trade size and news play a minor role, while the\nliquidity (especially price gaps on the limit order book) is a more influencing\nfactor. Hence, there might be other influencing factors of immediate price\nimpacts of trades. In this paper, through mechanical analysis of price\nvariations before and after a trade of arbitrary size, we identify that the\ntrade size, the bid-ask spread, the price gaps and the outstanding volumes at\nthe bid and ask sides of the limit order book have impacts on the changes of\nprices. We propose two regression models to investigate the influences of these\nmicroscopic factors on the price impact of buyer-initiated partially filled\ntrades, seller-initiated partially filled trades, buyer-initiated filled\ntrades, and seller-initiated filled trades. We find that they have\nquantitatively similar explanation powers and these factors can account for up\nto 44% of the price impacts. Large trade sizes, wide bid-ask spreads, high\nliquidity at the same side and low liquidity at the opposite side will cause a\nlarge price impact. We also find that the liquidity at the opposite side has a\nmore influencing impact than the liquidity at the same side.

At the primary venue, trading yields a linear price impact. In the dark\npool, no price impact costs arise but order execution is uncertain, modeled by\na multi-dimensional Poisson process. We characterize the costs of trading by a\nlinear-quadratic functional which incorporates both the price impact costs of\ntrading at the primary exchange and the market risk of the position. The\nliquidation constraint implies a singularity of the value function of the\nresulting minimization problem at the terminal time T. Via the HJB equation and\na quadratic ansatz, we obtain a candidate for the value function which is the\nlimit of a sequence of solutions of initial value problems for a matrix\ndifferential equation. We show that this limit exists by using an appropriate\nmatrix inequality and a comparison result for Riccati matrix equations.\nAdditionally, we obtain upper and lower bounds of the solutions of the initial\nvalue problems, which allow us to prove a verification theorem. If a single\nasset position is to be liquidated, the investor slowly trades out of her\nposition at the primary venue, with the remainder being placed in the dark pool\nat any point in time. For multi-asset liquidations this is generally not the\ncase; it can, e.g., be optimal to oversize orders in the dark pool in order to\nturn a poorly balanced portfolio into a portfolio bearing less risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 08:33:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 09:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kratz", "Peter", ""], ["Sch\u00f6neborn", "Torsten", ""]]}]
