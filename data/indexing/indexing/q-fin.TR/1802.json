This paper investigates a unique transaction dataset that\nenables us to inspect the imbalance of buying and selling on the man-times\nlevel at high frequency, what we call 'trading polarity', for a large\ncross-section of stocks from Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The trading polarity\nmeasures the market sentiment toward stocks from a view of very essence of\ntrading desire. When using the polarity to examine market crash, we find that\ntrading polarity successfully reflects the changing of market-level behavior in\nterms of its flipping times, depth, and length. We further investigate the\nrelationship between polarity and return. At market-level, trading polarity is\nnegatively correlated with returns, while at stock-level, this correlation\nchanges according to market conditions, which becomes a good signal of market\npsychology transition. Also, the significant correlation disclosed by the\nmarket polarity and market emotion implies that our presented polarity, which\nessentially calculated in the context of high-frequency trading data, can\nreal-timely reflect the sentiment of the market. The trading polarity indeed\nprovides a new way to understand and foresee the market behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Feb 2018 15:22:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Shan", ""], ["Zhao", "Jichang", ""], ["Wang", "Huiwen", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.01921", "submitter": "Damien Challet", "authors": "Damien Challet and Nikita Gourianov", "title": "Dynamical regularities of US equities opening and closing auctions", "comments": "20 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We first investigate the evolution of opening and closing auctions volumes of\nUS equities along the years.

In our previous report (arXiv:1703.06739; to appear in Phys. Rev.\nLett.), we have presented a microscopic model of trend-following high-frequency\ntraders (HFTs) and its theoretical relation to the dynamics of financial\nBrownian motion, directly supported by a data analysis of tracking trajectories\nof individual HFTs in a financial market. Here we show the mathematical\nfoundation for the HFT model paralleling to the traditional kinetic theory in\nstatistical physics. We first derive the time-evolution equation for the\nphase-space distribution for the HFT model exactly, which corresponds to the\nLiouville equation in conventional analytical mechanics. By a systematic\nreduction of the Liouville equation for the HFT model, the\nBogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchal equations are derived for\nfinancial Brownian motion. We then derive the Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like\nequations for the order-book and the price dynamics by making the assumption of\nmolecular chaos. The qualitative behavior of the model is asymptotically\nstudied by solving the Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like equations for the large\nnumber of HFTs, which is numerically validated through the Monte-Carlo\nsimulation.
