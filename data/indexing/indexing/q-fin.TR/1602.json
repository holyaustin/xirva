However, the evolutionary behavior of LOB\nresilience around liquidity shocks is not well understood empirically. Using\norder flow data sets of Chinese stocks, we quantify and compare the LOB\ndynamics characterized by the bid-ask spread, the LOB depth and the order\nintensity surrounding effective market orders with different aggressiveness. We\nfind that traders are more likely to submit effective market orders when the\nspreads are relatively low, the same-side depth is high, and the opposite-side\ndepth is low. Such phenomenon is especially significant when the initial spread\nis 1 tick. Although the resiliency patterns show obvious diversity after\ndifferent types of market orders, the spread and depth can return to the sample\naverage within 20 best limit updates. The price resiliency behavior is dominant\nafter aggressive market orders, while the price continuation behavior is\ndominant after less-aggressive market orders. Moreover, the effective market\norders produce asymmetrical stimulus to limit orders when the initial spreads\nequal to 1 tick. Under this case, effective buy market orders attract more buy\nlimit orders and effective sell market orders attract more sell limit orders.\nThe resiliency behavior of spread and depth is linked to limit order intensity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 22:26:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 08:29:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Hai-Chuan", "", "ECUST"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Stanley", "H Eugene", "", "BU"]]}, {"id": "1602.00839", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "A Tale of Two Consequences: Intended and Unintended Outcomes of the\n  Japan TOPIX Tick Size Changes", "comments": "This version has a mathematical proof to show conditions under which\n  endogeneity is resolved when doing a regression.

The Transient Impact Model\n(TIM) posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear\ncombination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a\nso-called propagator function. An alternative description -- the History\nDependent Impact Model (HDIM) -- assumes that the deviation between the\nrealised order sign and its expected level impacts the price linearly and\npermanently. The two models, however, should be extended since prices are a\npriori influenced not only by the past order flow, but also by the past\nrealisation of returns themselves. In this paper, we propose a two-event\nframework, where price-changing and non price-changing events are considered\nseparately. Two-event propagator models provide a remarkable improvement of the\ndescription of the market impact, especially for large tick stocks, where the\nevents of price changes are very rare and very informative. Specifically the\nextended approach captures the excess anti-correlation between past returns and\nsubsequent order flow which is missing in one-event models. Our results\ndocument the superior performances of the HDIMs even though only in minor\nrelative terms compared to TIMs. This is somewhat surprising, because HDIMs are\nwell grounded theoretically, while TIMs are, strictly speaking, inconsistent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2016 20:37:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Taranto", "Damian Eduardo", ""], ["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Toth", "Bence", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.03011", "submitter": "Michael Benzaquen", "authors": "Michael Benzaquen, Jonathan Donier, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "title": "Unravelling the trading invariance hypothesis", "comments": "11 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We confirm and substantially extend the recent empirical result of Andersen\net al. \\cite{Andersen2015}, where it is shown that the amount of risk $W$\nexchanged in the E-mini S\\&P futures market (i.e. price times volume times\nvolatility) scales like the 3/2 power of the number of trades $N$.
