An analysis of data from the NYSE order book points out that\ntraders' strategies contribute to this asymmetry. We also investigate this\nphenomenon in the framework of a microscopic model and, by introducing a\nnon-uniform deposition mechanism for limit orders, we are able to\nquantitatively reproduce the asymmetry found in the experimental data.\nSimulations of our model also show a realistic dynamics with a sort of\nintermittent behavior characterized by long periods in which the order book is\ncompact and liquid interrupted by volatile configurations. The order placement\nstrategies produce a non-trivial behavior of the spread relaxation dynamics\nwhich is similar to the one observed in real markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Jun 2009 20:19:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 15:33:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 May 2010 10:27:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zaccaria", "A.", ""], ["Cristelli", "M.", ""], ["Alfi", "V.", ""], ["Ciulla", "F.", ""], ["Pietronero", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1444", "submitter": "Yacine A\\\"{\\i}t-Sahalia", "authors": "Yacine A\\\"it-Sahalia, Jialin Yu", "title": "High frequency market microstructure noise estimates and liquidity\n  measures", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOAS200 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2009, Vol. 3, No. 1, 422-457", "doi": "10.1214/08-AOAS200", "report-no": "IMS-AOAS-AOAS200", "categories": "stat.AP q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using recent advances in the econometrics literature, we disentangle from\nhigh frequency observations on the transaction prices of a large sample of NYSE\nstocks a fundamental component and a microstructure noise component.
