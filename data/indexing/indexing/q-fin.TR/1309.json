At the economic crisis due to disasters or\ninternational disputes, the stock price suddenly drops. The macroscopic\nphenomena should be explained from the corresponding microscopic view point\nbecause there are existing a huge number of active traders behind the crushes.\nHence, here we attempt to model the artificial financial market in which each\ntrader $i$ can choose his/her decision among `buying', `selling' or `staying\n(taking a wait-and-see attitude)', each of which corresponds to a realization\nof the three state Ising spin, namely, $S_{i}=+1$, -1 and $S_{i}=0$,\nrespectively. The decision making of traders is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann\ndistribution with the energy function. The energy function contains three\ndistinct terms, namely, the ferromagnetic two-body interaction term (endogenous\ninformation), random field term as external information (exogenous news), and\nchemical potential term which controls the number of traders who are watching\nthe market calmly at the instance. We specify the details of the model system\nfrom the past financial market data to determine the conjugate hyper-parameters\nand draw each parameter flow as a function of time-step. Especially we will\nexamine to what extent one can characterize the crisis by means of a brand-new\norder parameter --- `turnover' --- which is defined as the number of active\ntraders who post their decisions $S_{i}=1,-1$, instead of $S_{i}=0$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2013 15:42:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Murota", "Mitsuaki", ""], ["Inoue", "Jun-ichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.5046", "submitter": "Jackie Shen", "authors": "Jackie Jianhong Shen", "title": "A Pre-Trade Algorithmic Trading Model under Given Volume Measures and\n  Generic Price Dynamics (GVM-GPD)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We make several improvements to the mean-variance framework for optimal\npre-trade algorithmic execution, by working with volume measures and generic\nprice dynamics. Volume measures are the continuum analogies for discrete volume\nprofiles commonly implemented in the execution industry.

The four impact cost components are all consistently built upon the\nPoV function. Some novel efforts are made for these linear impact models by\nhaving market signals more properly expressed. For the opportunistic cost, we\nare able to go beyond the conventional Brownian-type motions. By working\ndirectly with the auto-covariances of the price dynamics, we remove the\nMarkovian restriction associated with Brownians and thus allow potential memory\neffects in the price dynamics. In combination, the final execution model\nbecomes a constrained quadratic programming problem in infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. Important linear constraints such as participation capping are\nall permissible.
