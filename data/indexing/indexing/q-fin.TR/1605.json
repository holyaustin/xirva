In addition, under proper assumptions, they\nare able to reproduce the price peak at the end of November 2013, its next fall\nin April 2014, the generation of Bitcoins, the hashing capability, the power\nconsumption, and the mining hardware and electrical energy expenses of the\nBitcoin network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 17:20:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cocco", "Luisanna", ""], ["Marchesi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01862", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "title": "Optimal market making", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Market makers provide liquidity to other market participants: they propose\nprices at which they stand ready to buy and sell a wide variety of assets.

On the mathematical side, we formulate the proposed modeling\nframework as a continuum-player control-stopping game. We manage to split the\nequilibrium problem into two parts. The first one is described by a\ntwo-dimensional system of Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations\n(RBSDEs), whose solution components reflect against each other.
