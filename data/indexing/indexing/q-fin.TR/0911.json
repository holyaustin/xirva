We investigate the\ndynamics of order cancelation by studying the statistical properties of\ninter-cancelation durations defined as the waiting times between consecutive\norder cancelations of 22 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of\nChina in year 2003. Three types of cancelations are considered including\ncancelation of any limit orders, of buy limit orders and of sell limit orders.\nWe find that the distributions of the inter-cancelation durations of individual\nstocks can be well modeled by Weibulls for each type of cancelation and the\ndistributions of rescaled durations of each type of cancelations exhibit a\nscaling behavior for different stocks. Complex intraday patterns are also\nunveiled in the inter-cancelation durations. The detrended fluctuation analysis\n(DFA) and the multifractal DFA show that the inter-cancelation durations\npossess long-term memory and multifractal nature, which are not influenced by\nthe intraday patterns. No clear crossover phenomenon is observed in the\ndetrended fluctuation functions with respect to the time scale. These findings\nindicate that the cancelation of limit orders is a non-Poisson process, which\nhas potential worth in the construction of order-driven market models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2009 05:12:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ni", "Xiao-Hui", "", "ECUST"], ["Jiang", "Zhi-Qiang", "", "ECUST"], ["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Ren", "Fei", "", "ECUST"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}]
