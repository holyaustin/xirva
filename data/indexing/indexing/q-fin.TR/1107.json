While traditional\nexpert advice and \"universal\" algorithms (as well as standard technical trading\nheuristics) attempt to predict winners or trends, our approach relies on\npredictable statistical relations between all pairs of stocks in the market.\nOur empirical results on historical markets provide strong evidence that this\ntype of technical trading can \"beat the market\" and moreover, can beat the best\nstock in the market.

The presence\nof ties in the agents' best-response correspondences yields discontinuous\npayoff functions for the agencies. These discontinuities are dealt with via\nefficient tie--breaking rules. In a first step, the model presented by Carlier,\nEkeland & Touzi (2007) of optimal derivative design by profit-maximizing\nagencies is extended to a multiple--firm setting, and results of Page &\nMonteiro (2003, 2007, 2008) are used to prove the existence of\n(mixed-strategies) Nash equilibria. On a second step we consider the more\ncomplex case of risk minimizing firms. Here the concept of socially efficient\nallocations is introduced, and existence of the latter is proved. It is also\nshown that in the particular case of the entropic risk measure, there exists an\nefficient \"fix--mix\" tie-breaking rule, in which case firms share the whole\nmarket over given proportions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jul 2011 10:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Horst", "Ulrich", ""], ["Moreno-Bromberg", "Santiago", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1787", "submitter": "Takashi Kato", "authors": "Takashi Kato", "title": "An Optimal Execution Problem with a Geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Price\n  Process", "comments": "21 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study an optimal execution problem in the presence of market impact where\nthe security price follows a geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which\nimplies the mean-reverting property, and show that the optimal strategy is a\nmixture of initial/terminal block liquidation and gradual intermediate\nliquidation. The mean-reverting property describes a price recovery effect that\nis strongly related to the resilience of market impact, as described in several\npapers that have studied optimal execution in a limit order book (LOB) model.\nIt is interesting that despite the fact that the model in this paper is\ndifferent from the LOB model, the form of our optimal strategy is quite similar\nto those obtained for an LOB model. Moreover, we discuss what properties cause\ngradual liquidation as an optimal strategy by studying various cases and find\nout that not only \"convexity of market impact function\" but also \"price\nrecovery effect\" (or, in other words, transience of market impact) are\nessential to make a trader execute the security gradually to mitigate the\neffect of market impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Jul 2011 14:34:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2012 10:27:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2014 10:51:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2014 04:46:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kato", "Takashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3364", "submitter": "Zolt\\'an Eisler", "authors": "Zoltan Eisler, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Julien Kockelkoren", "title": "Models for the impact of all order book events", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures, to appear in the proceedings of Market\n  Microstructure - Confronting Many Viewpoints", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a general framework to describe the impact of different events in\nthe order book, that generalizes previous work on the impact of market orders.\nTwo different modeling routes can be considered, which are equivalent when only\nmarket orders are taken into account.

The \"history dependent impact\" model (HDIM), on the\nother hand, assumes that only price-changing events have a direct impact,\nitself modulated by the past history of all events through an \"influence\nmatrix\" that measures how much, on average, an event of a given type affects\nthe immediate impact of a price-changing event of the same sign in the future.\nWe find in particular that aggressive market orders tend to reduce the impact\nof further aggressive market orders of the same sign (and increase the impact\nof aggressive market orders of opposite sign). We discuss the relative merits\nof TIM and HDIM, in particular concerning their ability to reproduce accurately\nthe price diffusion pattern. We find that in spite of theoretical\ninconsistencies, TIM appears to fare better than HDIM when compared to\nempirical data.
