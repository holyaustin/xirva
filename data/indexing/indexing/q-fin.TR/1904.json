For the Franke-Westerhoff model, we\nproof that a constraint required in the original model is not necessary for\nstability of the time-continuous model. It is shown that a semi-implicit\ndiscretization of the time-continuous system preserves this unconditional\nstability. In addition, this semi-implicit discretization can be computed at\ncost comparable to the original model. Furthermore, we discuss possible\nprobabilistic descriptions of time continuous agent-based computational\neconomic market models.
