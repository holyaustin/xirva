The view-point of renewal theory\nis assumed. In order to represent market data with relatively long durations,\ntwo types of distributions are used, namely, a distribution derived from the\nso-called Mittag-Leffler survival function and the Weibull distribution. For\nMittag-Leffler type distribution, the average waiting time (residual life time)\nis strongly dependent on the choice of a cut-off parameter t_ max, whereas the\nresults based on the Weibull distribution do not depend on such a cut-off.\nTherefore, a Weibull distribution is more convenient than a Mittag-Leffler type\none if one wishes to evaluate relevant statistics such as average waiting time\nin financial markets with long durations. On the other side, we find that the\nGini index is rather independent of the cut-off parameter. Based on the above\nconsiderations, we propose a good candidate for describing the distribution of\nfirst-passage time in a market: The Weibull distribution with a power-law tail.\nThis distribution compensates the gap between theoretical and empirical results\nmuch more efficiently than a simple Weibull distribution. We also give a useful\nformula to determine an optimal crossover point minimizing the difference\nbetween the empirical average waiting time and the one predicted from renewal\ntheory. Moreover, we discuss the limitation of our distributions by applying\nour distribution to the analysis of the BTP future and calculating the average\nwaiting time. We find that our distribution is applicable as long as durations\nfollow a Weibull-law for short times and do not have too heavy a tail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2008 02:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sazuka", "Naoya", ""], ["Inoue", "Jun-ichi", ""], ["Scalas", "Enrico", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3196", "submitter": "Anindya Sundar Chakrabarti", "authors": "Anindya S.

The model is minimal in\nthe sense that we try to identify the essential ingredients to reproduce the\nmain most important deviations of price time series from a Random Walk\nbehavior. We focus on four essential ingredients: fundamentalist agents which\ntend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization;\nanalysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which\ngoverns the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to\nsituations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time\nstability (on average). The Stylized Facts are shown to correspond to an\nintermittent behavior which occurs only for a finite value of the number of\nagents N. Therefore they correspond to finite size effect which, however, can\noccur at different time scales. We propose a new mechanism for the\nSelf-Organization of this state which is linked to the existence of a threshold\nfor the agents to be active or not active. The feedback between price\nfluctuations and number of active agents represent a crucial element for this\nstate of Self-Organized-Intermittency. The model can be easily generalized to\nconsider more realistic variants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2008 18:13:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Alfi", "V.", ""], ["Cristelli", "M.", ""], ["Pietronero", "L.", ""], ["Zaccaria", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3565", "submitter": "Valentina Alfi", "authors": "V.

The aim of the\nmodel is to consider the minimal elements for the understanding of the origin\nof the Stylized Facts and their Self-Organization. The key elements are\nfundamentalist agents, chartist agents, herding dynamics and price behavior.\nThe first two elements correspond to the competition between stability and\ninstability tendencies in the market. The herding behavior governs the\npossibility of the agents to change strategy and it is a crucial element of\nthis class of models. The linear approximation permits a simple interpretation\nof the model dynamics and, for many properties, it is possible to derive\nanalytical results. The generalized non linear dynamics results to be extremely\nmore sensible to the parameter space and much more difficult to analyze and\ncontrol. The main results for the nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized\nFacts are, however, very similar in the two cases. The main peculiarity of the\nnon linear dynamics is an enhancement of the fluctuations and a more marked\nevidence of the Stylized Facts. We will also discuss some modifications of the\nmodel to introduce more realistic elements with respect to the real markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2008 18:23:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Alfi", "V.", ""], ["Cristelli", "M.", ""], ["Pietronero", "L.", ""], ["Zaccaria", "A.", ""]]}]
