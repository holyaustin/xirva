One\nof the main features of such models is to encode not only the influence of past\nevents on future events but also, crucially, the influence of past price\nchanges on such events. We show that the empirically calibrated quadratic\nkernel is well described by a diagonal contribution (that captures past\nrealised volatility), plus a rank-one \"Zumbach\" contribution (that captures the\neffect of past trends). We find that the Zumbach kernel is a power-law of time,\nas are all other feedback kernels. As in many previous studies, the rate of\ntruly exogenous events is found to be a small fraction of the total event rate.\nThese two features suggest that the system is close to a critical point -- in\nthe sense that stronger feedback kernels would lead to instabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2020 12:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fosset", "Antoine", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Benzaquen", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.09356", "submitter": "Nino Antulov-Fantulin", "authors": "Nino Antulov-Fantulin, Tian Guo, Fabrizio Lillo", "title": "Temporal mixture ensemble models for intraday volume forecasting in\n  cryptocurrency exchange markets", "comments": "36 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of the intraday short-term volume forecasting in\ncryptocurrency exchange markets.

This can answer the\nquestion of whether correlations are better understood as an emergent time\nscale dependent property. In other words: Is the Epps effect a bias? To this\nend, we derive the Epps effect arising from asynchrony and provide a refined\nmethod to correct for the effect. The correction is compared against two\nexisting methods correcting for asynchrony. We propose three experiments to\ndiscriminate between possible underlying representations: whether the data is\nbest thought to be generated by discrete connected events (as proxied by a\nD-type Hawkes process), or if they can be approximated to arise from Brownian\ndiffusions, with or without jumps. We then demonstrate how the Hawkes\nrepresentation easily recovers the phenomenology reported in the literature;\nphenomenology that cannot be recovered using a Brownian representation, without\nadditional ad-hoc model complexity, even with jumps. The experiments are\napplied to trade and quote data from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. We find\nevidence suggesting that high frequency correlation dynamics are most\nfaithfully recovered when tick-by-tick data is represented as a web of\ninter-connected discrete events rather than sampled or averaged from underlying\ncontinuous Brownian diffusions irrespective of whether or not they are dressed\nwith jumps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 11:03:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2020 09:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Patrick", ""], ["Pienaar", "Etienne", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13621", "submitter": "Christopher Clack", "authors": "Christopher D.
