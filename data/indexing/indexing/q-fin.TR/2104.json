Arbitrage trades have been shown to align the prices reported by\nCFMMs with those of external markets. These trades impose costs on Liquidity\nProviders (LPs) who supply reserves to CFMMs. Trading fees have been proposed\nas a mechanism for compensating LPs for arbitrage losses. However, large fees\nreduce the accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to\ndeviate from desirable asset compositions. CFMM designers are therefore faced\nwith the problem of how to optimally select fees to attract liquidity. We\ndevelop a framework for determining the value to LPs of supplying liquidity to\na CFMM with fees when the underlying process follows a general diffusion.\nFocusing on a popular class of CFMMs which we call Geometric Mean Market Makers\n(G3Ms), our approach also allows one to select optimal fees for maximizing LP\nvalue. We illustrate our methodology by showing that an LP with mean-variance\nutility will prefer a G3M over all alternative trading strategies as fees\napproach zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 13:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Alex", ""], ["Angeris", "Guillermo", ""], ["Chitra", "Tarun", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.00620", "submitter": "Karush Suri", "authors": "Karush Suri, Xiao Qi Shi, Konstantinos Plataniotis, Yuri Lawryshyn", "title": "TradeR: Practical Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Trade\n  Execution", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) span a wide variety of applications\nwhich motivate development in this area.

Through this lens, TradeR makes use of\nhierarchical RL to execute trade bids on high frequency real market experiences\ncomprising of abrupt price variations during the 2019 fiscal year COVID19 stock\nmarket crash. The framework utilizes an energy-based scheme in conjunction with\nsurprise value function for estimating and minimizing surprise.

The log returns are studied for either positive\nor negative cases. The results for the S&P500 daily closing values are showing\na huge lack of non-conformity, whatever the different levels of disaggregation.\nSome \"first digits\" and \"first two digits\" values are even missing. The causes\nof this non-conformity are discussed, pointing to the danger in taking\nBenford's laws for granted in huge databases, whence drawing \"definite\nconclusions\". The agreements with Benford's laws are much better for the log\nreturns. Such a disparity in agreements finds an explanation in the data set\nitself: the inherent trend in the index. To further validate this, daily\nreturns have been simulated calibrating the simulations with the observed data\naverages and tested against Benford's laws. One finds that not only the trend\nbut also the standard deviation of the distributions are relevant parameters in\nconcluding about conformity with Benford's laws.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:31:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "Marcel", ""], ["Ficcadenti", "Valerio", ""], ["Dhesi", "Gurjeet", ""], ["Shakeel", "Muhammad", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.09700", "submitter": "Jinge Wu", "authors": "Mingwen Liu, Junbang Huo, Yulin Wu, Jinge Wu", "title": "Stock Market Trend Analysis Using Hidden Markov Model and Long Short\n  Term Memory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR cs.LG q-fin.CP q-fin.PM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This paper intends to apply the Hidden Markov Model into stock market and and\nmake predictions.

This\nvariety of choice creates a new question for traders - when to trade to\nmaximize the gain. This problem is not trivial especially for trading larger\nvolumes as the market participants should also consider their own price impact.\nThe following paper raises this issue considering two markets: the hourly EPEX\nDay-Ahead Auction and the quarter-hourly EPEX Intraday Auction. We consider a\nrealistic setting which includes a forecasting study and a suitable evaluation.\nFor a meaningful optimization many price scenarios are considered that we\nobtain using bootstrap with models that are well-known and researched in the\nelectricity price forecasting literature. The own market impact is predicted by\nmimicking the demand or supply shift in the respectful auction curves. A number\nof trading strategies is considered, e.g. minimization of the trading costs,\nrisk neutral or risk averse agents. Additionally, we provide theoretical\nresults for risk neutral agents. Especially we show when the optimal trading\npath coincides with the solution that minimizes transaction costs. The\napplication study is conducted using the German market data, but the presented\nmethods can be easily utilized with other two auction-based markets. They could\nbe also generalized to other market types, what is discussed in the paper as\nwell. The empirical results show that market participants could increase their\ngains significantly compared to simple benchmark strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2021 08:52:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Narajewski", "Micha\u0142", ""], ["Ziel", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.14615", "submitter": "Rene Carmona", "authors": "Rene Carmona and Laura Leal", "title": "Optimal Execution with Quadratic Variation Inventories", "comments": "26 pages, 20 figures, 8 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The first half of the paper is devoted to description and implementation of\nstatistical tests arguing for the presence of a Brownian component in the\ninventories and wealth processes of individual traders.
