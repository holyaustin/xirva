We derive typical properties for ensembles of large\nrandom markets using techniques borrowed from statistical mechanics of\ndisordered systems. We show that, depending on the number of financial\ninstruments available and on the heterogeneity of local measures, the market\nmoves from an arbitrage-free phase to an unstable one, where the complexity of\nthe market - as measured by the diversity of financial instruments - increases,\nand arbitrage opportunities arise. A sharp transition separates the two phases.\nFocusing on two different classes of local measures inspired by real markets\nstrategies, we are able to analytically compute the critical lines,\ncorroborating our findings with numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2012 12:27:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 17:25:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 1 Sep 2012 14:00:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Livan", "Giacomo", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.2946", "submitter": "Thilo Albrecht Schmitt", "authors": "Thilo A.

In\nempirical studies, it has been found that gaps between the orders in the order\nbook lead to large price shifts and thereby to these heavy tails. We set up an\nagent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the\norder book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a\ndouble-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In\nsituations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not\nobserve fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap\nstructure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails. We show\nthat return distributions with heavy tails are an order-book effect if the\navailable liquidity is constrained. This is largely independent of the specific\ntrading strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:05:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitt", "Thilo A.", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["M\u00fcnnix", "Michael C.", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5269", "submitter": "Paolo Zagaglia Dr", "authors": "Caterina Liberati, Massimiliano Marzo, Paolo Zagaglia, Paola Zappa", "title": "Structural distortions in the Euro interbank market: The role of 'key\n  players' during the recent market turmoil", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the frictions in the patterns of trades in the Euro money market. We\ncharacterize the structure of lending relations during the period of recent\nfinancial turmoil. We use network-topology method on data from overnight\ntransactions in the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposits (e-Mid) to\ninvestigate on two main issues. First, we characterize the division of roles\nbetween borrowers and lenders in long-run relations by providing evidence on\nnetwork formation at a yearly frequency. Second, we identify the 'key players'\nin the marketplace and study their behaviour. Key players are 'locally-central\nbanks' within a network that lend (or borrow) large volumes to (from) several\ncounterparties, while borrowing (or lending) small volumes from (to) a small\nnumber of institutions. Our results are twofold. We show that the aggregate\ntrading patterns in e-Mid are characterized by largely asymmetric relations.\nThis implies a clear division of roles between lenders and borrowers. Second,\nthe key players do not exploit their position of network leaders by imposing\nopportunistic pricing policies. We find that only a fraction of the networks\ncomposed by big players are characterized by interest rates that are\nstatistically different from the average market rate throughout the turmoil\nperiod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 00:00:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Liberati", "Caterina", ""], ["Marzo", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Zagaglia", "Paolo", ""], ["Zappa", "Paola", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6325", "submitter": "Mathieu Rosenbaum", "authors": "Khalil Dayri and Mathieu Rosenbaum", "title": "Large tick assets: implicit spread and optimal tick size", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we provide a framework linking microstructural properties of an\nasset to the tick value of the exchange.
