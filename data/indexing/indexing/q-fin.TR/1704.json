The paper discusses trading strategies for both\ncommodities and stocks but the main focus is on stock market trading at the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\n  Problem 1: Buy Low and Sell High. The buy low and sell high problem can be\nsummarized like this: suppose the price of a commodity or stock fluctuates\nindefinitely, is there any explicit strategy for a trader to \"ride the price\nwaves\" by buying low and selling high to eventually win even if price does not\nincrease?\n  Problem 2: \"Beat\" the Market. In Part 2, the trading system presented in Part\n1 is transformed into a strategy that always outperforms the market eventually.\n  Problem 3: Can a Trader Outperform a geometric Brownian Motion? The general\nbelief is that it is impossible to \"beat\" a GBM since technical analysis of\nhistorical prices is useless in predicting future prices. The last part of the\npaper shows that the answer to Problem 3 is actually a \"YES\", which is quite\nsurprising.\n  The trading strategies presented are based mainly on information obtained\nfrom the movements of waves and wavelets created by large and small\nfluctuations of market prices. They do not involve any forecasting or\nprediction of future prices. Behavioral economics also plays a role in the\ndecision making process of the Wavelet Trading program.

Its main application is slicing\nlarge trading orders, in the interest of minimizing trading costs and potential\nperturbations of price dynamics due to liquidity shocks. The initial\noptimization frameworks were based on mean-variance minimization for the\ntrading costs. In the past 15 years, finer modelling of price dynamics, more\nrealistic control variables and different cost functionals were developed. The\ninclusion of signals (i.e. short term predictors of price dynamics) in optimal\ntrading is a recent development and it is also the subject of this work.\n  We incorporate a Markovian signal in the optimal trading framework which was\ninitially proposed by Gatheral, Schied, and Slynko [21] and provide results on\nthe existence and uniqueness of an optimal trading strategy. Moreover, we\nderive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market\nimpact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact\ndecay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations\nin opposite directions.\n  Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit were the transient market impact\nbecomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is\ncompatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and\nJaimungal [10].\n  In order to support our models, we analyse nine months of tick by tick data\non 13 European stocks from the NASDAQ OMX exchange. We show that orderbook\nimbalance is a predictor of the future price move and it has some\nmean-reverting properties. From this data we show that market participants,\nespecially high frequency traders, use this signal in their trading strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 01:38:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 21:27:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2018 11:13:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Neuman", "Eyal", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.03205", "submitter": "Luigi Troiano", "authors": "Luigi Troiano and Elena Mejuto and Pravesh Kriplani", "title": "On Feature Reduction using Deep Learning for Trend Prediction in Finance", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the major advantages in using Deep Learning for Finance is to embed a\nlarge collection of information into investment decisions.

Price limit\nrules are introduced in the definition of relative price. The order placement\nprocess is determined by several empirical regularities: the long memory in\norder directions, the long memory in relative prices, the asymmetric\ndistribution of relative prices, and the nonlinear dependence of the average\norder size and its standard deviation on the relative price. Order cancellation\nfollows a Poisson process with the arrival rate determined from real data and\nthe cancelled order is determined according to the empirical distributions of\nrelative price level and relative position at the same price level. All these\ningredients of the model are derived based on the empirical microscopic\nregularities in the order flows of stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The\nmodel is able to produce the main stylized facts in real markets. Computational\nexperiments uncover that asymmetric setting of price limits will cause the\nstock price diverging exponentially when the up price limit is higher than the\ndown price limit and vanishing vice versus. We also find that asymmetric price\nlimits have influences on stylized facts. Our EBOD model provides a suitable\ncomputational experiment platform for academics, market participants and policy\nmakers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 05:53:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Gao-Feng", ""], ["Xiong", "Xiong", ""], ["Xu", "Hai-Chuan", ""], ["Zhang", "Wei", ""], ["Zhang", "Yong-Jie", ""], ["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.06572", "submitter": "Bruno Remillard", "authors": "Jonathan A.
