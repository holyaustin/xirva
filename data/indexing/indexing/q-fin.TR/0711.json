Agents are assumed to have three components to the expectation of future\nasset returns, namely-fundamentalist, chartist and noise trader. Furthermore\nagents differ in the characteristics describing these components, such as time\nhorizon, risk aversion and the weights given to the various components. The\nmodel developed here extends a great deal of earlier literature in that the\norder submissions of agents are determined by utility maximisation, rather than\nthe mechanical unit order size that is commonly assumed. In this way the order\nflow is better related to the ongoing evolution of the market. For the given\nmarket structure we analyze the impact of the three components of the trading\nstrategies on the statistical properties of prices and order flows and observe\nthat it is the chartist strategy that is mainly responsible of the fat tails\nand clustering in the artificial price data generated by the model. The paper\nprovides further evidence that large price changes are likely to be generated\nby the presence of large gaps in the book.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 14:10:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chiarella", "Carl", ""], ["Iori", "Giulia", ""], ["Perello", "Josep", ""]]}]
