Here we study how the\nstandard scenario is affected in a mixed population game in which agents with\nthe `optimal' learning rule (i.e. the one leading to efficiency) coexist with\nones whose adaptive dynamics is sub-optimal. Our generic finding is that any\nnon-vanishing intensive fraction of optimal agents guarantees the existence of\nan efficient phase. Specifically, we calculate the dependence of the critical\npoint on the fraction $q$ of `optimal' agents focusing our analysis on three\ncases: MGs with market impact correction, grand-canonical MGs and MGs with\nheterogeneous comfort levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Dec 2007 16:25:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Galla", "Tobias", ""], ["De Martino", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.0912", "submitter": "Gao-Feng Gu", "authors": "Gao-Feng Gu (ECUST), Wei Chen (SZSE), Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Empirical regularities of order placement in the Chinese stock market", "comments": "15 Elsart page including 1 table and 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 387 (13), 3173-3182 (2008)", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2008.01.114", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  Using ultra-high-frequency data extracted from the order flows of 23 stocks\ntraded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, we study the empirical regularities of\norder placement in the opening call auction, cool period and continuous\nauction.
