The first part\nconsiders the problem of a market maker optimally setting bid/ask quotes over a\nfinite time horizon, to maximize her expected utility. The intensities of the\norders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on\nunobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control\nproblem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering,\ncontrol and PDMPs theory. The value function is characterized as the unique\ncontinuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation and\nnumerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal full\ninformation spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is\nunknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty\nin terms of PnL sensitivity and observable order flow volatility.\n  The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic impulse\ncontrol games. These offer a realistic and far-reaching modelling framework,\nbut the difficulty in solving such problems has hindered their proliferation. A\npolicy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of\nquasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring\nresults.\n  Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and an\nimproved algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is\nundertaken with natural assumptions on the players strategies, which admit\ngraph-theoretic interpretations in the context of weakly chained diagonally\ndominant matrices. The algorithm is used to compute with high precision\nequilibrium payoffs and Nash equilibria of otherwise too challenging problems,\nand even some for which results go beyond the scope of the currently available\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 15:30:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zabaljauregui", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06905", "submitter": "Dave Cliff", "authors": "Michael Rollins, Dave Cliff", "title": "Which Trading Agent is Best?

Various public-domain trading algorithms have\nbeen proposed over the past 25 years in a kind of arms-race, where each new\ntrading algorithm was compared to the previous best, thereby establishing a\n\"pecking order\", i.e. a partially-ordered dominance hierarchy from best to\nworst of the various trading algorithms. Many of these algorithms were\ndeveloped and tested using simple minimal simulations of financial markets that\nonly weakly approximated the fact that real markets involve many different\ntrading systems operating asynchronously and in parallel. In this paper we use\nBSE, a public-domain market simulator, to run a set of experiments generating\nbenchmark results from several well-known trading algorithms. BSE incorporates\na very simple time-sliced approach to simulating parallelism, which has obvious\nknown weaknesses. We then alter and extend BSE to make it threaded, so that\ndifferent trader algorithms operate asynchronously and in parallel: we call\nthis simulator Threaded-BSE (TBSE). We then re-run the trader experiments on\nTBSE and compare the TBSE results to our earlier benchmark results from BSE.\nOur comparison shows that the dominance hierarchy in our more realistic\nexperiments is different from the one given by the original simple simulator.\nWe conclude that simulated parallelism matters a lot, and that earlier results\nfrom simple simulations comparing different trader algorithms are no longer to\nbe entirely trusted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:44:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rollins", "Michael", ""], ["Cliff", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.07086", "submitter": "Michael Darlin", "authors": "Michael Darlin, Nikolaos Papadis, Leandros Tassiulas", "title": "Optimal Bidding Strategy for Maker Auctions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Maker Protocol is a decentralized finance application that enables\ncollateralized lending.
