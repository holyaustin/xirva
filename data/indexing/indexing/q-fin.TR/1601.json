While\nprevious models reported in the literature are also capable of replicating some\nof these statistical properties, in general, they tend to oversimplify either\nthe trading mechanisms or the behavior of the agents. In our model, we strived\nto capture the most important characteristics of both aspects to create agents\nthat employ strategies inspired on those used in real markets, and, at the same\ntime, a more realistic trade mechanism based on a double auction order book. We\nstudy the role of the distinct types of trader on the return statistics:\nspecifically, correlation properties (or lack thereof), volatilty clustering,\nheavy tails, and the degree to which the distribution can be described by a\nlog-normal. Further, by introducing the practice of profit taking, our model is\nalso capable of replicating the stylized fact related to an asymmetry in the\ndistribution of losses and gains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2016 22:30:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Jul 2016 03:38:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Navarro", "Roberto Mota", ""], ["Ridaura", "Hern\u00e1n Larralde", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01553", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Gurjeet Dhesi and Marcel Ausloos", "title": "Modelling and Measuring the Irrational behaviour of Agents in Financial\n  Markets: Discovering the Psychological Soliton", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures, 33 references; prepared for a special issue of\n  Chaos, Solitons & Fractals", "journal-ref": "Chaos, Solitons & Fractals 88, 119-125 (2016)", "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2015.12.015", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Following a Geometrical Brownian Motion extension into an Irrational\nFractional Brownian Motion model, we re-examine agent behaviour reacting to\ntime dependent news on the log-returns thereby modifying a financial market\nevolution.

Cont and A. de Larrard (SIAM J. Finan.

As suggested by empirical observations,\nwe extend their framework to 1) arbitrary distributions for book events\ninter-arrival times (possibly non-exponential) and 2) both the nature of a new\nbook event and its corresponding inter-arrival time depend on the nature of the\nprevious book event. We do so by resorting to Markov renewal processes to model\nthe dynamics of the bid and ask queues. We keep analytical tractability via\nexplicit expressions for the Laplace transforms of various quantities of\ninterest. We justify and illustrate our approach by calibrating our model to\nthe five stocks Amazon, Apple, Google, Intel and Microsoft on June 21^{st}\n2012. As in R.

This \"spatial neural network\" models the joint\ndistribution of the state of the limit order book at a future time conditional\non the current state of the limit order book. The spatial neural network\noutperforms other models such as the naive empirical model, logistic regression\n(with nonlinear features), and a standard neural network architecture. Both\nneural networks strongly outperform the logistic regression model. Due to its\nmore effective use of information deep in the limit order book, the spatial\nneural network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the tail\nof the distribution, which is important for risk management applications. The\nmodels are trained and tested on nearly 500 stocks. Techniques from deep\nlearning such as dropout are employed to improve performance.

The model is\nbased on a percolation picture of the network of traders and the concept that\nclusters of connected traders share the same opinion. The key ingredient is the\nnotion that a shift of position from buyer to seller of a sufficiently large\ngroup of traders can trigger a crash. This provides a formula to estimate the\ncrash hazard rate by summation over percolation clusters above a minimum size\nof a power sa (with a > 1) of the cluster sizes s, similarly to a generalized\npercolation susceptibility. The power sa of cluster sizes emerges from the\nsuper-linear dependence of group activity as a function of group size,\npreviously documented in the literature. The crash hazard rate exhibits\nexplosive finite-time singular behaviors when the control parameter (fraction\nof occupied sites, or density of traders in the network) approaches the\npercolation threshold pc. Realistic dynamics are generated by modelling the\ndensity of traders on the percolation network by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,\nwhose memory controls the spontaneous excursion of the control parameter close\nto the critical region of bubble formation.
