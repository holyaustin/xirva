This survey highlights the insights that have\nemerged from the wealth of empirical and theoretical studies of LOBs. We\nexamine the findings reported by statistical analyses of historical LOB data\nand discuss how several LOB models provide insight into certain aspects of the\nmechanism. We also illustrate that many such models poorly resemble real LOBs\nand that several well-established empirical facts have yet to be reproduced\nsatisfactorily. Finally, we identify several key unresolved questions about\nLOBs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 23:25:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2011 23:14:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 20:22:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2013 13:17:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gould", "Martin D.", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Williams", "Stacy", ""], ["McDonald", "Mark", ""], ["Fenn", "Daniel J.", ""], ["Howison", "Sam D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2160", "submitter": "Deqing Zhou", "authors": "Fuzhou Gong, Deqing Zhou", "title": "Insider Trading in the Market with Rational Expected Price", "comments": "37 pages, 21 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Kyle (1985) builds a pioneering and influential model, in which an insider\nwith long-lived private information submits an optimal order in each period\ngiven the market maker's pricing rule. An inconsistency exists to some extent\nin the sense that the ``constant pricing rule \" actually assumes an adaptive\nexpected price with pricing rule given before insider making the decision, and\nthe ``market efficiency\" condition, however, assumes a rational expected price\nand implies that the pricing rule can be influenced by insider's strategy. We\nloosen the ``constant pricing rule \" assumption by taking into account\nsufficiently the insider's strategy has on pricing rule. According to the\ncharacteristic of the conditional expectation of the informed profits, three\ndifferent models vary with insider's attitudes regarding to risk are presented.\nCompared to Kyle (1985), the risk-averse insider in Model 1 can obtain larger\nguaranteed profits, the risk-neutral insider in Model 2 can obtain a larger ex\nante expectation of total profits across all periods and the risk-seeking\ninsider in Model 3 can obtain larger risky profits. Moreover, the limit\nbehaviors of the three models when trading frequency approaches infinity are\ngiven, showing that Model 1 acquires a strong-form efficiency, Model 2 acquires\nthe Kyle's (1985) continuous equilibrium, and Model 3 acquires an equilibrium\nwith information released at an increasing speed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 02:29:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Fuzhou", ""], ["Zhou", "Deqing", ""]]}]
