In this work we focus on the\nmultifractal properties found in price and index signals. Although the usual\nMinority Game (MG) models do not exhibit multifractality, we study here one of\nits variants that does. We show that the nonsynchronous MG models in the\nnonergodic phase is multifractal and in this sense, together with other\nstylized facts, constitute a better modeling tool. Using the Structure Function\n(SF) approach we detected the stationary and the scaling range of the time\nseries generated by the MG model and, from the linear (nonlinear) behavior of\nthe SF we identified the fractal (multifractal) regimes. Finally, using the\nWavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) technique we obtained its multifractal\nspectrum width for different dynamical regimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2007 17:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Oct 2007 12:20:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2007 20:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Crepaldi", "Antonio F.", ""], ["Neto", "Camilo Rodrigues", ""], ["Ferreira", "Fernando F.", ""], ["Francisco", "Gerson", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3005", "submitter": "Damien Challet", "authors": "Damien Challet", "title": "Feedback and efficiency in limit order markets", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures.

The agents operate within a\nhighly simplified environment where they are only able to be long or short one\nunit of the asset. The price of the asset is influenced by both an external\ninformation stream and the demand of the agents. The current strategy of each\nagent is defined by a pair of moving thresholds straddling the current price.\nWhen the price crosses either of the thresholds for a particular agent, that\nagent switches position and a new pair of thresholds is generated.\n  Different kinds of threshold motion correspond to different sources of\nmotivation, running the gamut from purely rational information-processing,\nthrough rational (but often undesirable) behaviour induced by perverse\nincentives and moral hazards, to purely psychological effects. As with the\nprevious class of models, the fact that the simplest model of this kind\nprecisely conforms to the Efficient Market Hypothesis allows causal\nrelationships to be established between properties at the agent level and\nviolations of EMH price statistics at the global level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2007 19:43:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lamba", "H.", ""], ["Seaman", "T.", ""]]}]
