The resulting optimal bid and ask limit order prices tend to\ntrack the underlying price as one might expect. This is indeed the case with\nthe model of Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008), which has been studied extensively.\nWe consider here this model under the condition when the underlying price is\nmean reverting. Our main result is that when time is far from the terminal, the\noptimal price for bid and ask limit orders is constant, which means that it\ndoes not track the underlying price. Numerical simulations confirm this\nbehavior. When the underlying price is mean reverting, then for times\nsufficiently far from terminal, it is more advantageous to focus on the mean\nprice and ignore fluctuations around it. Mean reversion suggests that limit\norders will be executed with some regularity, and this is why they are optimal.\nWe also explore intermediate time regimes where limit order prices are\ninfluenced by the inventory of outstanding orders. The duration of this\nintermediate regime depends on the liquidity of the market as measured by\nspecific parameters in the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jul 2016 02:44:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 19:43:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ahuja", "Saran", ""], ["Papanicolaou", "George", ""], ["Ren", "Weiluo", ""], ["Yang", "Tzu-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04553", "submitter": "Jia-Wen Gu", "authors": "Qing-Qing Yang, Wai-Ki Ching, Jia-Wen Gu, Tak-Kuen Siu", "title": "Generalized Optimal Liquidation Problems Across Multiple Trading Venues", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we generalize the Almgren-Chriss's market impact model to a\nmore realistic and flexible framework and employ it to derive and analyze some\naspects of optimal liquidation problem in a security market.
