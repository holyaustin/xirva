An investor needs to execute a long\nposition in the asset affecting the price of the asset and possibly incurring\nin fixed transaction cost. The objective is to maximize the discounted revenue\nobtained by this transaction. This problem is formulated first as an impulse\ncontrol problem and we characterize the value function using the viscosity\nsolutions framework. We also analyze the case where there is no transaction\ncost and how this formulation relates with a singular control problem. A\nviscosity solution characterization is provided in this case as well. We also\nestablish a connection between both formulations with zero fixed transaction\ncost. Numerical examples with different types of price impact conclude the\ndiscussion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 15:45:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Sep 2010 22:12:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 Dec 2010 03:11:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 9 Feb 2011 23:25:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2011 22:01:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Junca", "Mauricio", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0461", "submitter": "Jose Roberto Iglesias", "authors": "J.R.

A simple analogy compares the wealth in a society with the\nenergy in a physical system, and the trade between agents to the energy\nexchange between molecules during collisions. However, while in physical\nsystems the equipartition of energy is valid, in most exchange models for\neconomic markets the system converges to a very unequal \"condensed\" state,\nwhere one or a few agents concentrate all the wealth of the society and the\nwide majority of agents shares zero or a very tiny fraction of the wealth. Here\nwe present an exchange model where the goal is not only to avoid condensation\nbut also to reduce the inequality; to carry out this objective the choice of\ninteracting agents is not at random, but follows an extremal dynamics regulated\nby the wealth of the agent. The wealth of the agent with the minimum capital is\nchanged at random and the difference between the ancient and the new wealth of\nthis poorest agent is taken from other agents, so establishing a regulatory\ntool for wealth redistribution. We compare different redistribution processes\nand conclude that a drastic reduction of the inequality can be obtained with\nvery simple regulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2010 00:03:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jul 2010 15:55:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Iglesias", "J.

Nodes in the network print their own currency and trust each other for\na certain amount of each other's currency. This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected. Further, we characterize a centralized currency system as a\nspecial type of a star network (one where edges to the root have infinite\ncredit capacity, and transactions occur only between leaf nodes) and compute\nthe steady-state transaction failure probability in a centralized system. We\nshow that liquidity in star networks, complete graphs and Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nnetworks is comparable to that in equivalent centralized currency systems; thus\nwe do not lose much liquidity in return for their robustness and decentralized\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2010 22:39:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Feb 2011 01:21:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Feb 2012 20:34:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dandekar", "Pranav", ""], ["Goel", "Ashish", ""], ["Govindan", "Ramesh", ""], ["Post", "Ian", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1631", "submitter": "Lorenzo Pareschi", "authors": "Dario Maldarella, Lorenzo Pareschi", "title": "Price dynamics in financial markets: a kinetic approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of kinetic modelling based on partial differential equations for the\ndynamics of stock price formation in financial markets is briefly reviewed.
