We find that its probability\ndistribution seems to be stable over different time scales, a stylized fact\nobserved in many different financial time series. However, an in-depth analysis\nof the data using maximum likelihood estimation and different goodness-of-fit\ntests rejects the L\\'evy-stable law as a plausible underlying probabilistic\nmodel. The analysis shows that the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution\nprovides an overall fit for the data better than any of the other subclasses of\nthe family of the Generalized Hyperbolic distributions and certainly much\nbetter than the L\\'evy-stable laws. Furthermore, the right (resp. left) tail of\nthe distribution seems to follow a power-law with exponent \\alpha=4.60 (resp.\n\\alpha =4.28). Finally, we present evidence that the observed stability is due\nto temporal correlations or non-stationarities of the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 18:51:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda", "Pablo", ""], ["G\u00f3mez-Ullate", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0451", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "Ismael Martinez-Martinez and Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "title": "Directed Random Markets: Connectivity determines Money", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1142/S012918311250088X", "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO cs.MA q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution arises as the statistical equilibrium\nprobability distribution of money among the agents of a closed economic system\nwhere random and undirected exchanges are allowed.

It is designed to explain\ncollective behaviour of the market when new information affecting the market\narrives. The novel feature of the model is two additional slow changing\nparameters, the so-called sentiment functions. These sentiment functions\nmeasure the conception of the fair price of two groups of investors, namely,\nbulls and bears. Our model specifies differential equations for the time\nevolution of sentiment functions and constitutes a nonlinear Markov process\nwhich exhibits long term correlations. We explain the intuition behind\nequations for sentiment functions and present numerical simulations which show\nthat the behaviour of our model is similar to the behaviour of the real market.\nWe also obtain a diffusion limit of the model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type\nprocess with variable volatility. The volatility is proportional to the\ndifference of opinions of bulls and bears about the fair price of a security.\nThe paper is complimentary to our previous work where mathematical proofs are\npresented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2012 10:44:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 00:41:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 26 Dec 2013 23:50:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 21:27:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lykov", "A.", ""], ["Muzychka", "S.", ""], ["Vaninsky", "K.", ""]]}]
