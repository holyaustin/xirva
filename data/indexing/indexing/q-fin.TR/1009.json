In our model, agents arrive on the market over two periods, while\nagents in the first period do not know the types of those arriving later.\nAgents already present in the market may match early or wait for the small\ngroup of new entrants. Despite the lack of discounting or risk aversion, this\nperturbation creates incentives to match early and leave the market before the\nnew agents arrive. These incentives do not disappear as the market gets large.\nMoreover, we identify a new adverse phenomenon in this setting: as markets get\nlarge the probability of \\emph{chaos} -- where no early matching scheme for\nexisting agents is robust to pairwise deviations -- approaches 1. These results\nare independent of the distribution of agents' types and robust to asymmetries\nbetween the two sides of the market. Our findings thus suggest that matching\nmarkets are extremely sensitive to institutional details and uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Sep 2010 20:53:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Du", "Songzi", ""], ["Livne", "Yair", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1446", "submitter": "Sanmay Das", "authors": "Aseem Brahma, Sanmay Das and Malik Magdon-Ismail", "title": "Comparing Prediction Market Structures, With an Application to Market\n  Making", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ensuring sufficient liquidity is one of the key challenges for designers of\nprediction markets. Various market making algorithms have been proposed in the\nliterature and deployed in practice, but there has been little effort to\nevaluate their benefits and disadvantages in a systematic manner. We introduce\na novel experimental design for comparing market structures in live trading\nthat ensures fair comparison between two different microstructures with the\nsame trading population. Participants trade on outcomes related to a\ntwo-dimensional random walk that they observe on their computer screens. They\ncan simultaneously trade in two markets, corresponding to the independent\nhorizontal and vertical random walks. We use this experimental design to\ncompare the popular inventory-based logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR)\nmarket maker and a new information based Bayesian market maker (BMM). Our\nexperiments reveal that BMM can offer significant benefits in terms of price\nstability and expected loss when controlling for liquidity; the caveat is that,\nunlike LMSR, BMM does not guarantee bounded loss. Our investigation also\nelucidates some general properties of market makers in prediction markets. In\nparticular, there is an inherent tradeoff between adaptability to market shocks\nand convergence during market equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Sep 2010 03:26:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Brahma", "Aseem", ""], ["Das", "Sanmay", ""], ["Magdon-Ismail", "Malik", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2721", "submitter": "Volker Nannen", "authors": "Volker Nannen", "title": "Convergence of Income Growth Rates in Evolutionary Agent-Based Economics", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a heterogeneous agent-based economic model where economic agents\nhave strictly bounded rationality and where income allocation strategies evolve\nthrough selective imitation.
