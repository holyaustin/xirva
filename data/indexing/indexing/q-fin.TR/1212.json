We build a model which explains qualitatively and\nquantitatively the empirical facts observed so far concerning market impact. We\ndefine different notions of market impact, and show how they lead to the\ndifferent price paths observed in the literature. For each one, under the\nassumption of perfect competition and information, we derive and explain the\nrelationships between the correlations in the order flow, the shape of the\nmarket impact function while a meta-order is being executed, and the expected\nprice after the completion. We also derive an expression for the decay of\nmarket impact after a trade, and show how it can result in a better liquidation\nstrategy for an informed trader. We show how, in spite of auto-correlation in\norder-flow, prices can be martingales, and how price manipulation is ruled out\neven though the bare impact function is concave. We finally assess the cost of\nmarket impact and try to make a step towards optimal strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 18:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Donier", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6601", "submitter": "Sasidevan Vijayakumar", "authors": "V.

In our model, $N$ agents choose\nbetween two alternatives repeatedly, and those who are in the minority get a\npay-off 1, others zero. The agents optimize the expectation value of their\ndiscounted future pay-off, the discount parameter being $\\lambda$. We propose\nan alternative to the standard Nash equilibrium, called co-action equilibrium,\nwhich gives higher expected pay-off for all agents. The optimal choice of\nprobabilities of different actions are determined exactly in terms of simple\nself -consistent equations. The optimal strategy is characterized by $N$ real\nparameters, which are non-analytic functions of $\\lambda$, even for a finite\nnumber of agents. The solution for $N \\leq 7$ is worked out explicitly\nindicating the structure of the solution for larger $N$. For large enough\nfuture time horizon, the optimal strategy switches from random choice to a\nwin-stay lose-shift strategy, with the shift probability depending on the\ncurrent state and $\\lambda$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2012 09:06:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 09:59:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 02:42:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 05:28:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Sasidevan", "V.", ""], ["Dhar", "Deepak", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6791", "submitter": "Younes Ben-Ghabrit", "authors": "Younes Ben-Ghabrit", "title": "The normaly distributed daily returns in stock trading", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this report, we talked about a new quantitative strategy for choosing the\noptimal(s) stock(s) to trade. The basic notions are generally very known by the\nfinancial community. The key here is to understand 1) the standard score\napplied to a sample and 2) the correlation factor applied to different time\nseries in real life. These notions are the core of our research. We are going\nto begin with the introduction section. In this part, we talked about variance,\ncovariance, correlation factor, daily returns in stock trading and the\nShapiro-Wilk test to test the normality of a time serie. Next to that, I talked\nabout the core of my method (what do you do if you want to pick the optimal(s)\nstock(s) to trade). At the end of this report, I talked about a new idea if you\nwant to analyze more than one stock at the time. All my work goes with a\nprimary reflexion : forecasting a stock direction is a random walk and nobody\ncan be 100 % sure where a stock is going. All we can do, is to pretend to have\na technic with a win/loss ratio greater than 51 %.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2012 23:11:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ben-Ghabrit", "Younes", ""]]}]
