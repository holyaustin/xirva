The advent of electronic trading has allowed complex\nmachine learning solutions to enter the field of financial trading. Financial\nmarkets have both long term and short term signals and thus a good predictive\nmodel in financial trading should be able to incorporate them together. One of\nthe most sought after forms of electronic trading is high-frequency trading\n(HFT), typically known for microsecond sensitive changes, which results in a\ntremendous amount of data. LSTMs are one of the most capable variants of the\nRNN family that can handle long-term dependencies, but even they are not\nequipped to handle such long sequences of the order of thousands of data points\nlike in HFT. We propose very-long short term memory networks, or VLSTMs, to\ndeal with such extreme length sequences. We explore the importance of VLSTMs in\nthe context of HFT. We compare our model on publicly available dataset and got\na 3.14\\% increase in F1-score over the existing state-of-the-art time-series\nforecasting models. We also show that our model has great parallelization\npotential, which is essential for practical purposes when trading on such\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2018 13:44:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 09:02:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2020 13:15:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ganesh", "Prakhar", ""], ["Rakheja", "Puneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.02433", "submitter": "Martin Boissier", "authors": "Rainer Schlosser and Martin Boissier", "title": "Dealing with the Dimensionality Curse in Dynamic Pricing Competition:\n  Using Frequent Repricing to Compensate Imperfect Market Anticipations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computers & Operations Research Volume 100, December 2018, Pages\n  26-42", "doi": "10.1016/j.cor.2018.07.011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.TR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Most sales applications are characterized by competition and limited demand\ninformation. For successful pricing strategies, frequent price adjustments as\nwell as anticipation of market dynamics are crucial. Both effects are\nchallenging as competitive markets are complex and computations of optimized\npricing adjustments can be time-consuming. We analyze stochastic dynamic\npricing models under oligopoly competition for the sale of perishable goods. To\ncircumvent the curse of dimensionality, we propose a heuristic approach to\nefficiently compute price adjustments. To demonstrate our strategy's\napplicability even if the number of competitors is large and their strategies\nare unknown, we consider different competitive settings in which competitors\nfrequently and strategically adjust their prices. For all settings, we verify\nthat our heuristic strategy yields promising results. We compare the\nperformance of our heuristic against upper bounds, which are obtained by\noptimal strategies that take advantage of perfect price anticipations. We find\nthat price adjustment frequencies can have a larger impact on expected profits\nthan price anticipations. Finally, our approach has been applied on Amazon for\nthe sale of used books. We have used a seller's historical market data to\ncalibrate our model. Sales results show that our data-driven strategy\noutperforms the rule-based strategy of an experienced seller by a profit\nincrease of more than 20%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2018 12:20:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Schlosser", "Rainer", ""], ["Boissier", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.03769", "submitter": "Johannes Ruf", "authors": "Adrian Banner, Robert Fernholz, Vassilios Papathanakos, Johannes Ruf,\n  David Schofield", "title": "Diversification, Volatility, and Surprising Alpha", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been widely observed that capitalization-weighted indexes can be\nbeaten by surprisingly simple, systematic investment strategies.

Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the\nworld's major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that\npreviously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by\nhigh-speed autonomous automated trading systems. Research aimed at\nunderstanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by\nthe fact that no operational real-world exchange is ever likely to allow\nexperimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing\nresearchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data. Similarly,\nuniversity-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation\nautomated trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience\nin a sufficiently realistic teaching environment. BSE as described here\naddresses both those needs: it has been successfully used for teaching and\nresearch in a leading UK university since 2012, and the BSE program code is\nfreely available as open-source on GitHuB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2018 05:30:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cliff", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.07545", "submitter": "Franck Gabriel", "authors": "Sylvain Carr\\'e (EPFL), Pierre Collin-Dufresne (EPFL), Franck Gabriel", "title": "Insider Trading with Penalties", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a one-period Kyle (1985) framework where the insider can be\nsubject to a penalty if she trades. We establish existence and uniqueness of\nequilibrium for virtually any penalty function when noise is uniform. In\nequilibrium, the demand of the insider and the price functions are in general\nnon-linear and remain analytically tractable because the expected price\nfunction is linear. We use this result to investigate the trade off between\nprice efficiency and 'fairness': we consider a regulator that wants to minimise\npost-trade standard deviation for a given level of uninformed traders' losses.\nThe minimisation is over the function space of penalties; for each possible\npenalty, our existence and uniqueness theorem allows to define unambiguously\nthe post-trade standard deviation and the uninformed traders' losses that\nprevail in equilibrium.Optimal penalties are characterized in closed-form. They\nmust increase quickly with the magnitude of the insider's order for small\norders and become flat for large orders: in cases where the fundamental\nrealizes at very high or very low values, the insider finds it optimal to trade\ndespite the high penalty. Although such trades-if they occur-are costly for\nliquidity traders, they signal extreme events and therefore incorporate a lot\nof information into prices. We generalize this result in two directions by\nimposing a budget constraint on the regulator and considering the cases of\neither non-pecuniary or pecuniary penalties. In the first case, we establish\nthat optimal penalties are a subset of the previously optimal penalties: the\npatterns of equilibrium trade volumes and prices is unchanged. In the second\ncase, we also fully characterize the constrained efficient points and penalties\nand show that new patterns emerge in the demand schedules of the insider trader\nand the associated price functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Sep 2018 09:30:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Carr\u00e9", "Sylvain", "", "EPFL"], ["Collin-Dufresne", "Pierre", "", "EPFL"], ["Gabriel", "Franck", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08060", "submitter": "Mikko Pakkanen", "authors": "Maxime Morariu-Patrichi and Mikko S.
