Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) agents proved to be to a force to be reckon with in many complex games\nlike Chess and Go. We can look at the stock market historical price series and\nmovements as a complex imperfect information environment in which we try to\nmaximize return - profit and minimize risk. This paper reviews the progress\nmade so far with deep reinforcement learning in the subdomain of AI in finance,\nmore precisely, automated low-frequency quantitative stock trading. Many of the\nreviewed studies had only proof-of-concept ideals with experiments conducted in\nunrealistic settings and no real-time trading applications. For the majority of\nthe works, despite all showing statistically significant improvements in\nperformance compared to established baseline strategies, no decent\nprofitability level was obtained. Furthermore, there is a lack of experimental\ntesting in real-time, online trading platforms and a lack of meaningful\ncomparisons between agents built on different types of DRL or human traders. We\nconclude that DRL in stock trading has showed huge applicability potential\nrivalling professional traders under strong assumptions, but the research is\nstill in the very early stages of development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 22:26:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pricope", "Tidor-Vlad", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.03035", "submitter": "Koya Ishikawa", "authors": "Koya Ishikawa and Kazuhide Nakata", "title": "Online Trading Models in the Forex Market Considering Transaction Costs", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, a wide range of investment models have been created using\nartificial intelligence.

Automatic\ntrading can also be expected to trade with more information than is available\nto humans if it can sufficiently consider past data. In this paper, we propose\nan investment agent based on a deep reinforcement learning model, which is an\nartificial intelligence model. The model considers the transaction costs\ninvolved in actual trading and creates a framework for trading over a long\nperiod of time so that it can make a large profit on a single trade. In doing\nso, it can maximize the profit while keeping transaction costs low. In\naddition, in consideration of actual operations, we use online learning so that\nthe system can continue to learn by constantly updating the latest online data\ninstead of learning with static data.

The strength of our model lies within the fact that it is very\nsimple and can be calibrated to the market zero yield curve using an analytical\nformula. We run several numerical experiments at two different dates, once with\na partially sub-zero interest rate and once with a fully negative interest\nrate. In both cases, we obtain good results in the sense that the model\nreproduces the market term structures very well. We then simulate the model\nusing the Euler-Maruyama scheme and examine the mean, variance and distribution\nof the model. The latter agrees with the skewness and fat tail seen in the\noriginal CIR model. In addition, we compare the model's zero coupon prices with\nmarket prices at different future points in time. Finally, we test the market\nconsistency of the model by evaluating swaptions with different tenors and\nmaturities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2021 15:27:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Di Francesco", "Marco", ""], ["Kamm", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.06974", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Alexander Barzykin, Philippe Bergault, Olivier Gu\\'eant", "title": "Algorithmic market making in foreign exchange cash markets: a new model\n  for active market makers", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1907.01225", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In OTC markets, one of the main tasks of dealers / market makers consists in\nproviding prices at which they agree to buy and sell the assets and securities\nthey have in their scope. With ever increasing trading volume, this quoting\ntask has to be done algorithmically. Over the last ten years, many market\nmaking models have been designed that can be the basis of quoting algorithms in\nOTC markets. However, in the academic literature, most market making models\nadapted to OTC markets are general and only a few focus on specific market\ncharacteristics. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, in all OTC market\nmaking models, the market maker only sets quotes and/or waits for clients.\nHowever, on many markets such as foreign exchange cash markets, market makers\nhave access to liquidity pools where they can unwind part of their inventory.\nIn this paper, we propose a model taking this possibility into account,\ntherefore allowing market makers to trade ``actively'' in the market. The model\ndisplays an important feature well known to practitioners that in a certain\ninventory range the market maker does not actually want to capitalize on this\nactive trading opportunity but should rather ``internalize'' the flow by\nappropriately adjusting the quotes. The larger the market making franchise, the\nwider is the inventory range suitable for internalization.

To address this question, we develop a\ngame-theoretical model where miners first invest in hardware to improve the\nefficiency of their operations, and then compete for mining rewards in a\nrent-seeking game. We argue that because of capacity constraints faced by\nminers, centralization in mining is lower than indicated by both public\ndiscourse and recent academic work. We show that advancements in hardware\nefficiency do not necessarily lead to larger miners increasing their advantage,\nbut rather allow smaller miners to expand and new miners to enter the\ncompetition. Our calibrated model illustrates that hardware efficiency has a\nsmall impact on the cost of attacking a network, while the mining reward has a\nsignificant impact.
