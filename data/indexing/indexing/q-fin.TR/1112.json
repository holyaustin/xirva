The purpose is to understand the interactions of the\ndifferent aspects within a 'semi-closed' system. The complexity and nature of\nthe system led to the process of modifying the pricing mechanism which is\nviewed from a different angle to the classical Brownian Motion and the Random\nWalk model. However, it incorporates the essence of these two fundamental\ntheories and then investigates the matrix of investors' behaviours in relation\nto news feedbacks. This paper also explores the realm of randomly generated\nnews to the responses of participants to determine rational and irrational\nbehaviours. This is carried out through uncompressing the time within the\nexperiment and looking at concordant and disconcordant behaviour. The focus is\non how the modified pricing equation adapts to the conditions and uniqueness\nsurrounding a semi-closed stock market. Thus, this paper looks at how a simple\nmarket system where the main determinants of share prices are news, demand and\nsupply along with some filtering of the external forces can affect the\nbehaviours of investors in terms of their portfolio composition. The return\ndistributions can then be stipulated as arising from rational or irrational\ntrajectories and subsequently be simulated and matched via the proposed\nmodified Brownian Motion model to empirical return distributions in specific\ntime periods and markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 22:13:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2012 16:45:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dhesi", "Dr. Gurjeet", ""], ["Emambocus", "Mohammad Abdul Washad", ""], ["Shakeel", "Muhammad Bilal", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.1838", "submitter": "Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Muzy", "authors": "E.

The type of manipulation, a \"bear raid,\"\nwould have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in July 2007. The regulation, the uptick rule, was\ndesigned to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from\n1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its\naftermath. On November 1, 2007, Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in\ntrading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data\nshows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed\nshares, the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading\nvolume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as\nthere is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number\nof shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and\ncoincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted\neffort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit, i.e., a bear\nraid. Interpretations and analyses of financial markets should consider the\npossibility that the intentional actions of individual actors or coordinated\ngroups can impact market behavior. Markets are not sufficiently transparent to\nreveal even major market manipulation events. Our results point to the need for\nregulations that prevent intentional actions that cause markets to deviate from\nequilibrium and contribute to crashes. Enforcement actions cannot reverse\nsevere damage to the economic system. The current \"alternative\" uptick rule\nwhich is only in effect for stocks dropping by over 10% in a single day is\ninsufficient. Prevention may be achieved through improved availability of\nmarket data and the original uptick rule or other transaction limitations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 02:03:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Dec 2011 23:23:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2012 18:13:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Misra", "Vedant", ""], ["Lagi", "Marco", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.3908", "submitter": "Marco Bardoscia", "authors": "Andre Cardoso Barato, Iacopo Mastromatteo, Marco Bardoscia and Matteo\n  Marsili", "title": "Impact of meta-order in the Minority Game", "comments": "18 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Quantitative Finance 13-9 (2013), pp. 1343-1352", "doi": "10.1080/14697688.2012.756146", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the market impact of a meta-order in the framework of the Minority\nGame.

We\nfind that the profiles of relative price levels where cancellations occur obey\na log-normal distribution. After normalizing the relative price level by\nremoving the factor of order numbers stored at the price level, we find that\nthe profiles exhibit a power-law scaling behavior on the right tails for both\nbuy and sell orders. When focusing on the order cancellation positions in the\nqueue at each price level, we find that the profiles increase rapidly in the\nfront of the queue, and then fluctuate around a constant value till the end of\nthe queue. These profiles are similar for different stocks. In addition, the\nprofiles of cancellation positions can be fitted by an exponent function for\nboth buy and sell orders.
