Traditionally, these models introduce\ndifferent rules of random selection and exchange between pair agents. Unlike\nthese traditional models, this work introduces a chaotic procedure able of\nbreaking the pairing symmetry of agents (i,j)->(j,i). Its results show that,\nthe asymptotic money distributions of a market under chaotic evolution can\nexhibit a transition from Gibbs to Pareto distributions, as the pairing\nsymmetry is progressively broken.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 09:05:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Pellicer-Lostao", "C.", ""], ["Lopez-Ruiz", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.0900", "submitter": "Zolt\\'an Eisler", "authors": "Zoltan Eisler, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Julien Kockelkoren", "title": "The price impact of order book events: market orders, limit orders and\n  cancellations", "comments": "31 pages, 30 figures, accepted to Quantitative Finance; slightly\n  modified text, a changed figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While the long-ranged correlation of market orders and their impact on prices\nhas been relatively well studied in the literature, the corresponding studies\nof limit orders and cancellations are scarce. We provide here an empirical\nstudy of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their\nrespective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data\nthe \"bare\" impact these events would have, if they were to happen in isolation.\nFor large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events\nis permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small\ntick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history dependent part,\nreflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this\neffect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model on the past order\nflow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three\nparts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of\nthe different events, and the modification of the future gaps behind the best\nquotes. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact\nmodel that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when\nother types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to\ndescribe the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2009 10:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2010 09:31:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:37:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eisler", "Zoltan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Kockelkoren", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1402", "submitter": "Samuel V\\'azquez", "authors": "Samuel E.

This information could be\nfundamental for practitioners as the past performance can be affected by the\nnon-stationarity of financial market. In order to highlight this feature, we\nintroduce the 'local risk decomposition' (LRD) formalism, where dynamical\ninformation about a strategy's performance is retained.

In particular, from our simulations the recovery speed of\nthe market after a large order is clearly dependent on the order size, whereas\nthe AFS model assumes a constant speed. For this reason, we propose a\ngeneralization of the AFS model, the GAFS model, that incorporates this\ndependency, and prove the optimal investment strategies. As a corollary, we\nfind that we can derive the ``correct'' constant resilience speed for the AFS\nmodel from the GAFS model such that the optimal strategies of the AFS and the\nGAFS model coincide. Finally, we show that the costs of applying the optimal\nstrategies of the GAFS model to the artificial market environment still differ\nsignificantly from the model predictions, indicating that even the improved\nmodel does not capture all of the relevant details of a real market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 11:27:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2010 08:03:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Weiss", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4364", "submitter": "Vladimir Vovk", "authors": "Vladimir Vovk", "title": "Continuous-time trading and the emergence of probability", "comments": "54 pages, as compared with the previous version, the main result\n  (Theorem 6.3) slightly strengthened and a few further clarifications added", "journal-ref": "Finance and Stochastics 16:561-609 (2012)", "doi": "10.1007/s00780-012-0180-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper establishes a non-stochastic analogue of the celebrated result by\nDubins and Schwarz about reduction of continuous martingales to Brownian motion\nvia time change.
