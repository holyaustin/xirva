In particular, order arrivals are modeled as a point process whose\nintensity depends on the liquidation price. We set up a stochastic control\nproblem in which the goal is to maximize the expected revenue from liquidating\nthe entire position held. We solve this optimal liquidation problem for\npower-law and exponential-decay order book models and discuss several\nextensions. We also consider the continuous selling (or fluid) limit when the\ntrading units are ever smaller and the intensity is ever larger. This limit\nprovides an analytical approximation to the value function and the optimal\nsolution. Using techniques from viscosity solutions we show that the discrete\nstate problem and its optimal solution converge to the corresponding quantities\nin the continuous selling limit uniformly on compacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 May 2011 06:33:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 07:48:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2011 01:13:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 19:47:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 21:16:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Ludkovski", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1694", "submitter": "Bence T\\'oth", "authors": "Bence Toth, Yves Lemperiere, Cyril Deremble, Joachim de Lataillade,\n  Julien Kockelkoren, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "title": "Anomalous price impact and the critical nature of liquidity in financial\n  markets", "comments": "16 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Physical Review X 1, 021006 (2011)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevX.1.021006", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a dynamical theory of market liquidity that predicts that the\naverage supply/demand profile is V-shaped and {\\it vanishes} around the current\nprice.

Second, the\nanomalously small local liquidity induces a breakdown of linear response and a\ndiverging impact of small orders, explaining the \"square-root\" impact law, for\nwhich we provide additional empirical support.

Moreover, the\nco-existence of \"public disclosure requirement\" and \"heterogeneous prior\nbeliefs\" leads to the fluctuant multi-period expected profits and a larger\ntotal expected trading volume which is positively related to the degree of\nheterogeneity.
