The numerical approximation of the value function and\nthe optimal quotes in these models remains a challenge when the number of\nassets is large. In this article, we propose closed-form approximations for the\nvalue functions of many multi-asset extensions of the Avellaneda-Stoikov model.\nThese approximations or proxies can be used (i) as heuristic evaluation\nfunctions, (ii) as initial value functions in reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, and/or (iii) directly to design quoting strategies through a greedy\napproach. Regarding the latter, our results lead to new and easily\ninterpretable closed-form approximations for the optimal quotes, both in the\nfinite-horizon case and in the asymptotic (ergodic) regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Oct 2018 06:31:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Sep 2020 12:54:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 May 2021 13:38:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bergault", "Philippe", ""], ["Evangelista", "David", ""], ["Gu\u00e9ant", "Olivier", ""], ["Vieira", "Douglas", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.05884", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant, Jiang Pu", "title": "Mid-price estimation for European corporate bonds: a particle filtering\n  approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In most illiquid markets, there is no obvious proxy for the market price of\nan asset.

The key novelty is that we propose to employ\nadversarial training to improve the generalization of a neural network\nprediction model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the\ninput features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is\nessentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature.\nAs such, normal training with static price-based features (e.g. the close\nprice) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable\nmodels. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate\nthe stochasticity of price variable, and train the model to work well under\nsmall yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world\nstock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution with\n3.11% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, validating the\nusefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Oct 2018 07:27:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Jun 2019 11:43:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Fuli", ""], ["Chen", "Huimin", ""], ["He", "Xiangnan", ""], ["Ding", "Ji", ""], ["Sun", "Maosong", ""], ["Chua", "Tat-Seng", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10845", "submitter": "Juho Kanniainen", "authors": "Milla M\\\"akinen, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis", "title": "Forecasting of Jump Arrivals in Stock Prices: New Attention-based\n  Network Architecture using Limit Order Book Data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The existing literature provides evidence that limit order book data can be\nused to predict short-term price movements in stock markets.

The data set consists of order book data on five liquid U.S.\nstocks. The use of the attention mechanism makes it possible to analyze the\nimportance of the inclusion limit order book data and other input variables. By\nusing this mechanism, we provide evidence that the use of limit order book data\nwas found to improve the performance of the proposed model in jump prediction,\neither clearly or marginally, depending on the underlying stock.
