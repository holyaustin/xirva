The SMQ is\ndesigned within a framework where we analyse the dynamics of excess price moves\nfrom one directional change of price to the next. We use the SMQ to quantify\nthe FX market and evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology at major\nnews announcements. The evolution of SMQ magnitudes from 2003 to 2009 is\nanalysed across major currency pairs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 12:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bisig", "T.", ""], ["Dupuis", "A.", ""], ["Impagliazzo", "V.", ""], ["Olsen", "R.

Since its name was coined in 1995\nby merging the words Economics and Physics, this new interdisciplinary field\nhas grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics (wealth\ndistributions), microstructure of financial markets (order book modelling),\neconometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. In the first part of the\nreview, we discuss on the emergence of Econophysics. Then we present empirical\nstudies revealing statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the\npresentation with the widely acknowledged stylized facts which describe the\nreturns of financial assets- fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation,\netc.- and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way\ntime is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties\nobserved on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this\nreview, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own\nhigh-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of\ncorrelations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are\npresented. In the second part of the review, we deal with models in\nEconophysics through the point of view of agent-based modelling. Amongst a\nlarge number of multi-agent-based models, we have identified three\nrepresentative areas. First, using previous work originally presented in the\nfields of behavioural finance and market microstructure theory, econophysicists\nhave developed agent-based models of order-driven markets that are extensively\npresented here. Second, kinetic theory models designed to explain some\nempirical facts on wealth distribution are reviewed. Third, we briefly\nsummarize game theory models by reviewing the now classic minority game and\nrelated problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 15:25:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 13:43:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborti", "Anirban", ""], ["Toke", "Ioane Muni", ""], ["Patriarca", "Marco", ""], ["Abergel", "Frederic", ""]]}]
