A\nstock trading network consists of nodes and directed links, where every trader\nis a node and a link is formed from one trader to the other if the former sells\nshares to the latter. Specifically, three abnormal network motifs are\ninvestigated, which are found to be formed by a few traders, implying potential\nintention of price manipulation. We further investigate the dynamics of\nvolatility, trading volume, average trade size and turnover around the\ntransactions associated with the abnormal motifs for large, medium and small\ntrades. It is found that these variables peak at the abnormal events and\nexhibit a power-law accumulation in the pre-event time period and a power-law\nrelaxation in the post-event period. We also find that the cumulative excess\nreturns are significantly positive after buyer-initiated suspicious trades and\nexhibit a mild price reversal after seller-initiated suspicious trades. These\nfindings can be better understood in favor of price manipulation. Our work shed\nnew lights into the detection of price manipulation resorting to the abnormal\nmotifs of complex trading networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2012 05:49:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Zhi-Qiang", "", "ECUST"], ["Xie", "Wen-Jie", "", "ECUST"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Yong-Jie", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "W. -X.", "", "ECUST"]]}, {"id": "1301.1135", "submitter": "Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Muzy", "authors": "E.
