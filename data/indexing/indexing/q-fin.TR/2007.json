We demonstrate the instantaneous Epps effect\nunder a simulation setting and provide a simple method to ameliorate the\neffect. We find that using the previous tick interpolation in the\nCuchiero-Teichmann estimator results in unstable estimates when dealing with\nasynchrony, while the ability to bypass the time domain with the\nMalliavin-Mancino estimator allows it to produce stable estimates and is\ntherefore better suited for ultra-high frequency finance.

Yet, not much is known about\ntheir impact, especially on countries imposing them. Here we show that export\nbans are, by and large, counterproductive. Using a model of shock diffusion\nthrough the network of international trade, we simulate the impact of\nrestrictions under different scenarios. We observe that while they would be\nbeneficial to a country implementing them in isolation, their generalized use\nmakes most countries worse off relative to a no-ban scenario. As a corollary,\nwe estimate that prices increase in many countries imposing the restrictions.\nWe also find that the cost of restraining from export bans is small, even when\nothers continue to implement them. Finally, we document a change in countries'\nposition within the international trade network, suggesting that export bans\nhave geopolitical implications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2020 11:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Grassia", "Marco", ""], ["Mangioni", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Schiavo", "Stefano", ""], ["Traverso", "Silvio", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.14162", "submitter": "Ryan Donnelly", "authors": "Weston Barger, Ryan Donnelly", "title": "Insider Trading with Temporary Price Impact", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We model an informed agent with information about the future value of an\nasset trying to maximize profits when subjected to a transaction cost as well\nas a market maker tasked with setting fair transaction prices.
