Recent work illustrates that Proof of Stake\n(PoS) is vulnerable to financial attacks arising from on-chain lending and has\nworse capital efficiency than Proof of Work (PoW) \\cite{fanti_pos_econ}.\nNumerous methods for improving capital efficiency have been proposed that allow\nstakers to create fungible derivative claims on their staked assets. In this\npaper, we construct a unifying model for studying the security risks of these\nproposals. This model combines birth-death P\\'olya processes and risk models\nadapted from the credit derivatives literature to assess token inequality and\nreturn profiles. We find that there is a sharp transition between 'safe' and\n'unsafe' derivative usage. Surprisingly, we find that contrary to\n\\cite{fanti2019compounding} there exist conditions where derivatives can\n\\emph{reduce} concentration of wealth in these networks. This model also\napplies to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols where staked assets are used\nas insurance. Our theoretical results are validated using agent-based\nsimulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2020 20:59:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chitra", "Tarun", ""], ["Evans", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.11426", "submitter": "Bastien Baldacci", "authors": "Bastien Baldacci, Jerome Benveniste", "title": "A note on Almgren-Chriss optimal execution problem with geometric\n  Brownian motion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We solve explicitly the Almgren-Chriss optimal liquidation problem where the\nstock price process follows a geometric Brownian motion.
