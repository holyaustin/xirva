The optimal split of an\norder through time (`optimal trade scheduling') and space (`smart order\nrouting') is of high interest \\rred{to} practitioners because of the increasing\ncomplexity of the market micro structure because of the evolution recently of\nregulations and liquidity worldwide. This paper translates into quantitative\nterms these regulatory issues and, more broadly, current market design. It\nrelates the recent advances in optimal trading, order-book simulation and\noptimal liquidity to the reality of trading in an emerging global network of\nliquidity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 12:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.5966", "submitter": "Gregory Laughlin", "authors": "Gregory Laughlin, Anthony Aguirre, Joseph Grundfest", "title": "Information Transmission Between Financial Markets in Chicago and New\n  York", "comments": "18 pages, 10 figures.

Using relativistically\ncorrect millisecond-resolution tick data, we document a 3-millisecond decrease\nin one-way communication time between the Chicago and New York areas that has\noccurred from April 27th, 2010 to August 17th, 2012. We attribute the first\nsegment of this decline to the introduction of a latency-optimized fiber optic\nconnection in late 2010. A second phase of latency decrease can be attributed\nto line-of-sight microwave networks, operating primarily in the 6-11 GHz region\nof the spectrum, licensed during 2011 and 2012. Using publicly available\ninformation, we estimate these networks' latencies and bandwidths. We estimate\nthe total infrastructure and 5-year operations costs associated with these\nlatency improvements to exceed $500 million.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2013 23:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Laughlin", "Gregory", ""], ["Aguirre", "Anthony", ""], ["Grundfest", "Joseph", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.6363", "submitter": "Charles-Albert Lehalle", "authors": "Robert Azencott and Arjun Beri and Yutheeka Gadhyan and Nicolas Joseph\n  and Charles-Albert Lehalle and Matthew Rowley", "title": "Realtime market microstructure analysis: online Transaction Cost\n  Analysis", "comments": "33 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the practical challenge in monitoring the performance of a large\nnumber of algorithmic trading orders, this paper provides a methodology that\nleads to automatic discovery of the causes that lie behind a poor trading\nperformance. It also gives theoretical foundations to a generic framework for\nreal-time trading analysis. Academic literature provides different ways to\nformalize these algorithms and show how optimal they can be from a\nmean-variance, a stochastic control, an impulse control or a statistical\nlearning viewpoint. This paper is agnostic about the way the algorithm has been\nbuilt and provides a theoretical formalism to identify in real-time the market\nconditions that influenced its efficiency or inefficiency. For a given set of\ncharacteristics describing the market context, selected by a practitioner, we\nfirst show how a set of additional derived explanatory factors, called anomaly\ndetectors, can be created for each market order. We then will present an online\nmethodology to quantify how this extended set of factors, at any given time,\npredicts which of the orders are underperforming while calculating the\npredictive power of this explanatory factor set. Armed with this information,\nwhich we call influence analysis, we intend to empower the order monitoring\nuser to take appropriate action on any affected orders by re-calibrating the\ntrading algorithms working the order through new parameters, pausing their\nexecution or taking over more direct trading control. Also we intend that use\nof this method in the post trade analysis of algorithms can be taken advantage\nof to automatically adjust their trading action.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2013 09:04:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 15:49:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Azencott", "Robert", ""], ["Beri", "Arjun", ""], ["Gadhyan", "Yutheeka", ""], ["Joseph", "Nicolas", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Rowley", "Matthew", ""]]}]
