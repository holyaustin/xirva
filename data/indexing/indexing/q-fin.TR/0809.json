This is called\nthe \"zero sum fallacy\" -- the erroneous belief that one trader in a stock\nmarket exchange can only improve their position provided some other trader's\nposition deteriorates. However, a positive sum game in absolute terms can be\nrecast as a zero sum game in relative terms. Similarly it appears that negative\nsum games in absolute terms have been recast as zero sum games in relative\nterms: otherwise, why would zero sum games be used to represent situations of\nwar?

Because revealed market liquidity is\nextremely low, large orders to buy or sell can only be traded incrementally,\nover periods of time as long as months. As a result order flow is a highly\npersistent long-memory process. Maintaining compatibility with market\nefficiency has profound consequences on price formation, on the dynamics of\nliquidity, and on the nature of impact. We review a body of theory that makes\ndetailed quantitative predictions about the volume and time dependence of\nmarket impact, the bid-ask spread, order book dynamics, and volatility.\nComparisons to data yield some encouraging successes. This framework suggests a\nnovel interpretation of financial information, in which agents are at best only\nweakly informed and all have a similar and extremely noisy impact on prices.\nMost of the processed information appears to come from supply and demand\nitself, rather than from external news. The ideas reviewed here are relevant to\nmarket microstructure regulation, agent-based models, cost-optimal execution\nstrategies, and understanding market ecologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2008 14:21:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
