The corresponding dynamic\nprogramming (DP) equation is a quasi-variational inequality (QVI) with solvency\nconstraint satisfied by the value function in the sense of constrained\nviscosity solutions. By taking advantage of the lag variable tracking the time\ninterval between trades, we can provide an explicit backward numerical scheme\nfor the time discretization of the DPQVI. The convergence of this discrete-time\nscheme is shown by viscosity solutions arguments. An optimal quantization\nmethod is used for computing the (conditional) expectations arising in this\nscheme. Numerical results are presented by examining the behaviour of optimal\nliquidation strategies, and comparative performance analysis with respect to\nsome benchmark execution strategies. We also illustrate our optimal liquidation\nalgorithm on real data, and observe various interesting patterns of order\nexecution strategies. Finally, we provide some numerical tests of sensitivity\nwith respect to the bid/ask spread and market impact parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jun 2010 02:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Guilbaud", "Fabien", ""], ["Mnif", "Mohamed", ""], ["Pham", "Huy\u00ean", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1882", "submitter": "Alexander Petersen", "authors": "Alexander M.

We define the time of a market shock T_{c} to be the time for\nwhich the market volatility V(T_{c}) has a peak that exceeds a predetermined\nthreshold. The cascade of high volatility \"aftershocks\" triggered by the \"main\nshock\" is quantitatively similar to earthquakes and solar flares, which have\nbeen described by three empirical laws --- the Omori law, the productivity law,\nand the Bath law. We analyze the most traded 531 stocks in U.S. markets during\nthe two-year period 2001-2002 at the 1-minute time resolution. We find\nquantitative relations between (i) the \"main shock\" magnitude M \\equiv \\log\nV(T_{c}) occurring at the time T_{c} of each of the 219 \"volatility quakes\"\nanalyzed, and (ii) the parameters quantifying the decay of volatility\naftershocks as well as the volatility preshocks. We also find that stocks with\nlarger trading activity react more strongly and more quickly to market shocks\nthan stocks with smaller trading activity. Our findings characterize the\ntypical volatility response conditional on M, both at the market and the\nindividual stock scale. We argue that there is potential utility in these three\nstatistical quantitative relations with applications in option pricing and\nvolatility trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 19:28:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Oct 2010 12:56:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Wang", "Fengzhong", ""], ["Havlin", "Shlomo", ""], ["Stanley", "H.
