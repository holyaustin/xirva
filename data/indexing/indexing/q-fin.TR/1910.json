These problems stem from technical shortcomings that are not\naccounted for in the simple conceptual models used for theoretical market\nanalysis. They, thus, call for more pragmatic market design methodologies that\nconsider the various infrastructure complexities and their potential impact on\nthe market procedures. First, we formally define temporal fairness and then\nexplain why it is very difficult for order-matching policies to ensure it in\ncontinuous markets. Subsequently, we introduce a list of system requirements\nand evaluate existing \"fair\" market designs in various practical and\nadversarial scenarios. We conclude that they fail to retain their properties in\nthe presence of infrastructure inefficiencies and sophisticated technical\nmanipulation attacks. Based on these findings, we then introduce Libra, a\n\"fair\" policy that is resilient to gaming and tolerant of technical\ncomplications. Our security analysis shows that it is significantly more robust\nthan existing designs, while Libra's deployment (in a live foreign currency\nexchange) validated both its considerably low impact on the operation of the\nmarket and its ability to reduce speed-based predatory trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 11:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mavroudis", "Vasilios", ""], ["Melton", "Hayden", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.02194", "submitter": "Geoffrey Ramseyer", "authors": "Geoffrey Ramseyer, Ashish Goel, David Mazieres", "title": "Liquidity in Credit Networks with Constrained Agents", "comments": "To be published in TheWebConf 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3366423.3380276", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In order to scale transaction rates for deployment across the global web,\nmany cryptocurrencies have deployed so-called \"Layer-2\" networks of private\npayment channels. An idealized payment network behaves like a Credit Network, a\nmodel for transactions across a network of bilateral trust relationships.\nCredit Networks capture many aspects of traditional currencies as well as new\nvirtual currencies and payment mechanisms. In the traditional credit network\nmodel, if an agent defaults, every other node that trusted it is vulnerable to\nloss. In a cryptocurrency context, trust is manufactured by capital deposits,\nand thus there arises a natural tradeoff between network liquidity (i.e. the\nfraction of transactions that succeed) and the cost of capital deposits.\n  In this paper, we introduce constraints that bound the total amount of loss\nthat the rest of the network can suffer if an agent (or a set of agents) were\nto default - equivalently, how the network changes if agents can support\nlimited solvency guarantees.\n  We show that these constraints preserve the analytical structure of a credit\nnetwork. Furthermore, we show that aggregate borrowing constraints greatly\nsimplify the network structure and in the payment network context achieve the\noptimal tradeoff between liquidity and amount of escrowed capital.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Oct 2019 02:19:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 02:47:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 22:02:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ramseyer", "Geoffrey", ""], ["Goel", "Ashish", ""], ["Mazieres", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.03068", "submitter": "Marius Zoican", "authors": "Mariana Khapko, Marius Zoican", "title": "Do speed bumps curb low-latency trading?
