In our model the value\nfunction can be described by a three-dimensional system of backward stochastic\ndifferential equations (BSDE) with a singular terminal condition in one\ncomponent. We prove existence and uniqueness of a solution to the BSDE system\nand characterize both the value function and the optimal strategy in terms of\nthe unique solution to the BSDE system. Our existence proof is based on an\nasymptotic expansion of the BSDE system at the terminal time that allows us to\nexpress the system in terms of a equivalent system with finite terminal value\nbut singular driver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 18:18:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 12:17:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 13:49:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 14:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Graewe", "Paulwin", ""], ["Horst", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04091", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Hai-Chuan Xu, Zhi-Qiang Jiang and Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Immediate price impact of a stock and its warrant: Power-law or\n  logarithmic model?", "comments": "11 Latex pages including 4 figures and 4 tables. accepted by\n  International Journal of Modern Physics B", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Modern Physics B 31 (8), 1750048 (2017)", "doi": "10.1142/S0217979217500485", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on the order flow data of a stock and its warrant, the immediate price\nimpacts of market orders are estimated by two competitive models, the power-law\nmodel (PL model) and the logarithmic model (LG model).

We demonstrate that\nwhile the parameters of intraday agent-based models rooted in market\nmicrostructure can be meaningfully calibrated, those exclusively related to\nagent behaviors and incentives remain problematic. This could simply be a\nfailure of the calibration techniques used but we argue that the observed\nparameter degeneracies are most likely a consequence of the realistic matching\nprocesses employed in these models. This suggests that alternative approaches\nto linking data, phenomenology and market structure may be necessary and that\nit is conceivable that one could construct a useful model that does not\ndirectly depend on the nuances of agent behaviors, even when it is known that\nthe real agents engage in complex behaviors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 16:31:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 14:59:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:16:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Platt", "Donovan", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""]]}]
