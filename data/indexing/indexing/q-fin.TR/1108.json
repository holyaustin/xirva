Two possible explanations\nare herding, corresponding to positive correlation in the behavior of different\ninvestors, or order splitting, corresponding to positive autocorrelation in the\nbehavior of single investors. We investigate this using order flow data from\nthe London Stock Exchange for which we have membership identifiers. By\nformulating models for herding and order splitting, as well as models for\nbrokerage choice, we are able to overcome the distortion introduced by\nbrokerage. On timescales of less than a few hours the persistence of order flow\nis overwhelmingly due to splitting rather than herding. We also study the\nproperties of brokerage order flow and show that it is remarkably consistent\nboth cross-sectionally and longitudinally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2011 08:50:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 09:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Toth", "Bence", ""], ["Palit", "Imon", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

The use of the high's and low's of the bridge\nassociated with the original process makes the estimators significantly more\nefficient that the standard realized variance estimators and its\ngeneralizations. Adding the information on the occurrence times of the high and\nlow values improves further the efficiency of the estimators, much above those\nof the well-known realized variance estimator and those derived from the sum of\nGarman and Klass spot variance estimators.
