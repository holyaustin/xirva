We develop an effective description of state of the game.\nFor the payoff function $g(x)=\\sgn (x)$ we explicitly represent the game as the\nMarkov process and prove the finitness of number of states. We also demonstrate\nboundedness of the utility function. Using these facts we can explain all\ninteresting observable features of the aggregated demand: appearance of strong\nfluctuations, their periodicity and existence of prefered levels. For another\npayoff, $g(x)=x$, the number of states is still finite and utility remains\nbounded but the number of states cannot be reduced and probabilities of states\nare not calculated. However, using properties of the utility and analysing the\ngame in terms of de Bruijn graphs, we can also explain distinct peaks of demand\nand their frequencies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2009 17:19:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2009 13:45:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 18:15:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wawrzyniak", "Karol", ""], ["Wislicki", "Wojciech", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.3282", "submitter": "Takashi Kato", "authors": "Takashi Kato", "title": "An Optimal Execution Problem with Market Impact", "comments": "36 pages, 8 figures, a modified version of the article \"An optimal\n  execution problem with market impact\" in Finance and Stochastics (2014)", "journal-ref": "Finance and Stochastics, 18(3), pp.695-732 (2014)", "doi": "10.1007/s00780-014-0232-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study an optimal execution problem in a continuous-time market model that\nconsiders market impact.
