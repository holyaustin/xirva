This framework accounts for a\nnonlinear impact of trades on average market prices. The results of Almgren\n(2003) are based on the assumption that no shares of assets per unit of time\nare trade at the beginning of the period. We propose a general solution method\nthat accomodates the case of a positive stock of assets in the initial period.\nOur findings are twofold. First of all, we show that the problem admits a\nsolution with no trading in the opening period only if additional parametric\nrestrictions are imposed. Second, with positive asset holdings in the initial\nperiod, the optimal execution time depends on trading activity at the beginning\nof the planning period.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2011 14:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Marzo", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Ritelli", "Daniele", ""], ["Zagaglia", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7103", "submitter": "Nicolas Huth", "authors": "Nicolas Huth, Fr\\'ed\\'eric Abergel", "title": "High Frequency Lead/lag Relationships - Empirical facts", "comments": "40 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lead/lag relationships are an important stylized fact at high frequency. Some\nassets follow the path of others with a small time lag. We provide indicators\nto measure this phenomenon using tick-by-tick data. Strongly asymmetric\ncross-correlation functions are empirically observed, especially in the\nfuture/stock case. We confirm the intuition that the most liquid assets (short\nintertrade duration, narrow bid/ask spread, small volatility, high turnover)\ntend to lead smaller stocks. However, the most correlated stocks are those with\nsimilar levels of liquidity. This lead/lag phenomenon is not constant\nthroughout the day, it shows an intraday seasonality with changes of behaviour\nat very specific times such as the announcement of macroeconomic figures and\nthe US market opening. These lead/lag relationships become more and more\npronounced as we zoom on significant events. We reach 60% of accuracy when\nforecasting the next midquote variation of the lagger using only the past\ninformation of the leader, which is significantly better than using the\ninformation of the lagger only. However, a naive strategy based on market\norders cannot make any profit of this effect because of the bid/ask spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 10:00:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2012 22:52:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Huth", "Nicolas", ""], ["Abergel", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""]]}]
