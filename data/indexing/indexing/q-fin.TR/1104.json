Exploiting a database where the broker that initiates an\norder book event can be identified, we decompose the correlation and response\nfunctions into contributions coming from different market participants and\nstudy how their behaviour is interconnected. We find evidence that (1) brokers\nare very heterogeneous in liquidity provision -- some are consistently\nliquidity providers while others are consistently liquidity takers. (2) The\nbehaviour of brokers is strongly conditioned on the actions of {\\it other}\nbrokers. In contrast brokers are only weakly influenced by the impact of their\nown previous orders. (3) The total impact of market orders is the result of a\nsubtle compensation between the same broker pushing the price in one direction\nand the liquidity provision of other brokers pushing it in the opposite\ndirection. These results enforce the picture of market dynamics being the\nresult of the competition between heterogeneous participants interacting to\nform a complicated market ecology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Apr 2011 14:40:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 09:02:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Toth", "Bence", ""], ["Eisler", "Zoltan", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Kockelkoren", "Julien", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

Through\nits analytical tractability, the model allows to obtain analytical expressions\nfor various quantities of interest such as the distribution of the duration\nbetween price changes, the distribution and autocorrelation of price changes,\nand the probability of an upward move in the price, {\\it conditional} on the\nstate of the order book. We study the diffusion limit of the price process and\nexpress the volatility of price changes in terms of parameters describing the\narrival rates of buy and sell orders and cancelations. These analytical results\nprovide some insight into the relation between order flow and price dynamics in\norder-driven markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Apr 2011 00:16:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Cont", "Rama", ""], ["De Larrard", "Adrien", ""]]}]
