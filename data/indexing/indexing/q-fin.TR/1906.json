Learning expert agents' reward functions through their\nexternal demonstrations is hence particularly relevant for subsequent design of\nrealistic agent-based simulations. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims at\nacquiring such reward functions through inference, allowing to generalize the\nresulting policy to states not observed in the past. This paper investigates\nwhether IRL can infer such rewards from agents within real financial stochastic\nenvironments: limit order books (LOB). We introduce a simple one-level LOB,\nwhere the interactions of a number of stochastic agents and an expert trading\nagent are modelled as a Markov decision process. We consider two cases for the\nexpert's reward: either a simple linear function of state features; or a\ncomplex, more realistic non-linear function. Given the expert agent's\ndemonstrations, we attempt to discover their strategy by modelling their latent\nreward function using linear and Gaussian process (GP) regressors from previous\nliterature, and our own approach through Bayesian neural networks (BNN). While\nthe three methods can learn the linear case, only the GP-based and our proposed\nBNN methods are able to discover the non-linear reward case. Our BNN IRL\nalgorithm outperforms the other two approaches as the number of samples\nincreases.
