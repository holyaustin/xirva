For low\nmarket impact, overconfidence in a particular asset makes an investor become\ninsensitive to losses and a delayed strategy adjustment leads to a decline in\nwealth, and thereafter, one's runaway from the market. For high market impact,\nunder-confidence in a particular asset makes an investor over-sensitive to\nlosses and one's too frequent strategy adjustment leads to a large fluctuation\nin asset prices, and thereafter, a decrease in the number of agents.

No matter what the\nmarket impact is, an equilibrium between different markets exists, which is\nreflected in the occurrence of similar price fluctuations in different markets.\nA theoretical analysis indicates that such an equilibrium results from the\ncoupled effects of strategy updating and shift in investment. The runaway of\nthe agents trading a specific asset will lead to a decline in the asset price\nvolatility and such a decline will be inhibited by the clustering of the\nstrategies.
