Modeling the spread by the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process, we analyze three different trading strategies: (i)\nthe long-short strategy; (ii) the short-long strategy, and (iii) the chooser\nstrategy, i.e. the trader can enter into the spread by taking either long or\nshort position. In each of these cases, we solve an optimal double stopping\nproblem to determine the optimal timing for starting and subsequently closing\nthe position. We utilize the local time-space calculus of Peskir (2005a) and\nderive the nonlinear integral equations of Volterra-type that uniquely char-\nacterize the boundaries associated with the optimal timing decisions in all\nthree problems. These integral equations are used to numerically compute the\noptimal boundaries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 00:22:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 04:21:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Tim", ""], ["Kitapbayev", "Yerkin", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.01327", "submitter": "Antoine Jacquier Dr.", "authors": "Antoine Jacquier and Hao Liu", "title": "Optimal liquidation in a Level-I limit order book for large tick stocks", "comments": "27 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a framework to study the optimal liquidation strategy in a limit\norder book for large-tick stocks, with spread equal to one tick.

Our goal is to maximise the expected terminal wealth of an agent\nwho needs to liquidate her positions within a fixed time horizon. Assuming that\nthe agent trades (through sell limit order or/and sell market order) only when\nthe price moves, we model her liquidation procedure as a semi-Markov decision\nprocess, and compute the semi-Markov kernel using Laplace method in the\nlanguage of queueing theory. The optimal liquidation policy is then solved by\ndynamic programming, and illustrated numerically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 14:26:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:28:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Nov 2017 21:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Jacquier", "Antoine", ""], ["Liu", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.03098", "submitter": "Shanshan Wang", "authors": "Shanshan Wang", "title": "Trading strategies for stock pairs regarding to the cross-impact cost", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend the framework of trading strategies of Gatheral [2010] from single\nstocks to a pair of stocks.

By minimizing the potential cost\narising from cross-impacts, i.e., the price change of one stock due to the\ntrades of another stock, we can find out an optimal strategy for executing a\nsequence of trades from different stocks.
