We describe the\nbehavior when some uninformed agents, who we call switchers, decide whether or\nnot to pay for information before they trade. By paying for the information\nthey behave as informed traders. First we verify that our model is able to\nreproduce some of the stylized facts in real financial markets. Next we\nconsider the relationship between switching and the market volatility under\ndifferent structures of investors. We find that there exists a positive\nrelationship between the market volatility and the percentage of switchers. We\ntherefore conclude that the switchers are a destabilizing factor in the market.\nHowever, for a given fixed percentage of switchers, the proportion of switchers\nthat decide to buy information at a given moment of time is negatively related\nto the current market volatility. In other words, if more agents pay for\ninformation to know the fundamental value at some time, the market volatility\nwill be lower. This is because the market price is closer to the fundamental\nvalue due to information diffusion between switchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 06:02:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 16:51:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 09:06:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yi-Fang", ""], ["Zhang", "Wei", ""], ["Xu", "Chao", ""], ["Andersen", "J\u00f8rgen Vitting", ""], ["Xu", "Hai-Chuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.4342", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant, Jiang Pu", "title": "Option pricing and hedging with execution costs and market impact", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article considers the pricing and hedging of a call option when\nliquidity matters, that is, either for a large nominal or for an illiquid\nunderlying asset.

We relate this shape\nto the probability of execution of a limit order, highlighting a law of\nconservation of the flows of orders in an order book. We then extend our model\nby allowing random sizes of limit orders, hereby allowing to study the\nrelationship between the size of the incoming limit orders and the shape of the\norder book. Our theoretical model shows that, for a given total volume of\nincoming limit orders, the less limit orders are submitted (i.e. the larger the\naverage size of these limit orders), the deeper is the order book around the\nspread.

The basic idea is that\nmost of the daily liquidity is \"latent\" and furthermore vanishes linearly\naround the current price, as a consequence of the diffusion of the price\nitself. However, the numerical implementation of Toth et al. was criticised as\nbeing unrealistic, in particular because all the \"intelligence\" was conferred\nto market orders, while limit orders were passive and random. In this work, we\nstudy various alternative specifications of the model, for example allowing\nlimit orders to react to the order flow, or changing the execution protocols.\nBy and large, our study lends strong support to the idea that the square-root\nimpact law is a very generic and robust property that requires very few\ningredients to be valid. We also show that the transition from super-diffusion\nto sub-diffusion reported in Toth et al. is in fact a cross-over, but that the\noriginal model can be slightly altered in order to give rise to a genuine phase\ntransition, which is of interest on its own. We finally propose a general\ntheoretical framework to understand how a non-linear impact may appear even in\nthe limit where the bias in the order flow is vanishingly small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 11:08:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:47:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mastromatteo", "Iacopo", ""], ["Toth", "Bence", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}]
