Still as illustrated by the recent turmoil in\nfinancial markets initiated by the so called subprime crisis there is clearly\nan urgent need for new tools in our understanding and handling of financial\nspeculative bubbles. In contrast to periods of fast growth, the nature of\nmarket dynamics profoundly changes during speculative bubbles where self\ncontained strategies often leads to unconditional buying. A critical question\nis therefore whether such a signature can be quantified, and if so, used in the\nunderstanding of what are the sufficient and necessary conditions in the\ncreation of a speculative bubble. Here we show a new technique, based on agent\nbased simulations, gives a robust measure of detachment of trading choices\ncreated by feedback, and predicts the onset of speculative bubbles in\nexperiments with human subjects. We use trading data obtained from experiments\nwith humans as input to computer simulations of artificial agents that use\nadaptive strategies defined from game theory....\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jun 2008 17:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Roszczynska", "Magda", ""], ["Nowak", "Andrzej", ""], ["Kamieniarz", "Daniel", ""], ["Solomon", "Sorin", ""], ["Andersen", "Jorgen Vitting", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2444", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Zhi-Qiang Jiang (ECUST), Wei Chen (SZSE), Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Detrended fluctuation analysis of intertrade durations", "comments": "15 Elsart pages including 4 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": "Physica A 388 (4), 433-440 (2009)", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2008.10.028", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The intraday pattern, long memory, and multifractal nature of the intertrade\ndurations, which are defined as the waiting times between two consecutive\ntransactions, are investigated based upon the limit order book data and order\nflows of 23 liquid Chinese stocks listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in\n2003.

Our agents\ninvest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on\nthree sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)\ninformation from their \"friendship\" network and (iii) private information. Our\nbounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the\ncurrent market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in\ntheir trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find\nthat bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due\nto a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a\ntransient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the\nprice has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,\nwhich brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients\nprovide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial\nmarkets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current\nmarket regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.\nA positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms\n(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles\nand crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite\n(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a\nsingle framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the\ndistribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are\nqualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 13:14:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:52:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Harras", "Georges", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}]
