Informational footprint is\nrelated to order flow and is represented by the trader's influence on the flow\nimbalance process, while microstructure influence is captured by instantaneous\nprice impact. We propose a continuous-time stochastic control problem that\nbalances between these two costs. Incorporating order flow imbalance leads to\nthe consideration of the current market state and specifically whether one's\norders lean with or against the prevailing order flow, key components often\nignored by execution models in the literature. In particular, to react to\nchanging order flow, we endogenize the trading horizon $T$. After developing\nthe general indefinite-horizon formulation, we investigate several tractable\napproximations that sequentially optimize over price impact and over $T$. These\napproximations, especially a dynamic version based on receding horizon control,\nare shown to be very accurate and connect to the prevailing Almgren-Chriss\nframework. We also discuss features of empirical order flow and links between\nour model and \"Optimal Execution Horizon\" by Easley et al (Mathematical\nFinance, 2013).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 07:16:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 06:47:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bechler", "Kyle", ""], ["Ludkovski", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.4890", "submitter": "Matteo Formenti", "authors": "Matteo Formenti", "title": "Can Market Risk Perception Drive Inefficient Prices?
