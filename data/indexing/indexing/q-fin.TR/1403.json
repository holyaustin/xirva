The\nanalysis shows that the whole market effectively approaches a global objective,\ndespite that the market is designed such that each agent only cares about its\nown goal. Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for\noptimising the global objective. An intimate connection between machine\nlearning and our markets is thus established, such that we could 1) analyse a\nmarket by applying machine learning methods to the global objective, and 2)\nsolve machine learning problems by setting up and running certain markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 01:14:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Jinli", ""], ["Storkey", "Amos", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0842", "submitter": "Giacomo Bormetti", "authors": "Damian Eduardo Taranto, Giacomo Bormetti, Fabrizio Lillo", "title": "The adaptive nature of liquidity taking in limit order books", "comments": "40 pages, 14 figures, and 2 tables; old figure 12 removed.

Since orders impact prices,\nreconciling the persistence of the order flow with market efficiency is a\nsubtle issue. A possible solution is provided by asymmetric liquidity, which\nstates that the impact of a buy or sell order is inversely related to the\nprobability of its occurrence. We empirically find that when the order flow\npredictability increases in one direction, the liquidity in the opposite side\ndecreases, but the probability that a trade moves the price decreases\nsignificantly. While the last mechanism is able to counterbalance the\npersistence of order flow and restore efficiency and diffusivity, the first\nacts in opposite direction. We introduce a statistical order book model where\nthe persistence of the order flow is mitigated by adjusting the market order\nvolume to the predictability of the order flow. The model reproduces the\ndiffusive behaviour of prices at all time scales without fine-tuning the values\nof parameters, as well as the behaviour of most order book quantities as a\nfunction of the local predictability of order flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 16:26:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Apr 2014 13:19:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Taranto", "Damian Eduardo", ""], ["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0994", "submitter": "Lingjiong Zhu", "authors": "Behzad Mehrdad, Lingjiong Zhu", "title": "On the Hawkes Process with Different Exciting Functions", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.RM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Hawkes process is a simple point process, whose intensity function\ndepends on the entire past history and is self-exciting and has the clustering\nproperty.
