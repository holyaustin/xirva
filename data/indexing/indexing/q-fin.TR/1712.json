However, non-convexities in these markets cause conflicts between the\nactions that the bidders want to take and the actual market results. In this\nwork, we investigate the non-convex market clearing problem of Turkish market\noperator and propose three different rule sets. The first rule set allows both\nrejection of bids with positive surplus and acceptance of bids with negative\nsurplus. The second and the third sets only allow one of these conflicted\ncases. By using total surplus maximization as the objective, we formulate three\nmodels and statistically explore their performance with the real data taken\nfrom Turkish market operator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 09:01:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ceyhan", "G\u00f6khan", ""], ["Kurt", "Nermin Elif", ""], ["Sahin", "H.

The financial market can be regarded\nas a complex adaptive system, where purposeful agents collectively and\nsimultaneously create and perceive their environment as they interact with it.\nIt has been suggested that multiple agent classes operate in this system, with\na non-trivial hierarchy of top-down and bottom-up causation classes with\ndifferent effective models governing each level. We conjecture that agent\nclasses may in fact operate at different time scales and thus act differently\nin response to the same perceived market state. Given scale-specific temporal\nstate trajectories and action sequences estimated from aggregate market\nbehaviour, we use Inverse Reinforcement Learning to compute the effective\nreward function for the aggregate agent class at each scale, allowing us to\nassess the relative attractiveness of feature vectors across different scales.\nDifferences in reward functions for feature vectors may indicate different\nobjectives of market participants, which could assist in finding the scale\nboundary for agent classes. This has implications for learning algorithms\noperating in this domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 15:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hendricks", "Dieter", ""], ["Cobb", "Adam", ""], ["Everett", "Richard", ""], ["Downing", "Jonathan", ""], ["Roberts", "Stephen J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03106", "submitter": "Anatoliy Swishchuk Dr.", "authors": "Anatoliy Swishchuk, Bruno Remillard, Robert Elliott, Jonathan\n  Chavez-Casillas", "title": "Compound Hawkes Processes in Limit Order Books", "comments": "24 pages, 16 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1706.07459", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce two new Hawkes processes, namely, compound and\nregime-switching compound Hawkes processes, to model the price processes in\nlimit order books.

Then, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN)\nmodel is trained in the learning stage on the daily stock prices between 1997\nand 2007 for all of the Dow30 stocks.

The results indicate that by choosing the most appropriate technical\nindicators, the neural network model can achieve comparable results against the\nBuy and Hold strategy in most of the cases. Furthermore, fine tuning the\ntechnical indicators and/or optimization strategy can enhance the overall\ntrading performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 14:45:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sezer", "O.

This only makes sense if the short seller\nanticipates a downward trend in share price. The short seller incurs a gain if\nshare price decreases because the cost of replacing the borrowed share falls\nbelow the selling price. The reverse is true in an ordinary sale, where a\nperson owning a share of stock incurs a loss if price decreases because the\nselling price falls below the basis or acquisition cost. Therefore, when a\ntaxpayer simultaneously owns a share of stock and short sells an identical\nstock, any gain in an ordinary sale of the owned stock is offset by a\ncorresponding loss in the short sale of the borrowed identical stock, vice\nversa. This offsetting effect, in turn, creates an unexpected tax deferral\nopportunity abused in other jurisdictions and which remains unregulated in the\nPhilippine tax system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Dec 2017 18:49:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Geronimo", "Russell Stanley Q.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.10287", "submitter": "Reginald Smith", "authors": "Reginald D.
