Our simulation tool is implemented in C++ and we can\neasily run ABCEM models with several million agents. The object-oriented\nsoftware design enables the isolated implementation of building blocks for\nABCEM models, such as agent types and market mechanisms. The user can design\nand compare ABCEM models in a unified environment by recombining existing\nbuilding blocks using the XML-based SABCEMM configuration file. We introduce an\nabstract ABCEM model class which our simulation tool is built upon.\nFurthermore, we present the software architecture as well as computational\naspects of SABCEMM. Here, we focus on the efficiency of SABCEMM with respect to\nthe run time of our simulations. We show the great impact of different random\nnumber generators on the run time of ABCEM models. The code and documentation\nis published on GitHub at https://github.com/SABCEMM/SABCEMM, such that all\nresults can be reproduced by the reader.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jan 2018 16:08:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 23:10:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Trimborn", "Torsten", ""], ["Otte", "Philipp", ""], ["Cramer", "Simon", ""], ["Beikirch", "Max", ""], ["Pabich", "Emma", ""], ["Frank", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04910", "submitter": "Deok-Sun Lee", "authors": "Matthieu Barbier and D.-S.

Accordingly products' shares in\ninternational trade vary with time, reflecting the transfer of capital between\ndistinct industrial sectors. Here we analyze the share of hundreds of product\ncategories in world trade for four decades and find a scaling law obeyed by the\nannual variation of product share, which informs us of how capital flows and\ninteracts over the product space. A model of stochastic transfer of capital\nbetween products based on the observed scaling relation is proposed and shown\nto reproduce exactly the empirical share distribution. The model allows\nanalytic solutions as well as numerical simulations, which predict a\npseudo-condensation of capital onto few product categories and when it will\noccur. At the individual level, our model finds certain products unpredictable,\nthe excess or deficient growth of which with respect to the model prediction is\nshown to be correlated with the nature of goods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Dec 2017 17:03:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Barbier", "Matthieu", ""], ["Lee", "D. -S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.07784", "submitter": "Eyal Neuman", "authors": "Eyal Neuman and Alexander Schied", "title": "Protecting Pegged Currency Markets from Speculative Investors", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a stochastic game between a trader and a central bank in a target\nzone market with a lower currency peg. This currency peg is maintained by the\ncentral bank through the generation of permanent price impact, thereby\naggregating an ever increasing risky position in foreign reserves. We describe\nthis situation mathematically by means of two coupled singular control\nproblems, where the common singularity arises from a local time along a random\ncurve. Our first result identifies a certain local time as that central bank\nstrategy for which this risk position is minimized. We then consider the\nworst-case situation the central bank may face by identifying that strategy of\nthe strategic investor that maximizes the expected inventory of the central\nbank under a cost criterion, thus establishing a Stackelberg equilibrium in our\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jan 2018 21:48:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2018 09:28:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:40:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 04:56:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:46:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Neuman", "Eyal", ""], ["Schied", "Alexander", ""]]}]
