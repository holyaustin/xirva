We find explicit solutions in continuous and discrete\ntime considering risk averse investors having a CARA utility function.

The features of\nleptokurtosis, volatility clustering and aggregational Gaussianity are\nespecially highlighted and studied in detail. The following ingredients are\nfound to be essential for the production of these stylised facts: the memory of\nnoise traders who make random trade decisions; the inclusion of technical\ntraders that trade in line with trends in the price and the inclusion of\nfundamental traders who know the \"fundamental value\" of the stock and trade\naccordingly. When these three basic types of traders are included log returns\nare produced with a leptokurtic distribution and volatility clustering as well\nas some further statistical features of empirical data. This enhances and\nbroadens our understanding of the fundamental processes involved in the\nproduction of empirical data by the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2019 21:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Green", "Elena", ""], ["Heffernan", "Daniel M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.05332", "submitter": "Michael Benzaquen", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Bucci, Michael Benzaquen, Fabrizio Lillo, Jean-Philippe\n  Bouchaud", "title": "Slow decay of impact in equity markets: insights from the ANcerno\n  database", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an empirical study of price reversion after the executed\nmetaorders.

The models we propose thus integrate the\ninfluence of both the current book state and the past order flow. The first\nvariant considers the flow of order arrivals at a specific price level as\nindependent from the other one and describes this flow by adding a Hawkes\ncomponent to the arrival rates provided by the continuous time Markov \"Queue\nReactive\" model of Huang et al. Empirical calibration using Level-I order book\ndata from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term\ndramatically improves the pure \"Queue-Reactive\" model not only for the\ndescription of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event\ntimes) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The\nsecond variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events\noccurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day.\nThis model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate\nHawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate\nthis model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square\napproach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow\nus to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et\nal. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We\nnotably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly\nbe functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate\nof limit or cancel orders. Our findings also allows us to clearly bring to\nlight various features that distinguish small and large tick assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 15:50:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Peng", ""], ["Rambaldi", "Marcello", ""], ["Muzy", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Bacry", "Emmanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10534", "submitter": "Faisal Qureshi", "authors": "Faisal I Qureshi", "title": "Investigating Limit Order Book Characteristics for Short Term Price\n  Prediction: a Machine Learning Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the proliferation of algorithmic high-frequency trading in financial\nmarkets, the Limit Order Book has generated increased research interest.\nResearch is still at an early stage and there is much we do not understand\nabout the dynamics of Limit Order Books.
