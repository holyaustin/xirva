Because a study of information rates led to the Noiseless\nand Noisy Coding Theorems, two of the most important results of Shannon's\ntheory, we begin the paper by defining a pragmatic information rate, showing\nthat all of the relevant limits make sense, and interpreting them as the\nimprovement in compression obtained from using the correct distribution of\ntransmitted symbols.\n  The first of two applications of the theory extends the information theoretic\nanalysis of the Kelly Criterion, and its generalization, the horse race, to a\nseries of races where the stochastic process of winning horses, payoffs, and\nstrategies depend on some stationary process, including, but not limited to the\nhistory of previous races. If the bettor is receiving messages (side\ninformation) about the probability distribution of winners, the doubling rate\nof the bettor's winnings is bounded by the pragmatic information of the\nmessages.\n  A second application is to the question of market efficiency. An efficient\nmarket is, by definition, a market in which the pragmatic information of the\n\"tradable past\" with respect to current prices is zero. Under this definition,\nmarkets whose returns are characterized by a GARCH(1,1) process cannot be\nefficient.\n  Finally, a pragmatic informational analogue to Shannon's Noisy Coding Theorem\nsuggests that a cause of market inefficiency is that the underlying\nfundamentals are changing so fast that the price discovery mechanism simply\ncannot keep up. This may happen most readily in the run-up to a financial\nbubble, where investors' willful ignorance degrade the information processing\ncapabilities of the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2009 18:27:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Dec 2010 06:00:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 14:55:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 22 Sep 2014 23:48:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Weinberger", "Edward D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2428", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "authors": "J.P.

Although this notion seems to convey the idea of a\nforceful and intuitive mechanism, we discuss why things might not be that\nsimple. Empirical studies show that while the correlation between signed order\nflow and price changes is strong, the impact of trades on prices is neither\nlinear in volume nor permanent. Impact allows private information to be\nreflected in prices, but by the same token, random fluctuations in order flow\nmust also contribute to the volatility of markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2009 16:42:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchaud", "J.
