We first\ndetermine the ex-ante intraday temporal cluster configurations to identify\nmarket states, and then study the identified temporal state features to extract\nstate signature vectors which enable online state detection. The state\nsignature vectors serve as low-dimensional state descriptors which can be used\nin learning algorithms for optimal planning in the high-frequency trading\ndomain. We present a feasible scheme for real-time intraday state detection\nfrom streaming market data feeds. This study identifies an interesting\nhierarchy of system behaviour which motivates the need for time-scale-specific\nstate space reduction for participating agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 07:22:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 14:12:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 16:37:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hendricks", "Dieter", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""], ["Wilcox", "Diane", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05241", "submitter": "Jan Hendrik Witte", "authors": "Jan Hendrik Witte", "title": "Volatility Harvesting: Extracting Return from Randomness", "comments": "10 Pages, 6 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Studying Binomial and Gaussian return dynamics in discrete time, we show how\nexcess volatility can be traded to create growth.

The improved model builds on the\ntime-averaged number of particles in the inner layer and its change per unit\ntime, where the inner layer is revealed by the correlations between price\nvelocity and change in the number of particles (limit orders). This allows us\nto introduce the Knudsen number of the financial Brownian particle motion and\nits asymmetric version (on the buy and sell sides). Not being considered\npreviously, the asymmetric Knudsen numbers are crucial in finance in order to\ndetect asymmetric price changes. The Knudsen numbers allows us to characterise\nthe conditions for the market dynamics to be correctly described by a\ncontinuous stochastic process. Not questioned until now for large liquid\nmarkets such as the USD/JPY and EUR/USD exchange rates, we show that there are\nregimes when the Knudsen numbers are so high that discrete particle effects\ndominate, such as during market stresses and crashes. We document the presence\nof imbalances of particles depletion rates on the buy and sell sides that are\nassociated with high Knudsen numbers and violent directional price changes.\nThis indicator can detect the direction of the price motion at the early stage\nwhile the usual volatility risk measure is blind to the price direction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 04:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Yura", "Yoshihiro", ""], ["Takayasu", "Hideki", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""], ["Takayasu", "Misako", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07891", "submitter": "Tzu-Wei Yang", "authors": "Tzu-Wei Yang and Lingjiong Zhu", "title": "A reduced-form model for level-1 limit order books", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Market Microstructure and Liquidity, Volume 02, Issue 02,\n  September 2016", "doi": "10.1142/S2382626616500088", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One popular approach to model the limit order books dynamics of the best bid\nand ask at level-1 is to use the reduced-form diffusion approximations.

We use the proposed\nmodeling framework to analyze the effects of trading frequency on market\nliquidity in a very general setting. In particular, we demonstrate the dual\neffect of high trading frequency. On the one hand, the higher frequency\nincreases market efficiency, if the agents choose to provide liquidity in\nequilibrium. On the other hand, it also makes markets more fragile, in the\nsense that the agents choose to provide liquidity in equilibrium only if they\nare market-neutral (i.e., their beliefs satisfy certain martingale property).\nEven a very small deviation from market-neutrality may cause the agents to stop\nproviding liquidity, if the trading frequency is sufficiently high, which\nrepresents an endogenous liquidity crisis (aka flash crash) in the market. This\nframework enables us to provide more insight into how such a liquidity crisis\nunfolds, connecting it to the so-called adverse selection effect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 16:53:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 17:02:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 21:51:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 May 2017 03:34:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Gayduk", "Roman", ""], ["Nadtochiy", "Sergey", ""]]}]
