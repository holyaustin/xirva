In this\ncontext, the limit orders, market orders, and cancel orders arrivals in the LOB\nare modeled as Cox point processes with intensities that only depend on the\nstate of the LOB. These are high-dimensional models which are realistic from a\nmicro-structure point of view and have been recently developed in the\nliterature. In this context, we consider a market maker who stands ready to buy\nand sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price,\nand identifies the strategies that maximize her P\\&L penalized by her\ninventory. We apply the theory of Markov Decision Processes and dynamic\nprogramming method to characterize analytically the solutions to our optimal\nmarket making problem. The second part of the paper deals with the numerical\naspect of the high-dimensional trading problem. We use a control randomization\nmethod combined with quantization method to compute the optimal strategies.\nSeveral computational tests are performed on simulated data to illustrate the\nefficiency of the computed optimal strategy. In particular, we simulated an\norder book with constant/ symmet-ric/ asymmetrical/ state dependent\nintensities, and compared the computed optimal strategy with naive strategies.\nSome codes are available on https://github.com/comeh.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 14:33:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 06:40:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 10:42:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Abergel", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "MICS"], ["Hur\u00e9", "C\u00f4me", "", "LPSM"], ["Pham", "Huy\u00ean", "", "LPSM"]]}, {"id": "1705.03233", "submitter": "Adamantios Ntakaris Mr", "authors": "Adamantios Ntakaris, Martin Magris, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj,\n  Alexandros Iosifidis", "title": "Benchmark Dataset for Mid-Price Forecasting of Limit Order Book Data\n  with Machine Learning Methods", "comments": "Published: Journal of Forecasting", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1002/for.2543", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Managing the prediction of metrics in high-frequency financial markets is a\nchallenging task.
