This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It\nintroduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to\nseveral other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a\nnon-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The\nanalysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly\ncorrelated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such\nas bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a\nmarginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the\ninteractions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a\ncausality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures\nand shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across\ncurrencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of\nsignificative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich\nstructure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other\nboth instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is\nthat minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in\nshaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level\nof noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are\nsignificant with all links statistically validated and with a structural\norganisation consistently reproduced across all networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 09:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aste", "Tomaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.02228", "submitter": "Nicholas Murphy", "authors": "Nicholas Murphy and Tim Gebbie", "title": "Learning the dynamics of technical trading strategies", "comments": "35 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Quantitative Finance (2021)", "doi": "10.1080/14697688.2020.1869292", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.TR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use an adversarial expert based online learning algorithm to learn the\noptimal parameters required to maximise wealth trading zero-cost portfolio\nstrategies.

The resulting population time-series are\ninvestigated using unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and\nvisualisation. A key contribution is that the overall aggregated trading\nstrategies are tested for statistical arbitrage using a novel hypothesis test\nproposed by Jarrow et al.

The (low frequency) daily sampled strategies fail the arbitrage\ntests after costs, while the (high frequency) intraday sampled strategies are\nnot falsified as statistical arbitrages after costs. The estimates of trading\nstrategy success, cost of trading and slippage are considered along with an\nonline benchmark portfolio algorithm for performance comparison. In addition,\nthe algorithms generalisation error is analysed by recovering a probability of\nback-test overfitting estimate using a nonparametric procedure introduced by\nBailey et al. (2016).

Our flexible\nframework allows arbitrary order volume, price jump, and bid-ask spread\ndistributions as well as the use of market orders. It also honors the\nconsistency of price movements upon arrivals of different order types. For\nexample, it is apparent that prices should never go down on buy market orders.\nIn addition, it respects the price-time priority of LOB. In contrast to the\napproach of regular control on diffusion as in the classical Avellaneda and\nStoikov [1] market-making framework, we exploit the techniques of optimal\nswitching and impulse control on marked point processes, which have proven to\nbe very effective in modeling the order-book features.
