Based on this\nmodel, we study the influences of \"public disclosure\" and \"competition among\ninsiders\" on the trading behaviors of insiders. We find that the \"competition\namong insiders\" leads to higher effective price and lower insiders' profits,\nand the \"public disclosure\" makes each insider play a mixed strategy in every\nround except the last one. An interesting find is that as the total number of\nauctions goes to infinity, the market depth and the trading intensity at the\nfirst auction are all constants with the requirement of \"public disclosure\",\nwhile the market depth at the first auction goes to zero and the trading\nintensity of the first period goes to infinity without the requirement of\n\"public disclosure\".Moreover, we give the exact speed of the revelation of the\nprivate information, and show that all information is revealed immediately and\nthe market depth goes to infinity immediately as trading happens infinitely\nfrequently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2011 13:26:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Fuzhou", ""], ["Liu", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1526", "submitter": "Fei Ren", "authors": "Fei Ren and Wei-Xing Zhou", "title": "Analysis of trade packages in Chinese stock market", "comments": "23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables", "journal-ref": "Quantitative Finance 13 (7), 1071-1089 (2013)", "doi": "10.1080/14697688.2013.765957", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper conducts an empirically study on the trade package composed of a\nsequence of consecutive purchases or sales of 23 stocks in Chinese stock\nmarket. We investigate the probability distributions of the execution time, the\nnumber of trades and the total trading volume of trade packages, and analyze\nthe possible scaling relations between them. Quantitative differences are\nobserved between the institutional and individual investors. The trading\nprofile of trade packages is investigated to reveal the preference of large\ntrades on trading volumes and transaction time of the day, and the different\nprofiles of two types of investors imply that institutions may be more informed\nthan individuals. We further analyze the price impacts of both the entire trade\npackages and the individual transactions inside trade packages. We find the\nprice impact of trade packages is nonnegligible over the period of the\nexecution time and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading\nvolume. The price impact of the transactions inside trade packages displays a\nU-shaped profile with respect to the time $t$ of the day, and also shows a\npower-law dependence on their trading volumes. The trading volumes of the\ntransactions inside trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact\non current returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively\nshorter horizon in comparison with those by individuals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 13:35:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "Fei", ""], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.2214", "submitter": "Steffen Bohn", "authors": "Steffen Bohn (PMA)", "title": "The slippage paradox", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Buying or selling assets leads to transaction costs for the investor.

Initially, firms can invest both in low-emitting production\ntechnologies and trade permits. In the model, technology adoption and allowance\nprice are generated endogenously and are inter-dependent. It is shown that the\nnon-cooperative permit trading game possesses a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium,\nwhere the allowance value reflects the level of uncovered pollution (demand),\nthe level of unused allowances (supply), and the technological status. These\nconditions are also satisfied when a price support instrument, which is\ncontingent on the adoption of the new technology, is introduced. Numerical\ninvestigation confirms that this policy generates a floating price floor for\nthe allowances, and it restores the dynamic incentives to invest. Given that\nthis policy comes at a cost, a criterion for the selection of a self-financing\npolicy (based on convex risk measures) is proposed and implemented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2011 14:02:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Moreno-Bromberg", "Santiago", ""], ["Taschini", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3482", "submitter": "Mauricio Junca", "authors": "Mauricio Junca", "title": "Stochastic impulse control on optimal execution with price impact and\n  transaction cost", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a single risky financial asset model subject to price impact and\ntransaction cost over an finite time horizon.
