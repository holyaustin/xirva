To keep the exchange rate from breaking the prescribed\nbarriers, the central bank is generating permanent price impact and thereby\naccumulating inventory in the foreign currency. Historical examples of failed\ntarget zones illustrate that this inventory can become problematic, in\nparticular when there is an adverse macroeconomic trend in the market. We model\nthis situation through a continuous-time market impact model of\nAlmgren--Chriss-type with drift, in which the exchange rate is a diffusion\nprocess controlled by the price impact of the central bank's intervention\nstrategy. The objective of the central bank is to enforce the target zone\nthrough a strategy that minimizes the accumulated inventory. We formulate this\nobjective as a stochastic control problem with random time horizon. It is\nsolved by reduction to a singular boundary value problem that was solved by\nLasry and Lions (1989). Finally, we provide numerical simulations of optimally\ncontrolled exchange rate processes and the corresponding evolution of the\ncentral bank inventory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2020 12:30:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Neuman", "Eyal", ""], ["Schied", "Alexander", ""], ["Weng", "Chengguo", ""], ["Xue", "Xiaole", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00908", "submitter": "Eunjung Noh", "authors": "Eunjung Noh", "title": "Equilibrium under TWAP trading with quadratic transaction costs", "comments": "I find serious fundamental mistakes, so I would like to withdraw the\n  paper.
