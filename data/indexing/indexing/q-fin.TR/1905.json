The framework is general, only\nrequiring that the price process is a geometric rough path and the price impact\nfunction is a continuous function of the trading speed. Following an\napproximation of the optimisation problem, we are able to calculate an optimal\nsolution for the trading speed in the space of linear functions on a truncation\nof the signature of the price process. We provide strong numerical evidence\nillustrating the accuracy and flexibility of the approach. Our numerical\ninvestigation both examines cases where exact solutions are known,\ndemonstrating that the method accurately approximates these solutions, and\nmodels where exact solutions are not known. In the latter case, we obtain\nfavourable comparisons with standard execution strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 13:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kalsi", "Jasdeep", ""], ["Lyons", "Terry", ""], ["Arribas", "Imanol Perez", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.04137", "submitter": "Rene Carmona", "authors": "Rene Carmona and Kevin Webster", "title": "Applications of a New Self-Financing Equation", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1312.2302", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The goal of this note is to illustrate the impact of a self-financing\ncondition recently introduced by the authors.

In order to attain certain desired return\nprofiles, quantitative strategists must determine a large array of trading\nparameters. Backtesting, the attempt to identify the appropriate parameters\nusing historical data available, has been highly criticized due to the\nabundance of misleading results. Hence, there is an increasing interest in\ndevising procedures for the assessment and comparison of strategies, that is,\ndevising schemes for preventing what is known as backtesting overfitting. So\nfar, many financial researchers have proposed different ways to tackle this\nproblem that can be broadly categorised in three types: Data Snooping,\nOverestimated Performance, and Cross-Validation Evaluation. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to dealing with financial overfitting, a\nCovariance-Penalty Correction, in which a risk metric is lowered given the\nnumber of parameters and data used to underpins a trading strategy. We outlined\nthe foundation and main results behind the Covariance-Penalty correction for\ntrading strategies. After that, we pursue an empirical investigation, comparing\nits performance with some other approaches in the realm of Covariance-Penalties\nacross more than 1300 assets, using Ordinary and Total Least Squares. Our\nresults suggest that Covariance-Penalties are a suitable procedure to avoid\nBacktesting Overfitting, and Total Least Squares provides superior performance\nwhen compared to Ordinary Least Squares.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 08:39:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Koshiyama", "Adriano", ""], ["Firoozye", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.06489", "submitter": "Jos\\'e Lages", "authors": "C\\'elestin Coquid\\'e, Jos\\'e Lages, Dima L.
