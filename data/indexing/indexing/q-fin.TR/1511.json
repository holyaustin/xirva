One type of manipulation is based on the process of\nbuying or selling assets by using several trading strategies, among them\nspoofing is a popular strategy and is considered illegal by market regulators.\nSome promising tools have been developed to detect manipulation, but cases can\nstill be found in the markets. In this paper we model spoofing and pinging\ntrading, two strategies that differ in the legal background but share the same\nelemental concept of market manipulation. We use a reinforcement learning\nframework within the full and partial observability of Markov decision\nprocesses and analyse the underlying behaviour of the manipulators by finding\nthe causes of what encourages the traders to perform fraudulent activities.\nThis reveals procedures to counter the problem that may be helpful to market\nregulators as our model predicts the activity of spoofers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 23:15:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00ednez-Miranda", "Enrique", ""], ["McBurney", "Peter", ""], ["Howard", "Matthew J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.01965", "submitter": "Vikram Krishnamurthy", "authors": "Vikram Krishnamurthy and Sujay Bhatt", "title": "Sequential Detection of Market shocks using Risk-averse Agent Based\n  Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers a statistical signal processing problem involving agent\nbased models of financial markets which at a micro-level are driven by socially\naware and risk- averse trading agents.

From simple\nfinancial theory considerations, we arrive at a simple two-variable hidden\nMarkovian time series model, with one of the variable entirely unobserved.\nThen, we analyze the simplest version of the model, using path integral and\nGreen's function techniques from physics. We show that in this model, the\ninefficient market price is trend-following when the standard deviation of the\nlog reasonable price ($\\sigma$) is larger than that of the log market price\n($\\sigma'$), and mean-reversing when it is smaller. The risk premium is\nproportional to the difference between the current market price and the\nexponential moving average (EMA) of the past prices. This model thus provides a\ntheoretical explanation how the EMA of the past price can directly affect\nfuture prices, i.e., the so-called ``Bollinger bands\" in technical analyses. We\nthen carry out a maximum likelihood estimate for the model parameters from the\nobserved market price, by integrating out the reasonable price in Fourier\nspace.

The largest price buyers on the book are willing\nto offer is called the market bid price, and the smallest price sellers on the\nbook are willing to accept is called the market ask price. Market ask price is\nalways greater than market bid price, and these prices move upwards and\ndownwards due to new arrivals, market trades, and cancellations. We model these\ntwo price processes as \"bouncing geometric Brownian motions (GBMs)\", which are\ndefined as exponentials of two mutually reflected Brownian motions. We then\nmodify these bouncing GBMs to construct a discrete time stochastic process of\ntrading times and trading prices, which is parameterized by a positive\nparameter $\\delta$. Under this model, it is shown that the inter-trading times\nare inverse Gaussian distributed, and the logarithmic returns between\nconsecutive trading times follow a normal inverse Gaussian distribution. Our\nmain results show that the logarithmic trading price process is a renewal\nreward process, and under a suitable scaling, this process converges to a\nstandard Brownian motion as $\\delta\\to 0$. We also prove that the modified ask\nand bid processes approach the original bouncing GBMs as $\\delta\\to0$.
