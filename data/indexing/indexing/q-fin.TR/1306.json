We are in\nparticular interested in discerning between two different moods, or states of\nthe investors, corresponding to investors using fundamental investment\nstrategies, technical analysis investment strategies respectively. Our\nframework accounts for two opposite situations already encountered in\nexperimental setups: i) the rational expectations case, and ii) the case of\npure speculation. We consider new experimental conditions which allow both\nelements to be present in the decision making process of the traders, thereby\ncreating a dilemma in terms of investment strategy. Our theoretical framework\nallows us to predict the outcome of this type of trading experiments, depending\non such variables as the number of people trading, the liquidity of the market,\nthe amount of information used in technical analysis strategies, as well as the\ndividends attributed to an asset. We find that it is possible to give a\nqualitative prediction of trading behavior depending on a ratio that quantifies\nthe fluctuations in the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Jun 2013 23:22:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Soumare", "Maxence", ""], ["Andersen", "J\u00f8rgen Vitting", ""], ["Bouchard", "Francis", ""], ["Elkaim", "Alain", ""], ["Gu\u00e9gan", "Dominique", ""], ["Leroux", "Justin", ""], ["Miniconi", "Michel", ""], ["Stentoft", "Lars", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2832", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant, Guillaume Royer", "title": "VWAP execution and guaranteed VWAP", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Optimal liquidation using VWAP strategies has been considered in the\nliterature, though never in the presence of permanent market impact and only\nrarely with execution costs.
