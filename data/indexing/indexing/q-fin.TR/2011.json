New technologies are making it possible to address this\nchallenge through alternative solutions that complement and strengthen existing\npayment systems. For example, the interbank balancing method can also be\napplied to private payment systems, complementary currencies, and trade credit\nclearing systems to provide better liquidity and risk management. In this paper\nwe introduce the concept of a balanced payment system and demonstrate the\neffects of balancing on a small example. We show how to construct a balanced\npayment subsystem that can be settled in full and, therefore, that can be\nremoved from the payment system to achieve liquidity-saving and payments\ngridlock resolution. We also briefly introduce a generalization of a payment\nsystem and of the method to balance it in the form of a specific application\n(Tetris Core Technologies), whose wider adoption could contribute to the\nfinancial stability of and better management of liquidity and risk for the\nwhole economy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Fleischman", "Toma\u017e", ""], ["Dini", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.04367", "submitter": "Ivan Jericevich", "authors": "Ivan Jericevich, Patrick Chang, Tim Gebbie", "title": "Comparing the market microstructure between two South African exchanges", "comments": "25 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables.

A2X is an alternative\nexchange that provides for both shared listings and new listings within the\nfinancial market ecosystem of South Africa. From a science perspective it\nprovides the opportunity to compare markets trading similar shares, in a\nsimilar regulatory and economic environment, but with vastly different\nliquidity, costs and business models. A2X currently has competitive settlement\nand transaction pricing when compared to the JSE, but the JSE has deeper\nliquidity. In pursuit of an empirical understanding of how these differences\nrelate to their respective price response dynamics, we compare the\ndistributions and auto-correlations of returns on different time scales; we\ncompare price impact and master curves; and we compare the cost of trading on\neach exchange. This allows us to empirically compare the two markets. We find\nthat various stylised facts become similar as the measurement or sampling time\nscale increase. However, the same securities can have vastly different price\nresponses irrespective of time scales. This is not surprising given the\ndifferent liquidity and order-book resilience. Here we demonstrate that direct\ncosts dominate the cost of trading, and the importance of competitively\npositioning cost ceilings. Universality is crucial for being able to\nmeaningfully compare cross-exchange price responses, but in the case of A2X, it\nhas yet to emerge in a meaningful way due to the infancy of the exchange --\nmaking meaningful comparisons difficult.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2020 12:03:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Jericevich", "Ivan", ""], ["Chang", "Patrick", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.04391", "submitter": "Tadeu Ferreira", "authors": "Tadeu A.

In this paper, we introduce a DRL library FinRL that\nfacilitates beginners to expose themselves to quantitative finance and to\ndevelop their own stock trading strategies. Along with easily-reproducible\ntutorials, FinRL library allows users to streamline their own developments and\nto compare with existing schemes easily.

FinRL is\nfeatured with completeness, hands-on tutorial and reproducibility that favors\nbeginners: (i) at multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates trading\nenvironments across various stock markets, including NASDAQ-100, DJIA, S&P 500,\nHSI, SSE 50, and CSI 300; (ii) organized in a layered architecture with modular\nstructure, FinRL provides fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms (DQN,\nDDPG, PPO, SAC, A2C, TD3, etc.), commonly-used reward functions and standard\nevaluation baselines to alleviate the debugging workloads and promote the\nreproducibility, and (iii) being highly extendable, FinRL reserves a complete\nset of user-import interfaces. Furthermore, we incorporated three application\ndemonstrations, namely single stock trading, multiple stock trading, and\nportfolio allocation.
