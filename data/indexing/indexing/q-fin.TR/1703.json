Using a nonlinear Markov\nmodel, we analyze the dynamics of traders who select a favorable order price\ntaking into account the waiting cost incurred by others. We find swarm behavior\nemerges because of the delay in trader reactions to the market, and the\ndirection of the swarm is decided by the current market position and the\nintensity of zero-intelligent random behavior, rather than subjective trader\npredictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 06:56:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Toyoizumi", "Hiroshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06739", "submitter": "Kiyoshi Kanazawa", "authors": "Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Takumi Sueshige, Hideki Takayasu, Misako Takayasu", "title": "Derivation of the Boltzmann Equation for Financial Brownian Motion:\n  Direct Observation of the Collective Motion of High-Frequency Traders", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures + Appendices", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Furthermore, a theoretical framework parallel to\nmolecular kinetic theory is developed for the systematic description of the\nfinancial market from microscopic dynamics of HFTs. We report first on a\nmicroscopic empirical law of traders' trend-following behavior by tracking the\ntrajectories of all individuals, which quantifies the collective motion of HFTs\nbut has not been captured in conventional order-book models. We next introduce\nthe corresponding microscopic model of HFTs and present its theoretical\nsolution paralleling molecular kinetic theory: Boltzmann-like and Langevin-like\nequations are derived from the microscopic dynamics via the\nBogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. Our model is the first\nmicroscopic model that has been directly validated through data analysis of the\nmicroscopic dynamics, exhibiting quantitative agreements with mesoscopic and\nmacroscopic empirical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 06:45:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2018 14:31:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:53:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kanazawa", "Kiyoshi", ""], ["Sueshige", "Takumi", ""], ["Takayasu", "Hideki", ""], ["Takayasu", "Misako", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.08812", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "Microstructure under the Microscope: Tools to Survive and Thrive in The\n  Age of (Too Much) Information", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1603.09060", "journal-ref": "Journal of Trading, (Spring 2017), Institutional Investor\n  Journals, New York, USA, Vol. 12, No. 2, pp. 5-27", "doi": "10.3905/jot.2017.12.2.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Market Microstructure is the investigation of the process and protocols that\ngovern the exchange of assets with the objective of reducing frictions that can\nimpede the transfer. In financial markets, where there is an abundance of\nrecorded information, this translates to the study of the dynamic relationships\nbetween observed variables, such as price, volume and spread, and hidden\nconstituents, such as transaction costs and volatility, that hold sway over the\nefficient functioning of the system.\n  \"My dear, here we must process as much data as we can, just to stay in\nbusiness.

To aid in this effort to\nextract meaning from chaos and to gain a better understanding of the\nrelationships between financial variables, we summarize the application of the\ntheoretical results from (Kashyap 2016b) to microstructure studies. The central\nconcept rests on a novel methodology based on the marriage between the\nBhattacharyya distance, a measure of similarity across distributions, and the\nJohnson Lindenstrauss Lemma, a technique for dimension reduction, providing us\nwith a simple yet powerful tool that allows comparisons between data-sets\nrepresenting any two distributions. We provide an empirical illustration using\nprices, volumes and volatilities across seven countries and three different\ncontinents. The degree to which different markets or sub groups of securities\nhave different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us the\nextent to which they are different. This can aid investors looking for\ndiversification or looking for more of the same thing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 12:54:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.09386", "submitter": "Tetsuya Takaishi", "authors": "Tetsuya Takaishi and Toshiaki Watanabe", "title": "Analysis of Realized Volatility for Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo\n  Stock Exchange", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series 710 (2016) 012010", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/710/1/012010", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We calculate realized volatility of the Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei225)\nIndex on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and investigate the return dynamics.
