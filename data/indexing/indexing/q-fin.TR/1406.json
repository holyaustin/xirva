One is that the trend of monotonic increase and decrease can be\ngenerated by dealers' minuscule change in mood, which corresponds to the\npossible fundamentals. The other is that the emergence of trends is all but\ninevitable in the realistic situation because of the fact that dealers cannot\nalways obtain accurate information about deals, even if there is no influence\nfrom fundamentals and technical analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Jun 2014 04:29:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 06:58:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Murakami", "Ryo", ""], ["Nakamura", "Tomomichi", ""], ["Kimura", "Shin", ""], ["Manabe", "Masashi", ""], ["Tanizawa", "Toshihiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.5817", "submitter": "Vinko Zlati\\'c", "authors": "Vinko Zlati\\'c, Giampaolo Gabbi, Hrvoje Abraham", "title": "Reduction of systemic risk by means of Pigouvian taxation", "comments": "19 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0114928", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the possibility of reduction of systemic risk in financial markets\nthrough Pigouvian taxation of financial institutions which is used to support\nthe rescue fund. We introduce the concept of the cascade risk with a clear\noperational definition as a subclass and a network related measure of the\nsystemic risk. Using financial networks constructed from real Italian money\nmarket data and using realistic parameters, we show that the cascade risk can\nbe substantially reduced by a small rate of taxation and by means of a simple\nstrategy of the money transfer from the rescue fund to interbanking market\nsubjects. Furthermore, we show that while negative effects on the return on\ninvestment ($ROI$) are direct and certain, an overall positive effect on risk\nadjusted return on investments ($ROI^{RA}$) is visible. Please note that\n\\emph{the taxation} is introduced as a monetary/regulatory, not as a fiscal\nmeasure, as the term could suggest. \\emph{The rescue fund} is implemented in a\nform of a common reserve fund.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 06:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zlati\u0107", "Vinko", ""], ["Gabbi", "Giampaolo", ""], ["Abraham", "Hrvoje", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.6496", "submitter": "Michele Marchesi", "authors": "Luisanna Cocco, Giulio Concas and Michele Marchesi", "title": "Using an Artificial Financial Market for studying a Cryptocurrency\n  Market", "comments": "13 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an agent-based artificial cryptocurrency market in which\nheterogeneous agents buy or sell cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins.

The number of Bitcoins\nincreases over time with a rate proportional to the real one, even if the\nmining process is not explicitly modelled.\n  The model proposed is able to reproduce some of the real statistical\nproperties of the price absolute returns observed in the Bitcoin real market.\nIn particular, it is able to reproduce the autocorrelation of the absolute\nreturns, and their cumulative distribution function.
