Because regulations reduce profits to those possessing unfair\nadvantage, these advantaged corporations (whether individuals, companies, or\nother collective organizations) are motivated to influence regulators.\nRegulatory bodies created to protect the market are instead co-opted to advance\nthe interests of the corporations they are charged to regulate. This\nwide-spread influence, known as \"regulatory capture,\" has been recognized for\nover 100 years, and according to expectations of rational behavior, will exist\nwherever it is in the mutual self-interest of corporations and regulators. Here\nwe model the interaction between corporations and regulators using a new game\ntheory framework explicitly accounting for players' mutual influence, and\ndemonstrate the incentive for collusion. Communication between corporations and\nregulators enables them to collude and split the resulting profits. We identify\nwhen collusion is profitable for both parties. The intuitive results show that\ncapture occurs when the benefits to the corporation outweigh the costs to the\nregulator. Under these conditions, the corporation can compensate the regulator\nfor costs incurred and, further, provide a profit to both parties. In the real\nworld, benefits often far outweigh costs, providing large incentives to collude\nand making capture likely. Regulatory capture is inhibited by decreasing the\ninfluence between parties through strict separation, independent market\nknowledge and research by regulators, regulatory and market transparency,\nregulatory accountability for market failures, widely distributed regulatory\ncontrol, and anti-corruption enforcement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 21:13:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Albino", "Dominic K.", ""], ["Hu", "Anzi", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.0762", "submitter": "Jan Lipski", "authors": "Jan A.
