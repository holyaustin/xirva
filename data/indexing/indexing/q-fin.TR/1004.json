In the second part of the paper, analysis of sequences\nof arbitrages is reformulated in the linear algebra terms. This admits an\nelegant geometric interpretation of the problems under consideration linked to\nthe asynchronous systems theory. We feel that this interpretation will be\nuseful in understanding more complicated, and more realistic, mathematical\nmodels in economics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2010 04:55:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kozyakin", "Victor", ""], ["O'Callaghan", "Brian", ""], ["Pokrovskii", "Alexei", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1804", "submitter": "Fredrick Michael", "authors": "Fredrick Michael", "title": "Interacting Many-Investor Models, Opinion Formation and Price Formation\n  with Non-extensive Statistics", "comments": "10 pages, no figures.
