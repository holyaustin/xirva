Although a deep\nunderstanding of cross-currency correlations would be clearly beneficial for\nconceiving more stable and safer foreign exchange markets, the microscopic\norigins of these interdependencies have not been extensively investigated. We\nintroduce an agent-based model which describes the emergence of cross-currency\ncorrelations from the interactions between market makers and an arbitrager. Our\nmodel qualitatively replicates the time-scale vs. cross-correlation diagrams\nobserved in real trading data, suggesting that triangular arbitrage plays a\nprimary role in the entanglement of the dynamics of different foreign exchange\nrates.
