That is,\nwe can point our black-box DLNN system at trader T and successfully have it\nlearn from T's trading activity, such that it trades at least as well as T. Our\nsystem, called DeepTrader, takes inputs derived from Level-2 market data, i.e.\nthe market's Limit Order Book (LOB) or Ladder for a tradeable asset. Unusually,\nDeepTrader makes no explicit prediction of future prices. Instead, we train it\npurely on input-output pairs where in each pair the input is a snapshot S of\nLevel-2 LOB data taken at the time when T issued a quote Q (i.e. a bid or an\nask order) to the market; and DeepTrader's desired output is to produce Q when\nit is shown S. That is, we train our DLNN by showing it the LOB data S that T\nsaw at the time when T issued quote Q, and in doing so our system comes to\nbehave like T, acting as an algorithmic trader issuing specific quotes in\nresponse to specific LOB conditions. We train DeepTrader on large numbers of\nthese S/Q snapshot/quote pairs, and then test it in a variety of market\nscenarios, evaluating it against other algorithmic trading systems in the\npublic-domain literature, including two that have repeatedly been shown to\noutperform human traders. Our results demonstrate that DeepTrader learns to\nmatch or outperform such existing algorithmic trading systems. We analyse the\nsuccessful DeepTrader network to identify what features it is relying on, and\nwhich features can be ignored. We propose that our methods can in principle\ncreate an explainable copy of an arbitrary trader T via \"black-box\" deep\nlearning methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2020 11:57:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wray", "Aaron", ""], ["Meades", "Matthew", ""], ["Cliff", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.01160", "submitter": "Devansh Jain", "authors": "Devansh Jain, Manthan Patel, Aman Narsaria and Siddharth Malik", "title": "A Study on the Efficiency of the Indian Stock Market", "comments": "9 pages, 4 tables, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.TR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The efficiency of the stock market has a significant impact on the potential\nreturn on investment.

In the latter case, the population of traders is\nfragmented across the markets.

First, in financial markets,\nthere is no single model that can consistently make accurate prediction because\ntraders in markets quickly adapt to newly available information.
