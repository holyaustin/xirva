We find that the tether-margined perpetual contract on Binance is\nclearly the main source of volatility, continuously transmitting strong flows\nto all other instruments and receiving only a little volatility. Moreover, we\nfind that (i) during US trading hours, traders pay more attention and are more\nreactive to prevailing market conditions when updating their expectations and\n(ii) the crypto market exhibits a higher interconnectedness when traditional\nWestern stock markets are open. Our results highlight that regulators should\nnot only consider spot exchanges offering bitcoin-fiat trading but also the\ntether-margined derivatives products available on most unregulated exchanges,\nmost importantly Binance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 08:32:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alexander", "Carol", ""], ["Heck", "Daniel", ""], ["Kaeck", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.00534", "submitter": "John Cartlidge", "authors": "Zijian Shi and John Cartlidge", "title": "The Limit Order Book Recreation Model (LOBRM): An Extended Analysis", "comments": "16 pages, preprint accepted for publication in the European\n  Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge\n  Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2021)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The limit order book (LOB) depicts the fine-grained demand and supply\nrelationship for financial assets and is widely used in market microstructure\nstudies. Nevertheless, the availability and high cost of LOB data restrict its\nwider application. The LOB recreation model (LOBRM) was recently proposed to\nbridge this gap by synthesizing the LOB from trades and quotes (TAQ) data.\nHowever, in the original LOBRM study, there were two limitations: (1)\nexperiments were conducted on a relatively small dataset containing only one\nday of LOB data; and (2) the training and testing were performed in a\nnon-chronological fashion, which essentially re-frames the task as\ninterpolation and potentially introduces lookahead bias. In this study, we\nextend the research on LOBRM and further validate its use in real-world\napplication scenarios. We first advance the workflow of LOBRM by (1) adding a\ntime-weighted z-score standardization for the LOB and (2) substituting the\nordinary differential equation kernel with an exponential decay kernel to lower\ncomputation complexity. Experiments are conducted on the extended LOBSTER\ndataset in a chronological fashion, as it would be used in a real-world\napplication. We find that (1) LOBRM with decay kernel is superior to\ntraditional non-linear models, and module ensembling is effective; (2)\nprediction accuracy is negatively related to the volatility of order volumes\nresting in the LOB; (3) the proposed sparse encoding method for TAQ exhibits\ngood generalization ability and can facilitate manifold tasks; and (4) the\ninfluence of stochastic drift on prediction accuracy can be alleviated by\nincreasing historical samples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 15:25:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Zijian", ""], ["Cartlidge", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.01273", "submitter": "Naftali Cohen", "authors": "Naftali Cohen, Srijan Sood, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso", "title": "Visual Time Series Forecasting: An Image-driven Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.LG q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we address time-series forecasting as a computer vision task.\nWe capture input data as an image and train a model to produce the subsequent\nimage.
