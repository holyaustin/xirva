We quantify the value of optimally timing to sell\nthrough the concept of delayed liquidation premium, and analyze the associated\nprobabilistic representation and variational inequality. We illustrate the\noptimal liquidation policy for both single-named and multi-named credit\nderivatives.

In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the hidden\ncollusive cliques involved in an instrument of future markets by first\ncalculating the correlation coefficient between any two eligible unified\naggregated time series of signed order volume, and then combining the connected\ncomponents from multiple sparsified weighted graphs constructed by using the\ncorrelation matrices where each correlation coefficient is over a\nuser-specified threshold. Experiments conducted on real order data from the\nShanghai Futures Exchange show that the proposed method can effectively detect\nsuspect collusive cliques.
