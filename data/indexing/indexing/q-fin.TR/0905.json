Each agent\nknows its own budget and preferences but not those of any other agent. The\nnear-equilibrium price established mid-way through the trading session diverges\nto both much higher and much lower prices towards the end of the trading\nsession. This price divergence emerges in the model without any possibility\nthat the agents could have conspired to \"game\" the market. The results were\nweakly sensitive to the endowments but strongly sensitive to the nature of the\nagent's preferences and budget constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2009 16:04:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["LaViolette", "Randall A.", ""], ["Ellebracht", "Lory A.", ""], ["Stamber", "Kevin L.", ""], ["Gieseler", "Charles J.", ""], ["Cook", "Benjamin K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4793", "submitter": "Christian Humberto Sanabria Monta\\~na", "authors": "Christian H.

The\npower-law behavior of part of the distribution of individual wealth has been\nrecognized by Pareto as early as the nineteenth century. Heavy-tailed and\nscale-free behavior of the distribution of returns of different financial\nassets have been confirmed in a series of works. The existence of a Pareto-like\ndistribution of the wealth of market participants has been connected with the\nscale-free distribution of trading volumes and price-returns. The origin of the\nPareto-like wealth distribution, however, remained obscure. Here we show that\nit is the process of trading itself that under two mild assumptions\nspontaneously leads to a self-organization of the market with a Pareto-like\nwealth distribution for the market participants and at the same time to a\nscale-free behavior of return fluctuations. These assumptions are (i) everybody\ntrades proportional to his current capacity and (ii) supply and demand\ndetermine the relative value of the goods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 09:43:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ebert", "M.", ""], ["Paul", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4912", "submitter": "Daniel Fenn", "authors": "Daniel J.

To provide insights\ninto the clustering of the exchange rate time series, we investigate dynamic\ncommunities in the network. We show that there is a relationship between an\nexchange rate's functional role within the market and its position within its\ncommunity and use a node-centric community analysis to track the time dynamics\nof this role. This reveals which exchange rates dominate the market at\nparticular times and also identifies exchange rates that experienced\nsignificant changes in market role. We also use the community dynamics to\nuncover major structural changes that occurred in the FX market.
