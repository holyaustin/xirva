The obtained\nresults demonstrate that the CDA remains able to clear strongly different order\nflows, though the Milan stock exchange seemed to be a little more efficient\nthan the NYSE under the allocative point of view, witnessing the intrinsic\ncomplexity of the stock market. The simulation has been built as an Agent Based\nModel in order to obtain a plausible order flow. The decisions of single agents\nand their interaction through the market book are realistic and reproduce some\nempirical analysis results. The mentioned results have been obtained either by\nthe analysis of the complete pending time series and the same computation of\nthe asks and bids series alone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2008 11:29:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cappellini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Ferraris", "Gianluigi", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4165", "submitter": "Didier Sornette", "authors": "J.B.

Different components\nand/or aspects of real-world financial markets are modelled by these games. In\nthe MG, agents compete for scarce resources; in the MAJG gents imitate the\ngroup in the hope of exploiting a trend; in the $G agents attempt to\nsuccessfully predict and benefit from trends as well as changes in the\ndirection of a market. It has been previously shown that in the MG for a\nreasonable number of preliminary time steps preceding equilibrium (Time Horizon\nMG, THMG), agents' attempt to optimize their gains by active strategy selection\nis ``illusory'': The calculated hypothetical gains of their individual\nstrategies is greater on average than agents' actual average gains.\nFurthermore, if a small proportion of agents deliberately choose and act in\naccord with their seemingly worst performing strategy, these outper-form all\nother agents on average, and even attain mean positive gain, otherwise rare for\nagents in the MG. This latter phenomenon raises the question as to how well the\noptimization procedure works in the MAJG and $G. We demonstrate that the\nillusion of control is absent in MAJG and $G. In other words, low-entropy (more\ninformative) strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies in\nthe MG but outperform them in the MAJG and $G. This provides further\nclarification of the kinds of situations subject to genuine control, and those\nnot, in set-ups a priori defined to emphasize the importance of optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 17:45:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Satinover", "J.
