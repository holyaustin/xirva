Our main\ncontributions are threefold. First, we characterize the distributional behavior\nof high-frequency asset returns both in ordinary clock time and in trade time.\nWe show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time\nreturns of the highly liquid near-month E-mini S&P 500 futures contract are\nwell characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second,\nwe develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns by\nsubordinating a trade-time Gaussian distribution with a trade arrival process\nthat is associated with a modified Markov-Switching Multifractal Duration\n(MSMD) model. This model provides an excellent characterization of\nhigh-frequency inter-trade durations. Over-dispersion in this distribution of\ninter-trade durations leads to leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in\nclock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we use\nour model to extrapolate the empirical relationship between trade rate and\nvolatility in an effort to understand conditions of market failure. Our model\nsuggests that the 1,200 km physical separation of financial markets in Chicago\nand New York/New Jersey provides a natural ceiling on systemic volatility and\nmay contribute to market stability during periods of extremely heavy trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:49:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2014 16:36:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2014 16:05:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Aldrich", "Eric M.", ""], ["Heckenbach", "Indra", ""], ["Laughlin", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6118", "submitter": "Takashi Kato", "authors": "Takashi Kato", "title": "VWAP Execution as an Optimal Strategy", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures, long version of the paper \"VWAP execution as an\n  optimal strategy\" in JSIAM Letters, Vol. 7 (2015), pp.33-36", "journal-ref": "JSIAM Letters, Vol. 7 (2015), pp.33-36", "doi": "10.14495/jsiaml.7.33", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The volume weighted average price (VWAP) execution strategy is well known and\nwidely used in practice.
