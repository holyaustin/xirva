We focus on markets, which settle their prices after the\nEXAA, which enables traders to include the EXAA price into their calculations.\nFor each market we employ econometric models to incorporate the EXAA price and\ncompare them with their counterparts without the price of the Austrian\nexchange. By employing a forecasting study, we find that electricity price\nmodels can be improved when EXAA prices are considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2015 11:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 12:27:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ziel", "Florian", ""], ["Steinert", "Rick", ""], ["Husmann", "Sven", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00843", "submitter": "Ulrich Horst", "authors": "Ulrich Horst and Michael Paulsen", "title": "A law of large numbers for limit order books", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We define a stochastic model of a two-sided limit order book in terms of its\nkey quantities \\textit{best bid [ask] price} and the \\textit{standing buy\n[sell] volume density}.
