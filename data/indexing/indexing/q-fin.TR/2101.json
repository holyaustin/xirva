We first analyze the regularized\nsetting, in which the admissible strategies do not ensure complete execution of\nthe initial inventory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a continuous\nand bounded viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, whence\nwe obtain a characterization of the optimal trading rate. As a byproduct of our\nproof, we obtain a numerical algorithm. Then, we analyze the constrained\nproblem, in which admissible strategies must guarantee complete execution to\nthe trader.

Examples of such functions are the\nconstant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from\nseveral challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of\ntokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially\ndrain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price\nchanges can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets\nand reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to\nconstructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input\nfrom a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the\nassets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be\nidentical to the market price. This approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities\nand, as we show through simulations, maintains liquidity in the LP for all\nassets and the total value of the LP over a wide range of market prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 21:58:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnamachari", "Bhaskar", ""], ["Feng", "Qi", ""], ["Grippo", "Eugenio", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03086", "submitter": "Jose Figueroa-Lopez", "authors": "Agostino Capponi, Jos\\'e E.
