For\ndifferent thresholds q, the probability density function P_q(\\tau) scales with\nmean interval <\\tau> as P_q(\\tau)=<\\tau>^{-1}f(\\tau/<\\tau>) and the tails of\nthe scaling function can be well approximated by a power-law f(x)~x^{-\\gamma}.\nWe also study the relation between the form of the distribution function\nP_q(\\tau) and several financial factors: stock lifetime, market capitalization,\nvolume, and trading value. We find a systematic tendency of P_q(\\tau)\nassociated with these factors, suggesting a multi-scaling feature in the volume\nreturn intervals. We analyze the conditional probability P_q(\\tau|\\tau_0) for\n$\\tau$ following a certain interval \\tau_0, and find that P_q(\\tau|\\tau_0)\ndepends on \\tau_0 such that immediately following a short/long return interval\na second short/long return interval tends to occur. We also find indications\nthat there is a long-term correlation in the daily volume volatility.

Instead of focusing only on the scheduling aspect like\nAlmgren and Chriss, or only on the liquidity-consuming orders like Obizhaeva\nand Wang, we link the optimal trade-schedule to the price of the limit orders\nthat have to be sent to the limit order book to optimally liquidate a\nportfolio. Most practitioners address these two issues separately: they compute\nan optimal trading curve and they then send orders to the markets to try to\nfollow it. The results obtained here solve simultaneously the two problems. As\nin a previous paper that solved the \"intra-day market making problem\", the\ninteractions of limit orders with the market are modeled via a Poisson process\npegged to a diffusive \"fair price\" and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is\nused to solve the problem involving both non-execution risk and price risk.\nBacktests are carried out to exemplify the use of our results, both on long\nperiods of time (for the entire liquidation process) and on slices of 5 minutes\n(to follow a given trading curve).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 17:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Sep 2011 11:38:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 5 Feb 2012 00:07:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 16:30:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2012 23:15:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 14:58:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gu\u00e9ant", "Olivier", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Tapia", "Joaquin Fernandez", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4509", "submitter": "Amos Storkey", "authors": "Amos Storkey", "title": "Machine Learning Markets", "comments": "Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial\n  Intelligence and Statistics 2011", "journal-ref": "Journal of Machine Learning Research W&CP 15(AISTATS):716-724,\n  2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.NE q-fin.TR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Prediction markets show considerable promise for developing flexible\nmechanisms for machine learning.

We consider a small agent who continuously\nsubmits limit buy/sell orders and submits market orders at discrete dates. The\nobjective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue\nover a short term horizon by a tradeoff between limit and market orders, while\ncontrolling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime\nswitching regular/ impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of\nquasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. In the case of a\nmean-variance criterion with martingale reference price or when the asset price\nfollows a Levy process and with exponential utility criterion, the dynamic\nprogramming system can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving\nonly the inventory and spread variables. Calibration procedures are derived for\nestimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and\nfor Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. Several\ncomputational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and\nillustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit\norders and market orders\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2011 19:16:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Guilbaud", "Fabien", "", "LPMA"], ["Pham", "Huyen", "", "LPMA, CREST"]]}, {"id": "1106.5274", "submitter": "Alessandro Fiori Maccioni", "authors": "Alessandro Fiori Maccioni", "title": "Endogenous Bubbles in Derivatives Markets: The Risk Neutral Valuation\n  Paradox", "comments": "21 pages.
