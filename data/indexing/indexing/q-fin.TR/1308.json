The\ndynamic relaxation both before and after the large fluctuations is\ncharacterized by a power law, and the exponents $p_\\pm$ usually vary with the\nstrength of the large fluctuations. The large-fluctuation dynamics is\ntime-reversal symmetric at the time scale in minutes, while asymmetric at the\ndaily time scale. Careful analysis reveals that the time-reversal asymmetry is\nmainly induced by external forces. It is also the external forces which drive\nthe financial system to a non-stationary state. Different characteristics of\nthe Chinese and German stock markets are uncovered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 07:54:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "X.

The strategy contains only two parameters $p$ and\n$q$, and the sell (buy) decision is made when the log return is larger\n(smaller) than $p$ ($-q$). We discretize the unit square $(p, q) \\in [0, 1]\n\\times [0, 1]$ into the $N \\times N$ square grid and the profit $\\Pi (p, q)$ is\ncalculated at the center of each cell. We confirm the previous finding that\nlocal maxima in profit landscapes are scattered in a fractal-like fashion: The\nnumber M of local maxima follows the power-law form $M \\sim N^{a}$, but the\nscaling exponent $a$ is found to differ for different time series. From\ncomparisons of real and artificial stock prices, we find that the fat-tailed\nreturn distribution is closely related to the exponent $a \\approx 1.6$ observed\nfor real stock markets. We suggest that the fractality of profit landscape\ncharacterized by $a \\approx 1.6$ can be a useful measure to validate time\nseries model for stock prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 04:09:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Yi", "Il Gu", ""], ["Oh", "Gabjin", ""], ["Kim", "Beom Jun", ""]]}]
