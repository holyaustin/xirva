It will be the first approach which is\nable to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and\nmodern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price\nas it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and\nutilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity\nexchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every\nderegulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the\nelectricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an\napproach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data\nprocessing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation\nmethods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal\nbehavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also\ncompletely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is\nable to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is\nespecially useful for predicting huge price spikes. Using simulation methods we\nshow how to derive prediction intervals for probabilistic forecasting. We\ndescribe and show the proposed methods for the day-ahead EPEX spot price of\nGermany and Austria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 16:04:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 09:14:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ziel", "Florian", ""], ["Steinert", "Rick", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.06457", "submitter": "Suneel Sarswat", "authors": "Suneel Sarswat, Kandathil Mathew Abraham, Subir Kumar Ghosh", "title": "Identifying collusion groups using spectral clustering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.CE stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an illiquid stock, traders can collude and place orders on a predetermined\nprice and quantity at a fixed schedule.

The contribution of\nthis paper is two-fold. First, we provide a new economic interpretation of the\nmarket-clearing strategy of a pari-mutuel market that is well known in the\nliterature. The pari-mutuel auctioneer is shown to be equivalent to the market\nmaker with extreme ambiguity aversion for the future contingent event. Second,\nbased on this theoretical understanding, we present a new market-clearing\nalgorithm called the Knightian Pari-mutuel Mechanism (KPM). The KPM retains\nmany interesting properties of pari-mutuel markets while explicitly controlling\nfor the market maker's ambiguity aversion. In addition, the KPM is\ncomputationally efficient in that it is solvable in polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 20:48:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Sep 2015 03:20:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 24 Oct 2015 08:11:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 04:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Roh", "Hee Su", ""], ["Ye", "Yinyu", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07710", "submitter": "Jonathan Donier", "authors": "Pierre Blanc, Jonathan Donier, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "title": "Quadratic Hawkes processes for financial prices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce and establish the main properties of QHawkes (\"Quadratic\"\nHawkes) models. QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in\nE. Bacry et al. (2014), by allowing all feedback effects in the jump intensity\nthat are linear and quadratic in past returns. A non-parametric fit on NYSE\nstock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed\nhas a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. Our model\nexhibits two main properties, that we believe are crucial in the modelling and\nthe understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal\nasymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred\ndirection. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility\nprocess, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying\nkernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit.\nSeveral other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in\nparticular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily be\nat the critical point. Finally, we provide numerical simulations of our\ncalibrated QHawkes model, which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small\namount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time\nreversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 13:26:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Blanc", "Pierre", ""], ["Donier", "Jonathan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.08248", "submitter": "Andreas Platen", "authors": "Robert L\\\"ow, Stanislaus Maier-Paape, Andreas Platen", "title": "Correctness of Backtest Engines", "comments": "15 pages, 6 figures; Keywords: backtest evaluation, historical\n  simulation, trading system, candle chart, imperfect data, price model,\n  correctness test, backtest correctness", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years several trading platforms appeared which provide a backtest\nengine to calculate historic performance of self designed trading strategies on\nunderlying candle data.
