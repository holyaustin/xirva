Built on a strong theoretical foundation, our model provides\ninsights to market participants by splitting the overall move of the security\nprice during the duration of an order into the Market Impact (price move caused\nby their actions) and Market Timing (price move caused by everyone else)\ncomponents. We derive formulations of this model under different laws of motion\nof the security prices, starting with a simple benchmark scenario and extending\nthis to include multiple sources of uncertainty, liquidity constraints due to\nvolume curve shifts and relating trading costs to the spread. We develop a\nnumerical framework that can be used to obtain optimal executions under any law\nof motion of prices and demonstrate the tremendous practical applicability of\nour theoretical methodology including the powerful numerical techniques to\nimplement them. Our decomposition of trading costs into Market Impact and\nMarket Timing allows us to deduce the zero sum game nature of trading costs. It\nholds numerous lessons for dealing with complex systems, wherein reducing the\ncomplexity by splitting the many sources of uncertainty can lead to better\ninsights in the decision process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 06:07:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 06:53:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 09:40:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 10:08:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 03:38:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2018 01:10:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2021 03:49:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Sat, 17 Apr 2021 13:56:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.01341", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "Hong Kong -- Shanghai Connect / Hong Kong -- Beijing Disconnect (?):\n  Scaling the Great Wall of Chinese Securities Trading Costs", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1603.00984,\n  arXiv:1602.00839", "journal-ref": "Journal of Trading, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 2016), pp. 81-134", "doi": "10.3905/jot.2016.11.3.081", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We utilize a fundamentally different model of trading costs to look at the\neffect of the opening of the Hong Kong Shanghai Connect that links the stock\nexchanges in the two cities, arguably the biggest event in international\nbusiness and finance since Christopher Columbus set sail for India. We design a\nnovel methodology that compensates for the lack of data on trading costs in\nChina. We estimate trading costs across similar positions on the dual listed\nset of securities in Hong Kong and China, hoping to provide useful pieces of\ninformation to help scale 'The Great Wall of Chinese Securities Trading Costs'.\nWe then compare actual and estimated trading costs on a sample of real orders\nacross the Hong Kong securities in the dual listed pair to establish the\naccuracy of our measurements. The primary question we seek to address is 'Which\nmarket would be better to trade to gain exposure to the same (or similar) set\nof securities or sectors?' We find that trading costs on Shanghai, which might\nhave been lower than Hong Kong, might have become higher leading up to the\nConnect. What remains to be seen is whether this increase in trading costs is a\ntemporary equilibrium due to the frenzy to gain exposure to Chinese securities\nor whether this phenomenon will persist once the two markets start becoming\nmore and more tightly coupled. It would be interesting to see if this\npioneering policy will lead to securities exchanges across the globe linking up\none another, creating a trade anything, anywhere and anytime marketplace.\nLooking beyond mere trading costs, such studies can be used to gather some\nevidence on what effect the mode of governance and other aspects of life in one\ncountry have on another country, once they start joining up their financial\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 04:02:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2016 03:23:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2016 14:13:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 09:54:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 07:30:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2019 09:35:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2019 13:59:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2019 05:07:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.01580", "submitter": "Shanshan Wang", "authors": "Shanshan Wang, Rudi Sch\\\"afer and Thomas Guhr", "title": "Cross-response in correlated financial markets: individual stocks", "comments": "stock pairs, unaveraged, see arXiv:1510.03205", "journal-ref": "Eur.
