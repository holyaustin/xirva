We find a\nsignificant reversal of price for both intraday price decreases and increases\nwith a permanent price impact. The volatility, the volume of different types of\norders, the bid-ask spread, and the volume imbalance increase before the\nextreme events and decay slowly as a power law, which forms a well-established\npeak. The volume of buy market orders increases faster and the corresponding\npeak appears earlier than for sell market orders around positive events, while\nthe volume peak of sell market orders leads buy market orders in the magnitude\nand time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups\naccording to their aggressiveness, we find that the behaviors of order volume\nand order number are similar, except for buy limit orders and canceled orders\nthat the peak of order number postpones two minutes later after the peak of\norder volume, implying that investors placing large orders are more informed\nand play a central role in large price fluctuations. We also study the relative\nrates of different types of orders and find differences in the dynamics of\nrelative rates between buy orders and sell orders and between individual\ninvestors and institutional investors. There is evidence showing that\ninstitutions behave very differently from individuals and that they have more\naggressive strategies. Combing these findings, we conclude that institutional\ninvestors are more informed and play a more influential role in driving large\nprice fluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2010 07:51:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mu", "Guo-Hua", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Kertesz", "Janos", "", "BME"]]}, {"id": "1003.0764", "submitter": "Dorje C.

We address these large\ntrades as hidden orders. In order to identify and characterize hidden orders we\nfit hidden Markov models to the time series of the sign of the tick by tick\ninventory variation of market members of the Spanish Stock Exchange. Our\nmethodology probabilistically detects trading sequences, which are\ncharacterized by a net majority of buy or sell transactions. We interpret these\npatches of sequential buying or selling transactions as proxies of the traded\nhidden orders. We find that the time, volume and number of transactions size\ndistributions of these patches are fat tailed. Long patches are characterized\nby a high fraction of market orders and a low participation rate, while short\npatches have a large fraction of limit orders and a high participation rate. We\nobserve the existence of a buy-sell asymmetry in the number, average length,\naverage fraction of market orders and average participation rate of the\ndetected patches. The detected asymmetry is clearly depending on the local\nmarket trend. We also compare the hidden Markov models patches with those\nobtained with the segmentation method used in Vaglica {\\it et al.} (2008) and\nwe conclude that the former ones can be interpreted as a partition of the\nlatter ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2010 18:31:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Vaglica", "Gabriella", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Mantegna", "Rosario N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.3796", "submitter": "Ioane Muni Toke", "authors": "Ioane Muni Toke", "title": "\"Market making\" behaviour in an order book model and its impact on the\n  bid-ask spread", "comments": "17 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-88-470-1766-5_4", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been suggested that marked point processes might be good candidates\nfor the modelling of financial high-frequency data.
