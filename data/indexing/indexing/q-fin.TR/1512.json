We consider this question both in the context of a simple\nbinary classifier, which seeks to predict the direction of the next mid-price\nmovement, and a probabilistic classifier, which seeks to predict the\nprobability that the next mid-price movement will be upwards. To implement\nthese classifiers, we fit logistic regressions between the queue imbalance and\nthe direction of the subsequent mid-price movement for each of 10 liquid stocks\non Nasdaq. In each case, we find a strongly statistically significant\nrelationship between these variables. Compared to a simple null model, which\nassumes that the direction of mid-price changes is uncorrelated with the queue\nimbalance, we find that our logistic regression fits provide a considerable\nimprovement in binary and probabilistic classification for large-tick stocks,\nand provide a moderate improvement in binary and probabilistic classification\nfor small-tick stocks. We also perform local logistic regression fits on the\nsame data, and find that this semi-parametric approach slightly outperform our\nlogistic regression fits, at the expense of being more computationally\nintensive to implement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 00:26:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gould", "Martin D.", ""], ["Bonart", "Julius", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06228", "submitter": "Abhijit Sharang", "authors": "Abhijit Sharang and Chetan Rao", "title": "Using machine learning for medium frequency derivative portfolio trading", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use machine learning for designing a medium frequency trading strategy for\na portfolio of 5 year and 10 year US Treasury note futures.
