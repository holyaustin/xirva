The trade arrival rate presents a deterministic pattern that can\nbe modeled by a cosine function perturbed by noise. Due to the nonlinear\nrelationship between the rate and the observed number of trades, the noise can\neither enhance or suppress the detection of the deterministic pattern. By\nfinding the parameters of our model with intra-day data, we describe the\ntrading environment and illustrate the presence of SR in the trade arrival rate\nof stocks in the U.S. market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Jul 2008 18:57:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "A.

In this model market\nparticipants have access to a stream of noisy information concerning the future\nreturn of an asset, whereas the informed trader has access to a further\ninformation source which is obscured by an additional noise that may be\ncorrelated with the market noise. The informed trader uses the extraneous\ninformation source to seek statistical arbitrage opportunities, while at the\nsame time accommodating the additional risk. The amount of information\navailable to the general market participant concerning the asset return is\nmeasured by the mutual information of the asset price and the associated cash\nflow. The worth of the additional information source is then measured in terms\nof the difference of mutual information between the general market participant\nand the informed trader. This difference is shown to be nonnegative when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the information flow is known in advance. Explicit\ntrading strategies leading to statistical arbitrage opportunities, taking\nadvantage of the additional information, are constructed, illustrating how\nexcess information can be translated into profit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 14:24:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2008 15:07:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Davis", "Mark H.

This leads to a\ndetailed understanding of the origin of fat tails and volatility clustering and\nwe propose a mechanism for the self-organization of the market dynamics in the\nquasi-critical state. The stylized facts are shown to correspond to finite size\neffects which, however, can be active at different time scales. This implies\nthat universality cannot be expected in describing these properties in terms of\neffective critical exponents. The introduction of a threshold in the agents'\naction (small price fluctuations lead to no-action) triggers the\nself-organization towards the quasi-critical state. Non-stationarity in the\nnumber of active agents and in their action plays a fundamental role. The model\ncan be easily generalized to more realistic variants in a systematic way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jul 2008 16:45:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alfi", "V.", ""], ["Pietronero", "L.", ""], ["Zaccaria", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3960", "submitter": "Ivar Ekeland", "authors": "Ivar Ekeland", "title": "Existence, uniqueness and efficiency of equilibrium in hedonic markets\n  with multidimenstional types", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study equilibrium in hedonic markets, when consumers and suppliers have\nreservation utilities, and the utility functions are separable with respect to\nprice.
