The intensities of the orders she receives\ndepend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on unobservable factors\nmodelled by a hidden Markov chain. We tackle this stochastic control problem\nunder partial information with a model that unifies and generalizes many\nexisting ones under full information, combining several risk metrics and\nconstraints, and using general decreasing intensity functionals. We use\nstochastic filtering, control and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes\ntheory, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and characterize the\nreduced value function as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its\ndynamic programming equation. We then solve the analogous full information\nproblem and compare the results numerically through a concrete example. We show\nthat the optimal full information spreads are biased when the exact market\nregime is unknown, and the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime\nuncertainty in terms of P&L sensitivity and observed order flow volatility.\nThis effect becomes higher, the longer the waiting time in between orders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2019 12:59:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:49:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 22:46:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zabaljauregui", "Diego", ""], ["Campi", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01941", "submitter": "Jun Wu", "authors": "Weili Chen, Jun Wu, Zibin Zheng, Chuan Chen, and Yuren Zhou", "title": "Market Manipulation of Bitcoin: Evidence from Mining the Mt.
