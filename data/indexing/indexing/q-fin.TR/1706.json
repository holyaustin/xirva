We demonstrate the capabilities of\nthis method by applying it to high-frequency order book data from the EUREX\nexchange. We show that it is able to uncover (or recover) various relationships\nbetween all the first level order book events associated with some asset when\nmapped to a 12-dimensional process. We then scale up the model so as to account\nfor events on two assets simultaneously and we discuss the joint high-frequency\ndynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 21:39:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Achab", "Massil", ""], ["Bacry", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Muzy", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Rambaldi", "Marcello", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.04163", "submitter": "Felix Patzelt", "authors": "Felix Patzelt, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "title": "Universal scaling and nonlinearity of aggregate price impact in\n  financial markets", "comments": "This version: added affiliations and reference to companion paper.\n  Fixed minor typing errors", "journal-ref": "Phys.

More recently, attention shifted to higher frequencies, where\ntrades are processed piecewise across different timescales. Here we reveal that\nprice impact has a universal non-linear shape for trades aggregated on any\nintra-day scale. Its shape varies little across instruments, but drastically\ndifferent master curves are obtained for order-volume and -sign impact. The\nscaling is largely determined by the relevant Hurst exponents. We further show\nthat extreme order flow imbalance is not associated with large returns. To the\ncontrary, it is observed when the price is \"pinned\" to a particular level.\nPrices move only when there is sufficient balance in the local order flow. In\nfact, the probability that a trade changes the mid-price falls to zero with\nincreasing (absolute) order-sign bias along an arc-shaped curve for all\nintra-day scales. Our findings challenge the widespread assumption of linear\naggregate impact. They imply that market dynamics on all intra-day timescales\nare shaped by correlations and bilateral adaptation in the flows of liquidity\nprovision and taking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 17:03:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Aug 2017 07:42:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Patzelt", "Felix", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.04844", "submitter": "Alexander Schied", "authors": "Alexander Schied and Elias Strehle", "title": "On the minimizers of energy forms with completely monotone kernel", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.CA q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the problem of optimal portfolio liquidation under transient\nprice impact, we study the minimization of energy functionals with completely\nmonotone displacement kernel under an integral constraint.
