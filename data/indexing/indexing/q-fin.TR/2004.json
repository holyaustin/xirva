We develop a\nstochastic model of over-collateralized stablecoins that helps explain such\ncrises. In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by speculators who\noptimize the profitability of a leveraged position while incorporating the\nforward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which involves the endogenous\nprice of the stablecoin. We formally characterize regimes that are interpreted\nas stable and unstable for the stablecoin. We prove bounds on the probabilities\nof large deviations and quadratic variation in the stable domain and distinctly\ngreater price variance in the unstable domain. The unstable domain can be\ntriggered by large deviations, collapsed expectations, or liquidity problems\nfrom deleveraging. We formally characterize a deflationary deleveraging spiral\nas a submartingale that can cause the system to behave in counterintuitive ways\ndue to liquidity problems in a crisis. These deleveraging spirals, which\nresemble short squeezes, lead to faster collateral drawdown (and potential\nshortfalls) and are accompanied by higher price variance, as experienced on\nBlack Thursday. We also demonstrate `perfect' stability results in idealized\nsettings and discuss mechanisms which could bring realistic settings closer to\nsuch idealized stable settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 23:25:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 May 2021 23:00:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Klages-Mundt", "Ariah", ""], ["Minca", "Andreea", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.01498", "submitter": "Ye-Sheen Lim", "authors": "Ye-Sheen Lim, Denise Gorse", "title": "Deep Probabilistic Modelling of Price Movements for High-Frequency\n  Trading", "comments": "8 pages, 2 columns, IJCNN", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.TR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a deep recurrent architecture for the probabilistic\nmodelling of high-frequency market prices, important for the risk management of\nautomated trading systems.

Each\nmarket-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder\ntransforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is\nprocessed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a\nmarket-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information\nfrom the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent\nadvances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are\nfree to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters\nare driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over\nidiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding\nthe problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns.

A self-contained, realistic, and fully functional\nChild Order Placement (COP) model may never exist due to all the inherent\ncomplexities, e.g., fragmentation due to multiple venues, dynamics of limit\norder books, lit vs. dark liquidity, different trading sessions and rules. In\nthis paper, we propose a reductionism COP model that focuses exclusively on the\ninterplay between placing passive limit orders and sniping using aggressive\ntakeout orders. The dynamic programming model assumes the form of a stochastic\nlinear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and allows closed-form solutions under the\nbackward Bellman equations.
