Therefore, it only answers the general question\nof the optimal liquidation rhythm. The very question of the actual way to\nproceed with liquidation is then rarely dealt with. Our model, that\nincorporates both price risk and non-execution risk, is an attempt to tackle\nthis question using limit orders. The very general framework we propose to\nmodel liquidation generalizes the existing literature on optimal posting of\nlimit orders. We consider a risk-adverse agent whereas the model of Bayraktar\nand Ludkovski only tackles the case of a risk-neutral one. We consider very\ngeneral functional forms for the execution process intensity, whereas Gu\\'eant\net al. is restricted to exponential intensity. Eventually, we link the\nexecution cost function of Almgren-Chriss models to the intensity function in\nour model, providing then a way to see Almgren-Chriss models as a limit of\nours.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2012 23:38:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 Jul 2012 22:31:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 28 Jul 2012 18:16:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2012 11:17:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2013 11:03:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 10:27:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Gu\u00e9ant", "Olivier", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0426", "submitter": "Aki-Hiro Sato", "authors": "Aki-Hiro Sato, Takaki Hayashi, and Janusz A.
