The latter represent the actions of market regulators, or other major\nnatural or political events that impact on the market. In contrast to\nnon-spherical MGs, the spherical formulation allows one to derive closed\ndynamical order parameter equations in explicit form and work out the market's\nresponse to such events fully analytically. We focus on a comparison between\nthe response to stationary versus oscillating market interventions, and reveal\nprofound and partially unexpected differences in terms of transition lines and\nthe volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2008 15:32:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Papadopoulos", "P.", ""], ["Coolen", "A.

It is\nwell known that the interevent statistics observed in these contexts differs\nfrom the Poissonian profile by being long-tailed distributed with resting and\nactive periods interwoven. Understanding mechanisms generating consistent\nstatistics have therefore become a central issue. The approach we present is\ntaken from the Continuous Time Random Walk formalism and represents an\nanalytical alternative to models of non-trivial priority that have been\nrecently proposed. Our analysis also goes one step further by looking at the\nmultifractal structure of the interevent times of human decisions. We here\nanalyze the inter-transaction time intervals of several financial markets. We\nobserve that empirical data describes a subtle multifractal behavior. Our model\nexplains this structure by taking the pausing-time density in the form of a\nsuperstatistics where the integral kernel quantifies the heterogeneous nature\nof the executed tasks. An stretched exponential kernel provides a multifractal\nprofile valid for a certain limited range. A suggested heuristic analytical\nprofile is capable of covering a broader region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 May 2008 14:22:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2008 11:53:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Perello", "J.", ""], ["Masoliver", "J.", ""], ["Kasprzak", "A.", ""], ["Kutner", "R.", ""]]}]
