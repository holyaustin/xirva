Optimal strategies in the adapted class\nunder various risk criteria, namely value-at-risk, expected shortfall and a new\ncriterion called \"squared asset expectation\" (SAE), related to a version of the\ncost variance measure, are derived and compared. It is well known that\ndisplaced diffusions (DD) exhibit dynamics which are in-between arithmetic\nBrownian motions (ABM) and geometric Brownian motions (GBM) depending of the\nchoice of the shift parameter. Furthermore, DD allows for changes in the\nsupport of the mid asset price distribution, allowing one to include a minimum\npermitted value for the mid price, either positive or negative. We study the\ndependence of the optimal solution on the choice of the risk aversion\ncriterion. Optimal solutions across criteria and asset dynamics are comparable\nalthough differences are not negligible for high levels of risk aversion and\nlow market impact assets. This is illustrated with numerical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2013 12:56:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 16:46:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 May 2014 14:13:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Di Graziano", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3135", "submitter": "Jinzhong Niu", "authors": "Jinzhong Niu and Simon Parsons", "title": "Maximizing Matching in Double-sided Auctions", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures, full-length version of an extended abstract\n  published at the AAMAS 2013 conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a novel, non-recursive, maximal matching\nalgorithm for double auctions, which aims to maximize the amount of commodities\nto be traded.

All\nquantities involved in the equation can be calibrated using high-frequency data\non best quotes. One of our central finding is the the dynamical process is\napproximately scale invariant, i.e., the only relevant variable is the ratio of\nthe current volume in the queue to its average value. While the latter shows\nintraday seasonalities and strong variability across stocks and time periods,\nthe dynamics of the rescaled volumes is universal. In terms of rescaled\nvolumes, we found that the drift has a complex two-dimensional structure, which\nis a sum of a gradient contribution and a rotational contribution, both stable\nacross stocks and time. This drift term is entirely responsible for the\ndynamical correlations between the ask queue and the bid queue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:09:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gareche", "A.", ""], ["Disdier", "G.", ""], ["Kockelkoren", "J.", ""], ["Bouchaud", "J. -P.", ""]]}]
