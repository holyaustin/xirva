The price of a stock increases whenever it is\nbought and decreases whenever it is sold. Price changes are updated by the\norder book before the next transaction takes place. In this deterministic\nmodel, all traders based their buy decisions on a call utility function, and\nall their sell decisions on a put utility function. We then make the\nagent-based model more realistic, by either having a fraction $f_b$ of traders\nbuy a random stock on offer, or a fraction $f_s$ of traders sell a random stock\nin their portfolio. Based on our simulations, we find that it is possible to\nidentify useful order parameters from the steady-state price distributions of\nall three models. Using these order parameters as a guide, we find three\nphases: (i) the dead market; (ii) the boom market; and (iii) the jammed market\nin the the phase diagram of the deterministic model. Comparing the phase\ndiagrams of the stochastic models against that of the deterministic model, we\nrealize that the primary effect of stochasticity is to eliminate the dead\nmarket phase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 05:07:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lye", "Ribin", ""], ["Tan", "James Peng Lung", ""], ["Cheong", "Siew Ann", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1374", "submitter": "Anita Mehta", "authors": "Anita Mehta", "title": "Predatory trading and risk minimisation: how to (b)eat the competition", "comments": "19 pages, 13 figures, written for the Proceedings of the\n  International Workshop on the \"Econophysics of systemic risk and network\n  dynamics\" (Springer Verlag Italia)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-88-470-2553-0_10", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a model of predatory traders interacting with each other in the\npresence of a central reserve (which dissipates their wealth through say,\ntaxation), as well as inflation.

Then, a more general formulation of the above scaling properties allows to\nextend the model to the afternoon trading session. We finally outline an\napplication in which conditioned forecasting is used to implement a\ntrend-following trading strategy capable of exploiting linear correlations\npresent in the S&P dataset and absent in the model. Trading signals are\nmodel-based and not derived from chartist criteria. In-sample and out-of-sample\ntests indicate that the model-based trading strategy performs better than a\nbenchmark one established on an asymmetric GARCH process, and show the\nexistence of small arbitrage opportunities. We remark that in the absence of\nlinear correlations the trading profit would vanish and discuss why the trading\nstrategy is potentially interesting to hedge volatility risk for S&P\nindex-based products.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Feb 2012 14:38:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 09:40:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Baldovin", "Fulvio", ""], ["Camana", "Francesco", ""], ["Caporin", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Caraglio", "Michele", ""], ["Stella", "Attilio L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.3915", "submitter": "Didier Sornette", "authors": "A.

This\nmodel allows us to explain both qualitatively and quantitatively important\nstylized facts observed in the statistics of microstructure returns, including\nthe short-ranged correlation of returns, the long-ranged correlations of\nabsolute returns, the microstructure noise and Epps effects. According to the\nmicrostructure noise effect, volatility is a decreasing function of the time\nscale used to estimate it. Paradoxically, the Epps effect states that cross\ncorrelations between asset returns are increasing functions of the time scale\nat which the returns are estimated. The microstructure noise is explained as\nthe result of the negative return correlations inherent in the definition of\nthe bid-ask bounce component (ii). In the presence of a genuine correlation\nbetween the returns of two assets, the Epps effect is due to an average\nstatistical overlap of the momentum of the returns of the two assets defined\nover a finite time scale in the presence of the long memory process (i).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Feb 2012 14:28:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Saichev", "A.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.4877", "submitter": "Martin Rypdal", "authors": "Martin Rypdal, Espen Sirnes, Ola L{\\o}vsletten, Kristoffer Rypdal", "title": "Assessing market uncertainty by means of a time-varying intermittency\n  parameter for asset price fluctuations", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2013.02.010", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Maximum likelihood estimation applied to high-frequency data allows us to\nquantify intermittency in the fluctu- ations of asset prices.
