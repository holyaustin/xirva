Those two hypotheses enable us to\nderive the evolution of the price from the dynamics of the flow of market\norders. For example, if the market order flow is assumed to follow a nearly\nunstable Hawkes process, we retrieve the apparent long memory of the flow\ntogether with a power law impact function which is consistent with the\ncelebrated square root law. We also link the long memory exponent of the sign\nof market orders with the impact function exponent. One of the originalities of\nour approach is that our results are derived without assuming that market\nparticipants are able to detect the beginning of metaorders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 09:35:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Jaisson", "Thibault", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.1405", "submitter": "Dror Kenett", "authors": "Dror Y.

The\nPearson correlation is commonly used to indicate the level of similarity in the\nprice changes for a given pair of stocks, but it does not measure whether other\nstocks influence the relationship between them. To explore the influence of a\nthird stock on the relationship between two stocks, we use a partial\ncorrelation measurement to determine the underlying relationships between\nfinancial assets. Building on previous work, we present a statistically robust\napproach to extract the underlying relationships between stocks from four\ndifferent financial markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and\nIndia. This methodology provides new insights into financial market dynamics\nand uncovers implicit influences in play between stocks. To demonstrate the\ncapabilities of this methodology, we (i) quantify the influence of different\ncompanies and, by studying market similarity across time, present new insights\ninto market structure and market stability, and (ii) we present a practical\napplication, which provides information on the how a company is influenced by\ndifferent economic sectors, and how the sectors interact with each other.

According to prospect\ntheory, people are risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-seeking with\nrespect to losses, a phenomenon called \"loss aversion\". Despite of the fact\nthat prospect theory has been well developed in behavioral economics at the\ntheoretical level, there exist very few large-scale empirical studies and most\nof them have been undertaken with micro-panel data. Here we analyze over 28.5\nmillion trades made by 81.3 thousand traders of an online financial trading\ncommunity over 28 months, aiming to explore the large-scale empirical aspect of\nprospect theory. By analyzing and comparing the behavior of winning and losing\ntrades and traders, we find clear evidence of the loss aversion phenomenon, an\nessence in prospect theory. This work hence demonstrates an unprecedented\nlarge-scale empirical evidence of prospect theory, which has immediate\nimplication in financial trading, e.g., developing new trading strategies by\nminimizing the effect of loss aversion. Moreover, we introduce three\nrisk-adjusted metrics inspired by prospect theory to differentiate winning and\nlosing traders based on their historical trading behavior. This offers us\npotential opportunities to augment online social trading, where traders are\nallowed to watch and follow the trading activities of others, by predicting\npotential winners statistically based on their historical trading behavior\nrather than their trading performance at any given point in time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 02:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 13:37:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Mar 2014 16:34:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yang-Yu", ""], ["Nacher", "Jose C.", ""], ["Ochiai", "Tomoshiro", ""], ["Martino", "Mauro", ""], ["Altshuler", "Yaniv", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6583", "submitter": "Oleg Kritski L", "authors": "Lyudmila A.
