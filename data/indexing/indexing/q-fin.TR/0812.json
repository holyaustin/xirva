(2004)\nto allow for price impacts. We show that the impact of a market order on prices\ndepends on the size of the transaction and the level of liquidity. We obtain a\nsimple characterization of self-financing trading strategies and a sufficient\ncondition for no arbitrage. We consider a stochastic volatility model in which\nthe volatility is partly correlated with the liquidity process and show that,\nwith the use of variance swaps, contingent claims whose payoffs depend on the\nvalue of the asset can be approximately replicated in this setting. The\nreplicating costs of such payoffs are obtained from the solutions of BSDEs with\nquadratic growth and analytical properties of these solutions are investigated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 17:57:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2009 09:04:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Roch", "Alexandre F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2603", "submitter": "Neil F.

We show that a suitable combination of these two\nmodels -- in particular, a population of virtual traders with access to both\nglobal and local information -- produces results for the price return\ndistribution which are closer to the reported stylized facts. We believe that\nthis type of model can be applied across a wide range of systems in which\ncollective human activity is observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Dec 2008 05:16:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kirou", "Andy", ""], ["Ruszczycki", "Blazej", ""], ["Walser", "Markus", ""], ["Johnson", "Neil F.", ""]]}]
