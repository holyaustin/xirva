We define\nthe profit intensity as a measure of this economic category. The profit\nintensity in a repeated trading has a unique property of attaining its maximum\nat a fixed point regardless of the shape of demand curves for a wide class of\nprobability distributions of random reverse transaction (ie closing of the\nposition). This type of market games is often considered in the research aiming\nat finding an algorithm that maximizes profit of a trader who negotiates prices\nwith the Rest of the World (a collective opponent) that posses a definite and\nobjective supply profile. Such idealization neglects the sometimes important\ninfluence of an individual trader on the demand/supply profile of the Rest of\nthe World and in extreme cases questions the very idea of demand/supply\nprofile. Therefore we put forward a trading model in which the demand/supply\nprofile of the Rest of the World induces the (rational) trader to\n(subjectively) presume that he/she lacks (almost) all knowledge concerning the\nmarket but his/hers average frequency of trade. This point of view introduces\nmaximum entropy principles into the model and broadens the range of economics\nphenomena that can be perceived as a sort of thermodynamical system. As a\nconsequence, the profit intensity has a fixed point:the profit in tensity\nreaches its maximum when the probability of transaction is given by the Golden\nRatio rule $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Nov 2008 16:44:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Piotrowski", "Edward W.", ""], ["Sladkowski", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3988", "submitter": "Daniel Fenn", "authors": "Daniel J.

As an\nexample, we consider a foreign exchange market network in which each node\nrepresents an exchange rate and each edge represents a time-dependent\ncorrelation between the rates.

By introducing the possibility that agents can enter or leave the\nmarket depending on the behavior of the price, it is possible to show that the\nsystem self-organizes in a regime with a finite number of agents which\ncorresponds to the stylized facts. The mechanism to enter or leave the market\nis based on the idea that a too stable market is unappealing for traders while\nthe presence of price movements attracts agents to enter and speculate on the\nmarket. We show that this mechanism is also compatible with the idea that\nagents are scared by a noisy and risky market at shorter time scales. We also\nshow that the mechanism for self-organization is robust with respect to\nvariations of the exit/entry rules and that the attempt to trigger the system\nto self-organize in a region without stylized facts leads to an unrealistic\ndynamics. We study the self-organization in a specific agent based model but we\nbelieve that the basic ideas should be of general validity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2008 09:35:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Alfi", "V.", ""], ["Cristelli", "M.", ""], ["Pietronero", "L.", ""], ["Zaccaria", "A.", ""]]}]
