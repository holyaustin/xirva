Recently, universal and\nhighly nonlinear master curves were observed for price impacts aggregated on\nall intra-day scales [1]. Here we investigate how well these curves, their\nscaling, and the underlying return dynamics are captured by linear \"propagator\"\nmodels. We find that the classification of trades as price-changing versus\nnon-price-changing can explain the price impact nonlinearities and short-term\nreturn dynamics to a very high degree. The explanatory power provided by the\nchange indicator in addition to the order sign history increases with\nincreasing tick size. To obtain these results, several long-standing technical\nissues for model calibration and -testing are addressed. We present new\nspectral estimators for two- and three-point cross-correlations, removing the\nneed for previously used approximations. We also show when calibration is\nunbiased and how to accurately reveal previously overlooked biases. Therefore,\nour results contribute significantly to understanding both recent empirical\nresults and the properties of a popular class of impact models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 09:03:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Patzelt", "Felix", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02715", "submitter": "Mike Ludkovski", "authors": "Kyle Bechler and Michael Ludkovski", "title": "Order Flows and Limit Order Book Resiliency on the Meso-Scale", "comments": "8 figures; One figure is missing due to arxiv size constraints (was\n  6MB originally)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the behavior of limit order books on the meso-scale motivated\nby order execution scheduling algorithms.
