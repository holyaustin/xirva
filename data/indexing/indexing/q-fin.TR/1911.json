This article discusses hierarchical correlation reconstruction\n(HCR) methodology for such prediction on example of usually unavailable bid-ask\nspreads, predicted from more accessible data like closing price, volume,\nhigh/low price, returns. In HCR methodology we first normalize marginal\ndistributions to nearly uniform like in copula theory. Then we model (joint)\ndensities as linear combinations of orthonormal polynomials, getting its\ndecomposition into (mixed) moments. Then here we model each moment (separately)\nof predicted variable as a linear combination of mixed moments of known\nvariables using least squares linear regression - getting accurate description\nwith interpretable coefficients describing linear relations between moments.\nCombining such predicted moments we get predicted density as a polynomial, for\nwhich we can e.g. calculate expected value, but also variance to evaluate\nuncertainty of such prediction, or we can use the entire distribution e.g. for\nmore accurate further calculations or generating random values. There were\nperformed 10-fold cross-validation log-likelihood tests for 22 DAX companies,\nleading to very accurate predictions, especially when using individual models\nfor each company as there were found large differences between their behaviors.\nAdditional advantage of the discussed methodology is being computationally\ninexpensive, finding and evaluation a model with hundreds of parameters and\nthousands of data points takes a second on a laptop.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2019 09:57:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Duda", "Jaros\u0142aw", ""], ["Syrek", "Robert", ""], ["Gurgul", "Henryk", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.03380", "submitter": "Guillermo Angeris", "authors": "Guillermo Angeris, Hsien-Tang Kao, Rei Chiang, Charlie Noyes, Tarun\n  Chitra", "title": "An analysis of Uniswap markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.MA math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Uniswap -- and other constant product markets -- appear to work well in\npractice despite their simplicity.

A bidder, participating in such\nPDAs, has to plan for bids in the current auction as well as for the future\nauctions, which highlights the necessity of good bidding strategies. In this\npaper, we perform an equilibrium analysis of single unit single-shot double\nauctions with a certain clearing price and payment rule, which we refer to as\nACPR, and find it intractable to analyze as number of participating agents\nincrease. We further derive the best response for a bidder with complete\ninformation in a single-shot double auction with ACPR. Leveraging the theory\ndeveloped for single-shot double auction and taking the PowerTAC wholesale\nmarket PDA as our testbed, we proceed by modeling the PDA of PowerTAC as an\nMDP. We propose a novel bidding strategy, namely MDPLCPBS. We empirically show\nthat MDPLCPBS follows the equilibrium strategy for double auctions that we\npreviously analyze.
