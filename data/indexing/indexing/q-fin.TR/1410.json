Here we consider a very simple trading strategy for calls.\nThe main points of this note are the following. First, the presented trading\nstrategy appears very lucrative in the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework. In\nfact, it is such even to the extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a\nsense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models\ntogether, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying\nstate price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile and\nthis is the main point of the paper. Moreover, these observations arise from\npurely structural considerations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Oct 2014 16:04:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Talponen", "Jarno", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1481", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "title": "Optimal execution of ASR contracts with fixed notional", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Be it for taking advantage of stock undervaluation or in order to distribute\npart of their profits to shareholders, firms may buy back their own shares. One\nof the way they proceed is by including Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASR) as\npart of their repurchase programs. In this article, we study the pricing and\noptimal execution strategy of an ASR contract with fixed notional. In such a\ncontract the firm pays a fixed notional $F$ to the bank and receives, in\nexchange, a number of shares corresponding to the ratio between $F$ and the\naverage stock price over the purchase period, the duration of this period being\ndecided upon by the bank. From a mathematical point of view, the problem is\nrelated to both optimal execution and exotic option pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Oct 2014 18:06:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 16:10:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gu\u00e9ant", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.3394", "submitter": "Mathieu Rosenbaum", "authors": "Jim Gatheral, Thibault Jaisson and Mathieu Rosenbaum", "title": "Volatility is rough", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.MF q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Estimating volatility from recent high frequency data, we revisit the\nquestion of the smoothness of the volatility process. Our main result is that\nlog-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst\nexponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt\nthe fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call\nour model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We\ndemonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time\nseries data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts\nof realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not\nlong memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at\ndetecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory\nin data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility\nhas been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative\nmarket microstructure-based foundation for our findings, relating the roughness\nof volatility to high frequency trading and order splitting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Oct 2014 17:04:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gatheral", "Jim", ""], ["Jaisson", "Thibault", ""], ["Rosenbaum", "Mathieu", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6144", "submitter": "Sergio  Pulido", "authors": "Dmitry Kramkov, Sergio Pulido", "title": "Stability and analytic expansions of local solutions of systems of\n  quadratic BSDEs with applications to a price impact model", "comments": "Final version, 28 pages", "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics, 2016, Vol. 7, No. 1 : pp.\n  567-587", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.PM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We obtain stability estimates and derive analytic expansions for local\nsolutions of multi-dimensional quadratic BSDEs.
