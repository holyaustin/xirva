The segmentation algorithm is a non parametric statistical method\nable to identify the regimes (patches) of the time series. The process is\ncomposed of consecutive patches of variable length, each patch being described\nby a stationary compound Poisson process, i.e. a Poisson process where each\ncount is associated to a fluctuating signal. The parameters of the process are\ndifferent in each patch and therefore the time series is non stationary. Our\nmethod is a generalization of the algorithm introduced by Bernaola-Galvan, et\nal., Phys. Rev. Lett., 87, 168105 (2001). We show that the new algorithm\noutperforms the original one for regime switching compound Poisson processes.\nAs an application we use the algorithm to segment the time series of the\ninventory of market members of the London Stock Exchange and we observe that\nour method finds almost three times more patches than the original one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2010 20:25:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Feb 2011 21:22:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Toth", "Bence", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
