Volumes of orders sitting deep in the LOB are\npredicted by combining outputs from: (1) a history compiler that uses a Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) module to selectively compile prediction relevant quote\nhistory; (2) a market events simulator, which uses an Ordinary Differential\nEquation Recurrent Neural Network (ODE-RNN) to simulate the accumulation of net\norder arrivals; and (3) a weighting scheme to adaptively combine the\npredictions generated by (1) and (2).

Like Gode & Sunder's classic Zero-Intelligence Constrained (ZIC)\ntrader, PRZI generates quote-prices from a random distribution over some\nspecified domain of discretely-valued allowable quote-prices. Unlike ZIC, which\nuses a uniform distribution to generate prices, the probability distribution in\na PRZI trader is parameterised in such a way that its probability mass function\n(PMF) is determined by a real-valued control variable s in the range [-1.0,\n+1.0] that determines the strategy for that trader. When s is zero, a PRZI\ntrader behaves identically to the ZIC strategy, with a flat/rectangular PMF;\nbut when s is close to plus or minus one the PRZI trader's PMF becomes\nasymptotically maximally skewed to one extreme or the other of the price-range,\nthereby enabling the PRZI trader to act in the same way as the \"Shaver\"\nstrategy (SHVR) or the \"Giveaway\" strategy (GVWY), both of which have recently\nbeen demonstrated to be surprisingly dominant over more sophisticated, and\nsupposedly more profitable, trader-strategies that incorporate adaptive\nmechanisms and machine learning. Depending on the value of s, a PRZI trader\nwill behave either as a ZIC, or as a SHVR, or as a GVWY, or as some hybrid\nstrategy part-way between two of these three previously-reported strategies.\nThe novel smoothly-varying strategy in PRZI has value in giving trader-agents\nplausibly useful \"market impact\" responses to imbalances in an auction-market's\nlimit-order-book, and also allows for the study of co-adaptive dynamics in\ncontinuous strategy-spaces rather than the discrete spaces that have\ntraditionally been studied in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Mar 2021 08:43:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2021 19:09:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:53:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2021 21:43:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Cliff", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.12419", "submitter": "Artur Sokolovsky", "authors": "Artur Sokolovsky, Luca Arnaboldi, Jaume Bacardit, Thomas Gross", "title": "Explainable Machine Learning-driven Strategy for Automated Trading\n  Pattern Extraction", "comments": "The reproducibility package available at:\n  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629567", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY eess.SY q-fin.TR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Financial markets are a source of non-stationary multidimensional time series\nwhich has been drawing attention for decades.

In practice, however, optimal execution problems often involve\nlarge portfolios comprising numerous assets, and models should consequently\naccount for risks at the portfolio level.

By using \\textit{a priori} estimates\nobtained thanks to optimal control tools, we nevertheless prove an existence\nand uniqueness result for the latter ODE, and then deduce a verification\ntheorem that provides a rigorous solution to the execution problem. Using\nnumerical methods we eventually illustrate our results and discuss their\nimplications.

We demonstrate a simple method for recovering a CFMM trading\nfunction that produces this desired payoff. This method uses only basic tools\nfrom convex analysis and is intimately related to Fenchel conjugacy.

We assume that N risky assets held will be liquidated\naccording to the same time interval and order quantity, and the basic price\nprocesses of assets are generated by an N-dimensional independent standard\nBrownian motion. The permanent impact generated by an asset in the portfolio\nduring the liquidation will affect all assets, and the temporary impact\ngenerated by one asset will only affect itself. On this basis, we establish a\nliquidation cost model based on the VaR measurement and obtain an optimal\nliquidation time under discrete-time conditions. The optimal solution shows\nthat the liquidation time is only related to the temporary impact rather than\nthe permanent impact.
