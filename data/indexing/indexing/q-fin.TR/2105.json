The\nhigh volatility of Bitcoin and the complex factors affecting them make the\nstudy of effective price forecasting methods of great practical importance to\nfinancial investors and researchers worldwide. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach called MRC-LSTM, which combines a Multi-scale Residual\nConvolutional neural network (MRC) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to\nimplement Bitcoin closing price prediction. Specifically, the Multi-scale\nresidual module is based on one-dimensional convolution, which is not only\ncapable of adaptive detecting features of different time scales in multivariate\ntime series, but also enables the fusion of these features. LSTM has the\nability to learn long-term dependencies in series, which is widely used in\nfinancial time series forecasting. By mixing these two methods, the model is\nable to obtain highly expressive features and efficiently learn trends and\ninteractions of multivariate time series. In the study, the impact of external\nfactors such as macroeconomic variables and investor attention on the Bitcoin\nprice is considered in addition to the trading information of the Bitcoin\nmarket. We performed experiments to predict the daily closing price of Bitcoin\n(USD), and the experimental results show that MRC-LSTM significantly\noutperforms a variety of other network structures. Furthermore, we conduct\nadditional experiments on two other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and Litecoin, to\nfurther confirm the effectiveness of the MRC-LSTM in short-term forecasting for\nmultivariate time series of cryptocurrencies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2021 09:32:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Qiutong", ""], ["Lei", "Shun", ""], ["Ye", "Qing", ""], ["Fang", "Zhiyang", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.02211", "submitter": "Ivan Jericevich", "authors": "Ivan Jericevich and Patrick Chang and Tim Gebbie", "title": "Simulation and estimation of a point-process market-model with a\n  matching engine", "comments": "19 pages, 33 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP stat.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The extent to which a matching engine can cloud the modelling of underlying\norder submission and management processes in a financial market remains an\nunanswered concern with regards to market models.

Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the\nway in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting\ntrends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast\nmean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping\nit back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a\nchangepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond\nto varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised\nchangepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid,\ncontinuous futures contracts over the period 1990-2020, the addition of the CPD\nmodule leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of one-third. Even more notably,\nthis module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity,\nand in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the\nperformance boost is approximately two-thirds. This is especially interesting\nas traditional momentum strategies have been underperforming in this period.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2021 10:46:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 12:51:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wood", "Kieran", ""], ["Roberts", "Stephen", ""], ["Zohren", "Stefan", ""]]}]
