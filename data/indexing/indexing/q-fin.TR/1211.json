In the US\nand Europe, it now accounts for nearly one-half of all trades. Although\nevidence suggests that HFT contributes to the efficiency of markets, there are\nconcerns it also adds to market instability, especially during times of stress.\nCurrently, it is unclear how or why HFT produces these outcomes. In this paper,\nI use data from NASDAQ to show that HFT synchronizes prices in financial\nmarkets, making the values of related securities change contemporaneously. With\na model, I demonstrate how price synchronization leads to increased efficiency:\nprices are more accurate and transaction costs are reduced. During times of\nstress, however, localized errors quickly propagate through the financial\nsystem if safeguards are not in place. In addition, there is potential for HFT\nto enforce incorrect relationships between securities, making prices more (or\nless) correlated than economic fundamentals warrant. This research highlights\nan important role that HFT plays in markets and helps answer several puzzling\nquestions that previously seemed difficult to explain: why HFT is so prevalent,\nwhy HFT concentrates in certain securities and largely ignores others, and\nfinally, how HFT can lower transaction costs yet still make profits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2012 17:44:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Gerig", "Austin", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.2078", "submitter": "Kenan Qiao", "authors": "Kenan Qiao", "title": "Market Liquidity and Convexity of Order Book (Evidence From China)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Market liquidity plays a vital role in the field of market micro-structure,\nbecause it is the vigor of the financial market.

Markets are therefore often described as\n\"informationally efficient\", rapidly removing predictable price changes, and\nleaving only residual unpredictable fluctuations. This classical view of\nmarkets absorbing information and otherwise operating close to an equilibrium\nis challenged by extreme price fluctuations, in particular since they occur far\nmore frequently than can be accounted for by external news. Here we show that\nspeculative markets which absorb mainly self-generated information can exhibit\nboth: evolution towards efficient equilibrium states as well as their\nsubsequent destabilization. This peculiar dynamics, a generic instability\narising from an adaptive control which annihilates predictable information, is\nrealized in a minimal agent-based market model where the impacts of agents'\nstrategies adapt according to their trading success. This adaptation implements\na learning rule for the market as a whole minimizing predictable price changes.\nThe model reproduces stylized statistical properties of price changes in\nquantitative detail, including heavy tailed log return distributions and\nvolatility clusters. Our results demonstrate that the perpetual occurrence of\nmarket instabilities can be a direct consequence of the very mechanisms that\nlead to market efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2012 18:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 18:30:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Patzelt", "Felix", ""], ["Pawelzik", "Klaus R.", ""]]}]
