We\npostulate that liquidity providers observe a fundamental price which is\ncontinuous, efficient, and can assume values outside the interval spanned by\nthe best quotes. We confirm the predictions of our price formation model with\nextensive empirical tests on large high-frequency datasets of 100 liquid Nasdaq\nstocks. Finally we use the model to propose an estimator of the fundamental\nprice based on the rebate adjusted volume imbalance at the best quotes and we\nempirically show that it outperforms other simpler estimators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 10:13:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Aug 2016 19:03:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bonart", "Julius", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.01795", "submitter": "D\\\"orte Kreher", "authors": "Ulrich Horst and D\\\"orte Kreher", "title": "A diffusion approximation for limit order book models", "comments": "Titel changed, appendix added, presentation improved", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper derives a diffusion approximation for a sequence of discrete-time\none-sided limit order book models with non-linear state dependent order arrival\nand cancellation dynamics. The discrete time sequences are specified in terms\nof an $\\R_+$-valued best bid price process and an $L^2_{loc}$-valued volume\nprocess. It is shown that under suitable assumptions the sequence of\ninterpolated discrete time models is relatively compact in a localized sense\nand that any limit point satisfies a certain infinite dimensional SDE. Under\nadditional assumptions on the dependence structure we construct two classes of\nmodels, which fit in the general framework, such that the limiting SDE admits a\nunique solution and thus the discrete dynamics converge to a diffusion limit in\na localized sense.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Aug 2016 08:09:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 Jan 2017 15:57:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 11:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Horst", "Ulrich", ""], ["Kreher", "D\u00f6rte", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.03985", "submitter": "Bertrand Roehner", "authors": "Peter Richmond, Bertrand M.

The analysis of this\nspeculative episode confirms the mechanism and regularities already highlighted\nby the present authors in similar episodes in other countries. Based on these\nregularities, it is possible to predict the price trajectory over the time\ninterval 2016-2025.
