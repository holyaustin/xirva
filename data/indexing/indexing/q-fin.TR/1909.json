The two primary goals of the portfolio management problem are\nmaximizing profit and restrainting risk. However, most approaches to this\nproblem solely take account of maximizing returns. Therefore, this paper\nproposes a deep reinforcement learning based trading agent that can manage the\nportfolio considering not only profit maximization but also risk restraint. We\nalso propose a new target policy to allow the trading agent to learn to prefer\nlow-risk actions. The new target policy can be reflected in the update by\nadjusting the greediness for the optimal action through the hyper parameter.\nThe proposed trading agent verifies the performance through the data of the\ncryptocurrency market. The Cryptocurrency market is the best test-ground for\ntesting our trading agents because of the huge amount of data accumulated every\nminute and the market volatility is extremely large. As a experimental result,\nduring the test period, our agents achieved a return of 1800% and provided the\nleast risky investment strategy among the existing methods. And, another\nexperiment shows that the agent can maintain robust generalized performance\neven if market volatility is large or training period is short.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Sep 2019 14:45:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Shin", "Wonsup", ""], ["Bu", "Seok-Jun", ""], ["Cho", "Sung-Bae", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.07748", "submitter": "Johann Lussange", "authors": "J.

These past financial\nmodels have all relied on so-called zero-intelligence agents, so that the\ncrucial issues of agent information and learning, central to price formation\nand hence to all market activity, could not be properly assessed. In order to\naddress this, we designed a next-generation MAS stock market simulator, in\nwhich each agent learns to trade autonomously via model-free reinforcement\nlearning. We calibrate the model to real market data from the London Stock\nExchange over the years $2007$ to $2018$, and show that it can faithfully\nreproduce key market microstructure metrics, such as various price\nautocorrelation scalars over multiple time intervals.

Disruptions to them can\nbe costly. Centrally managed supply chains invest in ensuring their resilience.\nDecentralized supply chains, however, must rely upon the self-interest of their\nindividual components to maintain the resilience of the entire chain.\n  We examine the incentives that independent self-interested agents have in\nforming a resilient supply chain network in the face of production disruptions\nand competition. In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield\nuncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time\nuncertainty or, \"soft\" supply caps). Competing retailers must decide which\nsuppliers to link to based on both price and reliability. In the presence of\nyield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse.\nRetailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea\nthat they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base.\nThis happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that\ncompetition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as\nwell, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander\ngraphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby,\nproviding the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain\nnetworks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs. Finally, we\nshow that a supplier's investments in improved yield can make it worse off.\nThis happens because high production output saturates the market, which, in\nturn lowers prices and profits for participants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:46:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:44:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Amelkin", "Victor", ""], ["Vohra", "Rakesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.09257", "submitter": "Bastien Baldacci", "authors": "Bastien Baldacci, Paul Jusselin and Mathieu Rosenbaum", "title": "How to design a derivatives market?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of designing a derivatives exchange aiming at\naddressing clients needs in terms of listed options and providing suitable\nliquidity.
