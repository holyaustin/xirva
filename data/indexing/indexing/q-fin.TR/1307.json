These are models for random markets where agents trade by pairs and\nexchange their money in a random and conservative way. They display the\nexponential wealth distribution as asymptotic equilibrium, independently of the\neffectiveness of the transactions and of the limitation of the total wealth.\nThe entropy increases with time in these models and the existence of an\nH-theorem is computationally checked. Also, it is shown that any small\nperturbation of the models equations make them to lose the exponential\ndistribution as an equilibrium solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 17:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:00:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lopez-Ruiz", "Ricardo", ""], ["Shivanian", "Elyas", ""], ["Lopez", "Jose-Luis", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.5440", "submitter": "Mehdi Lallouache", "authors": "Mehdi Lallouache, Fr\\'ed\\'eric Abergel", "title": "Tick Size Reduction and Price Clustering in a FX Order Book", "comments": "17 pages, Minor revisions", "journal-ref": "Physica A, Volume 416, 15 December 2014, Pages 488-498", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2014.09.016", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the statistical properties of the EBS order book for the\nEUR/USD and USD/JPY currency pairs and the impact of a ten-fold tick size\nreduction on its dynamics. A large fraction of limit orders are still placed\nright at or halfway between the old allowed prices. This generates price\nbarriers where the best quotes lie for much of the time, which causes the\nemergence of distinct peaks in the average shape of the book at round\ndistances. Furthermore, we argue that this clustering is mainly due to manual\ntraders who remained set to the old price resolution. Automatic traders easily\ntake price priority by submitting limit orders one tick ahead of clusters, as\nshown by the prominence of buy (sell) limit orders posted with rightmost digit\none (nine).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2013 17:09:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 May 2014 11:57:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 08:34:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lallouache", "Mehdi", ""], ["Abergel", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""]]}]
