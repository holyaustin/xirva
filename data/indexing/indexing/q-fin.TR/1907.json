More precisely, for a list of assets, they set\nprices at which they agree to buy and sell. Market makers face therefore an\ninteresting optimization problem: they need to choose bid and ask prices for\nmaking money while mitigating the risk associated with holding inventory in a\nvolatile market. Many market making models have been proposed in the academic\nliterature, most of them dealing with single-asset market making whereas market\nmakers are usually in charge of a long list of assets. The rare models tackling\nmulti-asset market making suffer however from the curse of dimensionality when\nit comes to the numerical approximation of the optimal quotes. The goal of this\npaper is to propose a dimensionality reduction technique to address multi-asset\nmarket making by using a factor model. Moreover, we generalize existing market\nmaking models by the addition of an important feature: the existence of\ndifferent transaction sizes and the possibility for the market makers in OTC\nmarkets to answer different prices to requests with different sizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 08:15:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 10:01:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 15:11:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bergault", "Philippe", ""], ["Gu\u00e9ant", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.06151", "submitter": "Mathieu Rosenbaum", "authors": "Aditi Dandapani, Paul Jusselin, Mathieu Rosenbaum", "title": "From quadratic Hawkes processes to super-Heston rough volatility models\n  with Zumbach effect", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using microscopic price models based on Hawkes processes, it has been shown\nthat under some no-arbitrage condition, the high degree of endogeneity of\nmarkets together with the phenomenon of metaorders splitting generate rough\nHeston-type volatility at the macroscopic scale.
