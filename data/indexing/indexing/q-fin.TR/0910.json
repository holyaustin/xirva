The proliferation of financial\ninstruments apparently provides more means for risk diversification, making the\nmarket more efficient and complete. In the simple market of interacting traders\ndiscussed here, the proliferation of financial instruments erodes systemic\nstability and it drives the market to a critical state characterized by large\nsusceptibility, strong fluctuations and enhanced correlations among risks. This\nsuggests that the hypothesis of APT may not be compatible with a stable market\ndynamics. In this perspective, market stability acquires the properties of a\ncommon good, which suggests that appropriate measures should be introduced in\nderivative markets, to preserve stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 12:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.1166", "submitter": "Sophie Laruelle", "authors": "Sophie Laruelle (PMA), Charles-Albert Lehalle, Gilles Pag\\`es (PMA)", "title": "Optimal split of orders across liquidity pools: a stochastic algorithm\n  approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evolutions of the trading landscape lead to the capability to exchange the\nsame financial instrument on different venues. Because of liquidity issues, the\ntrading firms split large orders across several trading destinations to\noptimize their execution. To solve this problem we devised two stochastic\nrecursive learning procedures which adjust the proportions of the order to be\nsent to the different venues, one based on an optimization principle, the other\non some reinforcement ideas. Both procedures are investigated from a\ntheoretical point of view: we prove a.s. convergence of the optimization\nalgorithm under some light ergodic (or \"averaging\") assumption on the input\ndata process. No Markov property is needed. When the inputs are i.i.d. we show\nthat the convergence rate is ruled by a Central Limit Theorem. Finally, the\nmutual performances of both algorithms are compared on simulated and real data\nwith respect to an \"oracle\" strategy devised by an \"insider\" who knows a priori\nthe executed quantities by every venues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2009 06:49:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 19:33:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2010 08:33:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Laruelle", "Sophie", "", "PMA"], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", "", "PMA"], ["Pag\u00e8s", "Gilles", "", "PMA"]]}, {"id": "0910.2909", "submitter": "Michael Christopher M\\\"unnix", "authors": "Michael C.
