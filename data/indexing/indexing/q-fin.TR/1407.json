In this paper, we study a\nstandard call auction problem where orders are submitted according to Poisson\nprocesses, with random prices distributed according to a general distribution,\nand may be cancelled at any time. We compute the analytical expressions of the\ndistributions of the traded volume, of the lower and upper bounds of the\nclearing prices, and of the price range of these possible clearing prices of\nthe call auction. Using results from the theory of order statistics and a\ntheorem on the limit of sequences of random variables with independent random\nindices, we derive the weak limits of all these distributions. In this setting,\ntraded volume and bounds of the clearing prices are found to be asymptotically\nnormal, while the clearing price range is asymptotically exponential.

The epsilon-drawdowns (resp. epsilon- drawups) generalise the notion\nof runs of negative (resp. positive) returns so as to capture the risks to\nwhich investors are arguably the most concerned with. Similarly to the\ndistribution of returns, we find that the distributions of epsilon-drawdowns\nand epsilon-drawups exhibit power law tails, albeit with exponents\nsignificantly larger than those for the return distributions. This paradoxical\nresult can be attributed to (i) the existence of significant transient\ndependence between returns and (ii) the presence of large outliers\n(dragon-kings) characterizing the extreme tail of the drawdown/drawup\ndistributions deviating from the power law. The study of the tail dependence\nbetween the sizes, speeds and durations of drawdown/drawup indicates a clear\nrelationship between size and speed but none between size and duration. This\nimplies that the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and are\ndominated by a few very large returns.
