Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic\ntrading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions\nchange; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect\nof our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting\nto predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect\nlarge volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a\nsuccessful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is\nexecuting, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a\ncentralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper\nwe demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the\ntrading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic\nsystem previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate\nthat DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader\nthat provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever\ndemonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or\nsuper-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world\nfinancial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN\ncould, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial\nmarket and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and\npossibly better.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2018 13:45:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Calvez", "Arthur le", ""], ["Cliff", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.03718", "submitter": "Hadrien De March", "authors": "Hadrien De March and Charles-Albert Lehalle", "title": "Optimal trading using signals", "comments": "21 pages, 5 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a mathematical framework to address the uncertainty\nemergingwhen the designer of a trading algorithm uses a threshold on a signal\nas a control.

An analysis\nof intraday volumes for the S&P500 constituent stocks illustrates that (i)\nvolume surprises, i.e., deviations from their respective forecasts, are\ncorrelated across stocks, and (ii) this correlation increases during the last\nfew hours of the trading session. These observations could be attributed, in\npart, to the prevalence of portfolio trading activity that is implicit in the\ngrowth of ETF, passive and systematic investment strategies; and, to the\nincreased trading intensity of such strategies towards the end of the trading\nsession, e.g., due to execution of mutual fund inflows/outflows that are\nbenchmarked to the closing price on each day. In this paper, we investigate the\nconsequences of such portfolio liquidity on price impact and portfolio\nexecution. We derive a linear cross-asset market impact from a stylized model\nthat explicitly captures the fact that a certain fraction of natural liquidity\nproviders only trade portfolios of stocks whenever they choose to execute. We\nfind that due to cross-impact and its intraday variation, it is optimal for a\nrisk-neutral, cost minimizing liquidator to execute a portfolio of orders in a\ncoupled manner, as opposed to a separable VWAP-like execution that is often\nassumed. The optimal schedule couples the execution of the various orders so as\nto be able to take advantage of increased portfolio liquidity towards the end\nof the day. A worst case analysis shows that the potential cost reduction from\nthis optimized execution schedule over the separable approach can be as high as\n6% for plausible model parameters. Finally, we discuss how to estimate\ncross-sectional price impact if one had a dataset of realized portfolio\ntransaction records that exploits the low-rank structure of its coefficient\nmatrix suggested by our analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:43:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Min", "Seungki", ""], ["Maglaras", "Costis", ""], ["Moallemi", "Ciamac C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06650", "submitter": "Ibrahim Ekren", "authors": "Erhan Bayraktar, Thomas Caye and Ibrahim Ekren", "title": "Asymptotics for Small Nonlinear Price Impact: a PDE Approach to the\n  Multidimensional Case", "comments": "to appear in Mathematical Finance", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP math.OC q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide an asymptotic expansion of the value function of a\nmultidimensional utility maximization problem from consumption with small\nnon-linear price impact.
