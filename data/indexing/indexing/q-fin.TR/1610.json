We emphasis the exposure to\nadverse selection, of paramount importance for limit orders. For a participant\nbuying using a limit order: if the price has chances to go down the probability\nto be filled is high but it is better to wait a little more before the trade to\nobtain a better price. In a third part we show how the added value of\nexploiting a knowledge on liquidity imbalance is eroded by latency: being able\nto predict future liquidity consuming flows is of less use if you have not\nenough time to cancel and reinsert your limit orders. There is thus a rational\nfor market makers to be as fast as possible as a protection to adverse\nselection. Thanks to our optimal framework we can measure the added value of\nlatency to limit orders placement.\n  To authors' knowledge this paper is the first to make the connection between\nempirical evidences, a stochastic framework for limit orders including adverse\nselection, and the cost of latency. Our work is a first stone to shed light on\nthe roles of latency and adverse selection for limit order placement, within an\naccurate stochastic control framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2016 11:14:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 20:32:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 18:52:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2018 11:22:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Mounjid", "Othmane", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.01149", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Qing Cai, Hai-Chuan Xu and Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Taylor's Law of temporal fluctuation scaling in stock illiquidity", "comments": "14 Latex pages including 4 figures and 5 tables", "journal-ref": "Fluctuation and Noise Letters 15 (4), 1650029 (2016)", "doi": "10.1142/S0219477516500292", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Taylor's law of temporal fluctuation scaling, variance $\\sim$ $a($mean$)^b$,\nis ubiquitous in natural and social sciences.
