Given the\nincreasing complexity and growing interaction across diverse bodies of\nknowledge it is becoming imperative to define a platform to properly support\ncollaborative research and track origin, accuracy and use of data. This paper\nstarts by defining a set of methods leveraging scientific principles and\nadvocating the importance of those methods in multidisciplinary, computer\nintensive fields like computational finance. The next part of this paper\ndefines a class of systems called scientific support systems, vis-a-vis usages\nin other research fields such as bioinformatics, physics and engineering. We\noutline a basic set of fundamental concepts, and list our goals and motivation\nfor leveraging such systems to enable large-scale investigation, \"crowd powered\nscience\", in economics. The core of this paper provides an outline of FRACTI in\nfive steps. First we present definitions related to scientific support systems\nintrinsic to finance and describe common characteristics of financial use\ncases. The second step concentrates on what can be exchanged through the\ndefinition of shareable entities called contributions. The third step is the\ndescription of a classification system for building blocks of the conceptual\nframework, called facets. The fourth step introduces the meta-model that will\nenable provenance tracking and representation of data fragments and simulation.\nFinally we describe intended cases of use to highlight main strengths of\nFRACTI: application of the scientific method for investigation in computational\nfinance, large-scale collaboration and simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Aug 2018 21:54:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Faleiro", "Jorge", ""], ["Tsang", "Edward", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.09677", "submitter": "Michael Benzaquen", "authors": "Lorenzo Dall'Amico, Antoine Fosset, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Michael\n  Benzaquen", "title": "How does latent liquidity get revealed in the limit order book?", "comments": "18 pages, 10 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/aaf10e", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Latent order book models have allowed for significant progress in our\nunderstanding of price formation in financial markets.
