We empirically investigate the price response of one stock to\nthe trades of other stocks. How large is the impact of one stock on others and\nvice versa? -- This impact of trades on the price change across stocks appears\nto be transient instead of permanent. Performing different averages, we\ndistinguish active and passive responses. The two average responses show\ndifferent characteristic dependences on the time lag. The passive response\nexhibits a shorter response period with sizeable volatilities, and the active\nresponse a longer period. We also study the response for a given stock with\nrespect to different sectors and to the whole market. Furthermore, we compare\nthe self-response with the various cross-responses. The correlation of the\ntrade signs is a short-memory process for a pair of stocks, but it turns into a\nlong-memory process when averaged over different pairs of stocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 09:51:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2016 17:13:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shanshan", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.03596", "submitter": "Ahmed Bel Hadj Ayed", "authors": "Ahmed Bel Hadj Ayed, Gr\\'egoire Loeper, Sofiene El Aoud, Fr\\'ed\\'eric\n  Abergel", "title": "Performance analysis of the optimal strategy under partial information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.MF q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The question addressed in this paper is the performance of the optimal\nstrategy, and the impact of partial information.

In order to explain this difference, we raised the hypothesis that this\nbehavior can be explained by the joint action of portfolios and non-synchronous\ntrading effects. To check the feasibility of the above assumption, we performed\na simulation of both effects, on two- and six-asset portfolios.

We\nformulate the problem in terms of a stochastic process with multiplicative\nnoise and a non-linear drift term that is determined by the specific functional\nform of carrying capacity.
