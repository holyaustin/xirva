A proper design of an optimal\nexecution strategy strongly depends on a careful modeling of market impact,\ni.e. how the price reacts to trades. In this paper we consider a recently\nintroduced market impact model (Bouchaud et al., 2004), which has the property\nof describing both the volume and the temporal dependence of price change due\nto trading. We show how this model can be used to describe price impact also in\naggregated trade time or in real time. We then solve analytically and calibrate\nwith real data the optimal execution problem both for risk neutral and for risk\naverse investors and we derive an efficient frontier of optimal execution. When\nwe include spread costs the problem must be solved numerically and we show that\nthe introduction of such costs regularizes the solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 17:11:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Busseti", "Enzo", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4804", "submitter": "David German", "authors": "David German and Henry Schellhorn", "title": "A No-Arbitrage Model of Liquidity in Financial Markets involving\n  Brownian Sheets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a dynamic market model where buyers and sellers submit limit\norders. If at a given moment in time, the buyer is unable to complete his\nentire order due to the shortage of sell orders at the required limit price,\nthe unmatched part of the order is recorded in the order book. Subsequently\nthese buy unmatched orders may be matched with new incoming sell orders. The\nresulting demand curve constitutes the sole input to our model. The clearing\nprice is then mechanically calculated using the market clearing condition. We\nuse a Brownian sheet to model the demand curve, and provide some theoretical\nassumptions under which such a model is justified.\n  Our main result is the proof that if there exists a unique equivalent\nmartingale measure for the clearing price, then under some mild assumptions\nthere is no arbitrage. We use the Ito- Wentzell formula to obtain that result,\nand also to characterize the dynamics of the demand curve and of the clearing\nprice in the equivalent measure. We find that the volatility of the clearing\nprice is (up to a stochastic factor) inversely proportional to the sum of buy\nand sell order flow density (evaluated at the clearing price), which confirms\nthe intuition that volatility is inversely proportional to volume. We also\ndemonstrate that our approach is implementable. We use real order book data and\nsimulate option prices under a particularly simple parameterization of our\nmodel.\n  The no-arbitrage conditions we obtain are applicable to a wide class of\nmodels, in the same way that the Heath-Jarrow-Morton conditions apply to a wide\nclass of interest rate models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 08:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["German", "David", ""], ["Schellhorn", "Henry", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4810", "submitter": "Mauricio Labadie", "authors": "Pietro Fodra and Mauricio Labadie", "title": "High-frequency market-making with inventory constraints and directional\n  bets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we extend the market-making models with inventory constraints\nof Avellaneda and Stoikov (\"High-frequency trading in a limit-order book\",\nQuantitative Finance Vol.8 No.3 2008) and Gueant, Lehalle and Fernandez-Tapia\n(\"Dealing with inventory risk\", Preprint 2011) to the case of a rather general\nclass of mid-price processes, under either exponential or linear PNL utility\nfunctions, and we add an inventory-risk-aversion parameter that penalises the\nmarker-maker if she finishes her day with a non-zero inventory. This general,\nnon-martingale framework allows a market-maker to make directional bets on\nmarket trends whilst keeping under control her inventory risk. In order to\nachieve this, the marker-maker places non-symmetric limit orders that favour\nmarket orders to hit her bid (resp. ask) quotes if she expects that prices will\ngo up (resp. down).\n  With this inventory-risk-aversion parameter, the market-maker has not only\ndirect control on her inventory risk but she also has indirect control on the\nmoments of her PNL distribution. Therefore, this parameter can be seen as a\nfine-tuning of the marker-maker's risk-reward profile.\n  In the case of a mean-reverting mid-price, we show numerically that the\ninventory-risk-aversion parameter gives the market-maker enough room to tailor\nher risk-reward profile, depending on her risk budgets in inventory and PNL\ndistribution (especially variance, skewness, kurtosis and VaR). For example,\nwhen compared to the martingale benchmark, a market can choose to either\nincrease her average PNL by more than 15% and carry a huge risk, on inventory\nand PNL, or either give up 5% of her benchmark PNL to increase her control on\ninventory and PNL, as well as increasing her Sharpe ratio by a factor bigger\nthan 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 08:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Fodra", "Pietro", ""], ["Labadie", "Mauricio", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.5252", "submitter": "Yiling Cheng", "authors": "Yiling Chen, David M Pennock", "title": "A Utility Framework for Bounded-Loss Market Makers", "comments": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2007-PG-49-56", "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a class of utility-based market makers that always accept orders\nat their risk-neutral prices.
