We\nprovide a mathematical framework within which to value derivatives under market\nimpact in a multi-player framework by introducing strategic interactions into\nthe Almgren & Chriss (2001) model. Specifically, we consider a financial market\nmodel with several strategically interacting players that hold European\ncontingent claims and whose trading decisions have an impact on the price\nevolution of the underlying. We establish existence and uniqueness of\nequilibrium results and show that the equilibrium dynamics can be characterized\nin terms of a coupled system of possibly non-linear PDEs. For the linear cost\nfunction used in Almgren & Chriss (2001), we obtain (semi) closed form\nsolutions for risk neutral or CARA investors. Finally, we indicate how spread\ncrossing costs discourage market manipulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Dec 2008 12:19:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Horst", "Ulrich", ""], ["Naujokat", "Felix", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0495", "submitter": "Bence T\\'oth", "authors": "Bence Toth, Janos Kertesz, J.

In the data we find large\nvariations in several microscopical measures, e.g., the volatility the bid-ask\nspread, the bid-ask imbalance, the number of queuing limit orders, the activity\n(number and volume) of limit orders placed and canceled, etc. The relaxation of\nthe quantities is generally very slow that can be described by a power law of\nexponent $\\approx0.4$. We introduce a numerical model in order to understand\nthe empirical results better. We find that with a zero intelligence deposition\nmodel of the order flow the empirical results can be reproduced qualitatively.\nThis suggests that the slow relaxations might not be results of agents'\nstrategic behaviour. Studying the difference between the exponents found\nempirically and numerically helps us to better identify the role of strategic\nbehaviour in the phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2009 15:04:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 20:32:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Toth", "Bence", ""], ["Kertesz", "Janos", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

The model consists of\nfirm agents with identical characteristic parameters and a bank agent. Dynamics\nof those agents is described by their balance sheets. Each firm tries to\nmaximize its expected profit with possible risks in market. Infinite growth of\na firm directed by the \"profit maximization\" principle is suppressed by a\nconcept of \"going concern\". Possibility of bankruptcy of firms is also\nintroduced by incorporating a retardation effect of information on firms'\ndecision. The firms, mutually interacting through the monopolistic bank, become\nheterogeneous in the course of temporal evolution.
