Our framework allows one to compute the average price\ntrajectory in the presence of a meta-order, that consistently generalizes\npreviously proposed propagator models. We account for the universally observed\nsquare-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is\ninterrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price\nmanipulation, and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic\nshort-term mean-reverting contribution). Our model suggests that prices can be\ndecomposed into a transient \"mechanical\" impact component and a permanent\n\"informational\" component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Nov 2014 19:19:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 08:24:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 16:00:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 12:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Donier", "Jonathan", ""], ["Bonart", "Julius", ""], ["Mastromatteo", "Iacopo", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.0217", "submitter": "Charles-Albert Lehalle", "authors": "Emmanuel Bacry, Adrian Iuga, Matthieu Lasnier, Charles-Albert Lehalle", "title": "Market impacts and the life cycle of investors orders", "comments": "30 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we use a database of around 400,000 metaorders issued by\ninvestors and electronically traded on European markets in 2010 in order to\nstudy market impact at different scales.\n  At the intraday scale we confirm a square root temporary impact in the daily\nparticipation, and we shed light on a duration factor in $1/T^{\\gamma}$ with\n$\\gamma \\simeq 0.25$. Including this factor in the fits reinforces the square\nroot shape of impact. We observe a power-law for the transient impact with an\nexponent between $0.5$ (for long metaorders) and $0.8$ (for shorter ones).\nMoreover we show that the market does not anticipate the size of the\nmeta-orders. The intraday decay seems to exhibit two regimes (though hard to\nidentify precisely): a \"slow\" regime right after the execution of the\nmeta-order followed by a faster one. At the daily time scale, we show price\nmoves after a metaorder can be split between realizations of expected returns\nthat have triggered the investing decision and an idiosynchratic impact that\nslowly decays to zero.\n  Moreover we propose a class of toy models based on Hawkes processes (the\nHawkes Impact Models, HIM) to illustrate our reasoning.\n  We show how the Impulsive-HIM model, despite its simplicity, embeds appealing\nfeatures like transience and decay of impact. The latter is parametrized by a\nparameter $C$ having a macroscopic interpretation: the ratio of contrarian\nreaction (i.e. impact decay) and of the \"herding\" reaction (i.e. impact\namplification).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 13:54:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 17:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bacry", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Iuga", "Adrian", ""], ["Lasnier", "Matthieu", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.2152", "submitter": "Fabrizio Lillo", "authors": "Elia Zarinelli, Michele Treccani, J.
