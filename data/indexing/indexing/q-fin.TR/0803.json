The price return is determined by the volume imbalance and number of\ntrades. The model successfully reproduces the power-law distributions of the\ntrading volume, number of trades and price return, and their relations.\nMoreover, the generated time series are long-range correlated. We demonstrate\nthat the results are rather robust, and do not depend on the particular form of\nthe trading probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2008 12:10:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2009 12:13:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 05:58:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2009 08:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "F.", ""], ["Zheng", "B.", ""], ["Chen", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.2198", "submitter": "Gordan Zitkovic", "authors": "Michail Anthropelos and Gordan Zitkovic", "title": "On Agents' Agreement and Partial-Equilibrium Pricing in Incomplete\n  Markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.OC math.PR q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider two risk-averse financial agents who negotiate the price of an\nilliquid indivisible contingent claim in an incomplete semimartingale market\nenvironment.

We also study the asymptotic case where the size of the claim is small\ncompared to the random endowments and we give a full characterization in this\ncase.
