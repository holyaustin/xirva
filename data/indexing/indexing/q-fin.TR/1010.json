This raises the important question of how\nsensitive such models might be to real-world effects that violate the\nassumptions. We show how the consequences of rational behavior caused by\nperverse incentives, as well as various irrational tendencies identified by\nbehavioral economists, can be systematically and consistently introduced into\nan agent-based model for a financial asset. This generates a class of models\nwhich, in the special case where such effects are absent, reduces to geometric\nBrownian motion --- the usual equilibrium pricing model. Thus we are able to\nnumerically perturb a widely-used equilibrium pricing model market and\ninvestigate its stability. The magnitude of such perturbations in real markets\ncan be estimated and the simulations imply that this is far outside the\nstability region of the equilibrium solution, which is no longer observed.\nIndeed the price fluctuations generated by endogenous dynamics, are in good\ngeneral agreement with the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity of actual\nasset prices. The methodology is presented within the context of a financial\nmarket. However, there are close links to concepts and theories from both\nmicro- and macro-economics including rational expectations, Soros' theory of\nreflexivity, and Minsky's theory of financial instability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 22:23:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lamba", "Harbir", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4226", "submitter": "Khalil Dayri", "authors": "Khalil al Dayri, Emmanuel Bacry, Jean-Francois Muzy", "title": "The nature of price returns during periods of high market activity", "comments": "17 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By studying all the trades and best bids/asks of ultra high frequency\nsnapshots recorded from the order books of a basket of 10 futures assets, we\nbring qualitative empirical evidence that the impact of a single trade depends\non the intertrade time lags. We find that when the trading rate becomes faster,\nthe return variance per trade or the impact, as measured by the price variation\nin the direction of the trade, strongly increases. We provide evidence that\nthese properties persist at coarser time scales. We also show that the spread\nvalue is an increasing function of the activity.
