We are specifically\ninterested in large trading orders that are executed incrementally, which we\ncall hidden orders. These are reconstructed based on information about market\nmember codes using data from the Spanish Stock Market and the London Stock\nExchange. We find that market impact is strongly concave, approximately\nincreasing as the square root of order size. Furthermore, as a given order is\nexecuted, the impact grows in time according to a power-law; after the order is\nfinished, it reverts to a level of about 0.5-0.7 of its value at its peak. We\nobserve that hidden orders are executed at a rate that more or less matches\ntrading in the overall market, except for small deviations at the beginning and\nend of the order.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2009 08:38:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Moro", "Esteban", ""], ["Vicente", "Javier", ""], ["Moyano", "Luis G.", ""], ["Gerig", "Austin", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

This suggests the\nuse of price thresholds to simulate agent behavior over much longer timescales\nthan are currently used in models of order-books.\n  We show that many phenomena, routinely ignored in efficient market theory,\ncan be systematically introduced into an otherwise efficient market, resulting\nin models that robustly replicate the most important stylized facts.\n  We then demonstrate a close link between such threshold models and queueing\ntheory, with large price changes corresponding to the busy periods of a\nsingle-server queue. The distribution of the busy periods is known to have\nexcess kurtosis and non-exponential decay under various assumptions on the\nqueue parameters. Such an approach may prove useful in the development of\nmathematical models for rapid deleveraging and panics in financial markets, and\nthe stress-testing of financial institutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 20:15:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 19:59:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lamba", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1555", "submitter": "Stefan Thurner", "authors": "Stefan Thurner, J.

All this changes when the funds are\nallowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than\ntheir wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives\ninvestors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As\nleverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered\nvolatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations\nof fat tails and clustered volatility depended on \"irrational behavior\", such\nas trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits\ncause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally\nsafer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage\nlimit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately\nthis sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is\nalready falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward\nprice movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at\nevery time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard\n(supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks\nbase leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of\nlow volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making\nthese extreme fluctuations even worse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2009 18:31:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jan 2010 14:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Thurner", "Stefan", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
