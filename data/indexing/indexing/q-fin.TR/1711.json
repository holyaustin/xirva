The goal of these models is to gain\nfurther insights into stylized facts of financial data. We derive the mean\nfield limit of the econophysical model by Cross, Grinfeld, Lamba and Seaman\n(Physica A, 354) and show that the kinetic limit is a good approximation of the\noriginal model. Our kinetic model is able to replicate some of the most\nprominent stylized facts, namely fat-tails of asset returns, uncorrelated stock\nprice returns and volatility clustering. Interestingly, psychological\nmisperceptions of investors can be accounted to be the origin of the appearance\nof stylized facts. The mesoscopic model allows us to study the model\nanalytically. We derive steady state solutions and entropy bounds of the\ndeterministic skeleton. These first analytical results already guide us to\nexplanations for the complex dynamics of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Nov 2017 15:53:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Trimborn", "Torsten", ""], ["Frank", "Martin", ""], ["Martin", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.03291", "submitter": "Torsten Trimborn", "authors": "Torsten Trimborn, Lorenzo Pareschi, Martin Frank", "title": "Portfolio Optimization and Model Predictive Control: A Kinetic Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.AP math.OC q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce a large system of interacting financial agents in\nwhich each agent is faced with the decision of how to allocate his capital\nbetween a risky stock or a risk-less bond. The investment decision of\ninvestors, derived through an optimization, drives the stock price. The model\nhas been inspired by the econophysical Levy-Levy-Solomon model (Economics\nLetters, 45). The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price\nand wealth distribution. We especially want to discover the causes for the\nappearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic approach\nsimilar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean\nfield limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is\nthat the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate\nand solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC\napproach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic\nconcepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.\nFurthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which\nconsiders a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our\nkinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a\nmesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law.\nFor the stock price distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in\nthe case of long-term investors or a power-law in the case of high-frequency\ntrader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail, which is a well\nknown characteristic of real financial data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Nov 2017 08:23:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:32:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 26 May 2018 23:00:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:08:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Trimborn", "Torsten", ""], ["Pareschi", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Frank", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.03534", "submitter": "Martin Magris", "authors": "Martin Magris, Jiyeong Kim, Esa Rasanen, Juho Kanniainen", "title": "Long-range Auto-correlations in Limit Order Book Markets: Inter- and\n  Cross-event Analysis", "comments": "Paper submitted for the IEEE SSCI 2017 conference.
