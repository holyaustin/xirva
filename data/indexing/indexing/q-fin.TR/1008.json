To this respect, Econophysics is offering models of markets as\ncomplex systems, such as the gas-like model, able to predict money\ndistributions observed in real economies. However, this model reveals some\ntechnical hitches to explain the power law (Pareto) distribution, observed in\nindividuals with high incomes. Here, non linear dynamics is introduced in the\ngas-like model. The results obtained demonstrate that a chaotic gas-like model\ncan reproduce the two money distributions observed in real economies\n(Exponential and Pareto). Moreover, it is able to control the transition\nbetween them. This may give some insight of the micro-level causes that\noriginate unfair distributions of money in a global society. Ultimately, the\nchaotic model makes obvious the inherent instability of asymmetric scenarios,\nwhere sinks of wealth appear in the market and doom it to complete inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Aug 2010 12:06:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pellicer-Lostao", "Carmen", ""], ["Lopez-Ruiz", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1846", "submitter": "Hector Zenil", "authors": "Hector Zenil and Jean-Paul Delahaye", "title": "An algorithmic information-theoretic approach to the behaviour of\n  financial markets", "comments": "Forthcoming in the Journal of Economic Surveys, special issue on\n  Nonlinearity, Complexity and Randomness. 25 pages. 7 figures. 9 tables.\n  Latest version fixes the glitches on the tables related to the distribution\n  from Turing machines (using 4 states as claimed, and not only 2 as before),\n  added 2 new references and other minor changes.

We do so by comparing the distributions of binary sequences\nfrom actual time series of financial markets and series built up from purely\nalgorithmic means. Our discussion is a starting point for a further\ninvestigation of the market as a rule-based system with an 'algorithmic'\ncomponent, despite its apparent randomness, and the use of the theory of\nalgorithmic probability with new tools that can be applied to the study of the\nmarket price phenomenon.
