In order to take advantage of the rapid, subtle\nmovement of assets in High Frequency Trading (HFT), an automatic algorithm to\nanalyze and detect patterns of price change based on transaction records must\nbe available. The multichannel, time-series representation of financial data\nnaturally suggests tensor-based learning algorithms. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effectiveness of two multilinear methods for the mid-price\nprediction problem against other existing methods. The experiments in a large\nscale dataset which contains more than 4 millions limit orders show that by\nutilizing tensor representation, multilinear models outperform vector-based\napproaches and other competing ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 07:48:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 05:14:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:33:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 11:03:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tran", "Dat Thanh", ""], ["Magris", "Martin", ""], ["Kanniainen", "Juho", ""], ["Gabbouj", "Moncef", ""], ["Iosifidis", "Alexandros", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.02015", "submitter": "Rene Carmona", "authors": "Rene Carmona and Kevin Webster", "title": "The microstructure of high frequency markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel approach to describing the microstructure of high\nfrequency trading using two key elements. First we introduce a new notion of\ninformed trader which we starkly contrast to current informed trader models. We\ndescribe the exact nature of the `superior information' high frequency traders\nhave access to, and how these agents differ from the more standard `insider\ntraders' described in past papers. This then leads to a model and an empirical\nanalysis of the data which strongly supports our claims. The second key element\nis a rigorous description of clearing conditions on a limit order book and how\nto derive correct formulas for such a market. From a theoretical point of view,\nthis allows the exact identification of two frictions in the market, one of\nwhich is intimately linked to our notion of `superior information'.\nEmpirically, we show that ignoring these frictions can misrepresent the wealth\nexchanged on the market by 50%. Finally, we showcase two applications of our\napproach: we measure the profits made by high frequency traders on NASDAQ and\nre-visit the standard Black - Scholes model to determine how trading frictions\nalter the delta-hedging strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 22:15:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Carmona", "Rene", ""], ["Webster", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05837", "submitter": "Jia-Wen Gu", "authors": "Qing-Qing Yang, Wai-Ki Ching, Jia-Wen Gu, Tak Kwong Wong", "title": "Optimal Liquidation Problems in a Randomly-Terminated Horizon", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study optimal liquidation problems in a randomly-terminated\nhorizon.

Instead, we consider the execution flow $I=dV/dt$ operator\nwith the \"impact from the future\" term providing information about\nnot--yet--executed trades. The \"impact from the future\" on $I$ can be directly\nestimated from the already--executed trades, the directional information on\nprice is then obtained from the experimentally observed fact that the $I$ and\n$p$ operators have the same eigenfunctions (the exact result in the dynamic\nimpact approximation $p=p(I)$). The condition for \"no information about the\nfuture\" is found and directional prediction quality is discussed.
