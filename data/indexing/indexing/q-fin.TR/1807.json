Here, we show how to do this accounting for the informational\nadvantage gained from assets within and outside the basket, as well as for the\npermanent price impact of market orders (MOs) from all market participants, and\nthe temporary impact that the agent's MOs have on prices. The execution problem\nis posed as an optimal stochastic control problem and we demonstrate that,\nunder some mild conditions, the value function admits a closed-form solution,\nand prove a verification theorem. Furthermore, we use data of five stocks\ntraded in the Nasdaq exchange to estimate the model parameters and use\nsimulations to illustrate the performance of the strategy. As an example, the\nagent liquidates a portfolio consisting of shares in Intel Corporation (INTC)\nand Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH). We show that including the\ninformation provided by three additional assets, FARO Technologies (FARO),\nNetApp (NTAP) and Oracle Corporation (ORCL), considerably improves the\nstrategy's performance; for the portfolio we execute, it outperforms the\nmulti-asset version of Almgren-Chriss by approximately 4 to 4.5 basis points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2018 02:13:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cartea", "Alvaro", ""], ["Gan", "Luhui", ""], ["Jaimungal", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.02787", "submitter": "Chien Yi Huang", "authors": "Chien Yi Huang", "title": "Financial Trading as a Game: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An automatic program that generates constant profit from the financial market\nis lucrative for every market practitioner. Recent advance in deep\nreinforcement learning provides a framework toward end-to-end training of such\ntrading agent. In this paper, we propose an Markov Decision Process (MDP) model\nsuitable for the financial trading task and solve it with the state-of-the-art\ndeep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) algorithm. We propose several modifications to\nthe existing learning algorithm to make it more suitable under the financial\ntrading setting, namely 1. We employ a substantially small replay memory (only\na few hundreds in size) compared to ones used in modern deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithms (often millions in size.) 2. We develop an action\naugmentation technique to mitigate the need for random exploration by providing\nextra feedback signals for all actions to the agent. This enables us to use\ngreedy policy over the course of learning and shows strong empirical\nperformance compared to more commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration. However,\nthis technique is specific to financial trading under a few market assumptions.\n3. We sample a longer sequence for recurrent neural network training. A side\nproduct of this mechanism is that we can now train the agent for every T steps.\nThis greatly reduces training time since the overall computation is down by a\nfactor of T. We combine all of the above into a complete online learning\nalgorithm and validate our approach on the spot foreign exchange market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jul 2018 09:17:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Chien Yi", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.03813", "submitter": "Alexander Schied", "authors": "Xiangge Luo and Alexander Schied", "title": "Nash equilibrium for risk-averse investors in a market impact game with\n  transient price impact", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1142/S238262662050001X", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a market impact game for $n$ risk-averse agents that are\ncompeting in a market model with linear transient price impact and additional\ntransaction costs.
