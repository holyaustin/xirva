We first attempt to utilize the so-called {\\it\nMadhavan-Richardson-Roomans model} (MRR for short) to simulate the stochastic\nprocess of the price-change in empirical data sets (say, EUR/JPY or USD/JPY\nexchange rates) in which the Bid-Ask spread fluctuates in time. We find that\nthe MRR theory apparently fails to simulate so much as the qualitative\nbehaviour ('non-monotonic' behaviour) of the response function $R(l)$ ($l$\ndenotes the difference of times at which the response function is evaluated)\ncalculated from the data. Especially, we confirm that the stochastic nature of\nthe Bid-Ask spread causes apparent deviations from a linear relationship\nbetween the $R(l)$ and the auto-correlation function $C(l)$, namely, $R(l)\n\\propto -C(l)$. To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having\nstochastic Bid-Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market\nhistory length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game\nshows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical\nevidence. We also reveal that the minority game modeling with the adaptive\n('annealed') look-up table reproduces the non-linear relationship $R(l) \\propto\n-f(C(l))$ ($f(x)$ stands for a non-linear function leading to\n'$\\lambda$-shapes') more effectively than the fixed (`quenched') look-up table\ndoes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Nov 2010 20:27:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 15:27:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ibuki", "Takero", ""], ["Inoue", "Jun-ichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1011", "submitter": "Iacopo Mastromatteo", "authors": "Iacopo Mastromatteo, Matteo Marsili and Patrick Zoi", "title": "Financial correlations at ultra-high frequency: theoretical models and\n  empirical estimation", "comments": "22 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, version to appear in EPJ B", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1140/epjb/e2011-10865-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A detailed analysis of correlation between stock returns at high frequency is\ncompared with simple models of random walks.

To this respect, Econophysics offers models of markets as complex\nsystems, that try to comprehend macro-, system-wide states of the economy from\nthe interaction of many agents at micro-level. One of these models is the\ngas-like model for trading markets. This tries to predict money distributions\nin closed economies and quite simply, obtains the ones observed in real\neconomies. However, it reveals technical hitches to explain the power law\ndistribution, observed in individuals with high incomes. In this work, non\nlinear dynamics is introduced in the gas-like model in way that an effort to\novercome these flaws. A particular chaotic dynamics is used to break the\npairing symmetry of agents $(i,j)\\Leftrightarrow(j,i)$. The results demonstrate\nthat a \"chaotic gas-like model\" can reproduce the Exponential and Power law\ndistributions observed in real economies. Moreover, it controls the transition\nbetween them. This may give some insight of the micro-level causes that\noriginate unfair distributions of money in a global society. Ultimately, the\nchaotic model makes obvious the inherent instability of asymmetric scenarios,\nwhere sinks of wealth appear and doom the market to extreme inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 18:15:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Pellicer-Lostao", "Carmen", ""], ["Lopez-Ruiz", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6284", "submitter": "Stefan Kerbl", "authors": "Stefan Kerbl", "title": "Regulatory Medicine Against Financial Market Instability: What Helps And\n  What Hurts?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Do we know if a short selling ban or a Tobin Tax result in more stable asset\nprices? Or do they in fact make things worse? Just like medicine regulatory\nmeasures in financial markets aim at improving an already complex system. And\njust like medicine these interventions can cause side effects which are even\nharder to assess when taking the interplay with other measures into account. In\nthis paper an agent based stock market model is built that tries to find\nanswers to the questions above. In a stepwise procedure regulatory measures are\nintroduced and their implications on market liquidity and stability examined.\nParticularly, the effects of (i) a ban of short selling (ii) a mandatory risk\nlimit, i.e. a Value-at-Risk limit, (iii) an introduction of a Tobin Tax, i.e.\ntransaction tax on trading, and (iv) any arbitrary combination of the measures\nare observed and discussed. The model is set up to incorporate non-linear\nfeedback effects of leverage and liquidity constraints leading to fire sales\nand escape dynamics. In its unregulated version the model outcome is capable of\nreproducing stylised facts of asset returns like fat tails and clustered\nvolatility. Introducing regulatory measures shows that only a mandatory risk\nlimit is beneficial from every perspective, while a short selling ban - though\nreducing volatility - increases tail risk. The contrary holds true for a Tobin\nTax: it reduces the occurrence of crashes but increases volatility.\nFurthermore, the interplay of measures is not negligible: measures block each\nother and a well chosen combination can mitigate unforeseen side effects.\nConcerning the Tobin Tax the findings indicate that an overdose can do severe\nharm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 16:34:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 07:23:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kerbl", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6402", "submitter": "Arseniy Kukanov", "authors": "Rama Cont and Arseniy Kukanov and Sasha Stoikov", "title": "The Price Impact of Order Book Events", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS (Winter 2014) 12 (1): 47-88", "doi": "10.1093/jjfinec/nbt003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the price impact of order book events - limit orders, market orders\nand cancelations - using the NYSE TAQ data for 50 U.S. stocks.
