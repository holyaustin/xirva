The system's principal features are the evolution\nof free-form strategies which do not rely on any prior models and the\nutilization of price series from multiple instruments as input data. This\nlatter feature constitutes an innovation with respect to previous works\ndocumented in literature. In this article we utilize Open, High, Low, Close bar\ndata at a 5 minutes frequency for the AUD.USD, EUR.USD, GBP.USD and USD.JPY\ncurrency pairs. We will test the implementation analyzing the in-sample and\nout-of-sample performance of strategies for trading the USD.JPY obtained across\nmultiple algorithm runs. We will also evaluate the differences between\nstrategies selected according to two different criteria: one relies on the\nfitness obtained on the training set only, the second one makes use of an\nadditional validation dataset. Strategy activity and trade accuracy are\nremarkably stable between in and out of sample results. From a profitability\naspect, the two criteria both result in strategies successful on out-of-sample\ndata but exhibiting different characteristics. The overall best performing\nout-of-sample strategy achieves a yearly return of 19%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Nov 2014 19:22:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Cirillo", "Simone", ""], ["Lloyd", "Stefan", ""], ["Nordin", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2215", "submitter": "Shingo Ichiki", "authors": "Shingo Ichiki and Katsuhiro Nishinari", "title": "Simple Stochastic Order-Book Model of Swarm Behavior in Continuous\n  Double Auction", "comments": "15 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2014.11.016", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, we present a simple stochastic order-book model for investors'\nswarm behaviors seen in the continuous double auction mechanism, which is\nemployed by major global exchanges. Our study shows a characteristic called\n\"fat tail\" is seen in the data obtained from our model that incorporates the\ninvestors' swarm behaviors. Our model captures two swarm behaviors: one is\ninvestors' behavior to follow a trend in the historical price movement, and\nanother is investors' behavior to send orders that contradict a trend in the\nhistorical price movement. In order to capture the features of influence by the\nswarm behaviors, from price data derived from our simulations using these\nmodels, we analyzed the price movement range, that is, how much the price is\nmoved when it is continuously moved in a single direction. Depending on the\ntype of swarm behavior, we saw a difference in the cumulative frequency\ndistribution of this price movement range. In particular, for the model of\ninvestors who followed a trend in the historical price movement, we saw the\npower law in the tail of the cumulative frequency distribution of this price\nmovement range. In addition, we analyzed the shape of the tail of the\ncumulative frequency distribution. The result demonstrated that one of the\nreasons the trend following of price occurs is that orders temporarily swarm on\nthe order book in accordance with past price trends.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 10:02:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ichiki", "Shingo", ""], ["Nishinari", "Katsuhiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.5062", "submitter": "Xin Li", "authors": "Tim Leung and Xin Li", "title": "Optimal Mean Reversion Trading with Transaction Costs and Stop-Loss Exit", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance, Vol. 18,\n  No. 3, 2015", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the industry practice of pairs trading, we study the optimal\ntiming strategies for trading a mean-reverting price spread. An optimal double\nstopping problem is formulated to analyze the timing to start and subsequently\nliquidate the position subject to transaction costs. Modeling the price spread\nby an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we apply a probabilistic methodology and\nrigorously derive the optimal price intervals for market entry and exit. As an\nextension, we incorporate a stop-loss constraint to limit the maximum loss. We\nshow that the entry region is characterized by a bounded price interval that\nlies strictly above the stop-loss level. As for the exit timing, a higher\nstop-loss level always implies a lower optimal take-profit level. Both\nanalytical and numerical results are provided to illustrate the dependence of\ntiming strategies on model parameters such as transaction cost and stop-loss\nlevel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 23:24:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 22:54:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2015 07:30:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Tim", ""], ["Li", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7502", "submitter": "Xuefeng Gao", "authors": "Xuefeng Gao and S.J.
