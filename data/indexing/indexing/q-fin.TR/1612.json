Buy (resp. sell) limit orders that arrive above (resp. below) the\ncurrent ask (resp. bid) price are converted into market orders. There is no\ncancellation of limit orders. This model has independently been reinvented by\nseveral authors, including Stigler in 1964 and Luckock in 2003, who was able to\ncalculate the equilibrium distribution of the bid and ask prices. We extend the\nmodel by introducing market makers that simultaneously place both a buy and\nsell limit order at the current bid and ask price. We show how the introduction\nof market makers reduces the spread, which in the original model is\nunrealistically large. In particular, we are able to calculate the exact rate\nat which market makers need to place orders in order to close the spread\ncompletely. If this rate is exceeded, we show that the price settles at a\nrandom level that in general does not correspond the Walrasian equilibrium\nprice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Dec 2016 16:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2018 13:56:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Per\u017eina", "V\u00edt", ""], ["Swart", "Jan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.05855", "submitter": "Jiang Wu", "authors": "Jiang Wu, Ricardas Zitikis", "title": "Should we opt for the Black Friday discounted price or wait until the\n  Boxing Day?", "comments": "16 pages;5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive an optimal strategy for minimizing the expected loss in the\ntwo-period economy when a pivotal decision needs to be made during the first\ntime period and cannot be subsequently reversed.

From the condition of absence of dynamical arbitrage we derive\ntheoretical limits for the size and form of cross-impact that can be directly\nverified on data. For bounded decay kernels we find that cross-impact must be\nan odd and linear function of trading intensity and cross-impact from asset $i$\nto asset $j$ must be equal to the one from $j$ to $i$. To test these\nconstraints we estimate cross-impact among sovereign bonds traded on the\nelectronic platform MOT.

Assets are\ntraded in either an exchange or a dark pool, with the dark pool offering better\nprices but lower execution rates. Informed traders receive noisy and\nheterogeneous signals about an asset's fundamental. We find that informed\ntraders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a\nsorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges,\ntraders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak\nsignals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on\nprice discovery. That is, when information precision is high (information risk\nis low), the majority of informed traders trade in the exchange hence adding a\ndark pool enhances price discovery, whereas when information precision is low\n(information risk is high), the majority of the informed traders trade in the\ndark pool hence adding a dark pool impairs price discovery. The paper\nreconciles the conflicting empirical evidence and produces novel empirical\npredictions. The paper also provides regulatory suggestions with dark pools on\ncurrent equity markets and in emerging markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2016 03:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ye", "Linlin", ""]]}]
