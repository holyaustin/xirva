Although the models that explain the\nvarious states of financial markets offer substantial evidences from the fields\nof finance, mathematics, and even physics to explain states observed in the\nreal financial markets, previous theories that attempt to fully explain the\ncomplexities of financial markets have been inadequate. In this study, we\npropose an artificial double auction market as an agent-based model approach to\nstudy the origin of complex states in the financial markets, characterizing\nimportant parameters with an investment strategy that can cover the dynamics of\nthe financial market. The investment strategy of chartist traders after market\ninformation arrives should reduce market stability originating in the price\nfluctuations of risky assets. However, fundamentalist traders strategically\nsubmit orders with a fundamental value and, thereby stabilize the market. We\nconstruct a continuous double auction market and find that the market is\ncontrolled by a fraction of chartists, P_{c}. We show that mimicking real\nfinancial markets state, which emerges in real financial systems, is given\nbetween approximately P_{c} = 0.40 and P_{c} = 0.85, but that mimicking the\nefficient market hypothesis state can be generated in a range of less than\nP_{c} = 0.40. In particular, we observe that the mimicking market collapse\nstate created in a value greater than P_{c} = 0.85, in which a liquidity\nshortage occurs, and the phase transition behavior is P_{c} = 0.85.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 12:10:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Yim", "Kyubin", ""], ["Oh", "Gabjin", ""], ["Kim", "Seunghwan", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.05475", "submitter": "Bruno Bouchard", "authors": "B.

In the strict orthodoxy of the efficient market theory, crashes must\nbe due to sudden changes of the fundamental valuation of assets. However,\ndetailed empirical studies suggest that large price jumps cannot be explained\nby news and are the result of endogenous feedback loops. Although plausible, a\nclear-cut empirical evidence for such a scenario is still lacking. Here we show\nhow crashes are conditioned by the market liquidity, for which we propose a new\nmeasure inspired by recent theories of market impact and based on readily\navailable, public information. Our results open the possibility of a dynamical\nevaluation of liquidity risk and early warning signs of market instabilities,\nand could lead to a quantitative description of the mechanisms leading to\nmarket crashes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 16:17:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 14:17:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Donier", "Jonathan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}]
