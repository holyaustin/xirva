The optimal\nexecution problem is solved explicitly in this context, and the closed-formula\noptimal strategy describes in particular how one should react to the orders of\nother traders. This result enables us to discuss the viability of the market.\nIt is shown that Poissonian arrivals of orders lead to quite robust Price\nManipulation Strategies in the sense of Huberman and Stanzl. Instead, a\nparticular set of conditions on the Hawkes model balances the self-excitation\nof the order flow with the resilience of the price, excludes Price Manipulation\nStrategies and gives some market stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 18:13:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 12:50:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Alfonsi", "Aur\u00e9lien", ""], ["Blanc", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.1051", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Jian Zhou (ECUST), Gao-Feng Gu (ECUST), Zhi-Qiang Jiang (ECUST), Xiong\n  Xiong (TJU), Wei Chen (SZSE), Wei Zhang (TJU), Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Computational experiments successfully predict the emergence of\n  autocorrelations in ultra-high-frequency stock returns", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computational Economics 50 (4), 579-594 (2017)", "doi": "10.1007/s10614-016-9612-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR physics.soc-ph q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social and economic systems are complex adaptive systems, in which\nheterogenous agents interact and evolve in a self-organized manner, and\nmacroscopic laws emerge from microscopic properties. To understand the\nbehaviors of complex systems, computational experiments based on physical and\nmathematical models provide a useful tools. Here, we perform computational\nexperiments using a phenomenological order-driven model called the modified\nMike-Farmer (MMF) to predict the impacts of order flows on the autocorrelations\nin ultra-high-frequency returns, quantified by Hurst index $H_r$. Three\npossible determinants embedded in the MMF model are investigated, including the\nHurst index $H_s$ of order directions, the Hurst index $H_x$ and the power-law\ntail index $\\alpha_x$ of the relative prices of placed orders. The\ncomputational experiments predict that $H_r$ is negatively correlated with\n$\\alpha_x$ and $H_x$ and positively correlated with $H_s$. In addition, the\nvalues of $\\alpha_x$ and $H_x$ have negligible impacts on $H_r$, whereas $H_s$\nexhibits a dominating impact on $H_r$. The predictions of the MMF model on the\ndependence of $H_r$ upon $H_s$ and $H_x$ are verified by the empirical results\nobtained from the order flow data of 43 Chinese stocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 07:47:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Feb 2018 08:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Jian", "", "ECUST"], ["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Jiang", "Zhi-Qiang", "", "ECUST"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}, {"id": "1404.1052", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Hai-Chuan Xu (TJU), Wei Zhang (TJU), Xiong Xiong (TJU), Wei-Xing Zhou\n  (ECUST)", "title": "An agent-based computational model for China's stock market and stock\n  index futures market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mathematical Problems in Engineering 2014, 563912 (2014)", "doi": "10.1155/2014/563912", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study presents an agent-based computational cross-market model for\nChinese equity market structure, which includes both stocks and CSI 300 index\nfutures.
