We\nperform an empirical analysis of a recent, high-quality data set from a large\nelectronic trading platform that utilizes QCLOBs to facilitate trade. We find\nmany significant differences between our results and those widely reported for\nother LOBs. We also uncover a remarkable empirical universality: although the\ndistributions describing order flow and market state vary considerably across\ndays, a simple, linear rescaling causes them to collapse onto a single curve.\nMotivated by this finding, we propose a semi-parametric model of order flow and\nmarket state in a QCLOB on a single trading day. Our model provides similar\nperformance to that of parametric curve-fitting techniques, while being simpler\nto compute and faster to implement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 22:43:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 12:35:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gould", "Martin D.", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Howison", "Sam D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.01125", "submitter": "Rudi Schaefer", "authors": "Frederik Meudt, Thilo A.

It is thus interesting to check if the resulting\nstylized facts of a model with equilibrium pricing change, remain the same or,\nmore generally, are compatible with the order book environment. We tackle this\nissue in the framework of a case study by embedding the\nBornholdt-Kaizoji-Fujiwara spin model into the order book dynamics. To this\nend, we use a recently developed agent based model that realistically\nincorporates the order book. We find realistic stylized facts.

Throughout the entire\nperiod, the main concern is inventory risk, which increases as the number of\nheld positions becomes critically small or large. The dark pool can control its\ninventory by choosing the size of the commission for each transaction, so to\nencourage, e.g., buy orders instead of sell orders. Furthermore, it can submit\nlit-pool limit orders, of which execution is uncertain, and market orders,\nwhich are expensive. In either case, the dark pool risks an information\nleakage, which we model via a fixed penalty for trading in the lit pool. We\nsolve a double-obstacle impulse-control problem associated with the optimal\nmanagement of the inventory, and we show that the value function is the unique\nviscosity solution of the associated system of quasi variational inequalities.\nWe explore various numerical examples of the proposed model, including one that\nadmits a semi-explicit solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2015 11:14:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Crisafi", "M.

The optimal strategy obtained consists of three components: (i)\nthe initial large trade; (ii) the unscheduled small trades during the period;\n(iii) the terminal large trade. The size and timing of the trade is governed by\nthe tolerance for market impact depending on the state at each time step, and\nhence the strategy behaves dynamically.
