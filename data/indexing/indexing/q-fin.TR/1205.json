The high-frequency trader has the choice to trade via market\norders or limit orders, which are represented respectively by impulse controls\nand regular controls. We model and discuss the consequences of the two main\nfeatures of this particular microstructure: first, the limit orders sent by the\nhigh frequency trader are only partially executed, and therefore she has no\ncontrol on the executed quantity. For this purpose, cumulative executed volumes\nare modelled by compound Poisson processes. Second, the high frequency trader\nfaces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of brutal variations in her\ninventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of\noptimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic\ncontrol and dynamic programming methods, which lead to a characterization of\nthe value function in terms of an integro quasi-variational inequality. We then\nprovide the associated numerical resolution procedure, and convergence of this\ncomputational scheme is proved. Next, we examine several situations where we\ncan on one hand simplify the numerical procedure by reducing the number of\nstate variables, and on the other hand focus on specific cases of practical\ninterest. We examine both a market making problem and a best execution problem\nin the case where the mid-price process is a martingale. We also detail a high\nfrequency trading strategy in the case where a (predictive) directional\ninformation on the mid-price is available. Each of the resulting strategies are\nillustrated by numerical tests.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2012 14:57:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Guilbaud", "Fabien", "", "LPMA"], ["Pham", "Huy\u00ean", "", "LPMA, CREST"]]}, {"id": "1205.3482", "submitter": "Mauricio Labadie", "authors": "Mauricio Labadie and Charles-Albert Lehalle", "title": "Optimal starting times, stopping times and risk measures for algorithmic\n  trading: Target Close and Implementation Shortfall", "comments": "27 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Investment Strategies, Volume 3, Issue 2, 2014", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive explicit recursive formulas for Target Close (TC) and\nImplementation Shortfall (IS) in the Almgren-Chriss framework.

We also study\nan alternative set of risk measures for the optimisation of algorithmic trading\ncurves. We assume a self-similar process (e.g. Levy process, fractional\nBrownian motion or fractal process) and define a new risk measure, the\np-variation, which reduces to the variance if the process is a brownian motion.\nWe deduce the explicit formula for the TC and IS algorithms under a\nself-similar process. We show that there is an equivalence between selfsimilar\nmodels and a family of risk measures called p-variations: assuming a\nself-similar process and calibrating empirically the parameter p for the\np-variation yields the same result as assuming a Brownian motion and using the\np-variation as risk measure instead of the variance. We also show that p can be\nseen as a measure of the aggressiveness: p increases if and only if the TC\nalgorithm starts later and executes faster. Finally, we show how the parameter\np of the p-variation can be implied from the optimal starting time of TC, and\nthat under this framework p can be viewed as a measure of the joint impact of\nmarket impact (i.e. liquidity) and volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2012 19:39:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2012 10:38:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 16:31:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2013 08:05:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 20:26:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 20:21:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Labadie", "Mauricio", ""], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4008", "submitter": "Alexander Schied", "authors": "Florian Kl\\\"ock, Alexander Schied, Yuemeng Sun", "title": "Price manipulation in a market impact model with dark pool", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For a market impact model, price manipulation and related notions play a role\nthat is similar to the role of arbitrage in a derivatives pricing model.

To this end, we\nfocus on a class of dark-pool models whose market impact at the exchange is\ndescribed by an Almgren--Chriss model. Conditions for the absence of price\nmanipulation for all Almgren--Chriss models include the absence of temporary\ncross-venue impact, the presence of full permanent cross-venue impact, and the\nadditional penalization of orders executed in the dark pool.
