Among them are those directly\nconnected with their activity on markets but one cannot neglect other aspects\nthat influence human decisions and their performance as investors.\nDistinguishing all subgames is usually beyond hope and resource consuming. In\nthis paper we study how investors facing many different games, gather\ninformation and form their decision despite being unaware of the complete\nstructure of the game. To this end we apply reinforcement learning methods to\nthe Information Theory Model of Markets (ITMM). Following Mengel, we can try to\ndistinguish a class $\\Gamma$ of games and possible actions (strategies)\n$a^{i}_{m_{i}}$ for $i-$th agent. Any agent divides the whole class of games\ninto analogy subclasses she/he thinks are analogous and therefore adopts the\nsame strategy for a given subclass. The criteria for partitioning are based on\nprofit and costs analysis. The analogy classes and strategies are updated at\nvarious stages through the process of learning. This line of research can be\ncontinued in various directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2007 07:53:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Piotrowski", "Edward W.", ""], ["Sladkowski", "Jan", ""], ["Szczypinska", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.1439", "submitter": "Vygintas Gontis", "authors": "V.
