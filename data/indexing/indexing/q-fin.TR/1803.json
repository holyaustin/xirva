Here, we address an algorithmic trading problem with collections of\nheterogeneous agents who aim to perform optimal execution or statistical\narbitrage, where all agents filter the latent states of the world, and their\ntrading actions have permanent and temporary price impact. This leads to a\nlarge stochastic game with heterogeneous agents. We solve the stochastic game\nby investigating its mean-field game (MFG) limit, with sub-populations of\nheterogeneous agents, and, using a convex analysis approach, we show that the\nsolution is characterized by a vector-valued forward-backward stochastic\ndifferential equation (FBSDE). We demonstrate that the FBSDE admits a unique\nsolution, obtain it in closed-form, and characterize the optimal behaviour of\nthe agents in the MFG equilibrium. Moreover, we prove the MFG equilibrium\nprovides an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite player game. We conclude\nby illustrating the behaviour of agents using the optimal MFG strategy through\nsimulated examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2018 02:38:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 31 Mar 2019 13:34:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Casgrain", "Philippe", ""], ["Jaimungal", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.04892", "submitter": "Ludovic Tangpi", "authors": "Mathias Pohl and Alexander Ristig and Walter Schachermayer and Ludovic\n  Tangpi", "title": "Theoretical and empirical analysis of trading activity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the structure of financial markets deals with suitably\ndetermining the functional relation between financial variables. In this\nrespect, important variables are the trading activity, defined here as the\nnumber of trades $N$, the traded volume $V$, the asset price $P$, the squared\nvolatility $\\sigma^2$, the bid-ask spread $S$ and the cost of trading $C$.\nDifferent reasonings result in simple proportionality relations (\"scaling\nlaws\") between these variables. A basic proportionality is established between\nthe trading activity and the squared volatility, i.e., $N \\sim \\sigma^2$. More\nsophisticated relations are the so called 3/2-law $N^{3/2} \\sim \\sigma P V /C$\nand the intriguing scaling $N \\sim (\\sigma P/S)^2$. We prove that these\n\"scaling laws\" are the only possible relations for considered sets of variables\nby means of a well-known argument from physics: dimensional analysis. Moreover,\nwe provide empirical evidence based on data from the NASDAQ stock exchange\nshowing that the sophisticated relations hold with a certain degree of\nuniversality. Finally, we discuss the time scaling of the volatility $\\sigma$,\nwhich turns out to be more subtle than one might naively expect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Mar 2018 15:45:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Mar 2018 08:10:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:54:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Pohl", "Mathias", ""], ["Ristig", "Alexander", ""], ["Schachermayer", "Walter", ""], ["Tangpi", "Ludovic", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.04894", "submitter": "Giuseppe Buccheri", "authors": "Giuseppe Buccheri, Giacomo Bormetti, Fulvio Corsi and Fabrizio Lillo", "title": "A Score-Driven Conditional Correlation Model for Noisy and Asynchronous\n  Data: an Application to High-Frequency Covariance Dynamics", "comments": "30 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The analysis of the intraday dynamics of correlations among high-frequency\nreturns is challenging due to the presence of asynchronous trading and market\nmicrostructure noise. Both effects may lead to significant data reduction and\nmay severely underestimate correlations if traditional methods for\nlow-frequency data are employed. We propose to model intraday log-prices\nthrough a multivariate local-level model with score-driven covariance matrices\nand to treat asynchronicity as a missing value problem. The main advantages of\nthis approach are: (i) all available data are used when filtering correlations,\n(ii) market microstructure noise is taken into account, (iii) estimation is\nperformed through standard maximum likelihood methods. Our empirical analysis,\nperformed on 1-second NYSE data, shows that opening hours are dominated by\nidiosyncratic risk and that a market factor progressively emerges in the second\npart of the day.

We assess the model by testing its\nout-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of\nprice and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The\nuniversal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable\nout-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from\ndifferent sectors.

Standard data normalizations based on volatility, price level or\naverage spread, or partitioning the training data into sectors or categories\nsuch as large/small tick stocks, do not improve training results.

Firstly, from the viewpoint of dynamics, we study the\nexistence of the cooling-off effect by following the dynamical evolution of\nsome financial variables over a period of time before the stock price hits its\nlimit. Secondly, from the probability perspective, we investigate, with the\nlogit model, the existence of the cooling-off effect through analyzing the\nhigh-frequency data of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock\nExchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 and inspecting the\ntrading period from the opening phase prior to the moment that the stock price\nhits its limits. A comparison is made of the properties between up-limit hits\nand down-limit hits, and the possible difference will also be compared between\nbullish and bearish market state by dividing the whole period into three\nalternating bullish periods and three bearish periods. We find that the\ncooling-off effect emerges for both up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the\ncooling-off effect of the down-limit hits is stronger than that of the up-limit\nhits. The difference of the cooling-off effect between bullish period and\nbearish period is quite modest. Moreover, we examine the sub-optimal orders\neffect, and infer that the professional individual investors and institutional\ninvestors play a positive role in the cooling-off effects. All these findings\nindicate that the price limit trading rule exerts a positive effect on\nmaintaining the stability of the Chinese stock markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2018 05:40:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wan", "Yu-Lei", "", "ECUST"], ["Wang", "Gang-Jin", "", "HNU"], ["Jiang", "Zhi-Qiang", "", "ECUST"], ["Xie", "Wen-Jie", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}]
