A Wiener-Hopf argument allows one to prove that this system (in\nwhich the kernel matrix is the unknown) possesses a unique causal solution and\nconsequently that the second-order properties fully characterize a Hawkes\nprocess. The numerical inversion of this system of integral equations allows us\nto propose a fast and efficient method, which main principles were initially\nsketched in [Bacry and Muzy, 2013], to perform a non-parametric estimation of\nthe Hawkes kernel matrix. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of this\nnon-parametric estimation procedure in the general framework of marked Hawkes\nprocesses. We describe precisely this procedure step by step. We discuss the\nestimation error and explain how the values for the main parameters should be\nchosen. Various numerical examples are given in order to illustrate the broad\npossibilities of this estimation procedure ranging from 1-dimensional\n(power-law or non positive kernels) up to 3-dimensional (circular dependence)\nprocesses. A comparison to other non-parametric estimation procedures is made.\nApplications to high frequency trading events in financial markets and to\nearthquakes occurrence dynamics are finally considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Jan 2014 15:28:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bacry", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Muzy", "Jean-Francois", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.1888", "submitter": "Li-Xin Wang", "authors": "Li-Xin Wang", "title": "Dynamical Models of Stock Prices Based on Technical Trading Rules Part\n  I: The Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 787-801, 2015", "doi": "10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2327994", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.CE q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we use fuzzy systems theory to convert the technical trading\nrules commonly used by stock practitioners into excess demand functions which\nare then used to drive the price dynamics.
