The liquid pairs in the\ntriplet are chosen so that one of the pairs is redundant. The broker is\nrisk-neutral and accounts for model ambiguity in the FX rates to make her\nstrategy robust to model misspecification. When the broker is ambiguity neutral\n(averse) the trading strategy in each pair is independent (dependent) of the\ninventory in the other two pairs in the triplet. We employ simulations to\nillustrate how the robust strategies perform. For a range of ambiguity aversion\nparameters, we find the mean Profit and Loss (P&L) of the strategy increases\nand the standard deviation of the P&L decreases as ambiguity aversion\nincreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 22:35:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cartea", "\u00c1lvaro", ""], ["Jaimungal", "Sebastian", ""], ["Jia", "Tianyi", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.12099", "submitter": "Chung-Han Hsieh", "authors": "Chung-Han Hsieh", "title": "Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Frequency-Based Kelly Optimal\n  Portfolio", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Control Systems Letter", "journal-ref": "IEEE Control Systems Letter, vol 5, no 1, pp. 349-354, 2021", "doi": "10.1109/LCSYS.2020.3002214", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.SY eess.SY q-fin.MF q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a discrete-time portfolio with $m \\geq 2$ assets\noptimization problem which includes the rebalancing~frequency as an additional\nparameter in the maximization. The so-called Kelly Criterion is used as the\nperformance metric; i.e., maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of a\ntrader's account, and the portfolio obtained is called the frequency-based\nKelly optimal portfolio. The focal point of this paper is to extend upon the\nresults of our previous work to obtain various optimality characterizations on\nthe portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion in our\nfrequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these\nconditions, we then show several new optimality characterizations such as\nexpected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality, and a result\nwhich we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem. That is, we prove that the\n$i$th asset is dominant in the portfolio if and only if the Kelly optimal\nportfolio consists of that asset only. The word \"extended\" on the theorem comes\nfrom the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was proved in our\nprevious work. Hence, in this paper, we improve it to involve a proof of the\nnecessity part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy\nconsideration) is also studied in detail in our frequency-based trading\nframework. Finally, to bridge the theory and practice, we propose a simple\ntrading algorithm using the notion called dominant asset condition to decide\nwhen should one triggers a trade. The corresponding trading performance using\nhistorical price data is reported as supporting evidence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Apr 2020 09:39:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Chung-Han", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.12392", "submitter": "Thomas Krabichler", "authors": "Thomas Krabichler, Josef Teichmann", "title": "The Jarrow & Turnbull setting revisited", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a financial market with zero-coupon bonds that are exposed to\ncredit and liquidity risk.
