We formulate our problem as a stochastic control problem with\nthe objective of maximizing the expected discounted utility of the dividend\nstream until bankruptcy, in which risk preferences are embodied by power\nutility. We semi-explicitly solve the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nvariational inequality, which is a nonlinear free-boundary problem. The optimal\n(excess) dividend rate $c^*_t$ - as a function of the company's current surplus\n$X_t$ and its historical running maximum of the (excess) dividend rate $z_t$ -\nis as follows: There are constants $0 < w_{\\alpha} < w_0 < w^*$ such that (1)\nfor $0 < X_t \\le w_{\\alpha} z_t$, it is optimal to pay dividends at the lowest\nrate $\\alpha z_t$, (2) for $w_{\\alpha} z_t < X_t < w_0 z_t$, it is optimal to\ndistribute dividends at an intermediate rate $c^*_t \\in (\\alpha z_t, z_t)$, (3)\nfor $w_0 z_t < X_t < w^* z_t$, it is optimal to distribute dividends at the\nhistorical peak rate $z_t$, (4) for $X_t > w^* z_t$, it is optimal to increase\nthe dividend rate above $z_t$, and (5) it is optimal to increase $z_t$ via\nsingular control as needed to keep $X_t \\le w^* z_t$. Because, the maximum\n(excess) dividend rate will eventually be proportional to the running maximum\nof the surplus, \"mountains will have to move\" before we increase the dividend\nrate beyond its historical maximum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2018 23:22:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 16:09:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2019 17:57:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Angoshtari", "Bahman", ""], ["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.07667", "submitter": "Marta Leniec", "authors": "Ola Hammarlid, Marta Leniec", "title": "Credit Value Adjustment for Counterparties with Illiquid CDS", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Credit Value Adjustment (CVA) is the difference between the value of the\ndefault-free and credit-risky derivative portfolio, which can be regarded as\nthe cost of the credit hedge.

Thus, the\ndynamic mean-risk problem does satisfy a Bellman's principle, but a more\ngeneral one, that seems more appropriate for a vector optimization problem: a\nset-valued Bellman's principle.
