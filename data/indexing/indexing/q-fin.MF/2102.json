Under this model, we derive the closed-form no-arbitrage prices for the\nfutures contracts. Applying a utility maximization approach, we solve for the\noptimal trading strategies under different portfolio configurations by\nexamining the associated system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The\noptimal strategies depend on not only the parameters of the underlying asset\nprice process but also the risk premia embedded in the futures prices.\nNumerical examples are provided to illustrate the investor's optimal positions\nand optimal wealth over time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:31:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Tim", ""], ["Zhou", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13574", "submitter": "Lars Niemann", "authors": "Lars Niemann and Thorsten Schmidt", "title": "A conditional version of the second fundamental theorem of asset pricing\n  in discrete time", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The second fundamental theorem of asset pricing characterizes completeness of\na financial market by uniqueness of prices of financial claims.
