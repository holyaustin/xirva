The setup is\nstrongly related to a DC pension plan where additionally (individual)\nconsumption is taken into account. The consumption rate is subject to a\ntime-varying minimum level and terminal wealth is subject to a terminal floor.\nMoreover, the preference between consumption and terminal wealth as well as the\nintertemporal coefficient of risk aversion are time-varying and therefore\ndepend on the age of the considered pension cohort. The optimal consumption and\ninvestment policies are calculated in the case of a Black-Scholes financial\nmarket framework and hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility\nfunctions. We generalize Ye (2008) (2008 American Control Conference, 356-362)\nby adding an age-dependent coefficient of risk aversion and extend Steffensen\n(2011) (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 35(5), 659-667), Hentschel\n(2016) (Doctoral dissertation, Ulm University) and Aase (2017) (Stochastics,\n89(1), 115-141) by considering consumption in combination with terminal wealth\nand allowing for consumption and terminal wealth floors via an application of\nHARA utility functions. A case study on fitting several models to realistic,\ntime-dependent life-cycle consumption and relative investment profiles shows\nthat only our extended model with time-varying preference parameters provides\nsufficient flexibility for an adequate fit.

The idea here is that real-world networks have to pay\nthe cost of growth. We investigate the growth and trade-off between value and\ncost in the networks with cost and preferential attachment together. Since the\npreferential attachment in the BA model does not consider any stop against the\ninfinite growth of networks, we introduce a modified version of preferential\nattachment of the BA model. This idea makes sense because the growth of real\nnetworks may be finite. In the present study, by combining preferential\nattachment in the science of temporal networks (interval graphs), and, the\nfirst-order differential equations of value and cost of making links, the\nfuture equilibrium of an evolving network is illustrated. During the process of\nachieving a winning position, the variables against growth such as the\ncompetition cost, besides the internally structural cost may emerge.
