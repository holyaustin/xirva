Rough stochastic\nvolatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral,\nQuantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data\nbased on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a\nfractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over\nreasonable timescales. Both time series data of asset prices and option derived\nprice data indicate that $H$ often takes values close to $0.1$ or smaller, i.e.\nrougher than Brownian Motion. This change greatly improves the fit to time\nseries data of underlying asset prices as well as to option prices while\nmaintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving\nfractional Brownian motion in the rough Bergomi model poses severe challenges\nfor theoretical and numerical analyses as well as for computational practice.\nWhile the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the\nrough Bergomi model, its strong rate of convergence is only $H$. For a\nsimplified rough Bergomi model, we prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak\nconvergence of the Euler method and, surprisingly, in the case of quadratic\npayoff functions we obtain rate one. Indeed, the problem of weak convergence\nfor rough Bergomi is very subtle; we provide examples demonstrating that the\nrate of convergence for payoff functions well approximated by second-order\npolynomials, as weighted by the law of the fractional Brownian motion, may be\nhard to distinguish from rate one empirically.
