By working with the associated\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation (HJB PDE), we obtain a\nclosed-form formula for a trading strategy which approximates the optimal\ntrading strategy when the time horizon is small. This strategy is generated by\na first order approximation to the value function. The approximate value\nfunction is obtained by constructing classical sub- and super-solutions to the\nHJB PDE using a formal expansion in powers of horizon time. Martingale\ninequalities are used to sandwich the true value function between the\nconstructed sub- and super-solutions. A rigorous proof of the accuracy of the\napproximation formulas is given. We end with a heuristic scheme for extending\nour small-time approximating formulas to approximating formulas in a finite\ntime horizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 19:35:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Jul 2017 03:04:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 22 Oct 2017 23:24:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 22:58:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:02:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Rohini", ""], ["Nasralah", "Hussein", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09631", "submitter": "Christa Cuchiero", "authors": "Christa Cuchiero, Walter Schachermayer and Ting-Kam Leonard Wong", "title": "Cover's universal portfolio, stochastic portfolio theory and the\n  numeraire portfolio", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cover's celebrated theorem states that the long run yield of a properly\nchosen \"universal\" portfolio is as good as the long run yield of the best\nretrospectively chosen constant rebalanced portfolio. The \"universality\"\npertains to the fact that this result is model-free, i.e., not dependent on an\nunderlying stochastic process. We extend Cover's theorem to the setting of\nstochastic portfolio theory as initiated by R. Fernholz: the rebalancing rule\nneed not to be constant anymore but may depend on the present state of the\nstock market. This model-free result is complemented by a comparison with the\nlog-optimal numeraire portfolio when fixing a stochastic model of the stock\nmarket. Roughly speaking, under appropriate assumptions, the optimal long run\nyield coincides for the three approaches mentioned in the title of this paper.\nWe present our results in discrete and continuous time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 13:49:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Cuchiero", "Christa", ""], ["Schachermayer", "Walter", ""], ["Wong", "Ting-Kam Leonard", ""]]}]
