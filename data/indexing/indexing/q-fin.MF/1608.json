Pricing for a European barrier\ncondition is straightforward for products of both types and depends on an\nefficient interpolation of observed market option pricing.

To allow for\nmutual dependence between the financial and the insurance markets, we use the\nprogressive enlargement of filtration approach. We characterize the optimal\nhedging strategy in terms of the integrand in the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe\ndecomposition of the insurance claim with respect to the minimal martingale\nmeasure and the available information flow. We provide an explicit formula by\nmeans of predictable projection of the corresponding hedging strategy under\nfull information with respect to the natural filtration of the risky asset\nprice and the minimal martingale measure. Finally, we discuss applications in a\nMarkovian setting via filtering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 17:31:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Dec 2016 09:31:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ceci", "Claudia", ""], ["Colaneri", "Katia", ""], ["Cretarola", "Alessandra", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07863", "submitter": "Matthew Lorig", "authors": "Jos\\'e E.

Our main results are closed-form expressions for the leading\norder terms of off-the-money European call and put LETF option prices, near\nexpiration, with explicit error bounds. We show that the price of an\nout-of-the-money European call on a LETF with positive (negative) leverage is\nasymptotically equivalent, in short-time, to the price of an out-of-the-money\nEuropean call (put) on the underlying ETF, but with modified spot and strike\nprices. Similar relationships hold for other off-the-money European options. In\nparticular, our results suggest a method to hedge off-the-money LETF options\nnear expiration using options on the underlying ETF. Finally, a second order\nexpansion for the corresponding implied volatility is also derived and\nillustrated numerically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 22:34:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:32:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 16:27:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Figueroa-L\u00f3pez", "Jos\u00e9 E.", ""], ["Gong", "Ruoting", ""], ["Lorig", "Matthew", ""]]}]
