We view this as an\nonline revenue management problem where the insurance company looks to set\nprices to optimize the long-run revenue from selling a new insurance product.\nWe develop two pricing models: an adaptive Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and\nan adaptive Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Both balance between\nexploration, where we choose prices in order to learn the distribution of\ndemands & claims for the insurance product, and exploitation, where we\nmyopically choose the best price from the information gathered so far. The\nperformance of the pricing policies is measured in terms of regret: the\nexpected revenue loss caused by not using the optimal price. As is commonplace\nin insurance, we model demand and claims by GLMs. In our adaptive GLM design,\nwe use the maximum quasi-likelihood estimation (MQLE) to estimate the unknown\nparameters. We show that, if prices are chosen with suitably decreasing\nvariability, the MQLE parameters eventually exist and converge to the correct\nvalues, which in turn implies that the sequence of chosen prices will also\nconverge to the optimal price. In the adaptive GP regression model, we sample\ndemand and claims from Gaussian Processes and then choose selling prices by the\nupper confidence bound rule. We also analyze these GLM and GP pricing\nalgorithms with delayed claims. Although similar results exist in other\ndomains, this is among the first works to consider dynamic pricing problems in\nthe field of insurance. We also believe this is the first work to consider\nGaussian Process regression in the context of insurance pricing. These initial\nfindings suggest that online machine learning algorithms could be a fruitful\narea of future investigation and application in insurance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 08:18:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yuqing", ""], ["Walton", "Neil", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.06673", "submitter": "Magnus Wiese", "authors": "Magnus Wiese, Robert Knobloch, Ralf Korn, Peter Kretschmer", "title": "Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series", "comments": "Corrected typos.

By using an approximation of\nthe portfolio in terms of its vega, we show that the seemingly high-dimensional\nstochastic optimal control problem of an option market maker is in fact\ntractable. More precisely, when volatility is modeled using a classical\nstochastic volatility model -- e.g. the Heston model -- the problem faced by an\noption market maker is characterized by a low-dimensional functional equation\nthat can be solved numerically using a Euler scheme along with interpolation\ntechniques, even for large portfolios.

In this paper, we\nintroduce the theory of multiple internally embedded financial time-clocks\nmotivated by behavioral finance. To be consistent with dynamic asset pricing\ntheory and option pricing, as suggested by behavioral finance, the investors'\nview is considered by introducing an intrinsic time process which we refer to\nas a behavioral subordinator. The process is subordinated to the Brownian\nmotion process in the well-known log-normal model, resulting in a new log-price\nprocess. The number of embedded subordinations results in a new parameter that\nmust be estimated and this parameter is as important as the mean and variance\nof asset returns. We describe new distributions, demonstrating how they can be\napplied to modeling the tail behavior of stock market returns. We apply the\nproposed models to modeling S&P 500 returns, treating the CBOE Volatility Index\nas intrinsic time change and the CBOE Volatility-of-Volatility Index as the\nvolatility subordinator. We find that these volatility indexes are not proper\ntime-change subordinators in modeling the returns of the S&P 500.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 18:49:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Shirvani", "Abootaleb", ""], ["Rachev", "Svetlozar T.", ""], ["Fabozzi", "Frank J.", ""]]}]
