In this paper we\nconsider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,\nthe local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a\nfunction of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of\nstrike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to\nderive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a\nrole of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and,\nmoreover, it can be solved in closed form.

A more fundamental problem when extending the distorted\nexpectation to a dynamic setting is time-inconsistency, that is, the usual\n\"tower property\" fails. By localizing the probability distortion and\nrestricting to a smaller class of random variables, we introduce a so-called\ndistorted probability and construct a conditional expectation in such a way\nthat it coincides with the original nonlinear expectation at time zero, but has\na time-consistent dynamics in the sense that the tower property remains valid.\nFurthermore, we show that in the continuous time model this conditional\nexpectation corresponds to a parabolic differential equation whose coefficient\ninvolves the law of the underlying diffusion. This work is the first step\ntowards a new understanding of nonlinear expectations under probability\ndistortion, and will potentially be a helpful tool for solving\ntime-inconsistent stochastic optimization problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 18:11:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Sep 2019 19:34:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:51:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2020 04:31:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2020 19:17:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Jin", ""], ["Wong", "Ting-Kam Leonard", ""], ["Zhang", "Jianfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08960", "submitter": "Nikolai Dokuchaev", "authors": "Nikolai Dokuchaev", "title": "On a gap between rational annuitization price for producer and price for\n  customer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper studies pricing of insurance products focusing on the pricing of\nannuities under uncertainty. This pricing problem is crucial for financial\ndecision making and was studied intensively, however, many open questions still\nremain.

The paper suggests a pricing method based on the risk\nminimization such that both producer and customer seek to minimize the mean\nsquare hedging error accepted as a measure of risk. This leads to two different\nversions of the pricing problem: the selection of the annuity price given the\nrate of regular payments, and the selection of the rate of payments given the\nannuity price. It appears that solutions of these two problems are different.\nThis can contribute to explanation for the \"annuity puzzle\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2018 14:16:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Dokuchaev", "Nikolai", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.09243", "submitter": "Yu-Jui Huang", "authors": "Yu-Jui Huang and Zhou Zhou", "title": "Strong and Weak Equilibria for Time-Inconsistent Stochastic Control in\n  Continuous Time", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mathematics of Operations Research, Vol. 46 (2021), Issue 2, pp\n  428-451", "doi": "10.1287/moor.2020.1066", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new definition of continuous-time equilibrium controls is introduced.
