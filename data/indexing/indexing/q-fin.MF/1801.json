As a way of modelling correlated exposures and\nherd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of\nmean-reversion in the drift.

In this way, we aim to capture\nkey `system-wide' effects on risk. The resulting mean field limit is\ncharacterized uniquely by a nonlinear SPDE on the half-line with a Dirichlet\nboundary condition. The density of this SPDE gives the conditional law of a\nnon-standard `conditional' McKean--Vlasov diffusion, for which we provide a\nnovel upper Dirichlet heat kernel type estimate that is essential to the\nproofs. Depending on the realizations of the common noise and the rate of mean\nreversion, the SPDE can exhibit rapid accelerations in the loss of mass at the\nboundary.
