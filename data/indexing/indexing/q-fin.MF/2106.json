Given a finite\nset of LETFs that exist in the marketplace, I give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for these products to be undominated in the price-gearing plane. In\na beautiful application of the duality theorem of linear programming, I prove a\nkind of two-fund theorem for LETFs: given a target gearing ratio for the\ninvestor, the cheapest way to achieve it is to combine (uniquely) the two\nnearest undominated LETF products that bracket it on the leverage axis.
