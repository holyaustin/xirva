We extend the\nmethodology to the geometric Brownian motion with affine drift and show that\nthe joint distribution of this process and its time-integral can be determined\nby a doubly-confluent Heun equation. Furthermore, the joint Laplace transform\nof the process and its time-integral is derived from the asymptotics of the\nsolutions. In addition, we provide an application by using the results for the\nasymptotics of the double-confluent Heun equation in pricing Asian options.\nNumerical results show the accuracy and efficiency of this new method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2020 15:19:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Runhuan", ""], ["Jiang", "Pingping", ""], ["Volkmer", "Hans", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.09820", "submitter": "Chinonso Nwankwo", "authors": "Chinonso Nwankwo, Weizhong Dai", "title": "Explicit RKF-Compact Scheme for Pricing Regime Switching American\n  Options with Varying Time Step", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP cs.CE cs.NA math.NA q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this research work, an explicit Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) time\nintegration with a fourth-order compact finite difference scheme in space and a\nhigh order analytical approximation of the optimal exercise boundary is\nemployed for solving the regime-switching pricing model. In detail, we recast\nthe free boundary problem into a system of nonlinear partial differential\nequations with a multi-fixed domain. We then introduce a transformation based\non the square root function with a Lipschitz character from which a high order\nanalytical approximation is obtained to compute the derivative of the optimal\nexercise boundary in each regime. We further compute the boundary values, asset\noption, and the option Greeks for each regime using fourth-order spatial\ndiscretization and adaptive time integration. In particular, the coupled assets\noptions and option Greeks are estimated using Hermite interpolation with Newton\nbasis.

We call this problem the acceptability maximization. First, we\nstudy the one-period (static) case, and propose a numerical algorithm that\napproximates the original problem by a sequence of risk minimization problems.\nThe results are applied to several important CAIs, such as the gain-to-loss\nratio, the risk-adjusted return on capital and the tail-value-at-risk based\nCAI. In the second part of the paper we investigate the acceptability\nmaximization in a discrete time dynamic setup. Using robust representations of\nCAIs in terms of a family of dynamic coherent risk measures (DCRMs), we\nestablish an intriguing dichotomy: if the corresponding family of DCRMs is\nrecursive (i.e. strongly time consistent) and assuming some recursive structure\nof the market model, then the acceptability maximization problem reduces to\njust a one period problem and the maximal acceptability is constant across all\nstates and times. On the other hand, if the family of DCRMs is not recursive,\nwhich is often the case, then the acceptability maximization problem ordinarily\nis a time-inconsistent stochastic control problem, similar to the classical\nmean-variance criteria. To overcome this form of time-inconsistency, we adapt\nto our setup the set-valued Bellman's principle recently proposed in\n\\cite{KovacovaRudloff2019} applied to two particular dynamic CAIs - the dynamic\nrisk-adjusted return on capital and the dynamic gain-to-loss ratio. The\nobtained theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples that\ninclude, in particular, the computation of the intermediate mean-risk efficient\nfrontiers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2020 12:51:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kov\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1", "Gabriela", ""], ["Rudloff", "Birgit", ""], ["Cialenco", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.13753", "submitter": "Hyungbin Park", "authors": "Seunghyun Lee and Hyungbin Park", "title": "Conditions for bubbles to arise under heterogeneous beliefs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the equilibrium price of a continuous time asset traded in\na market with heterogeneous investors.
