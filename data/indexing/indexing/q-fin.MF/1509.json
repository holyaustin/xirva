Taking a Bayesian approach, we model the initial\nbeliefs of an individual about the drift parameter by allowing an arbitrary\nprobability distribution to characterise the uncertainty about the drift\nparameter. Filtering theory is used to describe the evolution of the posterior\nbeliefs about the drift once the price process is being observed. An optimal\nstopping time is determined as the first passage time of the posterior mean\nbelow a monotone boundary, which can be characterised as the unique solution to\na non-linear integral equation.

The cashflow bundle is the vector bundle associated to this\nstochastic principal fibre bundle for the natural choice of the vector space\nfibre. The cashflow bundle carries a stochastic covariant differentiation\ninduced by the connection on the principal fibre bundle. The link between\narbitrage theory and spectral theory of the connection Laplacian on the vector\nbundle is given by the zero eigenspace resulting in a parametrization of all\nrisk neutral measures equivalent to the statistical one. This indicates that a\nmarket satisfies the (NFLVR) condition if and only if $0$ is in the discrete\nspectrum of the connection Laplacian on the cash flow bundle or of the Dirac\nLaplacian of the twisted cash flow bundle with the exterior algebra bundle. We\napply this result by extending Jarrow-Protter-Shimbo theory of asset bubbles\nfor complete arbitrage free markets to markets not satisfying the (NFLVR).\nMoreover, by means of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we prove that the Euler\ncharacteristic of the asset nominal space is a topological obstruction to the\nthe (NFLVR) condition, and, by means of the Bochner-Weitzenb\\\"ock formula, the\nnon vanishing of the homology group of the cash flow bundle is revealed to be a\ntopological obstruction to (NFLVR), too.
