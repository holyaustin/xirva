The seller of a futures contract commits to deliver, say,\npower, over a certain period, while the classical forward is a financial\nagreement settled on a maturity date. Our purpose is to design a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity\nmarket consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main\nassumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a\nuniversal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the\nmodels which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a\ndensity between a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of\ntraded assets like forward contracts are true $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the\nreal world probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are\nmean-reverting. The Girsanov kernel for such a transformation turns out to be\nstochastic and unbounded in the diffusion part, while in the jump part the\nGirsanov kernel must be deterministic and bounded: thus, in this respect, we\nprove two results on the martingale property of stochastic exponentials. The\nfirst allows to validate measure changes made of two components: an\nEsscher-type density and a Girsanov transform with stochastic and unbounded\nkernel. The second uses a different approach and works for the case of\ncontinuous density.

Two agents, who do not trade the stock, have differing\ninformation on the change point, and seek to optimally exercise the option by\nmaximising its discounted payoff under the physical measure. The first agent\nhas full information, and observes the change point. The second agent has\npartial information and filters the change point from price observations. This\nscenario is designed to mimic the positions of two employees of varying\nseniority, a fully informed executive and a partially informed less senior\nemployee, each of whom receives an ESO. The partial information scenario yields\na model under the observation filtration $\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$ in which the\nstock drift becomes a diffusion driven by the innovations process, an\n$\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$-Brownian motion also driving the stock under\n$\\widehat{\\mathbb{F}}$, and the partial information optimal stopping value\nfunction has two spatial dimensions. We rigorously characterise the free\nboundary PDEs for both agents, establish shape and regularity properties of the\nassociated optimal exercise boundaries, and prove the smooth pasting property\nin both information scenarios, exploiting some stochastic flow ideas to do so\nin the partial information case. We develop finite difference algorithms to\nnumerically solve both agents' exercise and valuation problems and illustrate\nthat the additional information of the fully informed agent can result in\nexercise patterns which exploit the information on the change point, lending\ncredence to empirical studies which suggest that privileged information of bad\nnews is a factor leading to early exercise of ESOs prior to poor stock price\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 19:33:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:57:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Feb 2020 20:52:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2020 13:50:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Henderson", "Vicky", ""], ["Klad\u00edvko", "Kamil", ""], ["Monoyios", "Michael", ""], ["Reisinger", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10384", "submitter": "Camelia Pop", "authors": "Donatella Danielli, Arshak Petrosyan, and Camelia A.
