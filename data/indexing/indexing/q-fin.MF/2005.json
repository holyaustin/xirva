In making the bequest proportion an additional\ncontrol function I obtain, hitherto unavailable, closed-form solutions for the\nfractional consumption rate, wealth, bequest amount, and bequest proportion\nunder a constant relative risk averse utility. I show that the optimal bequest\nproportion is the product of the optimum fractional consumption rate and an\nexponentiated bequest parameter.

We extend the forward deep BSDE to the\nbarrier condition case by adding nodes to the computational graph to explicitly\nmonitor the barrier conditions for each realization of the dynamics as well as\nnodes that preserve the time, state variables, and trading strategy value at\nbarrier breach or at maturity otherwise. Given these additional nodes in the\ncomputational graph, the forward loss function quantifies the replication of\nthe barrier or final payoff according to a chosen risk measure such as squared\nsum of differences. The proposed method can handle any barrier condition in the\nFBSDE set-up and any Dirichlet boundary conditions in the PDE set-up, both in\nlow and high dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 May 2020 02:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ganesan", "Narayan", ""], ["Yu", "Yajie", ""], ["Hientzsch", "Bernhard", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.11022", "submitter": "Thorsten Schmidt", "authors": "Philippe Artzner and Karl-Theodor Eisele and Thorsten Schmidt", "title": "No arbitrage in insurance and the QP-rule", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is an attempt to study fundamentally the valuation of insurance\ncontracts. We start from the observation that insurance contracts are\ninherently linked to financial markets, be it via interest rates, or -- as in\nhybrid products, equity-linked life insurance and variable annuities --\ndirectly to stocks or indices. By defining portfolio strategies on an insurance\nportfolio and combining them with financial trading strategies we arrive at the\nnotion of insurance-finance arbitrage (IFA). A fundamental theorem provides two\nsufficient conditions for presence or absence of IFA, respectively. For the\nfirst one it utilizes the conditional law of large numbers and risk-neutral\nvaluation. As a key result we obtain a simple valuation rule, called QP-rule,\nwhich is market consistent and excludes IFA.\n  Utilizing the theory of enlargements of filtrations we construct a tractable\nframework for general valuation results, working under weak assumptions.\n  The generality of the approach allows to incorporate many important aspects,\nlike mortality risk or dependence of mortality and stock markets which is of\nutmost importance in the recent corona crisis. For practical applications, we\nprovide an affine formulation which leads to explicit valuation formulas for a\nlarge class of hybrid products.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 May 2020 06:24:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2020 13:51:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Artzner", "Philippe", ""], ["Eisele", "Karl-Theodor", ""], ["Schmidt", "Thorsten", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12572", "submitter": "Alessandro Doldi", "authors": "Alessandro Doldi and Marco Frittelli", "title": "Entropy Martingale Optimal Transport and Nonlinear Pricing-Hedging\n  Duality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The objective of this paper is to develop a duality between a novel\nMartingale Entropy Optimal Transport problem (D) and an associated optimization\nproblem (P). In (D) we follow the approach taken in the Entropy Optimal\nTransport (EOT) primal problem by (Liero et al. \"Optimal entropy-transport\nproblems and a new Hellinger-Kantorovic distance between positive measures\",\nInvent. math. 2018) but we add the constraint, typical of Martingale Optimal\nTransport (MOT) theory, that the infimum of the cost functional is taken over\nmartingale probability measures, instead of finite positive measures, as in\nLiero et al. The Problem (D) differs from the corresponding problem in Liero et\nal. not only by the martingale constraint, but also because we admit less\nrestrictive relaxation terms D, which may not have a divergence formulation. In\nProblem (P) the objective functional, associated via Fenchel coniugacy to the\nterms D, is not any more linear, as in OT or in MOT. This leads to a novel\noptimization problem which also has a clear financial interpretation as a non\nlinear subhedging value. Our results allow us to establish a novel nonlinear\nrobust pricing-hedging duality in financial mathematics, which covers a wide\nrange of known robust results in its generality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 08:41:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:41:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Doldi", "Alessandro", ""], ["Frittelli", "Marco", ""]]}]
