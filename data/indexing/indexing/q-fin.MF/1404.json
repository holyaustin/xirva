When\nthe parameters of these SDEs are estimated from $N$ sub-sampled data $(X_{nT},\nY_{nT})$, estimation errors do impact the classical option pricing PDEs. We\nestimate these option pricing errors by combining numerical evaluation of\nestimation errors for Heston SDEs parameters with the computation of option\nprice partial derivatives with respect to these SDEs parameters. This is\nachieved by solving six parabolic PDEs with adequate boundary conditions. To\nimplement this approach, we also develop an estimator $\\hat \\lambda$ for the\nmarket price of volatility risk, and we study the sensitivity of option pricing\nto estimation errors affecting $\\hat \\lambda$. We illustrate this approach by\nfitting Heston SDEs to 252 daily joint observations of the S\\&P 500 index and\nof its approximate volatility VIX, and by numerical applications to European\noptions written on the S\\&P 500 index.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:34:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Apr 2015 10:39:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 14:11:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Azencott", "Robert", ""], ["Gadhyan", "Yutheeka", ""], ["Glowinski", "Roland", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4150", "submitter": "Phillip Yam", "authors": "Alain Bensoussan, Jens Frehse, Phillip Yam", "title": "The Master Equation in Mean Field Theory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP math.DS math.OC math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In his lectures at College de France, P.L. Lions introduced the concept of\nMaster equation, see [5] for Mean Field Games. It is introduced in a heuristic\nfashion, from the system of partial differential equations, associated to a\nNash equilibrium for a large, but finite, number of players. The method, also\nexplained in[2], consists in a formal analogy of terms. The interest of this\nequation is that it contains interesting particular cases, which can be studied\ndirectly, in particular the system of HJB-FP (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman,\nFokker-Planck) equations obtained as the limit of the finite Nash equilibrium\ngame, when the trajectories are independent, see [4]. Usually, in mean field\ntheory, one can bypass the large Nash equilibrium, by introducing the concept\nof representative agent, whose action is influenced by a distribution of\nsimilar agents, and obtains directly the system of HJB-FP equations of\ninterest, see for instance [1]. Apparently, there is no such approach for the\nMaster equation. We show here that it is possible. We first do it for the Mean\nField type control problem, for which we interpret completely the Master\nequation. For the Mean Field Games itself, we solve a related problem, and\nobtain again the Master equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 06:50:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 13:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bensoussan", "Alain", ""], ["Frehse", "Jens", ""], ["Yam", "Phillip", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4659", "submitter": "Jan Kuklinski", "authors": "Jan Kuklinski, Doinita Negru and Pawel Pliszka", "title": "Modelling the skew and smile of SPX and DAX index options using the\n  Shifted Log-Normal and SABR stochastic models", "comments": "5 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss modelling of SPX and DAX index option prices using the Shifted\nLog-Normal (SLN) model, (also known as Displaced Diffusion), and the SABR\nmodel.
