We consider the problem of optimal\ntransport from $\\mu$ to $\\nu$ with respect to a cost function $c: X \\times Y\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$. To ensure that the solution to this problem is smooth, it is\nnecessary to make several assumptions about the structure of the domains and\nthe cost function. In particular, Ma, Trudinger, and Wang established\nregularity estimates when the domains are strongly \\textit{relatively\n$c$-convex} with respect to each other and cost function has non-negative\n\\textit{MTW tensor}. For cost functions of the form $c(x,y)= \\Psi(x-y)$ for\nsome convex function $\\Psi$, we find an associated K\\\"ahler manifold whose\northogonal anti-bisectional curvature is proportional to the MTW tensor. We\nalso show that relative $c$-convexity geometrically corresponds to geodesic\nconvexity with respect to a dual affine connection. Taken together, these\nresults provide a geometric framework for optimal transport which is\ncomplementary to the pseudo-Riemannian theory of Kim and McCann.\n  We provide several applications of this work.
