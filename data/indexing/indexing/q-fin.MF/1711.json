We also\nshow that the mean realized variance of returns is a linear function of the\nnumber of days over which the returns are calculated. The slope is determined\nby the mean value of the variance (squared volatility) in the mean-reverting\nstochastic volatility models, such as Heston and multiplicative, independent of\nstochasticity. The distribution function of stock returns, which rescales with\nthe increase of the number of days of return, is obtained from the steady-state\nvariance distribution function using the product distribution with the normal\ndistribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Nov 2017 18:25:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Dec 2017 17:17:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Zhiyuan", ""], ["Moghaddam", "M.
