This allows us to determine the stopping region as a\ncertain interval and hence we are able to identify the form of $V^{\\omega}_{\\rm\nA}(s)$. We also prove a put-call symmetry for American options with\nasset-dependent discounting. In the case when $S_t$ is a geometric L\\'evy\nprocess we give exact expressions using the so-called omega scale functions\nintroduced in Li and Palmowski (2018). We prove that the analysed value\nfunction satisfies the HJB equation and we give sufficient conditions for the\nsmooth fit property as well. Finally, we present a few examples for which we\nobtain the analytical form of the value function $V^{\\omega}_{\\rm A}(s)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2020 12:35:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2021 18:25:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Hadad", "Jonas", ""], ["Palmowski", "Zbigniew", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.10643", "submitter": "Jan Palczewski", "authors": "Tiziano De Angelis, Nikita Merkulov, Jan Palczewski", "title": "On the value of non-Markovian Dynkin games with partial and asymmetric\n  information", "comments": "Changes include the proof of existence of a saddle point for the game\n  and inclusion of a separate payoff when players stop at the same time.

In\nthis paper, we investigate ordering relations between two aggregation sets for\nwhich the sets of marginals are related by two simple operations: distribution\nmixtures and quantile mixtures. Intuitively, these operations ``homogenize\"\nmarginal distributions by making them similar. As a general conclusion from our\nresults, more ``homogeneous\" marginals lead to a larger aggregation set, and\nthus more severe model uncertainty, although the situation for quantile\nmixtures is much more complicated than that for distribution mixtures. We\nproceed to study inequalities on the worst-case values of risk measures in risk\naggregation, which represent conservative calculation of regulatory capital.\nAmong other results, we obtain an order relation on VaR under quantile mixture\nfor marginal distributions with monotone densities. Numerical results are\npresented to visualize the theoretical results and further inspire some\nconjectures. Finally, we provide applications on portfolio diversification\nunder dependence uncertainty and merging p-values in multiple hypothesis\ntesting, and discuss the connection of our results to joint mixability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2020 04:05:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2021 01:12:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yuyu", ""], ["Liu", "Peng", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Wang", "Ruodu", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15041", "submitter": "Kasper Larsen", "authors": "Umut Cetin and Kasper Larsen", "title": "Uniqueness in Cauchy problems for diffusive real-valued strict local\n  martingales", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For a real-valued one dimensional diffusive strict local martingale, we\nprovide a set of smooth functions in which the Cauchy problem has a unique\nclassical solution.
