Arbitrage trades have been shown to align the prices reported by\nCFMMs with those of external markets. These trades impose costs on Liquidity\nProviders (LPs) who supply reserves to CFMMs. Trading fees have been proposed\nas a mechanism for compensating LPs for arbitrage losses. However, large fees\nreduce the accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to\ndeviate from desirable asset compositions. CFMM designers are therefore faced\nwith the problem of how to optimally select fees to attract liquidity. We\ndevelop a framework for determining the value to LPs of supplying liquidity to\na CFMM with fees when the underlying process follows a general diffusion.\nFocusing on a popular class of CFMMs which we call Geometric Mean Market Makers\n(G3Ms), our approach also allows one to select optimal fees for maximizing LP\nvalue.

We adopt an oft-used tool in mathematical finance, the Heston\nStochastic Volatility model, to forecast the short-term and long-term evolution\nof motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate a number of extensions to the\nHeston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We\nincorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision\nrate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of\naccelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of\ncollision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a short-term forecast of\ncollision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term\nforecasts. The short-term forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates\n(over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road\nsafety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios\nsuggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and\ntargets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to-month collision rates (by half)\ncould have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this\nscenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations\nsuggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044.\nThe main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting\nunreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents\nthe effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the\nlong run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that\nunderlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the\neffectiveness of implemented policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Apr 2021 08:18:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 23 May 2021 11:36:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Shannon", "Darren", ""], ["Fountas", "Grigorios", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11768", "submitter": "Bernhard Hientzsch", "authors": "Narayan Ganesan, Bernhard Hientzsch", "title": "Estimating Future VaR from Value Samples and Applications to Future\n  Initial Margin", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Predicting future values at risk (fVaR) is an important problem in finance.\nThey arise in the modelling of future initial margin requirements for\ncounterparty credit risk and future market risk VaR.
