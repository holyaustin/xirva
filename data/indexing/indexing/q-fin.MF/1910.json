A possible approach to this\nkey issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal\ninterest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and\nfinally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific\nstochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which\ninflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in\nmany epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known\nmodel in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic\ndynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become\nnegative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14\ncountries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an\nerror analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in\nour results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run\ndiscount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates. Even if one\nrejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our results support\nthe need to consider low discounting rates. The results provided by these\nfourteen countries significantly increase the priority of confronting global\nactions such as climate change mitigation. We finally extend the analysis by\nfirst allowing for fluctuations of the mean level in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nmodel and secondly by considering modified versions of the Feller and lognormal\nmodels. In both cases, results remain basically unchanged thus demonstrating\nthe robustness of the results presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2019 14:55:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 09:37:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Perell\u00f3", "Josep", ""], ["Montero", "Miquel", ""], ["Masoliver", "Jaume", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price\nreinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a\nrisk-free asset and a risky asset. The two insurers, as the followers of the\nStackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and\ninvest in the same financial market. The competitive relationship between two\ninsurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making will\nconsider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal\nwealth. We consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded\nmemory feature. This paper aims to find the equilibrium strategy for the\nreinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility of the reinsurer's\nterminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the\ncombination of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with\ndelay. By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming\napproach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions explicitly.\nThen, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. Finally, some\nnumerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the\neffects of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy. We find the delay\nfactor discourages or stimulates investment depending on the length of delay.\nMoreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal\nreinsurance-investment strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and\nreinsurance premium price.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:46:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Yanfei", ""], ["Zhou", "Zhongbao", ""], ["Xiao", "Helu", ""], ["Gao", "Rui", ""], ["Zhong", "Feimin", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.09855", "submitter": "Yan Dolinsky", "authors": "Yan Dolinsky and Jonathan Zouari", "title": "The Value of Insider Information for Super--Replication with Quadratic\n  Transaction Costs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study super--replication of European contingent claims in an illiquid\nmarket with insider information.
