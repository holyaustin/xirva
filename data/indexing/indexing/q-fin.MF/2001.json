This is mostly due to its\ntractability and the fact that it encompasses important examples, including\nentropic risk measures and average value at risk.\n  In this work we consider stochastic optimal control problems where the\nobjective criterion is given by an OCE risk measure, or put in other words, a\nrisk minimization problem for controlled diffusions. A major difficulty arises\nsince OCEs are often time inconsistent. Nevertheless, via an enlargement of\nstate space we achieve a substitute of sorts for time consistency in fair\ngenerality. This allows us to derive a dynamic programming principle and thus\nrecover central results of (risk-neutral) stochastic control theory. In\nparticular, we show that the value of our risk minimization problem can be\ncharacterized via the viscosity solution of a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman--Issacs\nequation. We further establish the uniqueness of the latter under suitable\ntechnical conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 22:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Veraguas", "Julio Backhoff", ""], ["Reppen", "A.

In our scheme, we assume that the invested\ncapital is explicitly associated with the quantum analog of the free-energy\n(i.e. ergotropy functional by Allahverdyan, Balian, and Nieuwenhuizen) of a\nsingle mode of the electromagnetic radiation which, depending on the outcome of\nthe betting, experiences attenuation or amplification processes which model\nlosses and winning events. The resulting stochastic evolution of the quantum\nmemory resembles the dynamics of random lasing which we characterize within the\ntheoretical setting of Bosonic Gaussian channels. As in the classical Kelly\nCriterion for optimal betting, we define the asymptotic doubling rate of the\nmodel and identify the optimal gambling strategy for fixed odds and\nprobabilities of winning. The performance of the model are hence studied as a\nfunction of the input capital state under the assumption that the latter\nbelongs to the set of Gaussian density matrices (i.e. displaced, squeezed\nthermal Gibbs states) revealing that the best option for the gambler is to\ndevote all her/his initial resources into coherent state amplitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:28:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Sep 2020 12:29:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:36:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:17:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Tirone", "Salvatore", ""], ["Ghio", "Maddalena", ""], ["Livieri", "Giulia", ""], ["Giovannetti", "Vittorio", ""], ["Marmi", "Stefano", ""]]}]
