We argue that a derivative liability, after primary risk factors\nbeing hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and\nshould be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of\ndetermining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically\nneutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate\nand effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the\nderivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option\ndiscounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and\npayable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the\ncounterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is\nprecisely defined by discounting the product of the risk free price and the\ncredit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be\nbroken into a default risk component -- CVA and a funding component -- FVA,\nconsistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the\nusual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a\nbasis. As for FVA, we define a cost -- credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a\nbenefit -- debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and\nattributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of\noutstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of\none price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own\ndefault risk.

The objective of this manuscript is to present an\noriginal self-contained treatment of the multidimensional pricing.

In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced. We present a general method of high-dimensional\noption pricing based on a wide range of jump-diffusion models. Namely, we\nconstruct approximation formulas for the price of spread options. It is\nimportant to get an efficient approximation for the respective density\nfunction, since the reward function has usually a simple structure. Instead of\na commonly used tabulation approach, we use the respective m-widths to compare\na wide range of numerical methods. We give an algorithm of almost optimal, in\nthe sense of the respective m-widths, reconstruction of density functions. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach we consider in details a concrete class\nof Levy driven processes and present the respective rates of convergence of\napproximation formulas. The interrelationship between the theory and tools\nreflects the richness and deep connections in Financial Mathematics, Stochastic\nProcesses, Theory of Martingales, Functional Analysis, Topology and Harmonic\nAnalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 08:50:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kushpel", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.07608", "submitter": "Alexander Lipton", "authors": "Alexander Lipton", "title": "Modern Monetary Circuit Theory, Stability of Interconnected Banking\n  Network, and Balance Sheet Optimization for Individual Banks", "comments": "67 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A modern version of Monetary Circuit Theory with a particular emphasis on\nstochastic underpinning mechanisms is developed.

It\nis shown how in the process of money creation banks become naturally\ninterconnected. A novel Extended Structural Default Model describing the\nstability of the Interconnected Banking Network is proposed. The purpose of\nbanks' capital and liquidity is explained. Multi-period constrained\noptimization problem for banks's balance sheet is formulated and solved in a\nsimple case.

Since BSDEs are nonlinear\ngeneralisations of the traditional (linear) expectations, this problem can be\nunderstood as stochastic control of a family of nonlinear expectations, or\nequivalently of nonlinear kernels. Our first main contribution is to prove a\ndynamic programming principle for this control problem in an abstract setting,\nwhich we then use to provide a semi-martingale characterisation of the value\nfunction. We next explore several applications of our results. We first obtain\na wellposedness result for second order BSDEs (as introduced in [86]) which\ndoes not require any regularity assumption on the terminal condition and the\ngenerator. Then we prove a nonlinear optional decomposition in a robust\nsetting, extending recent results of [71], which we then use to obtain a\nsuper-hedging duality in uncertain, incomplete and nonlinear financial markets.\nFinally, we relate, under additional regularity assumptions, the value function\nto a viscosity solution of an appropriate path-dependent partial differential\nequation (PPDE).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 19:59:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 03:23:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Possama\u00ef", "Dylan", ""], ["Tan", "Xiaolu", ""], ["Zhou", "Chao", ""]]}]
