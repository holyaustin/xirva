Our method\ngeneralizes the quadratic approximation scheme of Barone-Adesi & Whaley (1987)\nand several of its extensions. Using perturbative arguments, we decompose the\nearly exercise pricing problem into sub-problems of different orders and solve\nthese sub-problems successively. The obtained solutions are combined to recover\napproximations to the original pricing problem of multiple orders, with the\n0-th order version matching the general Barone-Adesi & Whaley ansatz. We test\nthe accuracy and efficiency of the approximations via numerical simulations.\nThe results show a clear dominance of higher order approximations over their\nrespective 0-th order version and reveal that significantly more pricing\naccuracy can be obtained by relying on approximations of the first few orders.\nAdditionally, they suggest that increasing the order of any approximation by\none generally refines the pricing precision, however that this happens at the\nexpense of greater computational costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Dec 2019 18:02:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mathys", "Ludovic", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.00469", "submitter": "Ludovic Mathys", "authors": "Ludovic Mathys", "title": "Valuing Tradeability in Exponential L\\'evy Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present article provides a novel theoretical way to evaluate tradeability\nin markets of ordinary exponential L\\'evy type.

Though the number of stocks in the\nopen market is fixed, the constituents of the market change over time as each\ncompany's rank by its market capitalization fluctuates. When one is allowed to\ninvest also in the money market, the open market resembles the entire 'closed'\nequity market in the sense that the equivalence of market viability (lack of\narbitrage) and the existence of numeraire portfolio (portfolio which cannot be\noutperformed) holds. When access to the money market is prohibited, some topics\nsuch as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), construction of functionally\ngenerated portfolios, and the concept of the universal portfolio are presented\nin the open market setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2019 23:01:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Donghan", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13259", "submitter": "Carlo Marinelli", "authors": "Carlo Marinelli, Luca Scarpa", "title": "On the positivity of local mild solutions to stochastic evolution\n  equations", "comments": "10 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a stochastic\nevolution equation on a Hilbert space of functions driven by a cylindrical\nWiener process ensuring that its mild solution is positive if the initial datum\nis positive.
