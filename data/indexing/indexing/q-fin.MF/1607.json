Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable. We illustrate the\nimputed risk functions in a portfolio selection problem and demonstrate their\npractical value using real-life data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 22:00:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jonathan Yu-Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07197", "submitter": "Luciano Campi", "authors": "Luciano Campi, Claude Martini", "title": "On the support of extremal martingale measures with given marginals: the\n  countable case", "comments": "14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the supports of extremal martingale measures with\npre-specified marginals in a two-period setting. First, we establish in full\ngenerality the equivalence between the extremality of a given measure $Q$ and\nthe denseness in $L^1(Q)$ of a suitable linear subspace, which can be seen in a\nfinancial context as the set of all semi-static trading strategies. Moreover,\nwhen the supports of both marginals are countable, we focus on the slightly\nstronger notion of weak exact predictable representation property (henceforth,\nWEP) and provide two combinatorial sufficient conditions, called \"2-link\nproperty\" and \"full erasability\", on how the points in the supports are linked\nto each other for granting extremality. When the support of the first marginal\nis a finite set, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the WEP to\nhold in terms of the new concepts of $2$-net and deadlock. Finally, we study\nthe relation between cycles and extremality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2016 10:21:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 15:23:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Jun 2017 09:57:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:09:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Campi", "Luciano", ""], ["Martini", "Claude", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07582", "submitter": "Maria D'Errico", "authors": "Maria d'Errico, Alessandro Laio and Guido L.
