To manage future uncertainty related\nto life expectancy, various insurance institutions have resolved to come up\nwith financial instruments that are indexed-linked to the longevity of the\npopulation.

The zero-coupon bonds yields are used as inputs for\nthe estimation process. The results of the analysis are gotten from the monthly\nobservations of U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds from December, 1992 to January,\n1993. The empirical evidence indicates that to model properly the historical\nmortality trends at different ages, both the survival rate and the yield data\nare needed to achieve a satisfactory empirical fit over the zero coupon\nlongevity bond term structure.
