Under the quantitative approach, the puzzle is\nreformulated into a nearest correlation matrix problem which can be used either\nas a stand-alone estimate or to re-establish positive-semi-definiteness of any\nother model's estimate. From an economic approach, it is discussed how expected\ncorrelations between stocks and risk factors (like CAPM, Fama-French) can be\ntranslated into a feasible implied correlation matrix.

In the first problem, we derive a\nstochastic control model to optimize banks' dividend and recapitalization\npolicies and calibrate that to a sample of U.S. banks in the situation where we\nmodel banks' true accounting asset values as partially observed variables due\nto the opaqueness in banks' assets. By the calibrated model, the noise in\nreported accounting asset values hides about one-third of the true asset return\nvolatility and raises the banks' market equity value by 7.8\\% because the noise\nhides the banks' solvency risk from banking regulators. Particularly, those\nbanks with a high level of loan loss provisions, nonperforming assets, and real\nestate loans, and with a low volatility of reported total assets have noisy\naccounting asset values. Because of the substantial shock on the true asset\nvalues, the banks' assets were more opaque during the recent financial crisis.\nIn the second problem, we present an optimal portfolio selection model with\nvoluntary retirement option in an economic situation, where an investor is\nfacing borrowing and short sale constraints, as well as the cointegration\nbetween the stock and labor markets.

First we prove that the $\\alpha$-quantile hedging price converges to the\nsuperhedging price at time $0$ for $\\alpha$ tending to $1$, and show that the\n$\\alpha$-quantile hedging price can be approximated by a neural network-based\nprice. This provides a neural network-based approximation for the superhedging\nprice at time $0$ and also the superhedging strategy up to maturity. To obtain\nthe superhedging price process for $t>0$, by using the Doob decomposition it is\nsufficient to determine the process of consumption. We show that it can be\napproximated by the essential supremum over a set of neural networks. Finally,\nwe present numerical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:37:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Biagini", "Francesca", ""], ["Gonon", "Lukas", ""], ["Reitsam", "Thomas", ""]]}]
