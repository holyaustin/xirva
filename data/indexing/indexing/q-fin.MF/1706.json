More specifically, we are interested in the NIG\n(normal inverse Gaussian) the VG (variance gamma) models. The exponential Levy\nmodels produce incomplete markets. There are therefore an infinite number of\nequivalent martingale measures. We are interested in two methods of\nconstructing of the risk-neutral measures. The first is based on the Esscher\ntransform, and the other consists of bringing a risk-neutral correction on the\ndynamics of the trajectories. It turns out, according to the numerical results\nobtained, that the two methods generally produce the same prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 23:35:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Berdjane", "Belkacem", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01813", "submitter": "Max Reppen", "authors": "Max Reppen and Jean-Charles Rochet and H.
