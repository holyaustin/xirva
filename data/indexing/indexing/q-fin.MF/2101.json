We discuss the stochastic control problem\nobtained by setting up the hedging portfolio and derive the optimal hedging\nstrategy. Furthermore, a (dual) forward indifference price representation of\nthe claim and its PDE are obtained. With these results, the residual risk\nprocess representing the basis risk (hedging error), pay-off decompositions and\nasymptotic expansions of the indifference price in the European case are\nderived.
