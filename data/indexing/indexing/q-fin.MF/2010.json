To accomplish this we make two key\ncontributions. First, we propose a dynamic default contagion model with\nendogenous early defaults for a finite set of banks, generalising the\nGai-Kapadia framework. Second, we reformulate this system as a stochastic\nparticle system leading to a limiting mean-field problem. We study the\nexistence of these clearing systems and, for the mean-field problem, the\ncontinuity of the system response.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 22:05:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2021 12:48:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Jul 2021 12:45:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Feinstein", "Zachary", ""], ["Sojmark", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15757", "submitter": "Stefan Kremsner", "authors": "Stefan Kremsner and Alexander Steinicke and Michaela Sz\\\"olgyenyi", "title": "A deep neural network algorithm for semilinear elliptic PDEs with\n  applications in insurance mathematics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Risks, 8(4):136, 2020", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In insurance mathematics optimal control problems over an infinite time\nhorizon arise when computing risk measures.
