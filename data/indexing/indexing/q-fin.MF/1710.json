Motivated by the fact that this issue is of paramount\nconcern to conservative investors, we dispense with the classical variance as\nthe risk metric and work with drawdown and mean return as the risk-reward pair.\nIn this setting, the main results in this paper address the so-called\n\"efficiency\" of linear time-invariant (LTI) investment feedback strategies\nwhich correspond to Markowitz-style schemes in the finance literature. Our\nanalysis begins with the following principle which is widely used in finance:\nGiven two investment opportunities, if one of them has higher risk and lower\nreturn, it will be deemed to be inefficient or strictly dominated and generally\nrejected in the marketplace. In this framework, with risk-reward pair as\ndescribed above, our main result is that classical Markowitz-style strategies\nare inefficient. To establish this, we use a new investment strategy which\ninvolves a time-varying linear feedback block K(k), called the drawdown\nmodulator. Using this instead of the original LTI feedback block K in the\nMarkowitz scheme, the desired domination is obtained. As a bonus, it is also\nseen that the modulator assures a worst-case level of drawdown protection with\nprobability one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Oct 2017 08:17:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:05:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Chung-Han", ""], ["Barmish", "B.
