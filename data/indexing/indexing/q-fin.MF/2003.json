This oscillation is the result of the temporary market\nimpact caused by waves of buyers and sellers.

They hold that position until one of\nthree outcomes occur: (1) they achieve the targeted profit; (2) they experience\na maximum tolerated loss; (3) the position is held beyond a maximum tolerated\nhorizon.\n  All market makers are confronted with the problem of defining profit-taking\nand stop-out levels. More generally, all execution traders acting on behalf of\na client must determine at what levels an order must be fulfilled. Those\noptimal levels can be determined by maximizing the trader's Sharpe ratio in the\ncontext of O-U processes via Monte Carlo experiments.
