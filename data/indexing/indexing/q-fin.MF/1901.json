Our setup is based on a general\nstatistically-constructed factor model with mean-reverting residuals, in which\nwe show how to construct analytically market-neutral portfolios and we analyze\nthe problem of investing optimally in continuous time and finite horizon under\nexponential and mean-variance utilities. We also extend our model to\nincorporate constraints on the investor's portfolio like dollar-neutrality and\nmarket frictions in the form of temporary quadratic transaction costs, provide\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations of the previous strategies with 100 assets,\nand describe further possible extensions of our work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jan 2019 03:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 03:52:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 Dec 2019 03:41:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2021 20:24:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Guijarro-Ordonez", "Jorge", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.09647", "submitter": "Blanka Horvath", "authors": "Blanka Horvath, Aitor Muguruza, and Mehdi Tomas", "title": "Deep Learning Volatility", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a neural network based calibration method that performs the\ncalibration task within a few milliseconds for the full implied volatility\nsurface. The framework is consistently applicable throughout a range of\nvolatility models -including the rough volatility family- and a range of\nderivative contracts. The aim of neural networks in this work is an off-line\napproximation of complex pricing functions, which are difficult to represent or\ntime-consuming to evaluate by other means. We highlight how this perspective\nopens new horizons for quantitative modelling: The calibration bottleneck posed\nby a slow pricing of derivative contracts is lifted. This brings several\nnumerical pricers and model families (such as rough volatility models) within\nthe scope of applicability in industry practice. The form in which information\nfrom available data is extracted and stored influences network performance:\nThis approach is inspired by representing the implied volatility and option\nprices as a collection of pixels. In a number of applications we demonstrate\nthe prowess of this modelling approach regarding accuracy, speed, robustness\nand generality and also its potentials towards model recognition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2019 13:56:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Aug 2019 22:36:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Horvath", "Blanka", ""], ["Muguruza", "Aitor", ""], ["Tomas", "Mehdi", ""]]}]
