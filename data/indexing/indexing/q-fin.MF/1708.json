A distinctive feature of this\nfamily of games is the fact that the agents do not have any exogenously given\nfundamental value for the asset, and they deduce the value of their position\nfrom the bid and ask prices posted by other agents (i.e. they are pure\nspeculators). As a result, in such a game, the reward function of each agent,\nat the time of stopping, depends directly on the controls of other players. The\nequilibrium problem leads naturally to a system of coupled control-stopping\nproblems (or, equivalently, Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential\nEquations (RBSDEs)), in which the individual reward functions (or, reflecting\nbarriers) depend on the value functions (or, solution components) of other\nagents. The resulting system, in general, presents multiple mathematical\nchallenges due to the non-standard form of coupling (or, reflection). In the\npresent case, this system is also complicated by the fact that the continuous\ncontrols of the agents, describing their posted bid and ask prices, are\nconstrained to take values in a discrete grid. The latter feature reflects the\npresence of a positive tick size in the market, and it creates additional\ndiscontinuities in the agents reward functions (or, reflecting barriers).\nHerein, we prove the existence of a solution to the associated system in a\nspecial Markovian framework, provide numerical examples, and discuss the\npotential applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 20:46:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 03:19:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gayduk", "Roman", ""], ["Nadtochiy", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.01561", "submitter": "Zachary Feinstein", "authors": "Zachary Feinstein, Weijie Pang, Birgit Rudloff, Eric Schaanning,\n  Stephan Sturm, Mackenzie Wildman", "title": "Sensitivity of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector to individual interbank\n  liabilities", "comments": "37 pages", "journal-ref": "SIAM J.

The interbank liabilities matrix is a crucial input to the\ncomputation of the clearing vector.

As a result, the clearing vector may\nsuffer from estimation errors in the liabilities matrix. We quantify the\nclearing vector's sensitivity to such estimation errors and show that its\ndirectional derivatives are, like the clearing vector itself, solutions of\nfixed point equations. We describe estimation errors utilizing a basis for the\nspace of matrices representing permissible perturbations and derive analytical\nsolutions to the maximal deviations of the Eisenberg-Noe clearing vector. This\nallows us to compute upper bounds for the worst case perturbations of the\nclearing vector in our simple setting. Moreover, we quantify the probability of\nobserving clearing vector deviations of a certain magnitude, for uniformly or\nnormally distributed errors in the relative liability matrix.\n  Applying our methodology to a dataset of European banks, we find that\nperturbations to the relative liabilities can result in economically sizeable\ndifferences that could lead to an underestimation of the risk of contagion.
