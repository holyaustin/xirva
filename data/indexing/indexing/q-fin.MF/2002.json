Using return\ndata for bitcoin, ethereum and ripple which account for over 70% of the\ncyrptocurrency market, we demonstrate that $\\alpha$-stable distribution models\nhighly speculative cryptocurrencies more robustly compared to other heavy\ntailed distributions that are used in financial econometrics. We find that the\nMaximum Likelihood Method proposed by DuMouchel (1971) produces estimates that\nfit the cryptocurrency return data much better than the quantile based approach\nof McCulloch (1986) and sample characteristic method by Koutrouvelis (1980).\nThe empirical results show that the leptokurtic feature presented in\ncryptocurrencies' return data can be captured by an ${\\alpha}$-stable\ndistribution.

Our contribution is manifold and extends several aspects of the\ngeometric step option pricing literature. First, we provide symmetry and parity\nrelations and derive various characterizations for both European-type and\nAmerican-type geometric double barrier step options. In particular, we are able\nto obtain a jump-diffusion disentanglement for the early exercise premium of\nAmerican-type geometric double barrier step contracts and its\nmaturity-randomized equivalent as well as to characterize the diffusion and\njump contributions to these early exercise premiums separately by means of\npartial integro-differential equations and ordinary integro-differential\nequations. As an application of our characterizations, we derive\nsemi-analytical pricing results for (regular) European-type and American-type\ngeometric down-and-out step call options under hyper-exponential jump-diffusion\nmodels. Lastly, we use the latter results to discuss the early exercise\nstructure of geometric step options once jumps are added and to subsequently\nprovide an analysis of the impact of jumps on the price and hedging parameters\nof (European-type and American-type) geometric step contracts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Feb 2020 14:21:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Farkas", "Walter", ""], ["Mathys", "Ludovic", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.10194", "submitter": "Len Patrick Dominic Garces", "authors": "Len Patrick Dominic M.

Pricing is performed under an equivalent\nmartingale measure obtained by setting the second asset yield process as the\nnumeraire asset, as suggested by Bjerskund and Stensland (1993). Such a choice\nfor the numeraire reduces the exchange option pricing problem, a\ntwo-dimensional problem, to pricing a call option written on the ratio of the\nyield processes of the two assets, a one-dimensional problem. The joint\ntransition density function of the asset yield ratio process and the\ninstantaneous variance process is then determined from the corresponding\nKolmogorov backward equation via integral transforms. We then determine\nintegral representations for the European exchange option price and the early\nexercise premium and state a linked system of integral equations that\ncharacterizes the American exchange option price and the associated early\nexercise boundary. Properties of the early exercise boundary near maturity are\nalso discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 12:21:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Garces", "Len Patrick Dominic M.", ""], ["Cheang", "Gerald H.
