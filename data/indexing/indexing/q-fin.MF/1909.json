However, a few papers\nhave pointed out a puzzle: the return distributions of many assets do not\nappear to be affected by the leverage effect. We analyze the determinants of\nthe return distribution and find that the impact of the leverage effect comes\nprimarily from an interaction between the leverage effect and the\nmean-reversion effect. When the leverage effect is large and the mean-reversion\neffect is small, then the interaction exerts a strong effect on the return\ndistribution. However, if the mean-reversion effect is large, even a large\nleverage effect has little effect on the return distribution. To better\nunderstand the impact of the interaction effect, we propose an indirect method\nto measure it. We apply our methodology to empirical data and find that the S&P\n500 data exhibits a weak interaction effect, and consequently its returns\ndistribution is little impacted by the leverage effect. Furthermore, the\ninteraction effect is closely related to the size factor: small firms tend to\nhave a strong interaction effect and large firms tend to have a weak\ninteraction effect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Sep 2019 19:01:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:14:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Dangxing", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.10035", "submitter": "Zhibai Zhang", "authors": "Peter Carr, Liuren Wu, Zhibai Zhang", "title": "Using Machine Learning to Predict Realized Variance", "comments": "15 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we formulate a regression problem to predict realized\nvolatility by using option price data and enhance VIX-styled volatility\nindices' predictability and liquidity.

This can for example model\na situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which\nintervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow\n& Protter for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian\nmotion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas & Shreve (in the continuous\nsetting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in\nthe case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there\nis a delay in the system.\n  In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift\nterm modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay \\theta>0\nin the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price\ndynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump\nprocess (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are\nessential in order to get more realistic financial market models.\n  Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate\nand portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long\nas the delay \\theta> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market\nin that case. However, when \\theta goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This\nis in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no\ndelay.\n  Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because\nhigh frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close\nto infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on\ntime sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the\npricing dynamics.
