Multiple assets with\ndifferent liquidity levels are available for hedging. Our risk criterion\ntargets a tradeoff between minimizing the risk against fluctuations in the\nstock price and incurring low liquidity costs. Following \\c{C}etin U., Jarrow\nR.A., and Protter P. (2004) we work in an arbitrage-free setting assuming a\nsupply curve for each asset. In discrete time, following the ideas in Schweizer\nM. (1998) and Lamberton D., Pham H., Schweizer M. (1998) we prove the existence\nof a locally risk-minimizing strategy under mild conditions on the price\nprocess. Under stochastic and time-dependent liquidity risk we give a\nclosed-form solution for an optimal strategy in the case of a linear supply\ncurve model. Finally we show how our hedging method can be applied in energy\nmarkets where futures with different maturities are available for trading. The\nfutures closest to their delivery period are usually the most liquid but\ndepending on the contingent claim not necessary optimal in terms of hedging. In\na simulation study we investigate this tradeoff and compare the resulting hedge\nstrategies with the classical ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 10:17:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:36:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Christodoulou", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Detering", "Nils", ""], ["Meyer-Brandis", "Thilo", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.07352", "submitter": "Tiziano De Angelis Dr", "authors": "Tiziano De Angelis, Fabien Gensbittel, St\\'ephane Villeneuve", "title": "A Dynkin game on assets with incomplete information on the return", "comments": "37 pages, 1 figure, new Section 8 added; keywords: Zero-sum games;\n  Nash equilibrium; incomplete information; free boundaries;", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.OC q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies a 2-players zero-sum Dynkin game arising from pricing an\noption on an asset whose rate of return is unknown to both players.

Based on this finding, the paper\ntheorizes that price displacements are constrained, meaning they have extreme\nvalues beyond which they cannot go when measured over a large number of\nsequential periods. By assuming price displacements are also subject to the\nprinciple of stationary action, the paper explores a method for measuring\nspecific probabilities of future price displacements based on prior historical\ndata.
