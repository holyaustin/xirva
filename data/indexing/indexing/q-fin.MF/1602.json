A company\nextracts a natural resource from a reserve with finite capacity, and sells it\nin the market at a spot price that evolves according to a Brownian motion with\nvolatility modulated by a two-state Markov chain. In this setting, the company\naims at finding the extraction rule that maximizes its expected discounted cash\nflow, net of the costs of extraction and maintenance of the reserve. We provide\nexpressions both for the value function and for the optimal control. On the one\nhand, if the running cost for the maintenance of the reserve is a convex\nfunction of the reserve level, the optimal extraction rule prescribes a\nSkorokhod reflection of the (optimally) controlled state process at a certain\nstate and price dependent threshold. On the other hand, in presence of a\nconcave running cost function it is optimal to instantaneously deplete the\nreserve at the time at which the commodity's price exceeds an endogenously\ndetermined critical level. In both cases, the threshold triggering the optimal\ncontrol is given in terms of the optimal stopping boundary of an auxiliary\nfamily of perpetual optimal selling problems with regime switching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 13:25:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:38:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 09:43:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 10:56:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrari", "Giorgio", ""], ["Yang", "Shuzhen", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06998", "submitter": "Jin Hyuk Choi", "authors": "Jin Hyuk Choi", "title": "Optimal consumption and investment with liquid and illiquid assets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an optimal consumption/investment problem to maximize expected\nutility from consumption.
