In this paper we develop a bivariate model in\ncontinuous time to describe the price dynamics of one BitCoin as well as the\nbehavior of a second factor affecting the price itself, which we name\nconfidence indicator. The two dynamics are possibly correlated and we also take\ninto account a delay between the confidence indicator and its delivered effect\non the BitCoin price. Statistical properties of the suggested model are\ninvestigated and its arbitrage-free property is shown. Further, based on\nrisk-neutral evaluation, a quasi-closed formula is derived for European style\nderivatives on the BitCoin. A short numerical application is finally provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 11:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cretarola", "Alessandra", ""], ["Fig\u00e0-Talamanca", "Gianna", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01175", "submitter": "Takanori Adachi", "authors": "Takanori Adachi and Yoshihiro Ryu", "title": "Monetary value measures in a category of probability spaces", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We generalize the notion of monetary value measures developed with category\ntheory in [Adachi, 2014] by extending their base category from the category\n\\c{hi} to the category of probability spaces Prob introduced in [Adachi and\nRyu, 2016].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 21:42:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Adachi", "Takanori", ""], ["Ryu", "Yoshihiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01385", "submitter": "Masaaki Fukasawa", "authors": "Masaaki Fukasawa and Mitja Stadje", "title": "Perfect hedging under endogenous permanent market impacts", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We model a nonlinear price curve quoted in a market as the utility\nindifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier.
