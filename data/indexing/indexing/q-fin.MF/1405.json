We\ntake the exchange to be an order-driven market and propose a continuous-time\nsetup for the best bid price and the market spread, both modelled by L\\'evy\nprocesses. Effects on the best bid price arising from the arrival of limit buy\norders at more favourable prices, the incoming market sell orders potentially\nwalking the book, and deriving from the cancellations of limit sell orders at\nthe best ask price are incorporated in the proposed price dynamics. A permanent\nimpact that occurs when 'lit' pool trades cannot be avoided is built in, and an\ninstantaneous impact that models the slippage, to which all 'lit' exchange\ntrades are subject, is also considered. We assume that the trading price in the\ndark pool is the mid-price and that no fees are due for posting orders. We\nallow for partial trade executions in the dark pool, and we find the optimal\ntrading strategy in both venues. Since the mid-price is taken from the\nexchange, the dynamics of the limit order book also affects the optimal\nallocation of shares in the dark pool. We propose a general objective function\nand we show that, subject to suitable technical conditions, the value function\ncan be characterised by the unique continuous viscosity solution to the\nassociated partial integro differential equation. We present two explicit\nexamples of the price and the spread models, and derive the associated optimal\ntrading strategy numerically. We discuss the various degrees of the agent's\nrisk aversion and further show that roundtrips, i.e. posting the remaining\ninventory in the dark pool at every point in time, are not necessarily\nbeneficial.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 May 2014 17:11:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 09:37:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 15:32:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 13:26:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Crisafi", "M.
