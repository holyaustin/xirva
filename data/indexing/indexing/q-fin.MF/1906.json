Besides ambiguity itself, we take into account how ambiguity-averse\nan agent is. This inclusion of ambiguity attitude, via an $\\alpha$-maxmin\nnonlinear expectation, renders the stopping problem time-inconsistent. We look\nfor subgame perfect equilibrium stopping policies, formulated as fixed points\nof an operator. For a one-dimensional diffusion with drift and volatility\nuncertainty, we show that every equilibrium can be obtained through a\nfixed-point iteration. This allows us to capture much more diverse behavior,\ndepending on an agent's ambiguity attitude, beyond the standard worst-case (or\nbest-case) analysis. In a concrete example of real options valuation under\nvolatility uncertainty, all equilibrium stopping policies, as well as the best\none among them, are fully characterized. It demonstrates explicitly the effect\nof ambiguity attitude on decision making: the more ambiguity-averse, the more\neager to stop -- so as to withdraw from the uncertain environment. The main\nresult hinges on a delicate analysis of continuous sample paths in the\ncanonical space and the capacity theory. To resolve measurability issues, a\ngeneralized measurable projection theorem, new to the literature, is also\nestablished.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2019 07:03:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2019 04:06:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 28 Mar 2021 23:39:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Yu-Jui", ""], ["Yu", "Xiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.02216", "submitter": "Alex Garivaltis", "authors": "Alex Garivaltis", "title": "Game-Theoretic Optimal Portfolios in Continuous Time", "comments": "14 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Economic Theory Bulletin, pp.1-9 (2018)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM econ.GN econ.TH q-fin.EC q-fin.GN q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a two-person trading game in continuous time whereby each player\nchooses a constant rebalancing rule $b$ that he must adhere to over $[0,t]$.
