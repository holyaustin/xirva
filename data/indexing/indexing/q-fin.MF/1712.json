The central bank can purchase\nand sell the foreign currency, and each intervention on the exchange market\nleads to a proportional cost whose instantaneous marginal value depends on the\ncurrent level of the exchange rate. The central bank aims at minimizing the\ntotal expected costs of interventions on the exchange market, plus a total\nexpected holding cost. We formulate this problem as an infinite time-horizon\nstochastic control problem with controls that have paths which are locally of\nbounded variation. The exchange rate evolves as a general linearly controlled\none-dimensional diffusion, and the two nondecreasing processes giving the\nminimal decomposition of a bounded-variation control model the cumulative\namount of foreign currency that has been purchased and sold by the central\nbank. We provide a complete solution to this problem by finding the explicit\nexpression of the value function and a complete characterization of the optimal\ncontrol. At each instant of time, the optimally controlled exchange rate is\nkept within a band whose size is endogenously determined as part of the\nsolution to the problem. We also study the expected exit time from the band,\nand the sensitivity of the width of the band with respect to the model's\nparameters in the case when the exchange rate evolves (in absence of any\nintervention) as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and the marginal costs of\ncontrols are constant.
