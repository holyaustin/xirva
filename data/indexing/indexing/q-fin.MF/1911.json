We incorporate the predictability of stock\nreturns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula.

The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's\npredictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing\nfunction of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These\nempirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices\nby spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price\nsignificantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the\nunderlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing\nformula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return\npredictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock\nreturn predictability is the same for both types of traders.

Based on switching ARCH\n(SWARCH) filtering probabilities of the high volatility regime, the proposed\nEWS first classifies stock market crises according to an indicator function\nwith thresholds dynamically selected by the two-peak method. A hybrid algorithm\nis then developed in the framework of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network\nto make daily predictions that alert turmoils. In the empirical evaluation\nbased on ten-year Chinese stock data, the proposed EWS yields satisfying\nresults with the test-set accuracy of $96.6\\%$ and on average $2.4$ days of the\nforewarned period. The model's stability and practical value in real-time\ndecision-making are also proven by the cross-validation and back-testing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 08:52:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Peiwan", ""], ["Zong", "Lu", ""], ["Ma", "Ye", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.12944", "submitter": "Hyungbin Park", "authors": "Hyungbin Park and Jonghwa Park", "title": "Pricing and hedging short-maturity Asian options in local volatility\n  models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses the short-maturity behavior of Asian option prices and\nhedging portfolios. We consider the risk-neutral valuation and the delta value\nof the Asian option having a H\\\"older continuous payoff function in a local\nvolatility model. The main idea of this analysis is that the local volatility\nmodel can be approximated by a Gaussian process at short maturity $T.$ By\ncombining this approximation argument with Malliavin calculus, we conclude that\nthe short-maturity behaviors of Asian option prices and the delta values are\napproximately expressed as those of their European counterparts with volatility\n$$\\sigma_{A}(T):=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T^3}\\int_0^T\\sigma^2(t,S_0)(T-t)^2\\,dt}\\,,$$\nwhere $\\sigma(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the local volatility function and $S_0$ is the\ninitial value of the stock. In addition, we show that the convergence rate of\nthe approximation is determined by the H\\\"older exponent of the payoff\nfunction.

Various\nwell-studied stochastic volatility models with and without self-exciting\nprice/volatility co-jumps are obtained as special cases under different scaling\nregimes.

This refined\nBN-S model is more efficient and has fewer parameters than other models which\nare used in practice as improvements of the BN-S model.
