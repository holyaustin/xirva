The purpose of this paper is to specify a\ngeneral methodological framework that is flexible enough to cover a wide range\nof possibilities to design systemic risk measures via multi-dimensional\nacceptance sets and aggregation functions, and to study corresponding examples.\nExisting systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal\ncapital needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In\ncontrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be\ninterpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by\nallocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual\nrisks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of\nsystemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations. Moreover, we also allow\nfor the possibility of allocating the funds according to the future state of\nthe system (random allocation).
