A series of analytical\nand numerical results are provided to illustrate the non-trivial optimal\nliquidation strategies under geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and exponential\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck models. We examine the combined effects of price dynamics\nand risk penalty on the sell and delay regions for various options.

We establish, using the Replica method, the asymptotic global law\nestimate for three general classes of noisy matrices, significantly extending\npreviously obtained results. We give exact results concerning the asymptotic\ndeviations (called overlaps) of the perturbed eigenvectors away from the true\nones, and we explain how to use these overlaps to \"clean\" the noisy eigenvalues\nof $\\textbf{M}$. We provide some numerical checks for the different estimators\nproposed in this paper and we also make the connection with some well known\nresults of Bayesian statistics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 09:58:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:21:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bun", "Jo\u00ebl", ""], ["Allez", "Romain", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Potters", "Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07397", "submitter": "Andrea Macrina", "authors": "Stephane Crepey, Andrea Macrina, Tuyet Mai Nguyen, David Skovmand", "title": "Rational Multi-Curve Models with Counterparty-Risk Valuation Adjustments", "comments": "34 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a multi-curve term structure setup in which the modelling\ningredients are expressed by rational functionals of Markov processes.
