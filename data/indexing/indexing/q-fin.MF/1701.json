Its popularity\narose from a tractable asymptotic expansion for implied volatility, derived by\nheat kernel methods. As markets moved to historically low rates, this expansion\nappeared to yield inconsistent prices. Since the model is deeply embedded in\nmarket practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in\nnumerous approaches in recent years. All standard option pricing methods make\ncertain regularity assumptions on the underlying model, but for SABR these are\nrarely satisfied. We examine here regularity properties of the model from this\nperspective with view to a number of (asymptotic and numerical) option pricing\nmethods. In particular, we highlight delicate degeneracies of the SABR model\n(and related processes) at the origin, which deem the currently used popular\nheat kernel methods and all related methods from (sub-) Riemannian geometry\nill-suited for SABR-type processes, when interest rates are near zero. We\ndescribe a more general semigroup framework, which permits to derive a suitable\ngeometry for SABR-type processes (in certain parameter regimes) via symmetric\nDirichlet forms. Furthermore, we derive regularity properties (Feller-\nproperties and strong continuity properties) necessary for the applicability of\npopular numerical schemes to SABR-semigroups, and identify suitable Banach- and\nHilbert spaces for these.

The uncertainty about the drift is\nrepresented by an arbitrary probability distribution; the stochastic volatility\nis modelled by $m$-state Markov chain. Using filtering theory, an equivalent\nreformulation of the original problem as a four-dimensional optimal stopping\nproblem is found and then analysed by constructing approximating sequences of\nthree-dimensional optimal stopping problems. An optimal liquidation strategy\nand various structural properties of the problem are determined. Analysis of\nthe two-point prior case is presented in detail, building on which, an outline\nof the extension to the general prior case is given.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 13:13:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Jan 2018 08:24:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Vaicenavicius", "Juozas", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08861", "submitter": "Dylan Possama\\\"i", "authors": "Romuald Elie and Ludovic Moreau and Dylan Possama\\\"i", "title": "On a class of path-dependent singular stochastic control problems", "comments": "33 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies a class of non$-$Markovian singular stochastic control\nproblems, for which we provide a novel probabilistic representation. The\nsolution of such control problem is proved to identify with the solution of a\n$Z-$constrained BSDE, with dynamics associated to a non singular underlying\nforward process. Due to the non$-$Markovian environment, our main argumentation\nrelies on the use of comparison arguments for path dependent PDEs. Our\nrepresentation allows in particular to quantify the regularity of the solution\nto the singular stochastic control problem in terms of the space and time\ninitial data. Our framework also extends to the consideration of degenerate\ndiffusions, leading to the representation of the solution as the infimum of\nsolutions to $Z-$constrained BSDEs. As an application, we study the utility\nmaximisation problem with transaction costs for non$-$Markovian dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 22:35:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:16:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Elie", "Romuald", ""], ["Moreau", "Ludovic", ""], ["Possama\u00ef", "Dylan", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08972", "submitter": "Takashi Kato", "authors": "Takashi Kato", "title": "An Optimal Execution Problem in the Volume-Dependent Almgren-Chriss\n  Model", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, we introduce an explicit trading-volume process into the\nAlmgren-Chriss model, which is a standard model for optimal execution.
