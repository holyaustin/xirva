A firm aims at meeting a random demand of the\ncommodity at a random time by maximizing total expected profits. We model the\nfirm's optimal procurement problem as a singular stochastic control problem in\nwhich controls are nondecreasing processes and represent the cumulative\ninvestment made by the firm in the spot market (a so-called stochastic\n\"monotone follower problem\"). We assume a general exponential L\\'evy process\nfor the commodity's spot price, rather than the commonly used geometric\nBrownian motion, and general convex holding costs.\n  We obtain necessary and sufficient first order conditions for optimality and\nwe provide the optimal procurement policy in terms of a \"base inventory\"\nprocess; that is, a minimal time-dependent desirable inventory level that the\nfirm's manager must reach at any time. In particular, in the case of linear\nholding costs and exponentially distributed demand, we are also able to obtain\nthe explicit analytic form of the optimal policy and a probabilistic\nrepresentation of the optimal revenue. The paper is completed by some computer\ndrawings of the optimal inventory when spot prices are given by a geometric\nBrownian motion and by an exponential jump-diffusion process. In the first case\nwe also make a numerical comparison between the value function and the revenue\nassociated to the classical static \"newsvendor\" strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 11:17:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 07:52:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chiarolla", "Maria B.", ""], ["Ferrari", "Giorgio", ""], ["Stabile", "Gabriele", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.1393", "submitter": "Jia-Wen Gu", "authors": "Wai-Ki Ching, Jia-Wen Gu and Harry Zheng", "title": "On Correlated Defaults and Incomplete Information", "comments": "24 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study a continuous time structural asset value model for\ntwo correlated firms using a two-dimensional Brownian motion.
