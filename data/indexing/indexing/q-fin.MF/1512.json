The\nproblem of such type leads to three dimensional nonlinear\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Such equations are not only tedious\nfor analytical methods but are also quite challenging form a numeric point of\nview. To reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one or even\nto an ODE one usually uses some substitutions, yet the methods used to find\nsuch substitutions are rarely discussed by the authors.\n  We find the admitted Lie algebra for a broad class of liquidation time\ndistributions in cases of HARA and log utility functions and formulate\ncorresponding theorems for all these cases. We use found Lie algebras to obtain\nreductions of the studied equations. Several of similar substitutions were used\nin other papers before whereas others are new to our knowledge. This method\ngives us the possibility to provide a complete set of non-equivalent\nsubstitutions and reduced equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Dec 2015 22:37:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bordag", "Ljudmila A.", ""], ["Yamshchikov", "Ivan P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06454", "submitter": "Philipp Harms", "authors": "Philipp Harms, David Stefanovits, Josef Teichmann, Mario V.

For uncollateralized customer\ntrades, MVA can be transferred to the customer via an extension of the\nliability-side pricing theory. For BCBS-IOSCO covered OTC derivatives, a market\nmaker has to charge financial counterparties a bid-ask spread to transfer its\nfunding cost. An IM multiplier is applied to calibrate to external IM models to\nallow portfolio incremental pricing. In particular, a link to ISDA SIMM for\nequity, commodity and fx risks is established through the PDE with its vega and\ncurvature IM components captured fully. Numerical examples are given for swaps\nand equity portfolios and offer a plausible attribution of recent CME-LCH basis\nspread widening to elevated MVA accompanying dealers' hedging of customer\nflows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 02:30:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 00:39:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 20:34:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lou", "Wujiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.07340", "submitter": "Wujiang Lou", "authors": "Wujiang Lou", "title": "Liability-side Pricing of Swaps and Coherent CVA and FVA by\n  Regression/Simulation", "comments": "19 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures; Global Derivatives USA Conference\n  (2014), Chicago", "journal-ref": "Liability-side pricing of swaps, RISK, April 2016, pp 66-71", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An uncollateralized swap hedged back-to-back by a CCP swap is used to\nintroduce FVA. The open IR01 of FVA, however, is a sure sign of risk not being\nfully hedged, a theoretical no-arbitrage pricing concern, and a bait to lure\nmarket risk capital, a practical business concern. By dynamically trading the\nCCP swap, with the liability-side counterparty provides counterparty exposure\nhedge and swap funding, we find that the uncollateralized swap can be fully\nreplicated, leaving out no IR01 leakage. The fair value of the swap is obtained\nby applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to\ncounterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a\nliability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of\nfunding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is\nredefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation\nadjustment, coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz\nstyle least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the\nrecursive fair value and adjustments. A separately developed finite difference\nscheme is used to test and find regression necessary to decouple the discount\nrate switch. Preliminary results show the impact of counterparty risk to swap\nhedge ratios, swap bid/ask spreads, and valuation adjustments, and considerable\nerrors of calculating CVA by discounting cash flow or potential future\nexposure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 02:42:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lou", "Wujiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08037", "submitter": "Roger Laeven", "authors": "Louis R.
