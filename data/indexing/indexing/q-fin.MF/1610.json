The main effect of temporary market impact is to slow down the speed\nof convergence to this constant Merton portfolio. The effect of permanent\nmarket impact is to incentivize the FI to buy additional risky assets near the\nend of the period.

In\nthis paper we generalize the natural retirement income tontine introduced by\nMilevsky and Salisbury (2015) by combining heterogeneous cohorts into one pool.\nWe engineer this scheme by allocating tontine shares at either a premium or a\ndiscount to par based on both the age of the investor and the amount they\ninvest.

This paper aims to unify and generalize several of\nthe widely-used pricing approaches for long-dated contracts with a focus on\nstylized CAT bonds and market-consistent valuation.

A loading degree controls how much influence\nthe formally obtained risk neutral price has on the market price. A key finding\nis that this loading degree has to be constant for a minimally fluctuating\ncontract, and is an important, measurable characteristic for prices of\nlong-dated contracts. Loading pricing allows long-dated, insurance-type\ncontracts to be priced less expensively and with higher return on investment\nthan under classical pricing approaches.

They\npromised enormous rewards to the last survivors at the expense of those died\nearly. And, while this design appealed to the gambling instinc}, it is a\nsuboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life\nannuities making constant payments -- where the insurance company is exposed to\nlongevity risk -- induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not\nhave to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared\namongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not\nsell actuarially-fair life annuities, in part due to aggregate longevity risk.\n  We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility. Technically\nspeaking we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to\n(i.) the size of the tontine pool $n$, and (ii.) individual longevity risk\naversion $\\gamma$. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with $\\gamma$ and\n$n$, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout.\nInterestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as\nlongevity risk aversion $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. We define the natural tontine as\nthe function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival\nprobabilities, which we show is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$ and $n$. We\nconclude by comparing the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded\nlife annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find\nthat the life annuity's advantage over the optimal tontine is minimal.\n  In sum, this paper's contribution is to (i.) rekindle a discussion about a\nretirement income product that has been long neglected, and (ii.) leverage\neconomic theory as well as tools from mathematical finance to design the next\ngeneration of tontine annuities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 19:51:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Milevsky", "Moshe A.", ""], ["Salisbury", "Thomas S.", ""]]}]
