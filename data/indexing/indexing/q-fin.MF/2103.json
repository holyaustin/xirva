One\nimportant line of research is concerned with mechanisms of clearing, that is,\nthe mechanism by which mutual debts are repaid, in the regular regime, or in a\ndefault regime. One of the first models of a clearing mechanism was proposed by\nEisenberg and Noe and is based on the three rules: limited liability, the\npriority of debt claims over the shareholders' interests, and the equal\npriority of debts (pro-rata rule). These three principles naturally lead to the\nconcept of clearing vector (the vector of the entities' total payments). In\nthis paper, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness\nof clearing vector applicable to an arbitrary topology of the financial\nnetwork. Further, we show that the overall system loss can be reduced if one\nrelaxes the pro-rata rule and replaces the clearing vector by a matrix of\nclearing payments.

Various desirable properties of the presented approach are\nderived including a limit result when considering a large time horizon and the\ncomparison with the frequently used gradient allocation method. In passing, we\nintroduce a second allocation method and discuss its relation to the other\nallocation approaches. A number of examples illustrate the applicability and\nperformance of the allocation approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 11:30:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Delsing", "Guusje", ""], ["Mandjes", "Michel", ""], ["Spreij", "Peter", ""], ["Winands", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16800", "submitter": "Yilun Song", "authors": "Lin He, Zongxia Liang, Yilun Song, Qi Ye", "title": "Optimal Retirement Time and Consumption with the Variation in Habitual\n  Persistence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper,we study the individual's optimal retirement time and optimal\nconsumption under habitual persistence. Because the individual feels equally\nsatisfied with a lower habitual level and is more reluctant to change the\nhabitual level after retirement, we assume that both the level and the\nsensitivity of the habitual consumption decline at the time of retirement. We\nestablish the concise form of the habitual evolutions, and obtain the optimal\nretirement time and consumption policy based on martingale and duality methods.\nThe optimal consumption experiences a sharp decline at retirement, but the\nexcess consumption raises because of the reduced sensitivity of the habitual\nlevel. This result contributes to explain the \"retirement consumption puzzle\".\nParticularly, the optimal retirement and consumption policies are balanced\nbetween the wealth effect and the habitual effect. Larger wealth increases\nconsumption, and larger growth inertia (sensitivity) of the habitual level\ndecreases consumption and brings forward the retirement time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 04:26:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Lin", ""], ["Liang", "Zongxia", ""], ["Song", "Yilun", ""], ["Ye", "Qi", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16918", "submitter": "Olivier Feron", "authors": "Thomas Deschatre and Olivier F\\'eron and Pierre Gruet", "title": "A survey of electricity spot and futures price models for risk\n  management applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This review presents the set of electricity price models proposed in the\nliterature since the opening of power markets.
