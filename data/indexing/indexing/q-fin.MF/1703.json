For the latter problem, our work\ncomplements Sircar & Zariphopoulou (2007), where it is implicitly assumed the\ninvestor is protected against default. We consider a factor model where the\nasset's instantaneous return, variance, correlation and default intensity are\ndriven by a time-homogenous diffusion X taking values in an arbitrary region E.\nWe identify the certainty equivalent with a semi-linear degenerate elliptic\npartial differential equation with quadratic growth in both function and\ngradient. Under a minimal integrability assumption on the market price of risk,\nwe show the certainty equivalent is a classical solution. In particular, our\nresults cover when X is a one-dimensional affine diffusion and when returns,\nvariances and default intensities are also affine. Numerical examples highlight\nthe relationship between the factor process and both the indifference price and\ndefault insurance.

Under\nsome conditions, funding is either a cost or a benefit, i.e., one of the\nlending/borrowing rates does not play a role in pricing derivatives. When\nderivatives are priced, considering different lending/borrowing rates leads to\nsemi-linear BSDEs and PDEs, and thus it is necessary to solve the equations\nnumerically. However, once it can be guaranteed that only one of the rates\naffects pricing, linear equations can be recovered and analytical formulae can\nbe derived. Moreover, as a byproduct, our results explain how debt value\nadjustment (DVA) and funding benefits are dissimilar. It is often believed that\nconsidering both DVA and funding benefits results in a double-counting issue\nbut it will be shown that the two components are affected by different\nmathematical structures of derivative transactions.
