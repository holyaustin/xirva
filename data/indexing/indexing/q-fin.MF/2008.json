We\nuse the intra-personal equilibrium approach to study the problem.\nInterestingly, we find that the only viable outcome is from the median\nmaximization, because for other quantiles either the equilibrium does not exist\nor there is no investment in the risky assets. The median maximization strategy\ngives a simple explanation to why wealthier people invest more percentage of\ntheir wealth in risky assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2020 08:39:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 10:30:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Xue Dong", ""], ["Jiang", "Zhaoli", ""], ["Kou", "Steven", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.11327", "submitter": "Hideaki Aoyama", "authors": "Makoto Mizuno, Hideaki Aoyama, Yoshi Fujiwara", "title": "Untangling the complexity of market competition in consumer goods -A\n  complex Hilbert PCA analysis", "comments": "27 pages with 9 Figures and 7 Tables, including a 2-page Appendix", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0245531", "report-no": "RIKEN-iTHEMS-Report-20", "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Today's consumer goods markets are rapidly evolving with significant growth\nin the number of information media as well as the number of competitive\nproducts. In this environment, obtaining a quantitative grasp of heterogeneous\ninteractions of firms and customers, which have attracted interest of\nmanagement scientists and economists, requires the analysis of extremely\nhigh-dimensional data. Existing approaches in quantitative research could not\nhandle such data without any reliable prior knowledge nor strong assumptions.\nAlternatively, we propose a novel method called complex Hilbert principal\ncomponent analysis (CHPCA) and construct a synchronization network using Hodge\ndecomposition. CHPCA enables us to extract significant comovements with a time\nlead/delay in the data, and Hodge decomposition is useful for identifying the\ntime-structure of correlations. We apply this method to the Japanese beer\nmarket data and reveal comovement of variables related to the consumer choice\nprocess across multiple products. Furthermore, we find remarkable customer\nheterogeneity by calculating the coordinates of each customer in the space\nderived from the results of CHPCA. Lastly, we discuss the policy and managerial\nimplications, limitations, and further development of the proposed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 01:11:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mizuno", "Makoto", ""], ["Aoyama", "Hideaki", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Yoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13082", "submitter": "Ting He", "authors": "Ting He", "title": "Nonparametric Predictive Inference for Asian options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Asian option, as one of the path-dependent exotic options, is widely traded\nin the energy market, either for speculation or hedging.

It is attractive\nto infer the Asian option price with few assumptions of the underlying asset\ndistribution and adopt to the historical data with a nonparametric method. In\nthis paper, we present a novel approach to price the Asian option from an\nimprecise statistical aspect. Nonparametric Predictive Inference (NPI) is\napplied to infer the average value of the future underlying asset price, which\nattempts to make the prediction reflecting more uncertainty because of the\nlimited information.
