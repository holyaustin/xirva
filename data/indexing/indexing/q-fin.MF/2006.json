Also the dynamics of the\nassociated instantaneous forward rate is provided and a condition is derived\nunder which the model can be market-consistently calibrated. The analytical\ntractability of this model is illustrated by the derivation of an explicit\nplain vanilla option price formula. With view on practical applications,\nsuitable probability distributions are proposed for the driving jump processes.\nThe paper is concluded by presenting a post-crisis extension of the proposed\nshort and forward rate model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2020 06:24:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hess", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.15158", "submitter": "Tianjiao Yang", "authors": "Tomoyuki Ichiba, Tianjiao Yang", "title": "Relative Arbitrage Opportunities in $N$ Investors and Mean-Field Regimes", "comments": "33 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The relative arbitrage portfolio, formulated in Stochastic Portfolio Theory\n(SPT), outperforms a benchmark portfolio over a given time-horizon with\nprobability one.
