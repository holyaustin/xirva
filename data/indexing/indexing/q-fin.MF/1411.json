The aim is to derive a filter for the underlying continuous-time Markov\nchain. The recursion formula for the discrete-time filter is easy to derive,\nhowever involves densities which are very hard to obtain. In this paper we\nderive exact formulas for the necessary densities in the case the state space\nof the HMM consists of two elements only. This is done by relating the\nunderlying integrated continuous-time Markov chain to the so-called asymmetric\ntelegraph process and by using recent results on this process. In case the\nstate space consists of more than two elements we present three different ways\nto approximate the densities for the filter. The first approach is based on the\ncontinuous filter problem. The second approach is to derive a PDE for the\ndensities and solve it numerically and the third approach is a crude discrete\ntime approximation of the Markov chain. All three approaches are compared in a\nnumerical study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 10:20:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 12:40:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e4uerle", "Nicole", ""], ["Gilitschenski", "Igor", ""], ["Hanebeck", "Uwe D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.1229", "submitter": "Yan Dolinsky", "authors": "Peter Bank, Yan Dolinsky, and Selim G\\\"okay", "title": "Super-replication with nonlinear transaction costs and volatility\n  uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study super-replication of contingent claims in an illiquid market with\nmodel uncertainty.
