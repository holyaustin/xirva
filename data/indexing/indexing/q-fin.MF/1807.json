Modern approaches, often relying on ADP, simulation, and/or\nduality, have limited rigorous guarantees, which may scale poorly and/or\nrequire previous knowledge of basis functions. A key difficulty with many\napproaches is that to yield stronger guarantees, they would necessitate the\ncomputation of deeply nested conditional expectations, with the depth scaling\nwith the time horizon T.\n  We overcome this fundamental obstacle by providing an algorithm which can\ntrade-off between the guaranteed quality of approximation and the level of\nnesting required in a principled manner, without requiring a set of good basis\nfunctions. We develop a novel pure-dual approach, inspired by a connection to\nnetwork flows. This leads to a representation for the optimal value as an\ninfinite sum for which: 1. each term is the expectation of an elegant\nrecursively defined infimum; 2. the first k terms only require k levels of\nnesting; and 3. truncating at the first k terms yields an error of 1/k. This\nenables us to devise a simple randomized algorithm whose runtime is effectively\nindependent of the dimension, beyond the need to simulate sample paths of the\nunderlying process. Indeed, our algorithm is completely data-driven in that it\nonly needs the ability to simulate the original process, and requires no prior\nknowledge of the underlying distribution. Our method allows one to elegantly\ntrade-off between accuracy and runtime through a parameter epsilon controlling\nthe associated performance guarantee, with computational and sample complexity\nboth polynomial in T (and effectively independent of the dimension) for any\nfixed epsilon, in contrast to past methods typically requiring a complexity\nscaling exponentially in these parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2018 02:53:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Aug 2018 18:47:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Goldberg", "David A.", ""], ["Chen", "Yilun", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.02243", "submitter": "Jian Sun", "authors": "Jian Sun", "title": "Generalization of Doob's Inequality and A Tighter Estimate on Look-back\n  Option Price", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short note, we will strengthen the classic Doob's $L^p$ inequality\nfor sub-martingale processes.

The most advanced literature on the topic elaborates existence and\ncharacterization of this portfolio under no-free-lunch-with-vanishing-risk\nassumption (NFLVR). There are many financial models violating NFLVR, while\nadmitting the log-optimal portfolio on the one hand. On the other hand, for\nfinancial markets under progressively enlargement of filtration, NFLVR remains\ncompletely an open issue, and hence the literature can be applied to these\nmodels.

For the case of the\nVasicek model, we explore some properties of the value function.

The problem is non-Markov\nbecause nonlinear filtering is required to make inference on these factors, and\nhence the associated dynamic program effectively takes the filtering\ndistribution as one of its state variables. This is of significant difficulty\nbecause the filtering distribution is a stochastic probability measure of\ninfinite dimension, and therefore the dynamic program has a state that cannot\nbe differentiated in the traditional sense. This lack of differentiability\nmeans that the problem cannot be solved using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation.
