By weak feedback we mean the case where the contagion\nparameters are small enough to prevent blow-ups in solutions. Next, we\nspecialise to a Brownian driver and show how the same techniques can be\nextended to give short-time uniqueness after blow-ups, regardless of the\nfeedback strength. The heart of our approach is a surprisingly simple\nprobabilistic comparison argument that is robust in the sense that it does not\nask for any regularity of the solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 18:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:32:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ledger", "Sean", ""], ["Sojmark", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12491", "submitter": "Mikhail Zhitlukhin", "authors": "Mikhail Zhitlukhin", "title": "Survival investment strategies in a continuous-time market model with\n  competition", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a stochastic game-theoretic model of an investment market in\ncontinuous time with short-lived assets and study strategies, called survival,\nwhich guarantee that the relative wealth of an investor who uses such a\nstrategy remains bounded away from zero.
