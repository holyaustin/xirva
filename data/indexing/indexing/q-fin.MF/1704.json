Its main application is slicing\nlarge trading orders, in the interest of minimizing trading costs and potential\nperturbations of price dynamics due to liquidity shocks. The initial\noptimization frameworks were based on mean-variance minimization for the\ntrading costs. In the past 15 years, finer modelling of price dynamics, more\nrealistic control variables and different cost functionals were developed. The\ninclusion of signals (i.e. short term predictors of price dynamics) in optimal\ntrading is a recent development and it is also the subject of this work.\n  We incorporate a Markovian signal in the optimal trading framework which was\ninitially proposed by Gatheral, Schied, and Slynko [21] and provide results on\nthe existence and uniqueness of an optimal trading strategy. Moreover, we\nderive an explicit singular optimal strategy for the special case of an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck signal and an exponentially decaying transient market\nimpact. The combination of a mean-reverting signal along with a market impact\ndecay is of special interest, since they affect the short term price variations\nin opposite directions.\n  Later, we show that in the asymptotic limit were the transient market impact\nbecomes instantaneous, the optimal strategy becomes continuous. This result is\ncompatible with the optimal trading framework which was proposed by Cartea and\nJaimungal [10].\n  In order to support our models, we analyse nine months of tick by tick data\non 13 European stocks from the NASDAQ OMX exchange. We show that orderbook\nimbalance is a predictor of the future price move and it has some\nmean-reverting properties. From this data we show that market participants,\nespecially high frequency traders, use this signal in their trading strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 01:38:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 21:27:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2018 11:13:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", ""], ["Neuman", "Eyal", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.02160", "submitter": "Sabrina Mulinacci", "authors": "Sabrina Mulinacci", "title": "A systemic shock model for too big to fail financial institutions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the distributional properties of a vector of lifetimes\nin which each lifetime is modeled as the first arrival time between an\nidiosyncratic shock and a common systemic shock.
