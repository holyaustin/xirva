In the special case when multivariate positions are converted\ninto a single fixed asset, our framework turns into the no good deals setting.\nHowever, in general, the possibilities of assessing the risk with respect to\nany asset or a basket of the assets lead to a decrease of superhedging prices\nand the no arbitrage conditions become stronger. The mathematical technique\nrelies on results for unbounded and possibly non-closed random sets in\nEuclidean space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2016 13:51:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 18:51:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 08:59:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lepinette", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Molchanov", "Ilya", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09112", "submitter": "Marcel Nutz", "authors": "Marcel Nutz", "title": "A Mean Field Game of Optimal Stopping", "comments": "Forthcoming in 'SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization'", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We formulate a stochastic game of mean field type where the agents solve\noptimal stopping problems and interact through the proportion of players that\nhave already stopped. Working with a continuum of agents, typical equilibria\nbecome functions of the common noise that all agents are exposed to, whereas\nidiosyncratic randomness can be eliminated by an Exact Law of Large Numbers.\nUnder a structural monotonicity assumption, we can identify equilibria with\nsolutions of a simple equation involving the distribution function of the\nidiosyncratic noise. Solvable examples allow us to gain insight into the\nuniqueness of equilibria and the dynamics in the population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2016 06:18:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 17:41:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nutz", "Marcel", ""]]}]
