The answer\nmay help investors realize the true risks of their investments, help prevent\nrecessions like that of 2008, and increase financial literacy amongst students.\nUsing several original Python programs, we take a correlation matrix with\ncorrelations between the stock prices and then transform that into a graphable\nbinary adjacency matrix. From this graph, we take a graph in which each edge\nrepresents weak correlations between two stocks. Finding the largest complete\ngraph will produce a diversified portfolio. Numerous trials have shown that\ndiversified portfolios consistently outperform the market during times of\neconomic stability, but undiversified portfolios prove to be riskier and more\nunpredictable, either producing huge profits or even larger losses.\nFurthermore, once deciding among which stocks our portfolio would consist of,\nhow do we know when to invest in each stock to maximize profits? Can taking\nstock price data and shifting values help predict how a stock will perform\ntoday if another stock performs a certain way n days prior? It was found that\nthis method of predicting the optimal time to investment failed to improve\nreturns when based solely on correlations. Although a trial with random stocks\nwith varied correlations produced more profits than continuously investing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Feb 2019 20:39:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Attia", "Joseph", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01157", "submitter": "Diego Zabaljauregui", "authors": "Diego Zabaljauregui and Luciano Campi", "title": "Optimal market making under partial information with general intensities", "comments": "37 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematical Finance (2020)", "doi": "10.1080/1350486X.2020.1758587", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Starting from the Avellaneda-Stoikov framework, we consider a market maker\nwho wants to optimally set bid/ask quotes over a finite time horizon, to\nmaximize her expected utility.

This can be related\nto the conventional Ito calculus-based framework through the time integral of a\nprice's squared volatility. In the new framework, corresponding processes are\nstrictly increasing, solve random ODEs, and are composed with geometric\nBrownian motion to obtain price processes. The new framework has no dependence\non stochastic calculus, so processes can be studied on a pathwise basis using\nprobability-free ODE techniques and functional analysis.\n  The ODEs considered depend on continuous driving functions which are\n`spatially irregular', meaning they need not have any spatial regularity\nproperties such as Holder continuity. They are however strictly increasing in\ntime, thus temporally asymmetric. When sensible initial values are chosen, IVP\nsolutions are also strictly increasing, and the IVPs' solution set is shown to\ncontain all differentiable bijections on the non-negative reals. This enables\nthe modelling of any non-negative volatility path which is not zero over\nintervals, via the time derivative of solutions. Despite this generality, new\nwell-posedness results establish the uniqueness of solutions going forwards in\ntime, and continuity of the IVPs' solution map.\n  Motivation to explore this framework comes from its connection with the\nHeston volatility model. The framework explains how Heston price processes can\nconverge to an interval-valued generalisation of the NIG Levy process, and\nreveals a deeper relationship between integrated CIR processes and the IG Levy\nprocess. Within this framework, a `Riemann-Liouville-Heston' martingale model\nis defined which generalises these relationships to fractional counterparts.\nImplied volatilities from this model are simulated, and exhibit features\ncharacteristic of leading `rough' volatility models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 13:43:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Apr 2019 14:42:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:28:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["McCrickerd", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02659", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Nneka Ene (Kings College London)", "title": "Implementation of a Port-graph Model for Finance", "comments": "In Proceedings TERMGRAPH 2018, arXiv:1902.01510", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 288, 2019, pp. 14-25", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.288.2", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we examine the process involved in the design and\nimplementation of a port-graph model to be used for the analysis of an\nagent-based rational negligence model.

Range Value at Risk (RVaR) is a\nnatural interpolation between these two prominent risk measures, which\nconstitutes a tradeoff between the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness\nof the former, turning it into a practically relevant risk measure on its own.\nAs such, there is a need to statistically validate RVaR forecasts and to\ncompare and rank the performance of different RVaR models, tasks subsumed under\nthe term 'backtesting' in finance. The predictive performance is best evaluated\nand compared in terms of strictly consistent loss or scoring functions. That\nis, functions which are minimised in expectation by the correct RVaR forecast.\nMuch like ES, it has been shown recently that RVaR does not admit strictly\nconsistent scoring functions, i.e., it is not elicitable. Mitigating this\nnegative result, this paper shows that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR\ncomponents at different levels is elicitable. We characterise the class of\nstrictly consistent scoring functions for this triplet. Additional properties\nof these scoring functions are examined, including the diagnostic tool of\nMurphy diagrams. The results are illustrated with a simulation study, and we\nput our approach in perspective with respect to the classical approach of\ntrimmed least squares in robust regression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2019 16:46:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:41:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2020 15:11:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fissler", "Tobias", ""], ["Ziegel", "Johanna F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06175", "submitter": "Jason Anquandah", "authors": "Jason S.
