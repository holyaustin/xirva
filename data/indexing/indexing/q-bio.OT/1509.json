Also\nhygroscopicity of yeasts in time was examined, allowing to check how water -\nthe main component of the cell - affects PALS parameters, thus lifetime of o-Ps\nwere found to change from 1.2 to 1.4 ns (shorter lived component) for the dried\nyeasts. The time sufficient to hydrate the cells was found below 10 hours. In\nthe presence of liquid water an indication of reorganization of yeast in the\nmolecular scale was observed.\n  Microscopic images of the lyophilised, dried and wet yeasts with best\npossible resolution were obtained using Inverted Microscopy (IM) and\nEnvironmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) methods.

Kleiber's observation that animals' basal metabolic rate scales to the\n3/4-power of body mass (Kleiber's rule) has been the prevailing hypothesis in\nthe last eight decades. Increasingly, more evidences are supporting the\nalternative 2/3-power scaling rule, especially for smaller animals. The\n2/3-rule dates back to before Kleiber's time and was thought to originate from\nthe surface to volume relationship in Euclidean geometry. In this study, we\nshow that both the 3/4- and 2/3-scaling rules have in fact one common origin.\nThey are governed by animals' nutrient supply networks-their vascular systems\nthat obey Murray's law. Murray's law describes the branching pattern of energy\noptimized vascular network under laminar flow. It is generally regarded as\nbeing closely followed by blood vessels. Our analysis agrees with experimental\nobservations and recent numerical analyses that showed a curvature in metabolic\nscaling. When applied to metabolic data, our model accurately produces the\nobserved 2/3-scaling rule for small animals of ~10 kg or less and the 3/4-rule\nfor all animals excluding the smallest ones (~15 g). The model has broad\nimplications to the ongoing debate. It proves that both the 3/4- and\n2/3-exponents are phenomenological approximations of the same scaling rule\nwithin their applicable mass ranges, and that the 2/3-rule does not originate\nfrom the classical surface law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:15:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Jinkui", ""]]}]
