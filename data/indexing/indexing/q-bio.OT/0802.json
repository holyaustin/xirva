The normal form which has been recently\nproposed on phenomenological grounds is given in form of a differential delay\nequation. The normal form exhibits a symmetry preserving Hopf bifurcation which\nmay coalesce with a saddle-node in a Bogdanov-Takens point, and a symmetry\nbreaking spatially inhomogeneous pitchfork bifurcation. We study here the Hopf\nbifurcation for the propagation of a single pulse in a ring by means of a\ncenter manifold reduction, and for a wave train by means of a multiscale\nanalysis leading to a real Ginzburg-Landau equation as the corresponding\namplitude equation. Both, the center manifold reduction and the multiscale\nanalysis show that the Hopf bifurcation is always subcritical independent of\nthe parameters. This may have links to cardiac alternans which have so far been\nbelieved to be stable oscillations emanating from a supercritical bifurcation.\nWe discuss the implications for cardiac alternans and revisit the instability\nin some excitable media where the oscillations had been believed to be stable.\nIn particular, we show that our condition for the onset of the Hopf bifurcation\ncoincides with the well known restitution condition for cardiac alternans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2008 01:36:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gottwald", "G.

Salient features of the models include the possibility to\nrepresent anisotropic mechanical behavior resulting from anisotropic filament\ndistributions, and a power-law scaling of the mechanical properties with the\nfilament density. Mechanical models within the class are parameterized by seven\ndifferent constants. We demonstrate a procedure for determining these constants\nusing finite element models of three-dimensional actin networks. Actin\nfilaments and cross-links were modeled as elastic rods, and the networks were\nconstructed at physiological volume fractions and at the scale of an image\nvoxel. We show the performance of the model in estimating the mechanical\nbehavior of the networks over a wide range of filament densities and degrees of\nanisotropy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2008 05:07:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kwon", "Ronald Y.", ""], ["Lew", "Adrian J.", ""], ["Jacobs", "Christopher R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3854", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vitiello", "authors": "Walter J.
