This challenge has been highlighted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, showing how viruses can quickly spread and how they can\nimpact society as a whole. Novel techniques that bring in different disciplines\nmust emerge to provide forward-looking strategies to combat viral infections,\nas well as possible future pandemics. In the past decade, an interdisciplinary\narea involving bioengineering, nanotechnology and information and communication\ntechnology (ICT) has been developing, known as Molecular Communications. This\nnew emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps it\nto molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body,\nwhere the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In this\npaper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how Molecular\nCommunications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseases\nmodelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering\nmolecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on the\nexisting models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body and\nout-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequent\ncommunication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immune\nresponse), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how it\ncan be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issues\nand future directions. Since the development of therapeutics/vaccines needs an\ninterdisciplinary approach centred around ICT, we are confident that Molecular\nCommunications can play a central role here by providing a detail\ncharacterisation and manipulation of the propagation of molecules in different\nmedia.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 15:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Barros", "Michael Taynnan", ""], ["Veleti\u0107", "Mladen", ""], ["Kanada", "Masamitsu", ""], ["Pierobon", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Vainio", "Seppo", ""], ["Balasingham", "Ilangko", ""], ["Balasubramaniam", "Sasitharan", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00290", "submitter": "Max Schurwanz", "authors": "Max Schurwanz, Peter Adam Hoeher, Sunasheer Bhattacharjee, Martin\n  Damrath, Lukas Stratmann, Falko Dressler", "title": "Infectious Disease Transmission via Aerosol Propagation from a Molecular\n  Communication Perspective: Shannon Meets Coronavirus", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE Communications\n  Magazine for the Feature Topic on \"Nano-Networking for Nano-, Micro-, and\n  Macro-Scale Applications\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/MCOM.001.2000956", "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Molecular communication is not only able to mimic biological and chemical\ncommunication mechanisms, but also provides a theoretical framework for viral\ninfection processes.

The\nuse of an isotope dilution approach for quantification ensures results\nreliability. As a part of the validation process, the method was applied to the\nanalysis of the target pesticides in sediments from the Llobregat River (NE\nSpain) showing the presence of five of them, namely, terbutryn, dichlorvos,\nterbuthylazine, diazinon, and irgarol. All 5 pesticides, due to both the\nconcentrations found and their physical-chemical characteristics, demonstrate\nhigh potential for bioaccumulation and risk to the aquatic organisms.\nAdditional multidisciplinary studies that investigate pesticides occurrence in\nthe different aquatic compartments and evaluate the potential risks for aquatic\necosystems are required to assess the environmental impact and significance of\nthe presence of pesticides in sediments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:41:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Barbieri", "Maria Vittoria", ""], ["Postigo", "Cristina", ""], ["Monllor-Alcaraz", "Simon", ""], ["Barcelo", "Damia", ""], ["de Alda", "Miren Lopez", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.11639", "submitter": "Cristina Postigo", "authors": "Maria Vittoria Barbieri, Luis Simon Monllor-Alcaraz, Cristina Postigo,\n  Miren Lopez de Alda", "title": "Improved fully automated method for the determination of medium to\n  highly polar pesticides in surface and groundwater and application in two\n  distinct agriculture-impacted areas", "comments": "Published in Science of the Total Environment", "journal-ref": "Science of The Total Environment Volume 745, 25 November 2020,\n  140650", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140650", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Water is an essential resource for all living organisms. The continuous and\nincreasing use of pesticides in agricultural and urban activities results in\nthe pollution of water resources and represents an environmental risk. To\ncontrol and reduce pesticide pollution, reliable multi-residue methods for the\ndetection of these compounds in water are needed. In this context, the present\nwork aimed at providing an analytical method for the simultaneous determination\nof trace levels of 51 target pesticides in water and applying it to the\ninvestigation of target pesticides in two agriculture-impacted areas of\ninterest. The method developed, based on an isotopic dilution approach and\non-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,\nis fast, simple, and to a large extent automated, and allows the analysis of\nmost of the target compounds in compliance with European regulations. Further\napplication of the method to the analysis of selected water samples collected\nat the lowest stretches of the two largest river basins of Catalonia (NE\nSpain), Llobregat and Ter, revealed the presence of a wide suite of pesticides,\nand some of them at concentrations above the water quality standards (irgarol\nand dichlorvos) or the acceptable method detection limits (methiocarb,\nimidacloprid, and thiacloprid), in the Llobregat, and much cleaner waters in\nthe Ter River basin. Risk assessment of the pesticide concentrations measured\nin the Llobregat indicated high risk due to the presence of irgarol,\ndichlorvos, methiocarb, azinphos ethyl, imidacloprid, and diflufenican (hazard\nquotient (HQ) values>10), and an only moderate potential risk in the Ter River\nassociated to the occurrence of bentazone and irgarol (HQ>1).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Barbieri", "Maria Vittoria", ""], ["Monllor-Alcaraz", "Luis Simon", ""], ["Postigo", "Cristina", ""], ["de Alda", "Miren Lopez", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.12350", "submitter": "Changchuan Yin Dr.", "authors": "Changchuan Yin, Stephen S.-T.

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design\nand vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a\ngenome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene\nexpression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity,\ngenome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in\nthe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an\nabundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the\ngene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene\nundergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution.\nComparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses\nsuggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus,\nSARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related\ncoronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the\nspike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat\ndistribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature. This study\nhighlights the significance of inverted repeats in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2\nand presents the inverted repeats as the genomic signature in genome analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2020 20:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Changchuan", ""], ["Yau", "Stephen S. -T.", ""]]}]
