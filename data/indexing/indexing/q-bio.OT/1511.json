However a training session is necessary in order to set\nup the controller that will make s-EMG based movement possible. All data\nrecorded during the training session are used by a machine learning algorithm\nto make a posture classification, that will allow the controller to distinguish\neach posture. The aim of this study is to investigate if it's possible to make\na posture classification which can remain valid over time. The next step will\nbe the study of how it varies depending on the amount of information submitted\nto it during the training session in view of real life everyday use of the\nupper-limb prosthesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 17:46:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lampacrescia", "Marco", ""]]}]
