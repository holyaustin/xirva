The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired\nby a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th\ngrades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.\nQualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible\nramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the\ncommunity level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the\npopulation-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings\nthat agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food\nassociation learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient\ncommunities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \\textit{Ratatouille} effect\ncan be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,\na potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the\noverall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the\neffectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of\ninstitutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,\ncultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values\nin the community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 23:40:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Murillo", "Anarina L.", ""], ["Safan", "Muntaser", ""], ["Castillo-Chavez", "Carlos", ""], ["Capaldi-Phillips", "Elizabeth D.", ""], ["Wadhera", "Devina", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06780", "submitter": "Nikita Sakhanenko", "authors": "David J.

Information related measures, like\nmarginal entropies, mutual / interaction / multi-information, have been used in\na number of fields including descriptions of systems complexity and biological\ndata analysis. The mathematical relationships among these measures are\ntherefore of significant interest. Relations between common information\nmeasures include the duality relations based on M\\\"obius inversion on lattices.\nThese are the direct consequence of the symmetries of the lattices of the sets\nof variables (subsets ordered by inclusion). While the mathematical properties\nand relationships among these information-related measures are of significant\ninterest, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic examination of the\nfull range of relationships and no unification of this diverse range of\nfunctions into a single formalism as we do here. In this paper we define\noperators on functions on these lattices based on the M\\\"obius inversion idea\nthat map the functions into one another (M\\\"obius operators.) We show that\nthese operators form a simple group isomorphic to the symmetric group S3.\nRelations among the set of functions on the lattice are transparently expressed\nin terms of the operator algebra, and, applied to the information measures, can\nbe used to derive a wide range of relationships among measures. We describe a\ndirect relation between sums of conditional log-likelihoods and previously\ndefined dependency measures. The algebra is naturally generalized which yields\nmore extensive relationships. This formalism provides a fundamental unification\nof information related measures, but isomorphism of all distributive lattices\nwith the subset lattice implies broad potential application of these results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 16:23:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 17:49:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Galas", "David J.", ""], ["Sakhanenko", "Nikita A.", ""]]}]
