Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem\nsurprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical\nmodels. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect\nunderlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships\nbetween the elements of a biological system, according to the motto \"throw away\nthe physics, keep the organisation\". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic\nmodels that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might\nhave deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own\nwork. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M,R)\nsystems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach\ncould be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the\nmathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate\nto his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a\nparticular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions\nrather than a different kind of model that excludes mechanistic models. The\nstrengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison\nwith current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's\ndefinition of life, \"organisms are closed to efficient causation\", should be\nconsidered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be\nimplemented in mathematical models are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 May 2017 16:50:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:22:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Siekmann", "Ivo", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03460", "submitter": "Leroy Cronin Prof", "authors": "Stuart M.

From DNA sequences to folded protein structures, living cells,\nmicrobial communities and multicellular structures, the material configurations\nin biology can easily be distinguished from non-living material assemblies.\nThis is also true of the products of complex organisms that can themselves\nconstruct complex tools, machines, and artefacts. Whilst these objects are not\nliving, they cannot randomly form, as they are the product of a biological\norganism and hence are either technological or cultural biosignatures. The\nproblem is that it is not obvious how it might be possible to generalise an\napproach that aims to evaluate complex objects as possible biosignatures.\nHowever, if it was possible such a self-contained approach could be useful to\nexplore the cosmos for new life forms. This would require us to prove\nrigorously that a given artefact is too complex to have formed by chance. In\nthis paper, we present a new type of complexity measure, Pathway Complexity,\nthat allows us to not only threshold the abiotic-biotic divide, but to\ndemonstrate a probabilistic approach based upon object abundance and complexity\nwhich can be used to unambiguously assign complex objects as biosignatures. We\nhope that this approach not only opens up the search for biosignatures beyond\nearth, but allow us to explore earth for new types of biology, as well as\nobserving when a complex chemical system discovered in the laboratory could be\nconsidered alive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 May 2017 21:13:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Marshall", "Stuart M.", ""], ["Murray", "Alastair R.
