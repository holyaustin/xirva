After admixture, some\nindividuals with admixed autosomes carried the modern Homo Sapiens uniparental\nDNAs, while the rest carried the archaic versions. Coevolution of admixed\nautosomes and uniparental DNAs is expected to cause some of the sites in modern\nuniparental DNAs to revert back to archaic alleles, while the opposite process\nwould occur (from archaic to modern) in some of the sites in archaic\nuniparental DNAs. This type of coevolution is one of the elements that\ndifferentiate the two different models of the Y phylogenetic tree of modern\nhumans, rooting it either in Africa or East Asia. The expected reversion to\narchaic alleles is assumed to occur and is easily traceable in the Asia model,\nbut is absent in the Africa model due to its infinite site assumption, which\nalso precludes the independent or convergent mutation to modern alleles in\narchaic uniparental DNAs since mutations are assumed to occur randomly across a\nneutral genome, and convergent evolution is assumed not to occur. Here, we\nexamined newly published high coverage Y chromosome sequencing data of two\nDenisovan and two Neanderthal samples to determine whether they carry\nmodern-Homo Sapiens alleles in sites where they are not supposed to according\nto the Africa model. The results showed that a significant fraction of the\nsites that, according to the Asia model, should differentiate the original\nmodern Y from the original archaic Y carried modern alleles in the archaic Y\nsamples here. Some of these modern alleles were shared among all archaic humans\nwhile others could differentiate Denisovans from Neanderthals.
