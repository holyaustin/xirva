An overview about existing data standards in systems\nbiology and the management, storage, exchange and integration of the generated\ndata in large distributed research projects is given, the pros and cons of the\ndifferent approaches are illustrated from a practical point of view, the\nexisting software - open source as well as commercial - and the relevant\nliterature is extensively overview, so that the reader should be enabled to\ndecide which data management approach is the best suited for his special needs.\nAn emphasis is laid on the use of workflow systems and of TAB-based formats.\nThe data in this format can be viewed and edited easily using spreadsheet\nprograms which are familiar to the working experimental biologists. The use of\nworkflows for the standardized access to data in either own or publicly\navailable databanks and the standardization of operation procedures is\npresented. The use of ontologies and semantic web technologies for data\nmanagement will be discussed in a further paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 08:53:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2009 08:35:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2009 09:09:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mayer", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1037", "submitter": "Tidjani Negadi", "authors": "Tidjani Negadi", "title": "A taylor-made arithmetic model of the genetic code and applications", "comments": "Work presented at the Symmetry Festival 2009, 31-Jul.5-Aug. 2009,\n  Budapest, Hungary", "journal-ref": "Symmetry: Culture and Science, Vol. 20, Numbers 1-4, 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a completely new version of our arithmetic model of the standard\ngenetic code and compute in a straightforward manner the exact numeric\ndegeneracies of the five multiplets without any trick for the doublets and the\nsextets, as we have done previously.

Activation induced\nthe alignment of a phosphatase cascade in parallel with the MAP kinase pathway.\nA novel regulatory motif was thus generated, providing for the combinatorial\ncontrol of each MAPK intermediate. This ensured a non-linear mode of signal\ntransmission with the output being shaped by the balance between the strength\nof input signal, and the activity gradient along the phosphatase axis. Shifts\nin this balance yielded modulations in topology of the motif, thereby expanding\nthe repertoire of output responses. Thus we identify an added dimension to\nsignal processing, wherein the output response to an external stimulus is\nadditionally filtered through indicators that define the phenotypic status of\nthe cell.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2009 15:34:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhri", "Virendra K.", ""], ["Kumar", "Dhiraj", ""], ["Misra", "Manjari", ""], ["Dua", "Raina", ""], ["Rao", "Kanury V.

We have demonstrated that the redundancy\ndistribution of codons and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) distribution of\namino acids are robust in the code relative to the mutational parameter, and\nindicated that the GMD can be looked as a non-fitness function on the adaptive\nlandscape. Finally, an important aspect on the symmetry of the code\nconstruction, the Yin-Yang duality is investigated. The Yin-Yang duality among\ncodons affords a sound basis for understanding the H-P structure in the genetic\ncode.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 08:02:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Liaofu", ""]]}]
