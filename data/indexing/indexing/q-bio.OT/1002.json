Optimum pH, inoculum and\ntemperature were 9.0, 3 percent and 33 C respectively. Among carbon sources 0.3\npeccent starch gave a maximum production followed by maltose, xylose and\nfructose. High yield of protease production was reported with 1.0 percent\ncasein followed by soybean meal, yeast extract and malt extract. Further, it\nwas optimized with 0.5 percent, 1.0 percentand 1.5 percent of NaCl among which\n1 percent NaCl resulted in maximum level of protease. The protease profile of\nthe isolate shows its potential as a good source for industrial application.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2010 07:09:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Jayasree", "D.", ""], ["Kumari", "T.

These responses\nare controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two\nsignals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin\nsignal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth\ncan be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided\nthat the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are\nbimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of\nisolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the\ngrowth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.\nMoreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the\nbiomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that\nmemory effects play a non-negligible role in plant growth processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2010 10:23:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Veglio", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.3292", "submitter": "Sk Sarif Hassan s", "authors": "Sk.
