Math. Bio. 49, 13-50 (1987)] is improved by\nconsidering the categories of the theory as fuzzy sets whose elements are the\ncomposite objects formed by the arrows and corresponding vertices of their\nembedded graphs. This way each category can be represented as a point in the\nstates space [0.1]**N. The introduction of a diffeomorphism, that acts in this\ncontext as a functor between categories, allows to define a measure preserving\ndynamical system. In particular, we apply this formalism to describe a living\nsingle cell. We propose for its state at a given time a hirerchical category\nwith three levels (molecular, coarse-grained and cellular levels) related by\nadequate colimits. Each level involves the main functional and structural\nmodules in which the cell can be partitioned. The time evolution of the cell is\ndrived by a transformation which is a N-dimensional generalization of the\nRicker map whose parameters we propose to be determined by requiring that, as\nhallmark of its behavior, the living cell to evolve at the edge of chaos. From\nthe dynamical point of view this property manifests in the fact that the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero. Since in a rather complete model of\nthe living cell the huge number of involved parameters can make of the\ncalculations a hard task, we also propose a toy model, with fewer parameters to\nbe determined, which emphasizes the cellular fission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 17:29:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mes\u00f3n", "Alejandro M.", ""], ["Carlevaro", "C.

Using this we show how to reconstruct the full iris template\nfrom partial information, and we show that about 1/6 of the given template is\nneeded to recover almost all information content of the original one in the\nsense that the resulting Hamming distance is well within the range to assert\ncorrectly the identity of the subject. This leads us to propose the concept of\neffective statistical degree of freedom of iris templates and show it is about\n1/6 of the total number of bits. In particular, for a template of $2048$ bits,\nits effective statistical degree of freedom is about $342$ bits, which\ncoincides very well with the degree of freedom computed by the completely\ndifferent method proposed by Daugman.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jan 2018 02:32:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kwon", "Song-Hwa", ""], ["Choi", "Hyeong In", ""], ["Lee", "Sung Jin", ""], ["Wee", "Nam-Sook", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.02546", "submitter": "Valeriy Grytsay Dr", "authors": "V.I.

However, to scale up\nthis technology, we need a better understanding of the processes in the\ndevices. In this effort, we present a differential-algebraic equation (DAE)\nmodel of a microbial electrolysis cell with an algebraic constraint on current.\nWe then perform sensitivity and bifurcation analysis for the DAE system. The\nmodel can be applied either to batch-cycle MECs or to continuous-flow MECs. We\nconduct differential-algebraic sensitivity analysis after fitting simulations\nto current density data for a batch-cycle MEC. The sensitivity analysis\nsuggests which parameters have the greatest influence on the current density at\nparticular times during the experiment. In particular, growth and consumption\nparameters for exoelectrogenic bacteria have a strong effect prior to the peak\ncurrent density. An alternative strategy to maximizing peak current density is\nmaintaining a long term stable equilibrium with non-zero current density in a\ncontinuous-flow MEC. We characterize the minimum dilution rate required for a\nstable nonzero current equilibrium and demonstrate transcritical bifurcations\nin the dilution rate parameter that exchange stability between several curves\nof equilibria. Specifically, increasing the dilution rate transitions the\nsystem through three regimes where the stable equilibrium exhibits (i)\ncompetitive exclusion by methanogens, (ii) coexistence, and (iii) competitive\nexclusion by exolectrogens. Positive long term current production is only\nfeasible in the final two regimes. These results suggest how to modify system\nparameters to increase peak current density in a batch-cycle MEC or to increase\nthe long term current density equilibrium value in a continuous-flow MEC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Feb 2018 03:30:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Dudley", "Harry J.", ""], ["Lu", "Lu", ""], ["Ren", "Zhiyong Jason", ""], ["Bortz", "David M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.08565", "submitter": "Johan Elf", "authors": "Stefan L\\\"of{\\aa}s, Amy E.
