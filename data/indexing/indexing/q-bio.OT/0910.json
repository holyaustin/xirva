This\nresearch addresses how pathogen replication rates and Immune System (IS)\nresponse times are constrained by host body size. An Ordinary Differential\nEquation (ODE) model is used to show that pathogen replication rates decline\nwith host body size but IS response rates remain invariant with body size. An\nAgent-Based Model (ABM) is used to investigate two models of IS architecture\nthat could explain scale invariance of IS response rates. A stage structured\nhybrid model is proposed that strikes a balance between the detailed\nrepresentation of an ABM and computational tractability of an ODE, by using\nthem in the initial and latter stages of an infection, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2009 15:50:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Soumya", ""], ["Moses", "Melanie", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.5834", "submitter": "Niall MacKay", "authors": "N.
