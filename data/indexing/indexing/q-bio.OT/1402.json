Despite the apparent differences, these\nthree networks are bound by common underlying principles which describe the\nbehaviour of the system in terms of the connections of its components, and its\nemergent properties. The longevity (long-term retention and functionality) of\nthe components of each of these systems is also defined by common principles.\nHere, I will examine some properties of the longevity and function of the\ncomponents of artificial and neurobiological systems, and generalise these to\nthe longevity and function of the components of social CAS. In other words, I\nwill show that principles governing the long-term functionality of computer\nnodes and of neurons, may be extrapolated to the study of the long-term\nfunctionality of humans (or more precisely, of the noemes, an abstract\ncombination of existence and digital fame). The study of these phenomena can\nprovide useful insights regarding practical ways that can be used in order to\nmaximize human longevity. The basic law governing these behaviours is the Law\nof Requisite Usefulness, which states that the length of retention of an agent\nwithin a CAS is proportional to the contribution of the agent to the overall\nadaptability of the system.
