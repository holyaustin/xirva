The degeneracy class-number is derived as the\nnumber of numbers coprime to the number of Family-Boxes involved for the\nquartets, the doublets and the singlets. Those for the triplet and the sextets\nare computed as simple linear combinations of the preceeding ones. Some\ninteresting consequences are also presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Jan 2011 12:52:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Jan 2011 16:22:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 15 Jul 2012 14:16:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Negadi", "Tidjani", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4984", "submitter": "James F.

Particular attention is paid to the concept of the rate\ndistortion function and from another direction as motivated by the\nthermodynamics of computing, the fundamental homology with the free energy\ndensity of a physical system. A unifying aspect of the dynamic framework\ninvolves the concept of a groupoid and of a groupoid atlas. From a stochastic\ndifferential equation we postulate a multidimensional Ito process for an\nepigenetic system from which a stochastic flow may permeate through components\nof this atlas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Jan 2011 01:49:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Glazebrook", "James F.", ""], ["Wallace", "Rodrick", ""]]}]
