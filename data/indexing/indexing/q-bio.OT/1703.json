This\nstudy proposes a method to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of\nexisting AGB map (Vieilledent's AGB map) by using a map of correction factors\ngenerated from GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) spaceborne LiDAR data.\nThe Vieilledent's AGB map of Madagascar was established using optical images,\nwith parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, climatic\nvariables, and field inventories. In the present study, first, GLAS LiDAR data\nwere used to obtain a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation)\nestimation of AGB (GLAS AGB) covering Madagascar forested areas, with a density\nof 0.52 footprint/km 2. Second, the difference between the AGB from the\nVieilledent's AGB map and GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location was\ncalculated, and additional spatially distributed correction factors were\nobtained. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was thus performed by taking\ninto account the spatial structure of these additional correction factors to\nprovide a continuous correction factor map. Finally, the existing and the\ncorrection factor maps were summed to improve the Vieilledent's AGB map. The\nresults showed that the integration of GLAS data improves the precision of\nVieilledent's AGB map by approximately 7 t/ha. By integrating GLAS data, the\nRMSE on AGB estimates decreases from 81 t/ha (R 2 = 0.62) to 74.1 t/ha (R 2 =\n0.71). Most importantly, we showed that this approach using LiDAR data avoids\nunderestimating high biomass values (new maximum AGB of 650 t/ha compared to\n550 t/ha with the first approach).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 10:24:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hajj", "Mohammad El", "", "UMR TETIS"], ["Baghdadi", "Nicolas", "", "UMR TETIS"], ["Fayad", "Ibrahim", "", "UMR TETIS"], ["Vieilledent", "Ghislain", "", "CIRAD, JRC"], ["Bailly", "Jean-St\u00e9phane", "", "LISAH"], ["Minh", "Dinh Ho Tong", "", "UMR TETIS"]]}, {"id": "1703.03787", "submitter": "Jian-Jun Shu", "authors": "Jian-Jun Shu", "title": "A new integrated symmetrical table for genetic codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "BioSystems, Vol. 151, pp. 21-26, 2017", "doi": "10.1016/j.biosystems.2016.11.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Degeneracy is a salient feature of genetic codes, because there are more\ncodons than amino acids.
