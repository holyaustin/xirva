The aim of this study was\nto determine the living taxonomic composition of the fauna of extinct mammals,\nand throughout the paleontological study of the deeper level of said tank\n(Level IX). The extracted material which it is currently stored in the\nwarehouse of paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural\nHistory in Havana, Cuba (MNHNCu) was analyzed. We proceeded to clean the bones,\nto classify and to identify them from the species and also the taphonomic\nanalysis of the condition of the remains. It was found that the mammal fauna of\nthe paleontological deposit under study is composed essentially of 3 orders, 7\nfamilies and 14 species. The most significative order is Chiroptera (bat\nfauna), represented by 4 families, 9 genus and 9 species of the total which\nwere identified. There were reported four species of bats Erophylla sezecorni,\nMonophyllus redmani, Pteronotus parnelli and Tadarida brasiliensis in the\nlocation. The results are the basis of the future paleoecological studies in\norder to reconstruct the natural history of these species. Moreover, the\ndiscovery of new species in this area is a contribution to the knowledge about\nthe distribution of these species in the Cuban archipelago and the age of them.\nFinally, the taphonomic analysis of the conservation status of these remains\npermitted the understanding of the processes that gave rise to the tank and its\ncharacteristics, and also it contribute to an adequate estimation of the\nspecies present in it and the relationship between spatiotemporal with the\nfossil.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:53:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gonz\u00e1lez", "Soraida Fiol", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.07522", "submitter": "Antonio Culla", "authors": "Andrea Cavagna and Antonio Culla and Luca Di Carlo and Irene Giardina\n  and Tomas S.

The key idea of the new theory is that the single-particle\npotential needed to bound the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom\naround a finite value, is marginal, that is has zero curvature. We study the\nmodel by using mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations in three\ndimensions, complemented by finite-size scaling analysis. While at the standard\ncritical temperature, $T_c$, the properties of the marginal model are exactly\nthe same as a normal ferromagnet with continuous symmetry-breaking, our results\nshow that a novel zero-temperature critical point emerges, so that in its\ndeeply ordered phase the marginal model develops divergent susceptibility and\ncorrelation length of the modulus of the microscopic degrees of freedom, in\ncomplete analogy with experimental data on natural flocks of starlings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2018 17:39:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:57:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cavagna", "Andrea", ""], ["Culla", "Antonio", ""], ["Di Carlo", "Luca", ""], ["Giardina", "Irene", ""], ["Grigera", "Tomas S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.10421", "submitter": "Vyacheslav Volov", "authors": "V.V.
