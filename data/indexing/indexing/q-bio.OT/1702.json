These organisms and their cells are\nontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing\nnon-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These\nassociation patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed.\nThis contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed\ncause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these\nintrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental\none that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary\ngland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological\nprinciples. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to\napply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or\ncomputer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based\non proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as\nfundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default\nstate of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle\nof organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological\ncomponent, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains\ncollagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless\nconstrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and\nii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their\nability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can\nbe interpreted in terms of closure of constraints...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 18:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mont\u00e9vil", "Ma\u00ebl", ""], ["Speroni", "Lucia", ""], ["Sonnenschein", "Carlos", ""], ["Soto", "Ana M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.06950", "submitter": "J.
