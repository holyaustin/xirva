As an alternative to\ntobacco, the use of electronic cigarettes (ECig) has been increased\ndramatically over the last decade. ECig use is hypothesized to impact smoking\nbehavior through several pathways, not only as a means of quitting cigarettes\nand lowering risk of relapse, but also as both an alternative nicotine delivery\ndevice to cigarettes, as a visible use of nicotine that can lead to imitative\nbehavior in the form of smoking, and as a gateway nicotine delivery technology\nthat can build high levels of nicotine tolerance and pave the way for\ninitiation of smoking. Evidence regarding the effect of ECig use on smoking\nbehavior change remains inconclusive. To address these challenges, we built an\nagent-based model (ABM) of smoking and ECig use to examine the effects of ECig\nuse on smoking behavior change. The impact of social network (SN) on the\ninitiation of smoking and ECig use were also explored. Findings from the\nsimulation suggest that the use of ECig generates substantially lower\nprevalence of current smoker (PCS), which demonstrates the potential for\nreducing smoking and lowering the risk of relapse. The effects of\nproximity-based influences within SN increases the prevalence of current ECig\nuser (PCEU). The model also suggests the importance of improved understanding\nof drivers in cessation and relapse in ECig use, in light of findings that such\naspects of behavior change may notably influence smoking behavior change and\nburden.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 01:27:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Qin", "Yang", ""], ["Edjoc", "Rojiemiahd", ""], ["Osgood", "Nathaniel D", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.09104", "submitter": "S{\\o}ren Toxvaerd", "authors": "S{\\o}ren Toxvaerd", "title": "A Prerequisite for Life", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology 474, 48-51, (2019)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.05.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The complex physicochemical structures and chemical reactions in living\norganism have some common features: (1) The life processes take place in the\ncytosol in the cells, which, from a physicochemical point of view is an\nemulsion of biomolecules in a dilute aqueous suspension.

I argue for a\n\"mechanism-plus-X\" paradigm, where mainstay elements of mechanistic models such\nas hierarchy and correlation are combined with nomological principles such as\ngeneral operative rules and generative principles. Depending on the question at\nhand and the nature of the inquiry, X could range from proven physical laws to\nspeculative biological generalizations, such as the notional principle of\ncellular synchrony.
