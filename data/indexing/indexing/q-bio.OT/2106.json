In this study, a\nfield test was implemented on the M3 generation of two mutant pea plants gained\nfrom previous neutron radiation of pea seeds. The relationship between\nagronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover,\ndifferences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were\nanalyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per\nplant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%\nhigher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the\nincrease in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per\nplant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which\ncould be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There\nwas a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield\nper plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were\nsignificant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants\nand the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two\nmutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two\nmutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a\nsignificant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and\nLeaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological\nstudies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 07:01:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Dapeng", ""], ["Yao", "Ze'en", ""], ["Pan", "Jianbin", ""], ["Feng", "Huyuan", ""], ["Guo", "Zhiqi", ""], ["Lu", "Xiaolong", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.01328", "submitter": "Srikanta Sannigrahi", "authors": "Nirmala D.

A recent surge (second wave) in the\nCOVID-19 cases in Europe and other temperate countries as compared to the\ntropical regions suggests the likely role of solar radiation. We hypothesized\nthat ultraviolet radiation's effect might be a significant factor moderating\nthe spread of the COVID-19 across countries. Regression analysis was done for\nthe UV radiation data for seven hotspot cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Milan,\nMadrid, New York, Melbourne and Sydney) with the daily COVID-19 cases. Global\nerythemal UV radiation values were lower during winter and higher during\nsummer. In general, the daily new COVID-19 cases registered were higher during\nthe winter months having low UV radiation dose (0.5-3.7 kJ m-2). Cases began to\ndecline with summer onset that corresponded to increased UV radiation (2.5-6.7\nkJ m-2). Our studies suggest that the natural UV radiation could be a strong\ndetermining factor moderating the spread of COVID-19 cases. The importance of\nUV radiation in natural sunlight as a disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be\nignored since the lockdowns were lifted; further, it can be considered as a\nfactor for COVID management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2021 12:21:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Desouza", "Nirmala D.", ""], ["Sannigrahi", "Srikanta", ""], ["Blaise", "D.", ""], ["Tan", "Daniel", ""], ["Cerd\u00e0", "Artemi", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.02999", "submitter": "Iv\\'an David Buitrago-Torres Mr.", "authors": "Iv\\'an David Buitrago-Torres, Javier Torres-Osorio and Elisabeth\n  Restrepo-Parra", "title": "Experimental and modeling methodologies for the analysis of water\n  adsorption in food products.

The origin of coronaviruses and the\nrisks of human-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-animal transmission of\ncoronaviral infections can be understood only on a broader evolutionary level\nby detailed comparative studies. In this paper, we studied ribonucleocapsid\nassembly-packaging signals (RNAPS) in the genomes of all seven known pathogenic\nhuman coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,\nHCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 and compared them with RNAPS in the genomes of the\nrelated animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV,\nBat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes\nof coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between\ngenomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional\ngenome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the\nanalysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In\nall coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome\nwith the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer\nand shorter than that of SARS-CoV, respectively. The comparison with the\nexperimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved\nthat the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the\npackaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both\ncharacters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make\nthem promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect\nthe recombination and co-infection as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jun 2021 14:26:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chechetkin", "Vladimir R.", ""], ["Lobzin", "Vasily V.", ""]]}]
