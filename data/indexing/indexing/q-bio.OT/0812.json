While these models are, at best, caricatures of peptides, we\nshow that a number of generic features thought to govern fibril assembly are\npresent in the toy model. The monomer, which contains eight beads made from\nthree letters (hydrophobic, polar, and charged), adopts a compact conformation\nin the native state. The kinetics of fibril assembly occurs in three distinct\nstages. In each stage there is a cascade of events that transforms the monomers\nand oligomers to ordered structures. In the first \"burst\" stage highly mobile\noligomers of varying sizes form. The conversion to the aggregation-prone\nconformation occurs within the oligomers during the second stage. As time\nprogresses, a dominant cluster emerges that contains a majority of the chains.\nIn the final stage, the aggregation-prone conformation particles serve as a\ntemplate onto which smaller oligomers or monomers can dock and undergo\nconversion to fibril structures. The overall time for growth in the latter\nstages is well described by the Lifshitz-Slyazov growth kinetics for\ncrystallization from super-saturated solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2008 10:36:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Mai Suan", ""], ["Klimov", "D.
