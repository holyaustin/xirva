But\nextrapolating complex bio-systems to life's origins, brings up a paradox: how\ncould simple organics--lacking the 'soft matter' response properties of today's\nbio-molecules--have dissipated energy from primordial reactions in a controlled\nmanner for their 'ordering'? Nevertheless, a causal link of life's macroscopic\nirreversible dynamics to the microscopic reversible laws of statistical\nmechanics is indicated via the 'functional-takeover' of a soft magnetic\nscaffold by organics (c.f. Cairns-Smith's 'crystal-scaffold'). A\nfield-controlled structure offers a mechanism for bootstrapping--bottom-up\nassembly with top-down control: its super-paramagnetic components obey\nreversible dynamics, but its dissipation of H-field energy for aggregation\nbreaks time-reversal symmetry. The responsive adjustments of the controlled\n(host) mineral system to environmental changes would bring about mutual\ncoupling between random organic sets supported by it; here the generation of\nlong-range correlations within organic (guest) networks could include SOC-like\nmechanisms. And, such cooperative adjustments enable the selection of the\nfunctional configuration by altering the inorganic network's capacity to assist\na spontaneous process. A non-equilibrium dynamics could now drive the\nkinetically-oriented system towards a series of phase-transitions with\nappropriate organic replacements 'taking-over' its functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2012 17:07:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 18:31:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2012 20:10:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mitra-Delmotte", "Gargi", ""], ["Mitra", "A.

The field of intonational phonology uses discrete accents to describe\nintonation and prosody. But, are such representations useful? The results of\nmimicry experiments indicate that discrete signs are not a useful\nrepresentation of the shape of intonation contours. Human behaviour seems to be\nbetter represented by a attractors where memory retains substantial fine detail\nabout an utterance. There is no evidence that discrete abstract representations\nthat might be formed that have an effect on the speech that is subsequently\nproduced.

Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many\nsystems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the\nlens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return\ntimes. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty\ninvolved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their\nexpected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls, or\nhindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable\ndifferent indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are\nto missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model based approach in order to\nquantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow\ncomparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be\nquite severe for common indicators even under favorable assumptions, and also\nillustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We\ndemonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in\ndifferent data sets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more\ncentral part of early warning predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 19:22:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boettiger", "Carl", ""], ["Hastings", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6247", "submitter": "Sergey Petoukhov", "authors": "Sergey V.
