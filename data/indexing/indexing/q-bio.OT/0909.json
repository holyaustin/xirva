Here we survey existing enabling research\nresults, as well as ideas and research avenues for future development of a new\nparadigm of digitally operating biosensors logically processing multiple\nbiochemical signals through Boolean logic networks composed of biomolecular\nreactions, yielding the final output signals as YES/NO responses. Such systems\ncan lead to high-fidelity biosensing compared to common single or parallel\nsensing devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2009 21:59:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Privman", "Vladimir", ""], ["Katz", "Evgeny", ""], ["Wang", "Joseph", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2676", "submitter": "Serguey Mayburov NN", "authors": "S.Mayburov", "title": "Coherent and Noncoherent Photonic Communications in Biological Systems", "comments": "9 pages, talk given at PIERS-2009 conference, Moscow, august 2009, to\n  appear in Proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The possible mechanisms of communications between distant bio-systems by\nmeans of optical and UV photons are studied.

As\nparameter values are often unknown or subject to a very high uncertainty, one\nis often interested in the question, whether or not a given mathematical model\ncan, for some conceivable parameter vector, exhibit multistationarity at all. A\npartial answer to this question is given in Feinberg's deficiency one\nalgorithm. This algorithm can decide about multistationarity by analyzing\nsystems of linear inequalities that are independent of parameter values.\nHowever, the deficiency one algorithm is limited to what its author calls\nregular deficiency one networks. Many realistic networks have a deficiency\nhigher than one, thus the algorithm cannot be applied directly. In a previous\npublication it was suggested to analyze certain well defined subnetworks that\nare guaranteed to be of deficiency one. Realistic reaction networks, however,\noften lead to subnetworks that are irregular, especially if metabolic networks\nare considered. Here the special structure of the subnetworks is used to derive\nconditions for multistationarity. These conditions are independent of the\nregularity conditions required by the deficiency one algorithm. Thus, in\nparticular, these conditions are applicable to irregular subnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 14:53:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Conradi", "Carsten", ""]]}]
