This is the first history of their study. They were\ndescribed by Lansdown Guilding (1797-1831). This paper identifies the landmarks\nof their study, in a worldwide level, for almost 200 years. The beginning,\n1826-1879, was based on describing their anatomy with light miscroscopy, mostly\nby famous French naturalists such as Milne-Edwards and Blanchard. In 1880-1929\npeiord, work concentrated in anatomy, physiology, behavior, biogeography and\necology, but the most important work was Bouvier`s mammoth monograph. The next\nperiod, 1930-1979, was important for the discovery of Cambrian species; Vachons\nexplanation of how ancient distribution defined the existence of two families;\nPioneer DNA and electron microscopy from Brazil; and primitive attempts at\nsystematics using embryology or isolated anatomical characteristics. Finally,\nthe 1980-2020 period, with research centered in Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica\nand Germany, is marked by an evolutionary approach to everything, from body and\nbehavior to distribution; for the solution of the old problem of how they form\ntheir adhesive net and how the glue works; the reconstruction of Cambrian\nonychophoran communities, the first experimental taphonomy; the first\ncountrywide map of conservation status (from Costa Rica); the first model of\nwhy they survive in cities; the discovery of new phenomena like food hiding,\nparental feeding investment and ontogenetic diet shift; and for the birth of a\nnew research branh, Onychophoran Etnobiology, founded in 2015,\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 17:10:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Monge-Najera", "Julian", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.01000", "submitter": "Andres Ospina-Alvarez Dr.", "authors": "Vicen\\c{c} Molt\\'o, Andres Ospina-Alvarez, Mark Gatt, Miquel Palmer,\n  Ignacio A.

In addition, climate change may also alter patterns of reproductive\nphenology at the community level. Usually, hatch-date distributions are\ndetermined back-calculating the age estimated on calcified structures from the\ncapture date. However, these estimated distributions could be biased due to\nmortality processes or time spaced samplings derived from fishery. Here, we\npresent a Bayesian approach that functions as a predictive model for the\nhatching date of individuals from a fishery-dependent sampling with temporal\nbiases. We show that the shape and shift of the observed distribution is\ncorrected.
