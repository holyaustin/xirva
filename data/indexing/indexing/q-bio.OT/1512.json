The code defines a mapping between tri-nucleotide\nsequences, called codons, and amino acids. Since there are 20 amino acids and\n64 possible tri-nucleotide sequences, more than one among these 64 triplets can\ncode for a single amino acid which incorporates the problem of degeneracy. This\nmanuscript explains the underlying logic of degeneracy of genetic code based on\na mathematical point of view using a parameter named Impression. Classification\nof protein family is also a long standing problem in the field of Bio-chemistry\nand Genomics. Proteins belonging to a particular class have some similar\nbio-chemical properties which are of utmost importance for new drug design.\nUsing the same parameter Impression and using graph theoretic properties we\nhave also devised a new way of classifying a protein family.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 11:01:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Jayanta Kumar", ""], ["Majumder", "Atrayee", ""], ["Choudhury", "Pabitra Pal", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03660", "submitter": "Raphael Cl\\'ement", "authors": "Raphael Clement", "title": "Stephane Leduc and the vital exception in the Life Sciences", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long\nbeen and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our\nreluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 14:36:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 16:42:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 13:27:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 15:05:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Clement", "Raphael", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03674", "submitter": "Nihar Sheth", "authors": "Shaun W.

Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon\nGeneralized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized\nconstraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype\nResemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a\nsimilarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The\nproposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is\nformed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the\nconstraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its\ncomparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or\npossibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with\ncomparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a\nmeta-analysis and its clinical application are provided.
