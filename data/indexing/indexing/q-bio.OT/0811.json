Approximating\nthe dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and Boolean logic gates\nmay, however, introduce dynamical possibilities that are not accessible to the\noriginal system. We show that large random networks of variables coupled\nthrough continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex\ndynamics of corresponding Boolean models in the disordered (chaotic) regime,\neven when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for Boolean\nidealization. A suitably modified Boolean theory explains the behavior of\nsystems in which information does not propagate faithfully down certain chains\nof nodes. Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer\nfunctions reported in the literature on transcriptional regulation of genes are\ndescribed by the modified theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Nov 2008 19:47:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 20:17:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Mar 2009 17:36:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 19:37:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 19:02:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 11 May 2009 14:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Norrell", "Johannes", ""], ["Socolar", "Joshua E.
