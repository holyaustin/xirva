They can be over a\nmeter long, with an irregular cylindrical shape, resembling a rope. These\nanaerobic intestinal \"rope\" parasites differ significantly from other\nwell-known intestinal parasites. Rope parasites can leave human body with\nenemas, and are often mistaken for intestinal lining, feces, or decayed remains\nof other parasites. Rope parasites can attach to intestinal walls with suction\nbubbles, which later develop into suction heads. Walls of the rope parasites\nconsist of scale-like cells forming multiple branched channels along the\nparasite's length. Rope parasites can move by jet propulsion, passing gas\nbubbles through these channels. Currently known antihelminthic methods include\nspecial enemas. Most humans are likely hosting these helminths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2013 23:18:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Volinsky", "Alex A.", ""], ["Gubarev", "Nikolai V.", ""], ["Orlovskaya", "Galina M.", ""], ["Marchenko", "Elena V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.1034", "submitter": "Richard Clymo", "authors": "R.

A computer program tells me that a mean value is 12.3456789012,\nbut how many of these digits are significant (the rest being random junk)?\nShould I report: 12.3?, 12.3456?, or even 10 (if only the first digit is\nsignificant)? There are several rules-of-thumb but, surprisingly (given that\nthe problem is so common in science), none seem to be evidence-based. RESULTS.\nHere I show how the significance of a digit in a particular decade of a mean\ndepends on the standard error of the mean (SEM). I define an index, DM that can\nbe plotted in graphs. From these a simple evidence-based rule for the number of\nsignificant digits (\"sigdigs\") is distilled: the last sigdig in the mean is in\nthe same decade as the first or second non-zero digit in the SEM. As example,\nfor mean 34.63 (SEM 25.62), with n = 17, the reported value should be 35 (SEM\n26). Digits beyond these contain little or no useful information, and should\nnot be reported lest they damage your credibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Jan 2013 18:00:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 11:21:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 11:36:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 6 May 2021 17:41:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Clymo", "R.

Rope worms have been discovered as a result of\ncleansing enemas. Thousands or people have passed the rope worms from all over\nthe World. Adult stages live in human gastro-intestinal tract and are\nanaerobic. They move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles utilizing jet\npropulsion. These worms look like a rope, and can be over a meter long. The\ndevelopment stages were identified based on their morphology. The fifth stage\nlooks like a tough string of mucus about a meter long. The fourth stage looks\nsimilar, but the rope worm is shorter and has softer slimier body. The third\nstage looks like branched jellyfish. The second stage is viscous snot, or mucus\nwith visible gas bubbles that act as suction cups. The first stage is slimier\nmucus with fewer bubbles, which can reside almost anywhere in the body. Rope\nworms have cellular structure, based on optical microscopy, DAPI staining and\nDNA analysis, however, the data collected is not sufficient to identify the\nspecie. Removal methods are also mentioned in the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 02:23:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Oct 2014 19:47:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Volinsky", "Alex A.", ""], ["Gubarev", "Nikolai V.", ""], ["Orlovskaya", "Galina M.", ""], ["Marchenko", "Elena V.", ""]]}]
