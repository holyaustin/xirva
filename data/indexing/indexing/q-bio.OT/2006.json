Through\nthis global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed\ncases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures.\nHowever, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this\nexponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt\nto safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to\nquantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of\nSARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a\nneural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative\ninfected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government\nrestriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.\nData for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model\ngovernment restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social\ndistance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government\nactions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter\nentry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less\nconfirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but\nmilder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting\nTaiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely\ndata-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical\nepidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that\nthe data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2020 02:04:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 21:04:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 25 Nov 2020 20:54:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:29:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Riccardi", "Annalisa", ""], ["Gemignani", "Jessica", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro", "Francisco", ""], ["Heffernan", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13012", "submitter": "Robin Thompson", "authors": "Robin N Thompson, T Deirdre Hollingsworth, Valerie Isham, Daniel\n  Arribas-Bel, Ben Ashby, Tom Britton, Peter Challoner, Lauren H K Chappell,\n  Hannah Clapham, Nik J Cunniffe, A Philip Dawid, Christl A Donnelly, Rosalind\n  Eggo, Sebastian Funk, Nigel Gilbert, Julia R Gog, Paul Glendinning, William S\n  Hart, Hans Heesterbeek, Thomas House, Matt Keeling, Istvan Z Kiss, Mirjam\n  Kretzschmar, Alun L Lloyd, Emma S McBryde, James M McCaw, Joel C Miller,\n  Trevelyan J McKinley, Martina Morris, Philip D ONeill, Carl A B Pearson, Kris\n  V Parag, Lorenzo Pellis, Juliet R C Pulliam, Joshua V Ross, Michael J\n  Tildesley, Gianpaolo Scalia Tomba, Bernard W Silverman, Claudio J Struchiner,\n  Pieter Trapman, Cerian R Webb, Denis Mollison, Olivier Restif", "title": "Key Questions for Modelling COVID-19 Exit Strategies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc.

Many\ngovernments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow\nrestrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in\ncases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding\ninterventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the\nface of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from\nthe Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May\n2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to\ngovernments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if\nanswered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different\nexit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate\nthe development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap\nrequires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and\npolicy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key\nepidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in\npopulations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in\nLow-to-Middle-Income countries. This will provide important information for\nplanning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public\nhealth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Jun 2020 17:06:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:09:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:09:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2020 13:08:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Thompson", "Robin N", ""], ["Hollingsworth", "T Deirdre", ""], ["Isham", "Valerie", ""], ["Arribas-Bel", "Daniel", ""], ["Ashby", "Ben", ""], ["Britton", "Tom", ""], ["Challoner", "Peter", ""], ["Chappell", "Lauren H K", ""], ["Clapham", "Hannah", ""], ["Cunniffe", "Nik J", ""], ["Dawid", "A Philip", ""], ["Donnelly", "Christl A", ""], ["Eggo", "Rosalind", ""], ["Funk", "Sebastian", ""], ["Gilbert", "Nigel", ""], ["Gog", "Julia R", ""], ["Glendinning", "Paul", ""], ["Hart", "William S", ""], ["Heesterbeek", "Hans", ""], ["House", "Thomas", ""], ["Keeling", "Matt", ""], ["Kiss", "Istvan Z", ""], ["Kretzschmar", "Mirjam", ""], ["Lloyd", "Alun L", ""], ["McBryde", "Emma S", ""], ["McCaw", "James M", ""], ["Miller", "Joel C", ""], ["McKinley", "Trevelyan J", ""], ["Morris", "Martina", ""], ["ONeill", "Philip D", ""], ["Pearson", "Carl A B", ""], ["Parag", "Kris V", ""], ["Pellis", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Pulliam", "Juliet R C", ""], ["Ross", "Joshua V", ""], ["Tildesley", "Michael J", ""], ["Tomba", "Gianpaolo Scalia", ""], ["Silverman", "Bernard W", ""], ["Struchiner", "Claudio J", ""], ["Trapman", "Pieter", ""], ["Webb", "Cerian R", ""], ["Mollison", "Denis", ""], ["Restif", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13841", "submitter": "Todd R Lewis PhD", "authors": "Todd R.
