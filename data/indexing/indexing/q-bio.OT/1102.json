Our bibliometric\nanalysis of several large protein families, including those known to be\n\"druggable\", reveals that, even today, most papers focus on proteins that were\nknown prior to 2000. It is evident that one or more aspects of the biomedical\nresearch system severely limits the exploration of the proteins in the 'dark\nmatter' of the proteome, despite unbiased genetic approaches that have pointed\nto their functional relevance. It is perhaps not surprising that relatively few\ngenome-derived targets have led to approved drugs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Feb 2011 20:52:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 19:38:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Isserlin", "Ruth", ""], ["Bader", "Gary D.", ""], ["Edwards", "Aled", ""], ["Frye", "Stephen", ""], ["Willson", "Timothy", ""], ["Yu", "Frank H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.0966", "submitter": "Jonathan Potts", "authors": "Luca Giuggioli, Jonathan R.

The\nmean square displacement (MSD) of the 1D Brownian walker within subdiffusing\nboundaries is calculated exactly and generalizes well known results when the\nboundaries are immobile.

Our method\nexpands an existing analytical model of T-cell cross-regulation (Carneiro et\nal. in Immunol Rev 216(1):48-68, 2007) that was used to study the\nself-organizing dynamics of a single population of T-Cells in interaction with\nan idealized antigen presenting cell capable of presenting a single antigen.\nWith agent-based modeling we are able to study the self-organizing dynamics of\nmultiple populations of distinct T-cells which interact via antigen presenting\ncells that present hundreds of distinct antigens. Moreover, we show that such\nself-organizing dynamics can be guided to produce an effective binary\nclassification of antigens, which is competitive with existing machine learning\nmethods when applied to biomedical text classification. More specifically, here\nwe test our model on a dataset of publicly available full-text biomedical\narticles provided by the BioCreative challenge (Krallinger in The biocreative\nii. 5 challenge overview, p 19, 2009). We study the robustness of our model's\nparameter configurations, and show that it leads to encouraging results\ncomparable to state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results help us understand both\nT-cell cross-regulation as a general principle of guided self-organization, as\nwell as its applicability to document classification. Therefore, we show that\nour bio-inspired algorithm is a promising novel method for biomedical article\nclassification and for binary document classification in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Feb 2011 22:10:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Abi-Haidar", "Alaa", ""], ["Rocha", "Luis M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3158", "submitter": "Dr A.

Little published data is\navailable on length-weight relationships of channel catfish in Michigan. Though\nthere is no record of public or private stocking, channel catfish appeared in\nLake Diane between 1984 and 1995 and it has developed into an excellent\nfishery. Results: NLLS regression yields parameter estimates of b = 3.2293 and\na = 0.00522. The improved model yields the same estimate for the exponent, b,\nand a length estimate (parameter L1) of 45.23 cm. Estimates of uncertainty and\ncovariance are smaller for the improved model, but the correlation coefficient\nis r = 0.995 in both cases. LLS regression produced different parameter values,\na = 0.01356 and b = 2.9726, and a smaller correlation coefficient, r = 0.980.\nOn average, catfish in the sample weighed 106.0% of the standard weight, (Brown\net al.) and the linear regression (no slope) of fillet yield vs. total weight\nsuggests a typical fillet yield of 28.1% with r = 0.989. Conclusion: Most of\nthe fish in the sample were above the standard weight, heavier than the 75th\npercentile for their length. Channel catfish are doing well in Lake Diane and\nthe population is well matched to the food supply. Management should attempt to\nmaintain current population levels. In this case, the improved length-weight\nmodel, W(L) = (L/L1)^b, provided lower uncertainties in parameter estimates and\nsmaller covariance than the traditional model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Feb 2011 21:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Aug 2012 03:22:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Keenan", "Elizabeth", ""], ["Warner", "Sarah", ""], ["Crowe", "Ashley", ""], ["Courtney", "Michael", ""]]}]
