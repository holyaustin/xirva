As the atmosphere warms without additional water\nvapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased\ntemperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative\nimpacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often\nneglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation\nbetween the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)\nand soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent\nroles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their\ninteractions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We\nfound that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD\nincreases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.\nThe negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and\ninfluenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield\nloss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased\nwater loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced\nphotosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing\nseason length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss\nunder warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact\nlevel varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier\nconditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and\nyield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2. A\nmechanistic understanding of the function of VPD and its relation with other\nclimate factors and management practices is critical to improving crop yield\nprojections under a changing climate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2019 23:24:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hsiao", "Jennifer", ""], ["Swann", "Abigail L.

Therefore, only\nfrom the acquired observations should state vectors reconstructed to emulate\nthe different states of the underlying system. It is what is known as the\nreconstruction of the state space, called phase space in real-world signals,\nfor now only satisfactorily resolved using the method of delays. Each state\nvector consists of m components, extracted from successive observations delayed\na time t. The morphology of the geometric structure described by the state\nvectors, as well as their properties, depends on the chosen parameters t and m.\nThe real dynamics of the system under study is subject to the correct\ndetermination of the parameters t and m. Only in this way can be deduced\ncharacteristics with true physical meaning, revealing aspects that reliably\nidentify the dynamic complexity of the physiological system. The biological\nsignal presented in this work, as a case study, is the PhotoPlethysmoGraphic\n(PPG) signal. We find that m is five for all the subjects analyzed and that t\ndepends on the time interval in which it evaluates. The H\\'enon map and the\nLorenz flow are used to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of applied\ntechniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Oct 2019 11:23:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["de Pedro-Carracedo", "J.", ""], ["Ugena", "A.

Here, the authors reasoned that for sustained resonance signaling, the\nnumber of oscillating DNA sequences per genome should be exceptionally high and\nthat, therefore, genomic repeats of various sizes are good candidates for\nserving as resonators. Moreover, it was suggested that for the two DNA\nsequences to resonate, they do not necessarily have to be identical. Therefore,\nthe existence of sequences differing in the primary sequence but having similar\nresonating sub-structures was proposed. It was hypothesized that such\nsequences, named HIDERs, would be enriched in the genomes of multicellular\nspecies. Specifically, it was hypothesized that delocalized electron clouds of\npurine-pyrimidine sequences could serve as the basis of HIDERs. The consequent\ngenomic analysis confirmed the enrichment of purine-pyrimidine HIDERs in a few\nselected genomes of mammals, an insect, and a plant, compared to randomized\nsequence controls. Similarly, it was suggested that hypothetical delocalized\nproton clouds of the hydrogen bonds of multiple stacked bases could serve as\nsequence-dependent hydrogen-bond-based HIDERs. Similarly, the enrichment of\nsuch HIDERs was observed. It is suggested that these enrichments are the first\nevidence in support of sequence-specific resonance signaling in the genome.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 03:04:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Savelev", "Ivan", ""], ["Myakishev-Rempel", "Max", ""]]}]
