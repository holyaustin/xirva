We find that the\nproposed precursor has much less optimality than that of the canonical code.\nOur results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an\nintermediate state in the evolution of the canonical genetic code. These\nfindings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary\ndynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical\nsignificance, it arose before the emergence of translation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2009 16:32:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Butler", "Thomas", ""], ["Goldenfeld", "Nigel", ""]]}]
