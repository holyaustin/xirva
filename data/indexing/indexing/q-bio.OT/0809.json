Here we extend the earlier work--static\ndispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well\nas multi-patches environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive\nratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases'\npersistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it\nimplies that for a wide range of parameters that infection rate will tend\nmaximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit\nmodels that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence\nof trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection\nperiod and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear\nrelationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher\nmobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i.e.,\nthe phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and\nthe spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it\nwill saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for multi-patches case, we find\nthat the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected\nfraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2008 12:05:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Quan-Xing", ""], ["Wang", "Rong-Hua", ""], ["Jin", "Zhen", ""]]}]
