Indeed, even authors of\npapers that use permutations to model genome rearrangement can struggle to\ninterpret each others' work, because of subtle differences in basic assumptions\nthat are often deeply ingrained (and consequently sometimes not even\nmentioned). In this paper, we describe the different ways in which permutations\nhave been used to model genomes and genome rearrangement events, presenting\nsome features and limitations of each approach, and show how the various models\nare related.

Several conceptions such as weak, strong and\nrobust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and\nontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is\nwhether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is\nrather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this\nquestion, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a\nframework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with\nthe knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a\nparticular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through\nexperiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes\nyielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a\nconceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept\ndisjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints\nof the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the\nnumber and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.\nInterestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global\nconstraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with\nan ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of\nemergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through\nthe active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this\ndefinition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at\nleast for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the\nrelevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward\ncausal influence exerted by natural selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 23:54:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Pascual-Garc\u00eda", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.04116", "submitter": "J.

Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses\nusing 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected\ngermination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time\n(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that\ngermination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl\nconcentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance\nwas observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate\nsalt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be\nmore accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,\nremains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)\nand velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the\nhigh salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt\nenvironment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended\nfor plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when\nungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,\nthey recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high\nspeed. This indicated that the germination inhibition was related to a\nreversible osmotic stress that induced dormancy rather than specific ion\ntoxicity. Conclusion: This ability to germinate after exposure to higher\nconcentrations of NaCl suggests that studied species, especially the most\ntolerant could be able to germinate under the salt affected soils and could be\nutilized for the rehabilitation of damaged arid zones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 14:32:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cherifi", "Khalil", ""], ["Boufous", "El Houssein", ""], ["Boubaker", "Hassan", ""], ["Msanda", "Fouad", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.06608", "submitter": "Yi-Xiang Wang", "authors": "Yi-Xiang Wang, Zoltan Kaplar, Min Deng, Jason Leung", "title": "Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis epidemiology: a systemic review\n  with a focus on gender-specific and age-specific prevalence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The epidemiology of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) remains\ncontroversial.
