Furthermore, the customary introduction of fundamental biological\nentities such as individual organisms, cells, genes, catalysts and motors\nremains largely descriptive; constructive approaches involving deductive\nreasoning appear, in comparison, almost absent. As a consequence, both the\nlogical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present\narticle describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations\nof biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the\nlanguage and the general methods employed in other disciplines. This approach\nassumes the existence of a certain unity of human knowledge that transcends\ndiscipline boundaries. Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason is revised\nthrough the introduction of the complementary concepts of symmetry and\nasymmetry and of necessity and contingency. This is used to explain how these\nfour concepts are involved in the elaboration of theories or laws of nature.\nFour fundamental theories of biology are then identified: cell theory, Darwin's\ntheory of natural selection, an informational theory of life (which includes\nMendel's theory of inheritance) and a physico-chemical theory of life. Atomism\nand deductive reasoning are shown to enter into the elaboration of the concepts\nof natural selection, individual living organisms, cells and their\nreproduction, genes as well as catalysts and motors. This work contributes to\nclarify the philosophical and logical structure of biology and its major\ntheories. This should ultimately lead to a better understanding of the origin\nof life, of system and synthetic biology, and of artificial life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 14:12:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 13:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Sikorav", "Jean-Louis", ""], ["Braslau", "Alan", ""], ["Goldar", "Arach", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3267", "submitter": "Rolando Cardenas", "authors": "Madeleine Lopez, Rolando Cardenas and Lien Rodriguez", "title": "On the habitability of exoplanets orbiting Proxima Centauri", "comments": "Paper written in Spanish", "journal-ref": "Rev.
