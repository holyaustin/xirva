Cu uptake data\nshowed that maximum Cu uptake was obtained by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The\nmetal uptake was dependent on the type of biosorbent with different\naccumulation affinities toward the tested chemical form of the copper. Cells\nharvested at exponential growth phase showed slightly higher Cu uptake than at\nstationary phase, which reflect that the Cu uptake is metabolism\ndependent-process. The increasing order of affinity of the cupric chloride and\ncupric sulphate towards the three genera were almost constant. However, where\ncupric nitrate was used, the copper uptake behavior in Pseudomonas aeroginosa\nwas not changed from those results with the other two chemical forms, whereas\nwith E. aerogenes & B. thuringiensis, different Cu uptake behaviors were\nobserved. In B. thuengenesis, the copper uptake rate as a function of initial\nCu concentration were shown to increase with increasing the initial\nconcentration of Cu, constantly above 320 ppm as compared with others. In\nEnterobacter with cupric nitrate, different bahavior was also shown in which\nthe copper uptake decline sharply beyond the 320 ppm. These results reflect\nthat the Cu uptake in P. aeruginosa is with different mechanisms as compared\nwith other tested bacteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Nov 2019 12:58:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 11:23:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Tarawneh", "Amjad Al", ""], ["Qaralleh", "Haitham", ""], ["Al-limoun", "Muhamad O.", ""], ["Khleifat", "Khaled M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.12006", "submitter": "Bina Melvia Girsang", "authors": "Bina Melvia Girsang, Eqlima Elvira", "title": "Characteristics Of Post Partum Perineum Wounds With Infra Red Therapy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Perineal wounds other than their localization in humid feminine areas and can\npose a risk of infection.
