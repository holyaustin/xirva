The gold nanoclusters with small size can\npenetrate kidney tissue and have promise to decrease in vivo toxicity by renal\nclearance. In this work, we explore the in vivo renal clearance,\nbiodistribution, and toxicity responses of the BSA- and GSH-protected gold\nnanoclusters for 24 hours and 28 days. The BSA-protected gold nanoclusters have\nlow-efficient renal clearance and only 1% of gold can be cleared, but the\nGSH-protected gold nanoclusters have high-efficient renal clearance and 36 % of\ngold can be cleared after 24 hours. The biodistribution further reveals that\n94% of gold can be metabolized for the GSH-protected nanoclusters, but only\nless than 5% of gold can be metabolized for the BSA-protected nanoclusters\nafter 28 days. Both of the GSH- and BSA-protected gold nanoclusters cause acute\ninfection, inflammation, and kidney function damage after 24 hours, but these\ntoxicity responses for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters can be eliminated\nafter 28 days. Immune system can also be affected by the two kinds of gold\nnanoclusters, but the immune response for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters\ncan also be recovered after 28 days. These findings show that the GSH-protected\ngold nanoclusters have small size and can be metabolized by renal clearance and\nthus the toxicity can be significantly decreased. The BSA- protected gold\nnanoclusters, however, can form large compounds and further accumulate in liver\nand spleen which can cause irreparable toxicity response. Therefore, the\nGSH-protected gold nanoclusters have great potential for in vivo imaging and\ntherapy, and the BSA-protected gold nanoclusters can be used as the agent of\nliver cancer therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2012 08:49:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xiao-Dong", ""], ["Wu", "Di", ""], ["Shen", "Xiu", ""], ["Liu", "Pei-Xun", ""], ["Fan", "Fei-Yue", ""], ["Fan", "Sai-Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3740", "submitter": "Diego Krivochen", "authors": "Diego Gabriel Krivochen", "title": "Biological Systems as Systems of Increasing Entropy: Language and\n  Genetics", "comments": "Withdrawn by the author as the content has been superseded by more\n  recent publications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.CD q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we will try to provide a formalization of some characteristics\nof the development of biological systems aiming at the highest level of\nadequacy: justificative adequacy, that is, not only what we observe\n(descriptive adequacy) and how we think it occurs (explanatory adequacy) but\nalso what architectural properties (in terms of matter configuration, for\nexample) license the occurrence of certain phenomena.

We show how information\npatterns, are united by the creation of mutual context, generating persistent\nconsequences, to result in `functional information'. This constructive process\nforms arbitrarily large complexes of information, the combined effects of which\ninclude the functions of life. Molecules and simple organisms have already been\nmeasured in terms of functional information content; we show how quantification\nmay be extended to each level of organisation up to the ecological. In terms of\na computer analogy, life is both the data and the program and its biochemical\nstructure is the way the information is embodied. This idea supports the\nseamless integration of life at all scales with the physical universe. The\ninnovation reported here is essentially to integrate these ideas, basing\ninformation on the `general definition' of information, rather than simply the\nstatistics of information, thereby explaining how functional information\noperates throughout life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2012 14:42:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 16:10:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Farnsworth", "Keith D.", ""], ["Nelson", "John", ""], ["Gershenson", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.7091", "submitter": "Suk Keun Lee", "authors": "Yeon Sook Kim, Dae Gwan Lee, Suk Keun Lee", "title": "Hydrogen magnetic reaction gene regulation", "comments": "This is a novel gene regulation system.

The HMR can\nsequentially activate the DNA base pair polarities of target DNA. With the\ncharacteristic base pair polarities of DNA duplex the (pyrimidine)m-(purine)n\nDNA segment is a basic unit to maintain and to accumulate the electrostatic\nenergy of DNA duplex (1). To enhance the polarities of objective DNA this HMR\ngene regulation (HMR-GR) uses the polarized magnetic field with optimal\nnucleotide exposure time for T:A and C:G base pairs (50 msec and 80 msec,\nrespectively). The targeting efficiency of HMR-GR to the objective DNA is\ntheoretically up to 25%. In the present study, the HMR-GR expanded the\nconformation of oligo-dsDNA in vitro, implicating the active state of DNA, and\nalso enhanced the restriction endonuclease digestion, in vitro RNA\ntranscription, and the production of green fluorescence protein and\n{\\beta}-galactosidase by using each RE site sequence and relevant promoter\nsequence, respectively. Taken together, it is assumed that the HMR-GR is an\neffective and safe method to control the multiple genes sequentially by\nactivating their specific DNA motifs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Oct 2012 10:25:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Yeon Sook", ""], ["Lee", "Dae Gwan", ""], ["Lee", "Suk Keun", ""]]}]
