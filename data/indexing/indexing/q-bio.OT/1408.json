Asymmetric\nmovements of the wings were used from 1 to 8 dph to effect progressively more\nsuccessful righting behaviour via body roll. Following 8 dph, wing motions\ntransitioned to bilaterally symmetric flapping that yielded aerial righting via\nnose down pitch, along with substantial increases in vertical force production\nduring descent. Ontogenetically, the use of such wing motions to effect aerial\nrighting precedes both symmetric flapping and a previously documented behaviour\nin chukar (i.e., wing assisted incline running) hypothesized to be relevant to\nincipient flight evolution in birds. These findings highlight the importance of\nasymmetric wing activation and controlled aerial manoeuvres during bird\ndevelopment, and are potentially relevant to understanding the origins of avian\nflight.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Aug 2014 19:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Evangelista", "Dennis", ""], ["Cam", "Sharlene", ""], ["Huynh", "Tony", ""], ["Krivitskiy", "Igor", ""], ["Dudley", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1580", "submitter": "Ethan Bolker", "authors": "Ethan D.

Hochkirch et al. (2013, Conserv.
