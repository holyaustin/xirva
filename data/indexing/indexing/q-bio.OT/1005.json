It has been shown that repeated social defeats\nin 10 daily agonistic interactions in male mice led to development of the\nexpressed level of anxiety and to reduction of communication estimated in the\nelevated plus-maze and partition tests, respectively. In the social\ninteractions test, sociable behavior toward unfamiliar partner and exploratory\nactivity were dramatically decreased in defeated male mice. Avoidance of\napproaching partner was significantly increased. Demonstration of self-grooming\nbehavior was increased in defeated males. Chronic diazepam treatment (0.5\nmg/kg, i.p., 2 weeks) led to significant decrease of anxiety level estimated in\nthe elevated plus maze test and to improvement of communication in the\npartition test. In the social interaction test diazepam completely restored the\nlevel of sociability and exploratory activity and reduced avoidance behavior of\napproaching partner. Diazepam did not affect self-grooming demonstration. It is\nconcluded that main factor which provokes decrease in communication in defeated\nmale mice is the high level of anxiety. Similarity between changes in social\nbehavior in defeated mice and symptoms of autism in humans is discussed. It is\nsupposed that this behavioral approach may be useful for studying the molecular\nmechanisms of autistic spectrum disorders, developing under chronic negative\nsocial experiences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2010 08:20:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kovalenko", "I.

In three independent\ngroups of 64, 39, and 19 volunteers by the factor analysis of heart rate\nperiodograms, it has been discovered that there are at least two other heart\nrate oscillation phenomena apart from the well known low frequency oscillations\nand respiratory arrhythmia. They have periods of 3 and 4 heart beats.\nAssociation of amplitude of 3-beats oscillation with level of mental readiness\nwas shown due to further observation in two independent groups of 12 and 7.\nMoreover, possibility of assessment of mental readiness by the mathematical\nmodel based on heart rate periodogram was suggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 13:59:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Mukhin", "V.", ""], ["Klimenko", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5101", "submitter": "Sergey Petoukhov", "authors": "Sergey V.

The matrix P=[C A; U G] in the\nthird Kronecker power is the (8*8)-matrix, which contains 64 triplets.\nPeculiarities of the degeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the\nsymmetrical black-and-white mosaic of this genetic (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets.\nPhenomena of connections of this mosaic matrix (and many other genetic\nmatrices) with projection operators are revealed. Taking into account an\nimportant role of projection operators in quantum mechanics, theory of digital\ncodes, computer science, logic and in many other fields of applied mathematics,\nwe study algebraic properties and biological meanings of these phenomena. Using\nof notions and formalisms of theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces in\nbioinformatics and theoretical biology is proposed on the bases of the\ndescribed results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 May 2010 05:54:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Petoukhov", "Sergey V.", ""]]}]
