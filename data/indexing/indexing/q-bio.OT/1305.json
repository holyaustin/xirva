It is\nbelieved that in 2007 more people died of MRSA than of AIDS worldwide. In\nAustralia \"there are about 2000 people per year who have a bloodstream\ninfection with the MRSA germ and the vast majority of those get them from\nhealth care procedure\" (Nader, 2005). It is acknowledged as a significant\nchallenge to Australian hospitals for MRSA infection control. Nursing\nprofessionals are in urgent need of the study of MRSA nosocomial infection\ncontrols. This review provides insight into the hand washing and isolation\ninfection-control strategies for MRSA. The important technologies on those two\naspects worldwide are well surveyed, compared, contrasted, and discussed. The\nreview is to do a complete survey on the hand washing and isolation\ntechnologies of infection controls for MRSA and try to provide some possible\nrecommendations for Australian hospitals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 12:33:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jiapu", ""]]}]
