First, after the presentation of a new formula,\nan indexed double Fibonacci sequence, comprising the first six Fibonacci\nnumbers, is shown to describe the 20 amino acids multiplets and their\ndegeneracy as well as a characteristic pattern for the 61 meaningful codons.\nNext, the twenty amino acids, classified according to their increasing\natom-number (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur), exhibit several Fibonacci\nsequence patterns. Several mathematical relations are given, describing various\natom-number patterns. Finally, a q-Fibonacci simple phenomenological model,\nwith q a real deformation parameter, is used to describe, in a unified way, not\nonly the standard genetic code, when q=1, but also all known slight variations\nof this latter, when q~1, as well as the case of the 21st amino acid\n(Selenocysteine) and the 22nd one (Pyrrolysine), also when q~1. As a by-product\nof this elementary model, we also show that, in the limit q=0, the number of\namino acids reaches the value 6, in good agreement with old and still\npersistent claims stating that life, in its early development, could have used\nonly a small number of amino acids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 21:32:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Negadi", "Tidjani", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.01589", "submitter": "Steven Bartlett", "authors": "Steven James Bartlett", "title": "The species problem and its logic: Inescapable Ambiguity and\n  Framework-relativity", "comments": "59 pages, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  For more than fifty years, taxonomists have proposed numerous alternative\ndefinitions of species while they searched for a unique, comprehensive, and\npersuasive definition.

A clear and rigorous understanding of the logic\nunderlying species definition leads both to a recognition of the inescapable\nambiguity that affects the definition of species, and to a framework-relative\napproach to species definition that is logically compelling, i.e., cannot not\nbe accepted without inconsistency.

We encode nucleotide sequences into symbolic\nsequences, called words, from which we establish meaningful length of words and\ngroup of words that share symbolic similarities. Interpreting a node to\nrepresent a group of similar words and edges to represent their functional\nconnectivity allows us to construct a network of the grammatical rules\ngoverning the appearance of group of words in the DNA. Our model allows to\npredict the transition between group of words in the DNA with unprecedented\naccuracy, and to easily calculate many informational quantities to better\ncharacterize the DNA. In addition, we reduce the DNA of known bacteria to a\nnetwork of only tens of nodes, show how our model can be used to detect similar\n(or dissimilar) genes in different organisms, and which sequences of symbols\nare responsible for the most of the information content of the DNA. Therefore,\nthe DNA can indeed be treated as a language, a markovian language, where a\n\"word\" is an element of a group, and its grammar represents the rules behind\nthe probability of transitions between any two groups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 15:55:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Srivastava", "Shambhavi", ""], ["Baptista", "Murilo S.", ""]]}]
