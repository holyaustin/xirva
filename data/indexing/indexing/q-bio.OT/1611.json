In this paper, we determine an optimal treatment policy using\nMarkov decision process modeling. The policy is optimal with respect to the\nnumber of quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) that are expected to be\naccumulated during the remaining life of a patient. The new policy takes into\naccount factors that are ignored by the current clinical policy (e.g. the\nlife-expectancy and the age-dependent surgical mortality). The resulting\noptimal policy is structurally different from the current policy. In\nparticular, the policy suggests that young patients with small aneurysms should\nundergo surgery. The robustness of the policy structure is demonstrated using\nsimulations. A gain in the number of expected QALYs is shown, which indicates a\npossibility of improved care for patients with AAAs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 17:19:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mattila", "Robert", ""], ["Siika", "Antti", ""], ["Roy", "Joy", ""], ["Wahlberg", "Bo", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02276", "submitter": "James  Peters Ph.D.", "authors": "Arturo Tozzi and James F.

However, seldom\nhas any research touched on its physiological resistance mechanism. In this\nexperiment, the impatiens is selected from those which experienced aerospace\nmutation and thereafter 12 years of cultivation and breeding. Therefore, it is\nsuperior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and\ndemonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,\nwhich intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By\nreference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens\nseeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure\nthe germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and\nexpression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower\nreaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct\ndifference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms\nof germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the\nrelative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene\nSoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the\nmutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can\nfurther cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:\nIn this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens\nimproves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained\nimpatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher\napplication value in garden virescence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 15:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Liao", "Xue Lan", ""], ["Wen", "Guo Qin", ""], ["Liu", "Qing Lin", ""], ["Wu", "Xue Yang Li Meng Xi", ""], ["Pan", "Yuan Zhi", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.05204", "submitter": "David Guillermo Fajardo Ortiz", "authors": "David Fajardo-Ortiz, Malaquias Lopez-Cervantes, Luis Duran, Michel\n  Dumontier, Miguel Lara, Hector Ochoa, and Victor M Castano", "title": "The emergence and evolution of the research fronts in HIV/AIDS research", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE, 2017 12(5): e0178293", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0178293", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.DL physics.soc-ph q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we have identified and analyzed the emergence, structure and\ndynamics of the paradigmatic research fronts that established the fundamentals\nof the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS.

The metabolic rate\n(energy production per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass.

We argue that the\ncause of interspecific allometric scaling is the total effect of physiological\nand adaptation mechanisms inherent to organisms composing a food chain.\nTogether, the workings of these mechanisms are united by a primary goal of any\nliving creature - its successful reproduction. This primary necessity of each\norganism and of the entire food chain is that common denominator, to which all\norganisms adjust their metabolic rates. In this article, we consider\nunicellular organisms, while the second paper studies multicellular organisms\nand the entire concept in more detail.
