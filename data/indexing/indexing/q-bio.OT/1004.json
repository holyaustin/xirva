In particular,\nthe role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in\nmathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies\nalong the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest\na functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a\nmathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The\n\"visual\" representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings,\nwill provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our\napproach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific\npathologies.

We\npropose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global\nnetwork structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected\nindividuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether\nsuch a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu\noutbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided\nbetween a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the\nprogression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.\n11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a\nwhole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16\nof the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the\npopulation as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional\ntime to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.\nMoreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,\npsychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Apr 2010 13:11:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Christakis", "Nicholas A.", ""], ["Fowler", "James H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5361", "submitter": "Ma\\\"el Mont\\'evil", "authors": "Giuseppe Longo and Ma\\\"el Mont\\'evil", "title": "Protention and retention in biological systems", "comments": "This paper was made possible only as part of an extended\n  collaboration with Francis Bailly (see references), a dear friend and\n  \"ma\\^itre \\'a penser\", who contributed to the key ideas.
