We have\ndesigned a simple stochastic off-lattice model of ant foraging in the absence\nof direct communication. The motion of ants is governed by two components - a\nrandom change in direction of motion that improves ability to explore the\nenvironment (facilitating food discovery), and a non-random global indirect\ninteraction component based on pheromone signalling. Using numerical\nsimulations we have studied the model behaviour in different parameter regimes\nand tested the ability of our model ants to adapt to changes in the external\nenvironment. The simulated behaviour of ants in the model recapitulated the\nexperimentally observed behaviours of real ants. Furthermore we observe\ninteresting synchronization in ant movement patterns which vary with the\ndiffusion properties of the pheromones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 11:46:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mal\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1", "Miriam", ""], ["Yates", "Christian", ""], ["Bo\u010fov\u00e1", "Katar\u00edna", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07244", "submitter": "J.
