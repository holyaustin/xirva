The\nmetallo-\\b{eta}-lactamases encoding genes are very severe in gram-negative\nbacteria especially E. coli. This study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence of\nMBLs among the clinical isolates of E. coli. A total of 65 E. coli isolates\nwere collected from various clinical samples of Malaysian patients with\nbacterial infections. The conventional microbiological test was performed for\nisolation and identification of E. coli producing MBLs strains in this\nvicinity. Multidrug Resistance (MDR) of E. coli isolates were assessed using\ndisk diffusion test. Phenotypic methods, as well as genotypic- PCR methods,\nwere performed to detect the presence of metallo-\\b{eta}-lactamase resistance\ngenes (blaIMP, blaVIM) in imipenem resistant strains. Out of 65 E. coli\nisolates, 42 isolates (57.3%) were MDR. The isolates from urine (19) produced\nsignificantly more MDR (10) isolates than other sources. Additionally, 19\n(29.2%) imipenem resistant E. coli isolates contained 10 MBLs gene, 7(36.8%)\nisolates contained blaIMP and 3(15.7%) isolates contained blaVIM genes. This\nstudy revealed the significant occurrence of MBL producing E. coli isolates in\nclinical specimens and its association with health risk factors indicating an\nalarming situation in Malaysia. It demands an appropriate concern to avoid\nfailure of treatments and infection control management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 14:06:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["MKK", "Fazlul", ""], ["S", "Deepthi", ""], ["Y", "Farzana", ""], ["A", "Najnin", ""], ["Ma", "Rashid", ""], ["B", "Munira", ""], ["C", "Srikumar", ""], ["Nazmul", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.07860", "submitter": "Andrzej Z.

This process encompasses\nnumerous biological processes ranging from embryogenesis to regeneration\nfollowing crisis such as amputation or transplantation. A fundamental\ntheoretical question is where exactly do these instructions for\n(re-)construction reside and how are they implemented? We have recently\nproposed a set of concepts, aiming to respond to these questions and to provide\nan appropriate mathematical formalization of the geometry of morphogenesis [1].\nFirst, we consider the possibility that evolution of shape is determined by\nepigenetic information, responsible for realization of different types of cell\nevents. Second, we suggest a set of rules for converting this epigenetic\ninformation into instructive signals for cell events for each cell, as well as\nfor transforming it after each cell event. Next we give notions of cell state,\ndetermined by its epigenetic array, and cell event, which is a change of cell\nstate, and formalize development as a graph (tree) of cell states connected by\n5 types of cell events, corresponding to the processes of cell division, cell\ngrowth, cell death, cell movement and cell differentiation. Here we present a\nMorphogenesis Software capable of simulating the evolution of a 3D embryo\nstarting from zygote, following a set of rules based on our theoretical\nassumptions, and thus to provide a proof-of-concept for the hypothesis of\nepigenetic code regulation. The software creates a developing embryo and a\ncorresponding graph of cell events according to the zygotic epigenetic spectrum\nand chosen parameters of the developmental rules. Variation of rules\ninfluencing the resulting shape of an embryo may help elucidating the principal\nlaws underlying pattern formation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:18:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2019 17:58:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bessonov", "N.", ""], ["Butuzova", "O.", ""], ["Minarsky", "A.", ""], ["Penner", "R.", ""], ["Soule", "C.", ""], ["Tosenberger", "A.", ""], ["Morozova", "N.", ""]]}]
