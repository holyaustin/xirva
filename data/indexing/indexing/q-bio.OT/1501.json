It\nalso correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with\nthe largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a\npredictive formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical\nmeasurements. The median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years\nplaying Native American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing\nthe instrument (p = .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress\nrates (p = .001). Physical discomfort was experienced by 47-64% of players at\nleast some of the time. Over 10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an\naverage basis. Females report significantly higher maximum and average physical\ndiscomfort than males (p < .001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span,\nhand span, and reported length of time playing and experience level all\ncorrelated with the largest flute that the player found comfortable.\nMultivariate coefficient analysis on those factors yielded a formula with a\nstrong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r = +.650). However, the\nformula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in predicting flute\ndesign. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of improving\nergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 13:41:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 10:21:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Goss", "Clinton F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01620", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vitiello", "authors": "Luc Montagnier, Emilio Del Giudice, Jamal A\\\"issa, Claude Lavallee,\n  Steven Motschwiller, Antonio Capolupo, Albino Polcari, Paola Romano, Alberto\n  Tedeschi, Giuseppe Vitiello", "title": "Transduction of DNA information through water and electromagnetic waves", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine 2015.34:106-112", "doi": "10.3109/15368378.2015.1036072", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low\nfrequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and\nviral DNAs are described.

However, the real\ncorrelation between them is presently uncertain, as previous studies have\ngenerally been conducted on the basis of small samples. In a sample of 113\nadult male prisoners, we analyzed correlations between five measures of HR/HRV\nand five psychological measures of mental health aspects (depression, state and\ntrait anxiety, and social relationships). We used Nadaraya-Watson\nnon-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman\ncorrelation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among\nHR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV\nand psychological measures were low and non-significant for the overall sample.\nHowever, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger\npeople (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p <\n.005). Overall, the general utility of HR/HRV as a marker for mental health\nacross populations remains unclear.

Most of these repeat a\nsingle untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs\ndetect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of\nmagnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have\nmagnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field\ndetection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly\nnarrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that\nmagnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates\nthe impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.\nHowever, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several\nteleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present\nin many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect\nmagnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as\ndemonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer\nfrom inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic\ndetection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies\ndepends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in\ntarget teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be\nindependently tested with adequate sample sizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 15:52:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Courtney", "Joshua", ""], ["Courtney", "Ya'el", ""], ["Courtney", "Michael", ""]]}]
