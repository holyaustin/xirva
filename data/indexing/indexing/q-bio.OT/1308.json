Cancer drugs ideally kill cancer cells\nwhile limiting harm to healthy cells. However, the inherent variance among\ncells in both cancer and healthy cell populations increases the difficulty of\nselective drug action. Here we propose a classification framework based on the\nidea that an ideal cancer drug should maximally discriminate between cancer and\nhealthy cells. We first explore how molecular markers can be used to\ndiscriminate cancer cells from healthy cells on a single cell basis, and then\nhow the effects of drugs are statistically predicted by these molecular\nmarkers. We then combine these two ideas to show how to optimally match drugs\nto tumor cells. We find that expression levels of a handful of genes suffice to\ndiscriminate well between individual cells in cancer and healthy tissue. We\nalso find that gene expression predicts the efficacy of cancer drugs,\nsuggesting that the cancer drugs act as classifiers using gene profiles. In\nagreement with our first finding, a small number of genes predict drug efficacy\nwell. Finally, we formulate a framework that defines an optimal drug, and\npredicts drug cocktails that may target cancer more accurately than the\nindividual drugs alone. Conceptualizing cancer drugs as solving a\ndiscrimination problem in the high-dimensional space of molecular markers\npromises to inform the design of new cancer drugs and drug cocktails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 19:44:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lawlor", "Patrick N.", ""], ["Kalisky", "Tomer", ""], ["Quake", "Stephen", ""], ["Rosner", "Robert", ""], ["Rosner", "Marsha Rich", ""], ["Kording", "Konrad P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2107", "submitter": "Peter Wills", "authors": "Peter R.

The\nobserved dependence of pupal transpiration on time is attributed to an\nalternation between two, essential modes, for which the deposition of a thin,\npupal skin inside the puparium and its subsequent demise are thought to be\nresponsible. For each mode of transpiration, the results of the Bursell (1958)\ninvestigation into pupal dehydration are used as a rudimentary data set. These\ndata are generalised to all temperatures and humidities by invoking the\nproperty of multiplicative separability. The problem, then, is that as the\ntemperature varies with time, so does the metabolism and the developmental\nstages to which the model data pertain, must necessarily warp. The\npuparial-duration formula of Phelps and Burrows (1969) and Hargrove (2004) is\nexploited to facilitate a mapping between the constant-temperature time domain\nof the data and that of some, more general case at hand. The resulting,\nGlossina morsitans model is extrapolated to other species using their relative\nsurface areas, their relative protected and unprotected transpiration rates and\ntheir different fourth instar excretions (drawing, to a lesser extent, from the\ndata of Buxton and Lewis, 1934). In this way the problem of pupal dehydration\nis formulated as a series of integrals and the consequent survival can be\npredicted. The discovery of a distinct definition for hygrophilic species,\nwithin the formulation, prompts the investigation of the hypothetical effect of\na two-day heat wave on pupae. This leads to the conclusion that the\nclassification of species as hygrophilic, mesophilic and xerophilic is largely\ntrue only in so much as their third and fourth instars are and, possibly, the\nhours shortly before eclosion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Aug 2013 05:14:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 May 2014 19:11:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2015 14:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Childs", "S.

These data are not complete in that all are\nat 25 $^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and the temperature-dependence cannot, therefore be\nresolved. An allowance is, nonetheless, made for the outstanding\ntemperature-dependent data. The data are generalised to all humidities, levels\nof activity and, in theory, temperatures, by invoking the property of\nmultiplicative separability. In this way a formulation, which is a very simple,\nfirst order, ordinary differential equation, is devised. The model is extended\nto include a variety of Glossina species by resorting to their relative,\nresting water loss rates in dry air. The calculated, total water loss is\nconverted to the relevant humidity, at 24 $^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, that which\nproduced an equivalent water loss in the pupa, in order to exploit an adaption\nof an established survival relationship. The resulting computational model\ncalculates total, teneral water loss, consequent mortality and adult\nrecruitment. Surprisingly, the postulated race against time, to feed, applies\nmore to the mesophilic and xerophilic species, in that increasing order. So\nmuch so that it is reasonable to conclude that, should Glossina brevipalpis\nsurvive the pupal phase, it will almost certainly survive to locate a host,\nwithout there being any significant prospect of death from dehydration.

Our goal is to determine the most effective strategies for\nreducing the overall population of Vicodin abusers.

We consider one linear and two\nnon-linear compartmental models in which medical users of Vicodin can\ntransition into the abuser compartment or leave the population by no longer\ntaking the drug. Once Vicodin abusers, people can transition into a treatment\ncompartment, with the possibility of leaving the population through successful\ncompletion of treatment or of relapsing and re-entering the abusive\ncompartment. The linear model assumes no social interaction, while both\nnon-linear models consider interaction. One considers interaction with abusers\naffecting the relapse rate, while the other assumes both this and an additional\ninteraction between the number of abusers and the number of new prescriptions.\nSensitivity analyses are conducted varying the rates of success of these\nintervention methods measured by the parameters to determine which strategy has\nthe greatest impact on controlling the population of Vicodin abusers. From\nthese models and analyses, we determine that manipulating parameters tied to\nprevention measures has a greater impact on reducing the population of abusers\nthan manipulating parameters associated with treatment.
