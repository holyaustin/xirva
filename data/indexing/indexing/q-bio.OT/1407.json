This paper presents several related investigations into the\nphysical process of both spontaneous biophoton emission and delayed\nluminescence. Since light intensities depend upon the modulus squared of their\ncorresponding electric fields we first make some general estimates about the\ninherent electric fields within various biological systems. Since photon\nemission from living matter following an initial excitation (\"delayed\nluminescence\") typically does not follow a simple exponential decay law after\nexcitation we discuss such non-exponential decays from a general theoretical\nperspective and argue that they are often to be expected and why. We then\ndiscuss the dynamics behind some nonlinear rate equations, connecting them both\nto biological growth rates and biophoton emission rates, noting a possible\nconnection with cancer. We then return to non-exponential decay laws seen for\ndelayed luminescence in an experimental context and again note a possible\nconnection with cancer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Apr 2014 23:44:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alvermann", "M.", ""], ["Srivastava", "Y.

Modern\nphysics has shown that fields are fundamental entities, and in particular that\nthe electromagnetic field is fundamental.

Our contemporary, information-rich\nenvironment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a\nperson but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,\nsocietal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being\nstatic or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,\nnecessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and\nevolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,\nbalanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including\nexposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has\ndirect or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to\nprolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a\nhormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,\neventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of\nthis biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource\nallocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell\nrepairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the\ndrastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 14:19:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kyriazis", "Marios", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7622", "submitter": "Adam Kapelner", "authors": "Adam Kapelner and Matthew Vorsanger", "title": "Starvation of Cancer via Induced Ketogenesis and Severe Hypoglycemia", "comments": "17 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.mehy.2014.11.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Neoplasms are highly dependent on glucose as their substrate for energy\nproduction and are generally not able to catabolize other fuel sources such as\nketones and fatty acids.
