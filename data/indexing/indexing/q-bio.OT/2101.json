Methods: 1-)\nTblastx searches of SARS-CoV-2 are performed by limiting searches to plasmodium\nspecies that infect human. 2-) Aligned sequences in the respective organisms'\nproteomes are searched with blastp. 3-) Binding predictions of the identified\nSARS-CoV-2 peptide to MHC class I supertype representatives are performed. 4-)\nBlastp searches of predicted-epitopes that bind strongly to the identified HLA\nallele are performed by limiting searches to human and to the plasmodium\nspecies. 5-) Peptides with minimum 60 % identity to the predicted-epitopes are\nfound in results. 6-) Peptides among those, which bind strongly to the same HLA\nallele, are predicted. 7-) Step-4 is repeated by limiting searches to human,\nfor peptides sourced by limiting searches to plasmodium species at step-4. 8-)\nStep-5 and 6 are performed with results of 7. Results: CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC peptide\nof SARS-CoV-2 has the highest identity to P. vivax. Its GYFCTCYFGLF and\nYFCTCYFGLF parts are predicted to bind strongly to HLA-A*24:02. Results\nobtained only for peptides homologous to YFCTCYFGLF, as follows: YYCARRFGLF,\nYYCHCPFGVF, and YYCQQYFFLF are potential HLA-A*24:02 epitopes in the human\nproteome. Among FFYTFYFELF, YFVACLFILF, and YFPTITFHLF peptides in the\nplasmodium species' proteomes with strong binding affinity to HLA-A*24:02, only\nFFYTFYFELF of P. falciparum is homologous to the potential HLA-A*24:02 epitope\nYFYLFSLELF in the human proteome. Conclusion: Immune responses to the\nidentified-peptides with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to\nHLA-A*24:02 may lead to autoimmune response risk in individuals with\nHLA-A*24:02 serotypes, upon getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 or P. falciparum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2021 22:52:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2021 00:19:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:11:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 06:19:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 04:21:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Adiguzel", "Yekbun", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.09153", "submitter": "Ulrike Boehm", "authors": "Glyn Nelson, Ulrike Boehm, Steve Bagley, Peter Bajcsy, Johanna\n  Bischof, Claire M Brown, Aurelien Dauphin, Ian M Dobbie, John E Eriksson,\n  Orestis Faklaris, Julia Fernandez-Rodriguez, Alexia Ferrand, Laurent Gelman,\n  Ali Gheisari, Hella Hartmann, Christian Kukat, Alex Laude, Miso Mitkovski,\n  Sebastian Munck, Alison J North, Tobias M Rasse, Ute Resch-Genger, Lucas C\n  Schuetz, Arne Seitz, Caterina Strambio-De-Castillia, Jason R Swedlow, Ioannis\n  Alexopoulos, Karin Aumayr, Sergiy Avilov, Gert-Jan Bakker, Rodrigo R Bammann,\n  Andrea Bassi, Hannes Beckert, Sebastian Beer, Yury Belyaev, Jakob Bierwagen,\n  Konstantin A Birngruber, Manel Bosch, Juergen Breitlow, Lisa A Cameron, Joe\n  Chalfoun, James J Chambers, Chieh-Li Chen, Eduardo Conde-Sousa, Alexander D\n  Corbett, Fabrice P Cordelieres, Elaine Del Nery, Ralf Dietzel, Frank Eismann,\n  Elnaz Fazeli, Andreas Felscher, Hans Fried, Nathalie Gaudreault, Wah Ing Goh,\n  Thomas Guilbert, Roland Hadleigh, Peter Hemmerich, Gerhard A Holst, Michelle\n  S Itano, Claudia B Jaffe, Helena K Jambor, Stuart C Jarvis, Antje Keppler,\n  David Kirchenbuechler, Marcel Kirchner, Norio Kobayashi, Gabriel Krens,\n  Susanne Kunis, Judith Lacoste, Marco Marcello, Gabriel G Martins, Daniel J\n  Metcalf, Claire A Mitchell, Joshua Moore, Tobias Mueller, Michael S Nelson,\n  Stephen Ogg, Shuichi Onami, Alexandra L Palmer, Perrine Paul-Gilloteaux,\n  Jaime A Pimentel, Laure Plantard, Santosh Podder, Elton Rexhepaj, Arnaud\n  Royon, Markku A Saari, Damien Schapman, Vincent Schoonderwoert, Britta\n  Schroth-Diez, Stanley Schwartz, Michael Shaw, Martin Spitaler, Martin T\n  Stoeckl, Damir Sudar, Jeremie Teillon, Stefan Terjung, Roland Thuenauer,\n  Christian D Wilms, Graham D Wright, Roland Nitschke", "title": "QUAREP-LiMi: A community-driven initiative to establish guidelines for\n  quality assessment and reproducibility for instruments and images in light\n  microscopy", "comments": "17 pages, 3 figures, shortened abstract, Co-Lead Authors: Glyn Nelson\n  and Ulrike Boehm, Corresponding author: Roland Nitschke", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.ins-det", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  In April 2020, the QUality Assessment and REProducibility for Instruments and\nImages in Light Microscopy (QUAREP-LiMi) initiative was formed.
