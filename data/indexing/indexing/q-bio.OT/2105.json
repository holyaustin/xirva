More\nspecifically, how the energy demand, expressed by the metabolic rate, changes\naccording to the mass of an organism. Empirical evidence suggests a power-law\nrelation between mass and metabolic rate, namely allometric law. For vascular\norganisms, the exponent $\\beta$ of this power-law is smaller than one, which\nimplies scaling economy; that is, the greater the organism is, the lesser\nenergy per cell it demands. However, the numerical value of this exponent is a\ntheme of an extensive debate and a central issue in comparative physiology. It\nis presented in this work some empirical data and a detailed discussion about\nthe most successful theories to explain these issues. A historical perspective\nis also shown, beginning with the first empirical insights in the sec. 19 about\nscaling properties in biology, passing through the two more important theories\nthat explain the scaling properties quantitatively. Firstly, the Rubner model,\nthat consider organism surface area and heat dissipation to derive $\\beta =\n2/3$. Secondly, the West-Brown-Enquist theory, that explains such scaling\nproperties as a consequence of the hierarchical and fractal nutrient\ndistribution network, deriving $\\beta = 3/4$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2021 14:47:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ribeiro", "Fabiano L.", ""], ["Pereira", "William R.

Research has focused on the identification\nand mapping of ecosystems, and ecosystem condition, the capacity to deliver key\necosystem services and the actual use (flow) of these services by local\ncommunities leading to benefits to human well-being. The integration of results\nfrom these different assessments demonstrates several significant synergies\nbetween ecosystem services, indicating multifunctionality in the provision of\necosystem services leading to human well-being. This is considered as key\ncriterion in the identification of green infrastructure in the Maltese Islands.\nA gradient in green infrastructure cover and ecosystem services capacity is\nobserved between rural and urban areas but ecosystem services flow per unit\narea was in some cases higher in urban environments. These results indicate a\npotential mismatch between ecosystem service demand and capacity but also\nprovide a scientific baseline for evidence-based policy which fosters the\ndevelopment of green infrastructure through nature-based innovation promoting\nmore specific and novel solutions for landscape and urban planning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 May 2021 14:13:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Balzan", "Mario V", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.07865", "submitter": "Jacques Van Helden", "authors": "Jacques van Helden, Colin D Butler, Bruno Canard, Guillaume Achaz,\n  Fran\\c{c}ois Graner, Rossana Segreto, Yuri Deigin, Fabien Colombo, Serge\n  Morand, Didier Casane, Dan Sirotkin, Karl Sirotkin, Etienne Decroly Jos\\'e\n  Halloy", "title": "An appeal for an open scientific debate about the proximal origin of\n  SARS-CoV-2", "comments": "This letter was submitted to The Lancet on January 6, 2021.

However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus\nauthoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death\ncounts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting\nof pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to\nvariability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing\ncapacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore\npotential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.\n  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government\nCovid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the\ngenerally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from\nthe recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the\ncontext of the political and fragile state dimensions.\n  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths\nby authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)\nsubstantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to\nstandard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian\ngovernments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic\nthan democratic governments.\n  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent\nto authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic\nstatistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess\npandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in\nstudies using death as an outcome variable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 May 2021 06:52:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Badman", "Ryan P.", ""], ["Wu", "Yunxin", ""], ["Inukai", "Keigo", ""], ["Akaishi", "Rei", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14372", "submitter": "Anthony Gitter", "authors": "Benjamin D.
