In both cases, predictions are possible despite large\nuncertainties in the microscopic parameters because these details are\ncompressed into just a few governing parameters that are sufficient to describe\nrelevant observables. We make this commonality explicit by examining parameter\nsensitivity in a hopping model of diffusion and a generalized Ising model of\nferromagnetism. We trace the emergence of a smaller effective model to the\ndevelopment of a hierarchy of parameter importance quantified by the\neigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. Strikingly, the same hierarchy\nappears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science. We conclude\nthat the emergence of effective continuum and universal theories in physics is\ndue to the same parameter space hierarchy that underlies predictive modeling in\nother areas of science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 04:09:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Machta", "Benjamin B.", ""], ["Chachra", "Ricky", ""], ["Transtrum", "Mark K.", ""], ["Sethna", "James P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6739", "submitter": "Maxim Makukov", "authors": "Vladimir I. shCherbak and Maxim A.

Genomic DNA is already\nused on Earth to store non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity,\nbut stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a flexible\nmapping between codons and amino acids, and this flexibility allows modifying\nthe code artificially. But once fixed, the code might stay unchanged over\ncosmological timescales. Thus, it represents a reliable storage for an\nintelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and thermodynamic\nrequirements. As the actual scenario for the origin of terrestrial life is far\nfrom being settled, the proposal that it might have been seeded intentionally\ncannot be ruled out. A statistically strong signal in the genetic code is then\na testable consequence of such scenario. Here we show that the terrestrial code\ndisplays a thorough precision orderliness matching the criteria to be\nconsidered an informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an\nensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same symbolic\nlanguage. Accurate and systematic, these underlying patterns appear as a\nproduct of precision logic and nontrivial computing rather than of stochastic\nprocesses. The patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself\nis uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The signal displays\nreadily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality. Besides, extraction of the\nsignal involves logically straightforward but abstract operations, making the\npatterns essentially irreducible to any natural origin. Plausible way of\nembedding the signal into the code and possible interpretation of its content\nare discussed. Overall, while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its\nlimited capacity is used extremely efficiently to store non-biological\ninformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 04:16:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 15:10:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 05:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:10:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["shCherbak", "Vladimir I.", ""], ["Makukov", "Maxim A.", ""]]}]
