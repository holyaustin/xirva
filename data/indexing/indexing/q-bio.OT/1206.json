The recent research established different norms to\neliminate flu pandemics. This can be made possible with skilled experimental\nanalyses and by tracking the recent virulent strain and can be broadly\napplicable with effective testing of vaccine efficacy. Every year World Health\nOrganization (WHO) reveals the administration of drug and vaccine to counter\narrest the spread of flu among the population. As there are recurrent failures\nin priming the population, the complete eradication of the flu pandemic is\nstill appears to be an unresolved problem. To overcome the current scenario,\nhigh level efforts with theoretical and practical research is required and it\ncan enhance the scope in this field. The recent advancements also allow the\nresearchers to endeavor effective vaccine to meet the emerging flu types. Only\nthe standardized vaccination among the population at the time of flu pandemics\nwill revolutionalize the current propositions against influenza virus. This\npaper shows the deficiencies of vaccine fitness research as there are reported\nfailures and less efficacy of vaccine even after priming the population from\nreferred evidences and studies. It also shows simple experimental approach in\ndetecting the effective vaccine among the vaccines announced by WHO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2012 17:49:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Jerald", "Baby", ""], ["Nair", "T.

Simple models have been used by physiologists for\na very long time. Physiologists have successfully analyzed a broad range of\nbiological systems using a 'device-oriented' approach similar to the approach\nan engineer would use to investigate her devices. The present generation views\nbiology through the powerful lenses of structural and (molecular) dynamic\nanalysis, understandably enough because of the beauty and power of the\nanalysis, and the ease of using these structures with present freely available\nsoftware. The problem is that these powerful lenses offer such magnification\nthat the engineering approach cannot be seen. High magnification means limited\nfield of view, because the (spatial) dynamic range cannot cover everything. The\nfunction of the structures and molecular dynamics cannot be seen in the work of\nmany biologists, probably because function cannot be immediately seen in the\nstructures and molecular dynamics they compute. It is just as important for\nbiologists to measure the inputs and outputs of their systems as it is to\nmeasure their structures. It seems clear, at least to one physiologist, that\nthis research will be catalyzed by assuming that most biological systems are\ndevices that can be analyzed with the same strategies one would use to analyze\nengineering devices. Thinking today about your biological preparation as a\ndevice tells you what experiments to do tomorrow. An important task for many of\nus is to transmit the physiological tradition to the next generation of\nbiophysicists to help them adapt traditional questions to the new length scales\nand techniques of molecular and atomic biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 21:14:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 12:26:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenberg", "Bob", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6774", "submitter": "Brian Williams Dr", "authors": "Brian G.
