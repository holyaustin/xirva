To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general\nfeatures of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their\nchemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.\nThus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct\ntrajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible\nsequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,\nsometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the\norganism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And\nthis is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a different\nframework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the\nview of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid\noveroptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely\ncomplemented. An increase of specification of experimental procedures is the\nway for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system\nmay be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 10:30:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["\u0160tys", "Dalibor", ""], ["Urban", "Jan", ""], ["Rycht\u00e1rikov\u00e1", "Renata", ""], ["Zhyrova", "Anna", ""], ["C\u00edsa\u0159", "Petr", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02689", "submitter": "Kazuhiro Takemoto", "authors": "Kazuhiro Takemoto", "title": "Heterogeneity of cells may explain allometric scaling of metabolic rate", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Biosystems 130, 11-16 (2015)", "doi": "10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.02.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The origin of allometric scaling of metabolic rate is a long-standing\nquestion in biology. Several models have been proposed for explaining the\norigin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,\nprevious models only demonstrate either two important observations for the\nallometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of\n3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this\nstudy, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that\ntotal surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two\nobservations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic\nrate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both\ntheoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law\nalthough several different biological strategies are considered. The model\nvalidity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the\nimportance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric\nscaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the\norigin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of\nthe model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 13:59:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:01:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Takemoto", "Kazuhiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.03815", "submitter": "Ganesh Bagler Dr", "authors": "Anupam Jain (1), Rakhi N K (2) and Ganesh Bagler (2) ((1) Centre for\n  System Science, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, India, (2) Centre for\n  Biologically Inspired System Science, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur,\n  India)", "title": "Spices form the basis of food pairing in Indian cuisine", "comments": "30 pages (inclusive of Supplementary Information), 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "IITJ/SEED/2014/0003", "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Culinary practices are influenced by climate, culture, history and geography.\nMolecular composition of recipes in a cuisine reveals patterns in food\npreferences. Indian cuisine encompasses a number of diverse sub-cuisines\nseparated by geographies, climates and cultures.

We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show\nthat, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines,\nIndian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing; more the extent\nof flavor sharing between any two ingredients, lesser their co-occurrence. This\nfeature is independent of recipe size and is not explained by ingredient\ncategory-based recipe constitution alone. Ingredient frequency emerged as the\ndominant factor specifying the characteristic flavor sharing pattern of the\ncuisine. Spices, individually and as a category, form the basis of ingredient\ncomposition in Indian cuisine.

The law of mass action does not\nautomatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,\nchosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series\nof chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of\nfar-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical\nreactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and\nequation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The\nadditional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the\nchemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that\ncase, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of\ncharge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods\nthat enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved. Variational methods\nhave only recently been developed to ensure that charge flow is conserved\nglobally, along with mass, in dissipative systems like ions in solution or\nproteins. The Energy Variational Approach EnVarA should allow the development\nof more robust models of chemical, biochemical, and biological systems, making\npractical devices more easy to design and build. These difficulties arise away\nfrom equilibrium, when current flows, and the law of mass action is applied to\na non-equilibrium situation, different from the systems considered when the law\nwas originally derived. Non-equilibrium systems are important. Almost all of\nbiology occurs away from equilibrium. Almost all devices of our technology\nfunction away from equilibrium. I believe robust models and device designs in\nthe chemical world will not be possible until continuity of current is embedded\nin a generalization of the law of mass action using a consistent variational\nmodel of energy and dissipation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 19:17:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 17:07:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2015 03:27:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Aug 2015 16:28:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2015 13:35:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenberg", "Bob", ""]]}]
