Multiple studies have corroborated the\nleading indicator concept by showing that the correlation between wastewater\nmeasurements and COVID-19 case counts is maximized when case counts are lagged.\nHowever, the meaning of \"leading indicator\" will depend on the specific\napplication of wastewater-based epidemiology, and the correlation analysis is\nnot relevant for all applications. In fact, the quantification of a leading\nindicator will depend on epidemiological, biological, and health systems\nfactors. Thus, there is no single \"lead time\" for wastewater-based COVID-19\nmonitoring. To illustrate this complexity, we enumerate three different\napplications of wastewater-based epidemiology for COVID-19: a qualitative\n\"early warning\" system; an independent, quantitative estimate of disease\nprevalence; and a quantitative alert of bursts of disease incidence. The\nleading indicator concept has different definitions and utility in each\napplication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 18:48:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:16:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Olesen", "Scott W.", ""], ["Imakaev", "Maxim", ""], ["Duvallet", "Claire", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.00739", "submitter": "Gopal P.
