The informational vs metabolic aspects of life in these respective\nscenarios can be linked together via a framboid-based theory of Sawlowicz\n(2000), as these assemblies typically form in colloidal environments.

It is further shown that summing entropies according to the\nPlanck-Boltzmann (P-B) definition of entropy is formally the same as ISS, which\nis why ISS works. Approximate values of the probabilities of fatality are used\nto calculate the Gibb's entropy, which is more accurate than the P-B entropy\nfar from equilibrium, and are shown to be again proportional to ISS. For the\ncategorisation of injury using entropies it is necessary to consider the\nunderlying entropy of the individuals morbidity to which is added the entropy\nof trauma, which then may result in death. Adding in the underlying entropy and\nsumming entropies of all AIS3+ values gives a more extended scale than ISS, and\nso entropy is considered the preferred measure. A small scale trial is\nconducted of these concepts using the APROSYS In-Depth Pedestrian database, and\nthe differences between the measures are illustrated. It is shown that adopting\nan entropy approach to categorising injury severity highlights the position of\nthe elderly, who have a reduced physiological reserve to resist further\ntraumatic onslaught. There are other informational entropy-like measures, here\ncalled i-entropy, which can also be used to classify injury severity, which are\noutlined. A large scale trial of these various entropy or i-entropy measures\nneeds to be conducted to assess the usefulness of the measures. In the\nmeantime, an age compensated ISS measure such as ASCOT or TRISS is recommended.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Aug 2010 11:39:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Neal-Sturgess", "Clive", ""]]}]
