However, this theory is not easy\nto test empirically, as exact measures of parental investment in an\nexperimental set-up are difficult to obtain. We have used the Indian feral dog\nas a model system to test the POC theory in their natural habitat in the\ncontext of the mother's tendency to share food given by humans with her pups in\nthe weaning and post-weaning stage. Our behavioural bioassay convincingly\ndemonstrates an increase of conflict and decrease of cooperation by the mother\nwith her offspring over a span of 4-6 weeks. We also demonstrate that the\nconflict is intentional, and is not influenced by the hunger levels of the pups\nor the litter size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2012 12:16:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Majumder", "Sreejani Sen", ""], ["Paul", "Manabi", ""], ["Bhadra", "Anindita", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.1158", "submitter": "Nadya Morozova", "authors": "Nadya Morozova, Mikhail Shubin", "title": "The Geometry of Morphogenesis and the Morphogenetic Field Concept", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT math.DG physics.gen-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The process of morphogenesis, which can be defined as an evolution of the\nform of an organism, is one of the most intriguing mysteries in the life\nsciences. It is clear, that gene expression patterns cannot explain the\ndevelopment of the precise geometry of an organism and its parts in space.\nHere, we suggest a set of postulates and possible approaches for discovering\nthe correspondence between molecular biological information and its realization\nin a given geometry of an organism in space-time. First, we suggest that the\ngeometry of the organism and its parts is coded by a molecular code located on\nthe cell surfaces in such a way that, with each cell, there can be associated a\ncorresponding matrix, containing this code. As a particular model, we propose\ncoding by several types of oligosaccharide residues of glycoconjugates. Second,\nwe provide a notion of cell event, and suggest a description of development as\na tree of cell events, where under cell event we understand the changing of\ncell state, e.g. the processes of cell division, cell growth/death, shift or\ndifferentiation. Next we suggest describing these cell motion laws using the\nnotion of a \"morphogenetic field\", meaning by the field an object in an \"event\nspace\" over a \"cell space\", which govern the transformation of the coded\nbiological information into an instructive signal for a cell event for a given\ncell, depending on the position of a cell in the developing embryo. The matrix\non a cell surface will be changed after each cell event according to the\nrule(s) dictated by the morphogenetic field of an organism. Finally, we provide\nsome ideas on the connection between morphogenetic code on a cell surface, cell\nmotion law(s) and the geometry of an embryo.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2012 20:33:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2013 10:00:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Morozova", "Nadya", ""], ["Shubin", "Mikhail", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4134", "submitter": "Serguey Mayburov NN", "authors": "S.N.

We find these mosquitoes flap their wings at\napproximately 850 Hz. We also generate body yaw, body pitch and wing deviation\nmeasurements with standard deviations of less than 1 degree and find that\nsideways velocity and acceleration are important components of mosquito motion.\nRapid turns involving changes in flight direction often involve large sideways\naccelerations. These do not correspond to commensurate changes in body heading,\nand the insect's flight direction and body heading are decoupled during flight.\nThese findings call in to question the role of yaw control in mosquito flight.\nIn addition, using orientation data, we find that sideways accelerations are\nwell explained by roll-based rotation of the lift vector. In contrast, the\ninsect's body pitch angle does not correlate with its forward acceleration.\nThis implies that controlling body roll is important to mosquito dynamics. The\ndynamic importance of stabilizing body pitch and body yaw is less clear.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2012 19:31:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Iams", "S.
