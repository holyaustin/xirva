A combination of natural language processing and\nmachine learning techniques were used to determine what people are tweeting\nabout Zika. Specifically, a two-stage classifier system was built to find\nrelevant tweets on Zika, and then categorize these into the four disease\ncategories. Tweets in each disease category were then examined using latent\ndirichlet allocation (LDA) to determine the five main tweet topics for each\ndisease characteristic. Results 1,234,605 tweets were collected. Tweets by\nmales and females were similar (28% and 23% respectively). The classifier\nperformed well on the training and test data for relevancy (F=0.87 and 0.99\nrespectively) and disease characteristics (F=0.79 and 0.90 respectively). Five\ntopics for each category were found and discussed with a focus on the symptoms\ncategory. Through this process, we demonstrate how misinformation can be\ndiscovered so that public health officials can respond to the tweets with\nmisinformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 18:52:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Michele", ""], ["Banerjee", "Dr. Tanvi", ""], ["Muppalla", "RoopTeja", ""], ["Romine", "Dr. William", ""], ["Sheth", "Dr. Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08388", "submitter": "David Ruelle", "authors": "David Ruelle", "title": "The origin of life seen from the point of view of non-equilibrium\n  statistical mechanics", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This note presents a minimal approach to the origin of life, following\nstandard ideas.
