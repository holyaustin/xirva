We describe the\ndynamic origin of the high efficiency and precise targeting of \\textit{Taq}\nactivity in PCR. The spatiotemporal distribution of interaction couplings,\nfrequencies, amplitudes, and phase modulations comprise a pattern of fields\nwhich constitutes the electromagnetic image of DNA in the surrounding water,\nwhich is what the polymerase enzyme actually recognizes in the DNA water\nenvironment. The experimental realization of PCR amplification, achieved\nthrough replacement of the DNA template by the treatment of pure water with\nelectromagnetic signals recorded from viral and bacterial DNA solutions, is\nfound consistent with the gauge theory paradigm of quantum fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 23:04:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Montagnier", "Luc", ""], ["A\u00efssa", "Jamal", ""], ["Capolupo", "Antonio", ""], ["Craddock", "Travis J.
