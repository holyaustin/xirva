While it\nhas been suggested that information transmission is optimized near the critical\npoint, it remains unclear how information transmission depends on the dynamics\nof the input signal, the distance over which the information needs to be\ntransmitted, and the distance to the critical point. Here we employ stochastic\nsimulations of a driven 2D Ising system and study the instantaneous mutual\ninformation and the information transmission rate between a driven input spin\nand an output spin. The instantaneous mutual information varies\nnon-monotonically with the temperature, but increases monotonically with the\ncorrelation time of the input signal. In contrast, the information transmission\nrate exhibits a maximum as a function of the input correlation time. Moreover,\nthere exists an optimal temperature that maximizes this maximum information\ntransmission rate. It arises from a tradeoff between the necessity to respond\nfast to changes in the input so that more information per unit amount of time\ncan be transmitted, and the need to respond to reliably. The optimal\ntemperature lies above the critical point, but moves towards it as the distance\nbetween the input and output spin is increased.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 13:26:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Meijers", "Matthijs", ""], ["Ito", "Sosuke", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.01464", "submitter": "Dr. Biplab Chattopadhyay", "authors": "Nirmalendu Hui and Biplab Chattopadhyay", "title": "Studies on Bone-mass Formation within a Theoretical Model", "comments": "14 pages, 11 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1307.5833", "journal-ref": "IOSR Journal of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, Volume 9, Issue\n  4 Ver.

High value of\nosteocytes with moderate level values of osteoblast and osteoclast, all at\nasymptotic scale, imply creation of new bone-matter in our model.

It allows for the timely reaction to regular or\npredicted events, reducing the pressure for fast processing of sensory input.\nThus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the present paper, we consider\nminimal abstract pure clocks in different configurations and investigate their\ncharacteristic dynamics. We are especially interested in optimally\ntime-resolving clocks. Among these, we find fundamentally diametral clock\ncharacteristics, such as oscillatory behavior for purely local time measurement\nor decay-based clocks measuring time periods of a scale global to the problem.\nWe include also sets of independent clocks (\"clock bags\"), sequential cascades\nof clocks and composite clocks with controlled dependency. Clock cascades show\na \"condensation effect\" and the composite clock shows various regimes of\nmarkedly different dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:13:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Robu", "Andrei D.", ""], ["Salge", "Christoph", ""], ["Nehaniv", "Chrystopher L.", ""], ["Polani", "Daniel", ""]]}]
