Incorporation of time rates into\nAvrami equations for fractions of open channels yields for each channel a\ntemperature independent dimensionless constant that is close in value to the\nfine structure constant. It also reveals temperature independent scaling\nexponents. Evidence is presented that the action potential traverses a\nferroelectric hysteresis loop. This results in a second order phase transition\npolarization flip at the peak of the action potential, followed by closing of\nsodium and opening of potassium channels, and finally closing the loop by\nreversing the polarization flip as the resting potential is reached.
