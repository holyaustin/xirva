These cultures can be selected under the\npermanent presence of carbon and the PHA production can be enhanced in\nsubsequent accumulation steps. To optimize the PHA production in accumulator\nreactors, this work evaluated the impact of 1) initial acetate concentration,\n2) light intensity, 3) removal of residual nitrogen on the culture performance.\nResults indicate that low acetate concentration (<30CmM) and specific light\nintensities around 20W/gX are optimal operating conditions that lead to high\npolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage yields (0.83+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol-Acet) and\nspecific PHB production rates of 2.21+-0.07 Cmol-PHB/Cmol X d. This rate is\nthree times higher than previously registered in non-optimized accumulation\ntests and enabled a PHA content increase from 15 to 30% in less than 4h. Also,\nit was shown for the first time, the capability of a PMC to use a real waste,\nfermented cheese whey, to produce PHA with a hydroxyvalerate (HV) content of\n12%. These results confirm that fermented wastes can be used as substrates for\nPHA production with PMCs and that the energy levels in sunlight that lead to\nspecific light intensities from 10 to 20W/gX are sufficient to drive\nphototrophic PHA production processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2019 18:23:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fradinho", "Joana", ""], ["Oehmen", "Adrian", ""], ["Reis", "Maria", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.04949", "submitter": "Sharmistha Mishra", "authors": "Huiting Ma (1), Linwei Wang (1), Peter Gichangi (2,3), Vernon Mochache\n  (4), Griffins Manguro (3), Helgar K Musyoki (5), Parinita Bhattacharjee\n  (6,7), Fran\\c{c}ois Cholette (8,9), Paul Sandstrom (8,9), Marissa L Becker\n  (7), Sharmistha Mishra (1,10,11,12) (on behalf of the Transitions Study Team,\n  (1) Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael's Hospital, Unity Health\n  Toronto, Toronto, Canada, (2) University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya, (3)\n  International Centre for Reproductive Health-Kenya, Mombasa, Kenya, (4)\n  University of Maryland, Centre for International Health, Education and\n  Biosecurity, College Park, United States, (5) National AIDS & STI Control\n  Programme, Nairobi, Kenya, (6) Key Populations Technical Support Unit,\n  Partners for Health and Development in Africa, Nairobi, Kenya, (7) Centre for\n  Global Public Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada, (8) National\n  HIV and Retrovirology Laboratory, JC Wilt Infectious Diseases Research\n  Centre, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Canada, (9) Department of\n  Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, University of Manitoba,\n  Winnipeg, Canada, (10) Department of Medicine, University of Toronto,\n  Toronto, Canada, (11) Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto,\n  Toronto, Canada, (12) Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation,\n  University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada)", "title": "Venue-based HIV testing at sex work hotspots to reach adolescent girls\n  and young women living with HIV: a cross-sectional study in Mombasa, Kenya", "comments": "16 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Background: We estimated the potential number of newly diagnosed HIV\ninfections among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) using a venue-based\napproach to HIV testing at sex work hotspots.\n  Methods: We used hotspot enumeration and cross-sectional bio-behavioural\nsurvey data from the 2015 Transitions Study of AGYW aged 14-24 years who\nfrequented hotspots in Mombasa, Kenya.

The large-scale pattern of distribution of genes on the\nchromosomes in the known animal genomes is not well characterized. We\nhypothesized that individual genes will be distributed on chromosomes in a\nmathematically ordered manner across the animal kingdom. Results. Twenty-one\nanimal genomes reported in the NCBI database were examined. Numerically, there\nwas a trend towards increasing overall gene content with increasing size of the\ngenome as reflected by the chromosomal complement. Gene frequency on individual\nchromosomes in each animal genome was analyzed and demonstrated uniformity of\nproportions within each animal with respect to both average gene frequency on\nindividual chromosomes and gene distribution across the unique genomes.\nFurther, average gene distribution across animal species followed a\nrelationship whereby it was, approximately, inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the number of chromosomes in the unique animal genomes,\nconsistent with the notion that there is an ordered increase in gene dispersion\nas the complexity of the genome increased. To further corroborate these\nfindings a derived measure, termed gene spacing on chromosomes correlated with\ngene frequency and gene distribution. Conclusion. As animal species have\nevolved, the distribution of their genes on individual chromosomes and within\ntheir genomes, when viewed on a large scale is not random, but follows a\nmathematically ordered process, such that as the complexity of the organism\nincreases, the genes become less densely distributed on the chromosomes and\nmore dispersed across the genome.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2019 01:42:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Toor", "Abdullah A.", ""], ["MD", "Amir A.

The key point in this model is the assumption that the body does\nnot have internal clocks that count out the chronological time at scales of\ndecades. At these scales, we may limit ourselves by empirical consideration\nonly the background (smoothed, averaged) processes. The body is dealing with\ninternal biological factors, which can be considered as the biological clocks\nin suitable parameterization of corresponding variables. The dynamics of these\nvariables is described using a system of autonomous ODEs. A particular\nrepresentation of the right-hand side of equations in the form of quadratic\npolynomials is considered. In the simplest case of one variable we deal with a\nlogistic equation, which has an analytical solution. Such quadratic model is\njustified if it is used to predict the dynamic of aging process for relatively\nsmall time intervals. However, since a well-defined biological interpretation\ncan be given for the quadratic right-hand side of the equations, we can expect\nthat the area of applicability of this simplified empirical model can extend to\nrelatively large time intervals. The considered model is, in our opinion, a\ngood and simple mathematical framework for organizing experimental data. The\nmodel may be useful to quantify and arrange the chains of causal relationships\nthat may appear significant for the development of the aging process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 18:03:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:16:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Morokov", "Yu.
