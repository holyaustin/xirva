These\neffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\ntopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\ndescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\nmodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\nthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\na system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\nthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\nstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\neffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\ndynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\ncontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\nwith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\nbecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\nstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and\ncounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\ncooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's\ndilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\nstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\nwith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\nthe emergence of global oscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 11:02:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 15:49:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2008 11:29:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Szollosi", "Gergely J", ""], ["Derenyi", "Imre", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3808", "submitter": "Jakob Enemark", "authors": "Jakob Enemark and Kim Sneppen", "title": "On Gene Duplication Models for Evolving Regulatory Networks", "comments": "14 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2007/11/P11007", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.OT", "license": null, "abstract": "  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular\nnetworks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in\nitself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites\nin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene\nduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree\ndistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream\nregions of genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2007 16:16:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 10:06:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Enemark", "Jakob", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3826", "submitter": "Mark Ya.
