We also report for the first time milk theft\nby pups who take advantage of the presence of multiple lactating females, due\nto the promiscuous mating system of the dogs. This behaviour, though apparently\ndisadvantageous for the mothers, is perhaps adaptive for the dogs in the face\nof high mortality and competition for resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jul 2016 20:42:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paul", "Manabi", ""], ["Bhadra", "Anindita", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.01135", "submitter": "Anindita Bhadra", "authors": "Manabi Paul, Shubhra Sau, Anjan K.

While mothers need to invest considerable time\nand energy in ensuring the survival of their current offspring, they also need\nto optimize their investment in one batch of offspring in order to ensure\nfuture reproduction and hence lifetime reproductive success. Free-ranging dogs\nlive in small social groups, mate promiscuously, and lack the cooperative\nbreeding biology of other group living canids. They face high early life\nmortality, which in turn reduces fitness benefits of the mother from a batch of\npups. We carried out a field based study on free-ranging dogs in India to\nunderstand the nature of parental care provided by mothers at different stages\nof pup development. Using behavioural patterns of mother-pup interactions, we\ndraw up a timeline of pup ontogeny. Our analysis reveals that mothers cleverly\nreduce investment in energy intensive active care and increase passive care as\nthe pups grow older, thereby keeping overall levels of parental care more or\nless constant over pup age.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jul 2016 07:37:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paul", "Manabi", ""], ["Sau", "Shubhra", ""], ["Nandi", "Anjan K.", ""], ["Bhadra", "Anindita", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.01138", "submitter": "Anindita Bhadra", "authors": "Manabi Paul and Anindita Bhadra", "title": "Do dogs live in joint families?

We conducted a five year\nlong study on parental care of free-ranging dogs in India. We observed\nwidespread alloparenting by both adult males and females. Allomothers provided\nsignificantly less care that the mothers, but the putative fathers showed\ncomparable levels of care with the mothers. However, the nature of care varied;\nmothers invested more effort in feeding and allogrooming, while the putative\nfathers played and protected more. We were unsure of the relatedness of the\npups with the putative fathers, but all the allomothers were maternal relatives\nof the pups, which provides support for both the benefit-of-philopatry and\nassured fitness returns hypotheses. Free-ranging dogs are not cooperative\nbreeders like wolves, but are more similar to communal breeders.
