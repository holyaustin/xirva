By modeling each cell in eukaryotic organisms as a processor\nhaving a unique set of allowed states, represented by a specific DNA sequence,\nwe demonstrate a method by which gene expression can be regulated. As the\ntheory is developed, we suggest reasons for the complementary, quaternary\n(4-base) coding scheme used in most eukaryotes. A role for transposable\nelements is suggested, as is a role for the abundance of noncoding DNA, along\nwith a clearly-defined method by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's)\nmay alter gene expression. The effect of various errors is considered. Finally,\na mechanism for inter-processor communication is proposed to explain cell-cell\nrecognition processes, which leads to an elucidation of a possible pathway by\nwhich nonmutagenic carcinogenic agents may act.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 19:26:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jacobson", "Barry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.4927", "submitter": "Seyed Aidin Sajedi", "authors": "Seyed Aidin Sajedi and Fahimeh Abdollahi", "title": "Correlation of multiple sclerosis incidence in the UK 1990-2010 with\n  geomagnetic disturbances", "comments": "4 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Mackenzie et al. reported incidence and prevalence of multiple\nsclerosis (MS) in the UK from 1990-2010. Authors of this report indicated that\nthey could not explain the cause of decreasing MS incidence trend in the UK\nduring this time period. Such inability mainly resulted from the fact that\noften-cited hypotheses of MS, such as vitamin D deficiency hypothesis, cannot\nprovide any answer for MS incidence trends. However, the newly proposed\nhypothesis of MS that is based on the biological effects of geomagnetic\ndisturbances (GMD) has the ability to provide explanations for this observed\ntrend. In this commentary, we showed that there is a significant correlation\namong alterations in GMD with changes in MS incidence and explained how\nresearchers can use GMD hypothesis to evaluate such relations. Moreover, we\nclarified why we need a revision in the method of reporting MS incidence data\nto find actual environmental factor of MS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Dec 2013 21:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sajedi", "Seyed Aidin", ""], ["Abdollahi", "Fahimeh", ""]]}]
