However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can\nlead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl\nradical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic\ninflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the\ninvolvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a\nlarge number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and\ninflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation\nof cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many\nsimilarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e.\niron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The\nstudies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic\nand neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and\nlesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and\nlongevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is\nthus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As\nsystems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have\nmultiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent\npatterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of\nmultiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the\ndecidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Aug 2008 19:31:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kell", "Douglas B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1780", "submitter": "Denis Semenov A.", "authors": "Denis A.
