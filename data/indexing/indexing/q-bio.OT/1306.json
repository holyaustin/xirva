There is no consensus on the function and nature of dreaming.\nHere we present a theory for governing neural activity in the human brain. The\ntheory describes the mechanisms for building memory traces for entities and\nexplains how verbal memory is integrated with sensory memory. We infer that a\ncore function of dreaming is to move charged particles such as calcium ions\nfrom the hippocampus to association areas to primary areas. We link a high\nlevel of calcium ions concentrations to Alzheimer's disease. We present a more\nprecise definition of consciousness. Our results are a step forward in\nunderstanding the function and health of the human brain and provide the public\nwith ways to keep a healthy brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 18:20:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Xiaoqiu", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6793", "submitter": "Vadim Volkov S", "authors": "Vadim Volkov", "title": "Translating photobiology to electrophysiology: A brief overview of\n  several photobiological processes with accent on electrophysiology", "comments": "32 pages, 7 figures, preprint", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The mini-review gives special attention to holistic approach and mechanisms\nof processes. The physical and chemical frames and background for visual\nperception and signalling are discussed. Perception of photons by retinal rod\ncells is described in more detail starting from photon absorption and\nculminating in ion currents. Dark noise and temperature-dependence of\nphotoreceptor cells are analysed. Perception of polarised light, its effects\nand informational importance are discussed based on underlying mechanisms and\nspecialised morphological structures of biological organisms. Role of\nstatistics of photons in photoreception is questioned. The review also\npinpoints new and developing directions and raises questions for the future\nresearch.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 11:16:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Volkov", "Vadim", ""]]}]
