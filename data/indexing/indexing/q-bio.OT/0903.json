The model provides a\nframework for describing the emergence of multiple ecological scenarios and\nbehaves in two extreme limits either as the unified neutral theory of\nbiodiversity or as the Bak-Sneppen model. Interestingly, the model shows a\ncondensation phase transition where one species becomes the dominant one, the\ndiversity in the ecosystems is strongly reduced and the ecosystem is\nnon-stationary. This phase transition extend the principle of competitive\nexclusion to open ecosystems and might be relevant for the study of the impact\nof invasive species in native ecologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 12:49:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2009 13:51:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bianconi", "Ginestra", ""], ["Ferretti", "Luca", ""], ["Franz", "Silvio", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4131", "submitter": "Tidjani Negadi", "authors": "Tidjani Negadi", "title": "The genetic code degeneracy and the amino acids chemical composition are\n  connected", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Neuroquantology, Vol.7, 1, 181-187, 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that our recently published Arithmetic Model of the genetic code\nbased on Godel Encoding is robust against symmetry transformations, specially\nRumer s one U > G, A > C, and constitutes a link between the degeneracy\nstructure and the chemical composition of the 20 canonical amino acids.
