However there is no\nuniversally accepted, formal, and yet broadly applicable definition of what an\norganism is. Here we introduce a candidate definition. We adopt the view that\nthe \"organism\" is a functional concept, used by scientists to address\nparticular questions concerning the future state of a biological system, rather\nthan something wholly defined by that system. In this approach organisms are a\ncoarse-graining of a fine-grained dynamical model of a biological system.\nCrucially, the coarse-graining of the system into organisms is chosen so that\ntheir dynamics can be used by scientists to make accurate predictions of those\nfeatures of the biological system that interests them, and do so with minimal\ncomputational burden. To illustrate our framework we apply it to a dynamic\nmodel of lichen symbiosis---a system where either the lichen or its constituent\nfungi and algae could reasonably be considered \"organisms.\" We find that the\nbest choice for what organisms are in this scenario are complex mixtures of\nmany entities that do not resemble standard notions of organisms. When we\nrestrict our allowed coarse-grainings to more traditional types of organisms,\nwe find that ecological conditions, such as niche competition and predation\npressure, play a significant role in determining the best choice for organisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:21:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Libby", "Eric", ""], ["Grochow", "Joshua", ""], ["DeDeo", "Simon", ""], ["Wolpert", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00098", "submitter": "Yuri Shestopaloff", "authors": "Yuri K.

Metabolic rate of organisms (amount of\nenergy produced per unit time) increases slower than organisms' mass, which has\nimportant consequences for life organization. This phenomenon, when considered\nacross different taxa, is called interspecific allometric scaling. Here, on the\nbasis of introduced biomechanical models, physiological and evolutionary\nprinciples, we discover and validate its fundamental mechanisms. Calculated\ntheoretical values of allometric exponents for the maximal and basal metabolic\nrates, for mammals, reptiles, fish and birds, correspond to experimental data.\nThis proves that the cooperative action of discovered mechanisms, indeed, is\nthe cause of this phenomenon, and that allometric scaling is rather a\nstatistical effect of individual evolutionary and physiological adaptations of\norganisms within the food chain, both in terms of metabolism and biomechanical\nconstraints. The increase in size is coupled with the increase of the overall\nmetabolic rate due to the change of biomechanical characteristics and the need\nto meet certain functional requirements for a successful reproduction (like the\nspeed advantage over the prey). On one hand, organisms have to reliably acquire\nsufficient food for that. On the other hand, neither biomechanical nor\nmetabolic advantage can be too strong - otherwise, the food chain could be\ndestroyed. The counteraction of these two needs establishes a dynamic balance\nin the food chain, which, together with biomechanical constraints, explains the\nphenomenon of allometric scaling.

Its brain model\nuses logic cells (gates) to create a high frequency spike generator. Addition\nlogic cells create a timing framework based upon Pulse Width Modulation (PWM),\nand create multi-cell, spike driven muscle actuators and bi-directional shift\nregisters that serve as memories. Together, these logic cells generate a pulse\ntrain that forms a recurrent fractal in the form of coherent square waves that\nconsist of an equal number of set pulses and reset pulses. These pulses drive\nthe actuators that pump water and food through its shell. Some of these\nindividuals lose their permanent attachment to the sea floor, and evolve the\nability to move around using the feeding motions. This creates the hazard of\ngetting stuck against an object or moving away from its breeding community.\nThey evolve a sensor system and logic cells that produce a restoring motion for\neach avoidance motion. This keeps the animal in the specific region of an\nobject that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of\nthe fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed\nin its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add\nplus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the\nanimal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve\nthat allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow\nthe animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using\npermanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,\ninformation is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one\nlogic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)\nconnections between cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Dec 2016 22:16:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 17:09:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "Robert Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.04695", "submitter": "Yuri Shestopaloff", "authors": "Yuri K.

When the size of organisms increases,\nthe metabolic rate increases slower than organisms' mass. This effect is called\nallometric scaling. It has important implications for the individual and\npopulation organismal development. Here, we study the causes of this phenomenon\nconsidering metabolic properties of unicellular organisms (Amoeba Proteus,\nfission yeast S. pombe, E. coli, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus). We found that\nthe metabolic properties of unicellular organisms are defined by two primary\nfactors. One is the need to acquire nutrients through the surface in a common\nnutritional environment, which forms the base part of 2/3 of an allometric\nexponent. The other factor is a regular increase of nutrient influx per unit\nsurface, when organisms' mass increases. This is a manifestation of metabolic\nadvantage, which bigger organisms need to have in order to support their\nmetabolic requirements. On the other hand, this advantage cannot be too strong,\nwhich could lead to destruction of species, organisms feed on or compete for\nnutrients within the food chain. Accounting for this regular increase of\nnutrient influx, we obtained allometric exponents and their range close to\nexperimental values. This supports an argument that the metabolic properties of\nliving organisms, and interspecific allometric scaling in particular, indeed,\nare defined by nutrient acquisition through the surface and a regular increase\nof nutrient influx per unit surface, in a way that preserves a dynamic balance\nbetween populations within the food chain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 15:40:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Nov 2017 01:50:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shestopaloff", "Yuri K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08742", "submitter": "Shuguan Ji", "authors": "Shuguan Ji, Bob Eisenberg, Weishi Liu", "title": "Flux ratios and channel structures", "comments": "47 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate Ussing's unidirectional fluxes and flux ratios of charged\ntracers motivated particularly by the insightful proposal of Hodgkin and Keynes\non a relation between flux ratios and channel structure. Our study is based on\nanalysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic\nflows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson\nequation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and\nis in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all\nphysical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions\nand channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in\nflux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk\nconditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that\nare specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.\nUniversal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux\nratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two\ntreatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important\nproperties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main\nion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests\na better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the\nmain ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns\nratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties\nof channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of\nestimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the\nspatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and\nthus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,\neven with ideal ionic solutions. ...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2016 02:32:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Shuguan", ""], ["Eisenberg", "Bob", ""], ["Liu", "Weishi", ""]]}]
