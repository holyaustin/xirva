Yet\nwe currently have no biologically plausible model capable of universal\ncomputation, i.e., Turing-equivalent in scope. Network models (which include\nneural networks, intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory\nnetworks) fall short of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of\nexplaining cognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge\ntwo concepts from distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda\ncalculus) and molecular biology. A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it\npossible to compute any computable function with identical algorithmic\ncomplexity to that of Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily\ncomplex molecular machinery or any processes that radically differ from what we\nalready know to occur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each\nof the rules and RNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching\nthrough their secondary structure. The most plausible of these models does not\nstrictly mimic the operation rules of combinatory logic or lambda calculus; it\nrelies on standard RNA transcription from static genomic templates and the\nediting rules can be implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations.\nThis demonstrates that universal computation is well within the reach of\nmolecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to assume that life has evolved -\nor possibly began with - a universal computer that yet remains to be\ndiscovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated computational problems across\nmany scales can potentially be solved using the same RNA-based computation\nsystem. Experimental validation of this theory may immensely impact our\nunderstanding of memory, cognition, development, disease, evolution, and the\nearly stages of life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:38:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2020 18:19:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Akhlaghpour", "Hessameddin", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.09039", "submitter": "Mathieu Desroches", "authors": "Tam\\`as F\\\"ul\\\"op, Mathieu Desroches, Fernando Ant\\^onio N\\'obrega\n  Santos, Serafim Rodrigues", "title": "Why we should use Topological Data Analysis in Ageing: towards defining\n  the \"Topological shape of ageing\"", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Living systems are subject to the arrow of time; from birth, they undergo\ncomplex transformations (self-organization) in a constant battle for survival,\nbut inevitably ageing and disease trap them to death.
