Eleven commercial\nfarms were selected for this study. Four housing systems were represented:\nsmall groups of five to seven sows (SG), free access stalls (FS) with exercise\narea, electronic sow feeder with a stable group (ESFsta) or a dynamic group\n(ESFdyn). Ten sows in mid-gestation were observed in each farm. The\nobservations of motor activity were made for 6 hours at the first meal or at\nthe start of the feeding sequence, two consecutive days and at regular\nintervals of 4 minutes. The results show that the motor activity of\ngroup-housed sows depends on the housing system. The activity is higher with\nthe ESFdyn system (standing: 55.7%), sows are less active in the SG system\n(standing: 26.5%), and FS system is intermediate. The distance traveled by sows\nin ESF system is linked to a larger area available. Thus, sows travel an\naverage of 362 m $\\pm$ 167 m in the ESFdyn system with an average available\nsurface of 446 m${}^2$ whereas sows in small groups travel 50 m $\\pm$ 15 m for\n15 m${}^2$ available.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2018 09:09:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ramonet", "Yannick", ""], ["Tertre", "Ana\u00efs", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.01011", "submitter": "Ishtiaque Ahammad", "authors": "Ishtiaque Ahammad", "title": "Identification of Key Proteins Involved in Axon Guidance Related\n  Disorders: A Systems Biology Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Axon guidance is a crucial process for growth of the central and peripheral\nnervous systems.
