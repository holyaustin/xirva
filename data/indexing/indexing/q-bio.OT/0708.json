It has been shown that appearance of a receptive\nfemale in the neighboring compartment of common cage separated by perforated\ntransparent partition produces the enhancement of testosterone level in blood\nand stimulates the behavioral activity near partition as a reaction to the\nreceptive female in naive males. In many studies this behavioral activity is\nconsidered as sexual motivation, arising in this experimental context in male\nmice. The lack of correlation between behavioral parameters and gonad reaction\nof males on receptive female, uninterconnected changes of these two parameters\nas well as the lack of sexual behavior between naive male and female when\npartition is removed cast doubt on this data interpretation. It has been\nsupposed that in naive males behavioral reaction to a receptive female is\ninduced by positive incentive - odor of the female associated with nursing and\nwarmth from mother and other females which look after posterity. Short-term\nincrease of the level of testosterone (possessing rewarding properties) is\ninnate stimulus-response reaction which stimulates and prolongs behavioral\ninterest of male to receptive female. It has been supposed that after sexual\nexperience female odor is associated in experienced males with sexual behavior\ndirected to the sexual partner and resulted in the formation of sexual\nmotivation. The data are considered also in the light of the theory of\nmotivated behavior including \"liking\", \"wanting\" and \"learning\" [Robinson and\nBerridge, 1993, 2000].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2007 08:35:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kudryavtseva", "N.
