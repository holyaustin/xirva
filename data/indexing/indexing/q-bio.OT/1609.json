Hence, existing influenza drugs could not cope with H1N1 infection\ndue to the high mutation rate of the virus. In this respect, new method to\nblock the virus was devised. The polymerase PAC-PB1N enzyme is responsible for\nthe replication of H1N1 virus. Thus, novel inhibitors were developed to ward\noff the functionality of the enzyme. In this research, cyclic peptides has been\nchosen to inhibit PAC-PB1N due to its proven stability in reaching the drug\ntarget. Thus, computational method for elucidating the molecular interaction\nbetween cyclic peptides and PAC-PB1N has been developed by using the LigX tools\nfrom MOE 2008.10 software. The tools could render the bindings that involved in\nthe interactions. The interactions between individual amino acid in the\ninhibitor and enzyme could be seen as well. Thus, the peptide sequences of\nCKTTC and CKKTC were chosen as the lead compounds. In this end, the feasibility\nof cyclic peptides to act as drug candidate for H1N1 could be exposed by the 2d\nand 3d modeling of the molecular interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 03:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Parikesit", "Arli Aditya", ""], ["Noviardi", "Harry", ""], ["Kerami", "Djati", ""], ["Tambunan", "Usman Sumo Friend", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.02141", "submitter": "Antonino Sciarrino", "authors": "Diego Cocurullo and Antonino Sciarrino", "title": "Correlations in Usage Frequencies and Shannon Entropy for Codons", "comments": "42 pages, 12 figures, 33 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, Naples,Italy, DSF-Th-2/08-v2", "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The usage frequencies for codons belonging to quartets are analized, over the\nwhole exonic region, for 92 biological species.

These mechanisms,\nacting in tight cooperation with biochemical mechanisms, define life cycles of\nindividual organisms, and, through this, the origin and evolution of the living\nworld. Here, we present such a physical mechanism (General growth law), which\nrepresents a new physical law of nature acting at cellular, organ, system and\nwhole organism levels, directing growth and reproduction together with\nbiomolecular mechanisms. It imposes uniquely defined constraints on\ndistribution of nutrients between biomass production and maintenance, thus\ndefining the composition of biochemical reactions, their change and\nirreversibility during the organismal life cycle. Mathematically, this law is\nrepresented by the growth equation. Using this equation, we introduce growth\nmodels and explain division mechanisms for unicellular organisms. High adequacy\nof obtained results to experiments proves validity of the General growth law\nand of the new physical paradigm of Life based on this law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 16:45:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Nov 2017 01:47:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Jan 2018 20:04:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2018 21:24:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shestopaloff", "Yuri K.", ""]]}]
