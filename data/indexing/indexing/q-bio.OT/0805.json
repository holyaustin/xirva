We then homogenize the right circular\ncylinder erected by the circle, with respect to a normalizing plane and develop\nan analytical equation to the chromaticity cone, for the spectral colors. In\nthe interior of the (CIE) chromaticity diagram, by homogenizing elliptic\ncylinders with respect to the normalizing planes, analytical equations to\nsubsets (also cones) of the chromaticity cone are developed. These equations\nprovide an algebraic method for describing color perception. As an application\nof the interior chromaticity cones, we demonstrate that by sectioning\nhomogenized cones with planes and projecting, analytical equations to the\nMacadam ellipses may be derived. Further, the cone equations are used to\npropose new types of color order systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2008 13:42:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Jun 2008 19:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Alluvada", "Prashanth", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0695", "submitter": "Tidjani Negadi", "authors": "Tidjani Negadi", "title": "The genetic code Via Godel encoding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "The Open Physical Chemistry Journal, 2008, Vol.2, 1-5", "doi": "10.2174/1874067700802010001", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The genetic code structure into distinct multiplet-classes as well as the\nnumeric degeneracies of the latter are revealed by a two-step process.
