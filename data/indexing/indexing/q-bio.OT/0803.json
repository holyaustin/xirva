It is significant that peculiarities of the\ndegeneracy of the genetic code are reflected in the symmetrical black-and-white\nmosaic of these genetic matrices. The article represents interesting\nmathematical properties of these mosaic matrices, which are connected with\npositional permutations inside duplets and triplets; with projector operators;\nwith unitary matrices and cyclic groups, etc. Fractal genetic nets are proposed\nas a new effective tool to study long nucleotide sequences.

The investigations of\nthe genetic code on the basis of matrix approaches (\"matrix genetics\") are\ndescribed. The degeneracy of the vertebrate mitochondria genetic code is\nreflected in the black-and-white mosaic of the (8*8)-matrix of 64 triplets, 20\namino acids and stop-signals. This mosaic genetic matrix is connected with the\nmatrix form of presentation of the special 8-dimensional Yin-Yang-algebra and\nof its particular 4-dimensional case. The special algorithm, which is based on\nfeatures of genetic molecules, exists to transform the mosaic genomatrix into\nthe matrices of these algebras. Two new numeric systems are defined by these\n8-dimensional and 4-dimensional algebras: genetic Yin-Yang-octaves and genetic\ntetrions. Their comparison with quaternions by Hamilton is presented. Elements\nof new \"genovector calculation\" and ideas of \"genetic mechanics\" are discussed.\nThese algebras are considered as models of the genetic code and as its possible\npre-code basis. They are related with binary oppositions of the Yin-Yang type\nand they give new opportunities to investigate evolution of the genetic code.\nThe revealed fact of the relation between the genetic code and these genetic\nalgebras is discussed in connection with the idea by Pythagoras: \"All things\nare numbers\". Simultaneously these genetic algebras can be utilized as the\nalgebras of genetic operators in biological organisms. The described results\nare related with the problem of algebraization of bioinformatics. They take\nattention to the question: what is life from the viewpoint of algebra?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Mar 2008 16:35:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2008 07:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Petoukhov", "Sergey V.", "", "Department of Biomechanics, Mechanical\n  Engineering Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences"]]}, {"id": "0803.4197", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "V.
