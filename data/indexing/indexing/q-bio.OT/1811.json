The key is to note that `reductionist discipline' entails\nconstructive reasoning: any proof of a compound property can be decomposed to\nproofs of constituent properties. Proof theory makes explicit the inner\nstructure of the axiomatized reasoning style and allows the permissible\ndynamics to be presented as a mode of computation that can be executed and\nanalyzed. Constructivity and execution guarantee simulation when working over\ndomain-specific languages. Here, we exhibit phenotype properties for genotype\nreasons: a molecular-biology argument is an open-system concurrent computation\nthat results in compartment changes and is performed among processes of\nphysiology change as determined from the molecular programming of given DNA.\nLife cycles are the possible sequentializations of the processes. A main\nimplication of our construction is that formal correctness provides a\ncomplementary perspective on science that is as fundamental there as for pure\nmathematics.

Here we consider the insight that\nCoHSI might bring to a different problem, the distribution of identical\nproteins across species. Horizontal and Vertical Gene Transfer (HGT/VGT) both\nlead to the replication of protein sequences across species through a diversity\nof mechanisms some of which remain unknown. In contrast, CoHSI predicts from\nfundamental theory that such systems will demonstrate power law behavior\nindependently of any mechanisms, and using the Uniprot database we show that\nthe global pattern of protein re-use is emphatically linear on a log-log plot\n(adj. $R^{2} = 0.99, p < 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}$ over 4 decades); i.e. it is\nextremely close to the predicted power law. Specifically we show that over 6.9\nmillion proteins in TrEMBL 18-02 are re-used, i.e. their sequence appears\nidentically in between 2 and 9,812 species, with re-used proteins varying in\nlength from 7 to as long as 14,596 amino acids. Using (DL+V) to denote the\nthree domains of life plus viruses, 21,676 proteins are shared between two\n(DL+V); 22 between three (DL+V) and 5 are shared in all four (DL+V). Although\nthe majority of protein re-use occurs between bacterial species those proteins\nmost frequently re-used occur disproportionately in viruses, which play a\nfundamental role in this distribution.\n  These results suggest that diverse mechanisms of gene transfer (including\ntraditional inheritance) are irrelevant in determining the global distribution\nof protein re-use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 17:40:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hatton", "Les", ""], ["Warr", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.05205", "submitter": "Thu Thuy Nguyen", "authors": "C.
