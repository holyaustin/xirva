In this spirit, a model for the\nGenetic Code based on continuous symmetries and entitled the \"Crystal Basis\nModel\" has been proposed a few years ago. The present paper is a review of the\nmodel, of some of its first applications as well as of its recent developments.\nIndeed, after a motivated presentation of our mathematical model, we illustrate\nits pertinence by applying it for the elaboration and verification of sum rules\nfor codon usage probabilities, as well as for establishing relations and some\npredictions between physical-chemical properties of amino-acids. Then, defining\nin this context a \"bio-spin\" structure for the nucleotides and codons, the\ninteraction between a couple of codon-anticodon can simply be represented by a\n(bio) spin-spin potential. This approach will constitute the second part of the\npaper where, imposing the minimum energy principle, an analysis of the\nevolution of the genetic code can be performed with good agreement with the\ngenerally accepted scheme. A more precise study of this interaction model\nprovides informations on codon bias, consistent with data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 10:17:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sciarrino", "A.", ""], ["Sorba", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04194", "submitter": "Branko Dragovich", "authors": "Branko Dragovich, Andrei Yu.
