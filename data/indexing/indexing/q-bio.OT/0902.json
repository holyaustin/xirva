The solution\nis to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions\nin the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of\nbird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do\nit as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization\nincluding the skilful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most\nfavorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we\naddress the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions\nbirds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were\ntaken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential\nparameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common\nfeatures in the ways birds and humans use thermals. In particular, falcons seem\nto reproduce the MacCready formula widely used by gliders to calculate the best\nslope to take before an upcoming thermal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 16:10:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Akos", "Zsuzsa", ""], ["Nagy", "Mate", ""], ["Vicsek", "Tamas", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0389", "submitter": "Michael B\\\"orsch", "authors": "M.

Fluorescing diamond nanocrystals containing defects\ncan be used as markers replacing conventional organic dye molecules, quantum\ndots or autofluorescent proteins. They can be applied for tracking and\nultrahigh-resolution localization of the single markers. In addition the spin\nproperties of diamond defects can be utilized for novel magneto-optical imaging\n(MOI) with nanometer resolution. We develop this technique to unravel the\ndetails of the rotary motions and the elastic energy storage mechanism of a\nsingle biological nanomotor FoF1-ATP synthase. FoF1-ATP synthase is the enzyme\nthat provides the 'chemical energy currency' adenosine triphosphate, ATP, for\nliving cells. The formation of ATP is accomplished by a stepwise internal\nrotation of subunits within the enzyme. Previously subunit rotation has been\nmonitored by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and\nwas limited by the photostability of the fluorophores. Fluorescent nanodiamonds\nadvance these FRET measurements to long time scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 22:13:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Boersch", "M.", ""], ["Reuter", "R.", ""], ["Balasubramanian", "G.", ""], ["Erdmann", "R.", ""], ["Jelezko", "F.", ""], ["Wrachtrup", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0490", "submitter": "Anirban Banerji", "authors": "Anirban Banerji", "title": "Existence of biological uncertainty principle implies that we can never\n  find 'THE' measure for biological complexity", "comments": "74 pages, 2 theorems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are innumerable 'biological complexity measure's. While some patterns\nemerge from these attempts to represent biological complexity, a single measure\nto encompass the seemingly countless features of biological systems, still\neludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the\nfeasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for biological\ncomplexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here\nto describe biological reality. It segments the entire biological space-time in\na series of different biological organizations before modeling the property\nspace of each of these organizations with computational and topological\nconstructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key biological property, it has been\nproved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing biological\ncomplexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of\nbiological complexity is rooted in the knowledge of biological reality, an\nexpression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological biological\nreality, in the form of an uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two\ntheorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer\ndependent nature of description of biological reality. They explain the reasons\nbehind failures to construct a single and complete biological complexity\nmeasure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore\nprovides a reliable and general way to study biological complexity and\nbiological reality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 12:27:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2009 08:30:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Banerji", "Anirban", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0664", "submitter": "Anirban Banerji", "authors": "Anirban Banerji", "title": "A (possible) mathematical model to describe biological\n  \"context-dependence\" : case study with protein structure", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context-dependent nature of biological phenomena are well documented in every\nbranch of biology.
