We first develop a highly general\nabstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as\na result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show\nthat the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules\nthat maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of\nthe observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human\nand animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise\ntheir future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this\ncohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the\ndistribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social\ninteraction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for\nboth discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts\nthat social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of\nresponse to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a\nneurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel\nbasis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in\nsimulation studies of collective behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 10:57:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Mann", "Richard P.", ""], ["Garnett", "Roman", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.6939", "submitter": "David Tourigny", "authors": "David S.

Using satellite-derived continuous forest cover change\ndata, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural\nproduction data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess\nmultilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside\nprotected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes\nthat drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we\nconstructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change\nvaried by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of\nforest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to\ncause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was\npredicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated\npositively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but\nnegatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting\nproduction drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,\nbut significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance\nfrom protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape\nchange near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate\nof forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population\ndensity, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale\nforces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and\nmarket forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of\nchange, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy\nin this biodiversity hotspot.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 14:50:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 22:41:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ryan", "Sadie J.", ""], ["Palace", "Michael", ""], ["Hartter", "Joel", ""], ["Diem", "Jeremy E.", ""], ["Chapman", "Colin A.", ""], ["Southworth", "Jane", ""]]}]
