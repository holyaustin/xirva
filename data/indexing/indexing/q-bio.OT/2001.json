Based on Body Weight\n(BT) measurement, Kambro population (n = 17) has an average BT of\n1,244.14(..)453.82 grams significant (p <0.01) to F1 Pelung (n = 7) with an\naverage BT of 602.88(..)79.93 grams in 8 weeks period with ad libitum diet of\nstandard feed. Phenotypic performance of Kambro significant to F1 Pelung based\non the measurement of linear bodyweight parameter, vitality parameter, PPa-PBe\nparameter, and phenotype parameter. Kambro has the phenotype combination of\nparental generation based on the phenotype parameter. PPa parameter was\nsuitable BT estimation model based on non-linear quadratic regression (r =\n0.956) with formula 1.84E3(..)3.54E2*x+31.73*x2. Difference between chicken\ngroup (p<0.014) was significant to BT and interaction between the group and\nlinear bodyweight parameter was not significant based on Analysis of\nCovariance. The mortality rate of Kambro was lower than F1 Pelung with the\nabsent of vaccination in a semi-intensive rearing system. As the size of the\nhybrids population was limited, research findings must be validated with a\nlarger population size of hybrids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jan 2020 13:54:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mahardhika", "I Wayan Swarautama", ""], ["Daryono", "Budi Setiadi", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.00641", "submitter": "Mihai Nadin", "authors": "Mihai Nadin", "title": "AI and Medicine", "comments": "53 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Which part of medicine, if any, can and should be entrusted to AI, now or at\nsome moment in the future?

I will argue\nthat the process of life is a cognitive process and that organisms, from\nbacteria to animals, are cognitive agents. To justify these arguments, the\nneural intelligence represented by the form of reasoning known as anthropic\nreasoning will be compared and contrasted with types of intelligence explicated\nby four disciplines of biology, relational biology, evolutionary epistemology,\nbiosemiotics and the systems view of life, not biased towards neural\nintelligence. The comparison will be achieved by asking several questions that\nprobe the concepts of observers and true observers. To answer the questions I\nwill rely on a range of established concepts including SETI, Fermi's paradox,\nbacterial cognition, versions of the panspermia theory, and some newly\nintroduced concepts including biocivilisations, cognitive universes, and the\ncognitive multiverse. The key point emerging from the answers is that the\nprocess of cognition, the essence of natural intelligence, is a biological\nuniversal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jan 2020 18:17:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Slijepcevic", "P", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.05127", "submitter": "Jaqueline Brito", "authors": "Jaqueline J.
