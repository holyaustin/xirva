Though this has been known\nfor decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often\nused to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or\ndifficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the\ncreation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically\noptimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been\nsome attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable\ncolormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the\nmost accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We\ndeveloped a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which\nimports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe\ncolorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is\nmade available to the science community to enable others to easily create their\nown CVDoptimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap\ncreated with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD\nas well as those with redgreen colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables\nnearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually\nuniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:24:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Dec 2017 18:14:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2018 19:17:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Nu\u00f1ez", "Jamie R.", ""], ["Anderton", "Christopher R.", ""], ["Renslow", "Ryan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04412", "submitter": "Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio", "authors": "Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio (1), Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz (2),\n  Toshifumi Takao (3), Yasser Perera (1) ((1) Center for Genetic Engineering\n  and Biotechnology, (2) Center of Molecular Immunology, (3) Institute for\n  Protein Research)", "title": "Missing and spurious interaction in additive, multiplicative and odds\n  ratio models", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Additive, multiplicative, and odd ratio neutral models for interactions are\nfor long advocated and controversial in epidemiology.

The genetic\ninformation may not only be understood by symbolic sequences but also from the\nhidden signals inside the sequences. The symbolic sequences need to be\ntransformed into numerical sequences so the hidden signals can be revealed by\nsignal processing techniques. All current transformation methods encode DNA\nsequences into numerical values of the same length. These representations have\nlimitations in the applications of genomic signal compression, encryption, and\nsteganography. We propose an integer chaos game representation (iCGR) of DNA\nsequences and a lossless encoding method DNA sequences by the iCGR. In the iCGR\nmethod, a DNA sequence is represented by the iterated function of the\nnucleotides and their positions in the sequence. Then the DNA sequence can be\nuniquely encoded and recovered using three integers from iCGR. One integer is\nthe sequence length and the other two integers represent the accumulated\ndistributions of nucleotides in the sequence. The integer encoding scheme can\ncompress a DNA sequence by 2 bits per nucleotide. The integer representation of\nDNA sequences provides a prospective tool for sequence compression, encryption,\nand steganography.

Individuals alternate grazing mode at null speed\nand moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronising\nwhen they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose a model for the\nindividual decision making process, based on switching rates between stopped /\nwalking states that depend on behind / ahead locations and states of the\nothers. We parametrize this model from data. Next, we translate this\n(microscopic) individual-based model into its density-flow (macroscopic)\nequations counterpart. Numerical solving these equations display a traveling\npulse propagating at constant speed even though each individual is at any\nmoment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in\nthese equations, we derive analytically the steady shape of the pulse (sech\nsquare). The parameters of the pulse (shape and speed) are expressed as\nfunctions of individual parameters. This pulse emerges from the non linear\ncoupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for\ndiffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking / stopped individuals, which\nin turn determines the traveling speed of the pulse. The system seems to\nconverge to this pulse from any initial condition, and to recover the pulse\nafter perturbation. This gives a high robustness to this coordination\nmechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Dec 2017 18:06:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2018 20:09:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Aza\u00efs", "Manon", ""], ["Blanco", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Bon", "Richard", ""], ["Fournier", "Richard", ""], ["Pillot", "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", ""], ["Gautrais", "Jacques", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.08369", "submitter": "Johan Elf", "authors": "Johan Elf, Irmeli Barkefors and Thomas Laurell", "title": "Nobel Symposium 162 - Microfluidics", "comments": "Nobel Symposium 162, Stockholm, Sweden", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.flu-dyn q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The Nobel Foundation's Symposium programme was initiated in 1965 and since\nthen over 160 symposia have taken place.
