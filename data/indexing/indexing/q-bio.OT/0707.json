In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and\nthe modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search\nfor effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually\ntransmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual\ncontact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the\nepidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite\npopulations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with\nnumber of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from\nnational sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case\nin which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account.\nNumerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our\nfindings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two\nclasses of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the\ndesign of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2007 18:03:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2008 14:56:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gomez-Gardenes", "J.", ""], ["Latora", "V.", ""], ["Moreno", "Y.", ""], ["Profumo", "E.

In a large,\ncomplex network of interacting elements, such as a genetic regulatory network\nwithin a cell, the average of the mutual information over all pairs <I> is a\nglobal measure of how well the system can coordinate its internal dynamics. We\nstudy this average pairwise mutual information in random Boolean networks\n(RBNs) as a function of the distribution of Boolean rules implemented at each\nelement, assuming that the links in the network are randomly placed. Efficient\nnumerical methods for calculating <I> show that as the number of network nodes\nN approaches infinity, the quantity N<I> exhibits a discontinuity at parameter\nvalues corresponding to critical RBNs. For finite systems it peaks near the\ncritical value, but slightly in the disordered regime for typical parameter\nvariations. The source of high values of N<I> is the indirect correlations\nbetween pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting\npoint. The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for\ncritical networks and peaks deep in the disordered regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 21:51:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2007 20:43:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ribeiro", "Andre S.", ""], ["Kauffman", "Stuart A.", ""], ["Lloyd-Price", "Jason", ""], ["Samuelsson", "Bj\u00f6rn", ""], ["Socolar", "Joshua E.
