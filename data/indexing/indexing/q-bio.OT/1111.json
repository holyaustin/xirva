For tightly coordinated water the friction is six times\nhigher than in bulk, which can be interpreted in terms of a dominant reaction\npath that involves additional orthogonal coordinates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 20:01:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["von Hansen", "Yann", ""], ["Sedlmeier", "Felix", ""], ["Hinczewski", "Michael", ""], ["Netz", "Roland R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3664", "submitter": "Bernhelm Booss-Bavnbek", "authors": "Bernhelm Booss-Bavnbek (Roskilde, Denmark)", "title": "Is mathematics invading human cells?
