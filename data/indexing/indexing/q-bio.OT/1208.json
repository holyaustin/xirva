However, the meeting of scientists of both fields is often\nhampered by a variety of communicative hurdles - which are based on\nfield-specific working languages and cultural differences.\n  As a step towards a better mutual understanding, we developed a workshop\nconcept bringing together young experimental biologists and statisticians, to\nwork as pairs and learn to value each others competences and practise\ninterdisciplinary communication in a casual atmosphere. The first\nimplementation of our concept was a cooperation of the German Region of the\nInternational Biometrical Society and the Leibnitz Institute DSMZ-German\nCollection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (short: DSMZ), Braunschweig,\nGermany. We collected feedback in form of three questionnaires, oral comments,\nand gathered experiences for the improvement of this concept.
