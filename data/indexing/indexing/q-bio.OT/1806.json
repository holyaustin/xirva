Case: 844 postoperative\nCABG patients, who were extubated within 24 hours of surgery were identified in\na critical care database (MIMIC-III). Nurse elicited pain scores were\ndocumented throughout their hospital stay on a scale of 0 to 10. Levels were\ntracked as mean, median, and maximum values, and categorized as no (0/10), mild\n(1-3), moderate (4-6) and severe pain (7-10). Regression analysis was employed\nto analyze the relationship between pain scores and outcomes of interest\n(mortality and hospital LOS). After covariate adjustment, increased levels of\npain were found to be associated with lower mortality rates and reduced\nhospital LOS. Conclusion: These counterintuitive results for post-CABG pain\nrelated outcomes have not been previously reported. While not representing\nstrong enough evidence to alter clinical practice, confirmed and reliable\nresults such as these should serve as a research trigger and prompt further\nstudies into unexpected associations between pain and patient outcomes. With\nthe advent of frequent secondary analysis of electronic health records, such\ncounterintuitive data results are likely to become more frequent. We discuss\nthe issue of counterintuitive data in extended fashion, including possible\nreasons for, and approaches to, this phenomenon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2018 23:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Doty", "E.", ""], ["McCague", "N.", ""], ["Stone", "D.

Investigating the shape of red blood cells (RBCs) in\nmicrocapillary Poiseuille flow, we overcome this drawback by introducing a\nconvolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant\nshape classification. From our experiments we expect two stable geometries: the\nso-called `slipper' and `croissant' shapes depending on the prevailing flow\nconditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur\nat low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method,\nwe are able to find the transition point between both `phases' of stable shapes\nwhich is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical\nsimulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain\nso-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations.\nProspectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of\nmeasurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable\nresults. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the\ninfluence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting\nmacroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2018 11:44:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kihm", "Alexander", ""], ["Kaestner", "Lars", ""], ["Wagner", "Christian", ""], ["Quint", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.08785", "submitter": "Les Hatton", "authors": "Les Hatton and Gregory Warr", "title": "CoHSI I; Detailed properties of the Canonical Distribution for Discrete\n  Systems such as the Proteome", "comments": "13 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The CoHSI (Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) distribution is at\nthe heart of a wide-class of discrete systems, defining the length distribution\nof their components amongst other global properties.
