A number of concepts and\nprinciples essential for understanding the motivation for constructing the\nmodel will be introduced first. This will be followed by a description of\nparameters, measurements, and graphical representations used in the model. Four\npossible outcomes for this model are then introduced and described. In\naddition, the relationship of relative fitness to selection is described.\nFinally, the consequences and potential lessons learned from the model are\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 20:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2008 19:19:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 15:53:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alicea", "Bradly", ""]]}]
