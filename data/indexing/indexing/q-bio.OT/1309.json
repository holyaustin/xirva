Certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more\nrapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all\nmicroscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning\nrheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? We examine swimmers employing\nprescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess Carreau fluid:\nshear-thinning \"Generalized Stokes\" flow. Swimmers are modeled, using the\nmethod of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. The equations\ngoverning the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and\nsolved with the finite element method. We analyze the locomotion of three\ndistinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding\nspheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity\nenvelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as \"squirmers\" and (3)\nmonoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. We find that morphologically identical\nswimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in\nshear-thinning fluids than in Newtonian fluids. We explain this kinematic\nsensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid\nsurrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this\ninsight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate Purcell's\nScallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. We also show that an increased flow\ndecay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction\nin the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers. For sperm-like swimmers, a\ngradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts\nupon the fluid, flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming\nspeed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 15:42:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Montenegro-Johnson", "Thomas D.", ""], ["Loghin", "Daniel", ""], ["Smith", "David J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.1303", "submitter": "Thomas Montenegro-Johnson", "authors": "Andrew A.

Following the\ndorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, the left-right axis is the last to\nbe established; in several species it has been shown that an important process\ninvolved with this is the production of a left-right asymmetric flow driven by\n'whirling' cilia. It has previously been established in experimental and\nmathematical models of the mouse ventral node that the combination of a\nconsistent rotational direction and posterior tilt creates left-right\nasymmetric flow. The zebrafish organising structure, Kupffer's vesicle, has a\nmore complex internal arrangement of cilia than the mouse ventral node;\nexperimental studies show the flow exhibits an anticlockwise rotational motion\nwhen viewing the embryo from the dorsal roof, looking in the ventral direction.\nReports of the arrangement and configuration of cilia suggest two possible\nmechanisms for the generation of this flow from existing axis information: (1)\nposterior tilt combined with increased cilia density on the dorsal roof, and\n(2) dorsal tilt of 'equatorial' cilia. We develop a mathematical model of\nsymmetry breaking cilia-driven flow in Kupffer's vesicle using the regularized\nStokeslet boundary element method. Computations of the flow produced by tilted\nwhirling cilia in an enclosed domain suggest that a possible mechanism capable\nof producing the flow field with qualitative and quantitative features closest\nto those observed experimentally is a combination of posteriorly tilted roof\nand floor cilia, and dorsally tilted equatorial cilia.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Sep 2013 10:30:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Smith", "Andrew A.", ""], ["Johnson", "Thomas D.", ""], ["Smith", "David J.", ""], ["Blake", "John R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.1768", "submitter": "Valentina Agoni", "authors": "Valentina Agoni", "title": "DNA evolved to minimize frameshift mutations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Point mutations can surely be dangerous but what is worst than to lose the\nreading frame?!

Their efficacy as anesthetics has been shown to correlate both with\ntheir affinity for a hydrophobic environment and with their potency in\ninhibiting certain ligand gated ion channels. Here we explore the effects that\nn-alcohols and other liquid anesthetics have on the two-dimensional miscibility\ncritical point observed in cell derived giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs).\nWe show that anesthetics depress the critical temperature (Tc) of these GPMVs\nwithout strongly altering the ratio of the two liquid phases found below Tc.\nThe magnitude of this affect is consistent across n-alcohols when their\nconcentration is rescaled by the median anesthetic concentration (AC50) for\ntadpole anesthesia, but not when plotted against the overall concentration in\nsolution. At AC50 we see a 4{\\deg}C downward shift in Tc, much larger than is\ntypically seen in the main chain transition at these anesthetic concentrations.\nGPMV miscibility critical temperatures are also lowered to a similar extent by\npropofol, phenylethanol, and isopropanol when added at anesthetic\nconcentrations, but not by tetradecanol or 2,6 diterbutylphenol, two structural\nanalogs of general anesthetics that are hydrophobic but have no anesthetic\npotency. We propose that liquid general anesthetics provide an experimental\ntool for lowering critical temperatures in plasma membranes of intact cells,\nwhich we predict will reduce lipid-mediated heterogeneity in a way that is\ncomplimentary to increasing or decreasing cholesterol.

The dependence of the transition\nrate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape\nof the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation.
