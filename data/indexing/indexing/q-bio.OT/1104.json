We identified some pos- sible geomorphological controls\nthat influence nest-site selection and survival using data collected along the\nFlorida Gulf coast. In particular we focused on the effects of beach\nreplenishment interventions on the Snowy Plover (SP), and on the migratory\nPiping Plover (PP) (Charadrius melodus) and Red Knot (RK) (Calidris canutus).\nTo quantify the relationship between past renourishment projects and shorebird\nspecies we used a Monte Carlo procedure to sample from the posterior\ndistribution of the binomial probabilities that a region is not a nesting or a\nwintering ground conditional on the occurrence of a beach replenishment\nintervention in the same and the previous year. The results indicate that it\nwas 2.3, 3.1, and 0.8 times more likely that a region was not a wintering\nground following a year with a renourishment intervention for the SP, PP and RK\nrespectively. For the SP it was 2.5. times more likely that a region was not a\nbreeding ground after a renourishment event. Through a maximum entropy\nprinciple model we observed small differences in the habitat use of the SP\nduring the breeding and the wintering season. However the habitats where RK was\nobserved ap- peared quite different. Maintaining and creating optimal suitable\nhabitats for SP characterized by sparse low vegetation in the foredunes areas,\nand uneven/low-slope beach surfaces, is the proposed conservation scenario to\nconvert anthropic beach restorations and SP populations into a positive\nfeedback without impacting other threatened shorebird species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 13:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Convertino", "M.", ""], ["Donoghue", "J.
