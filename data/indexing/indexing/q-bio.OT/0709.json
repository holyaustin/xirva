When restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) models are used, the mapping\nprocedure is normally computationally demanding. We develop a new efficient\ncomputational scheme for QTL mapping using variance component analysis and the\nAI-REML algorithm. The algorithm uses an exact or approximative low-rank\nrepresentation of the identity-by-descent matrix, which combined with the\nWoodbury formula for matrix inversion results in that the computations in the\nAI-REML iteration body can be performed more efficiently. For cases where an\nexact low-rank representation of the IBD matrix is available a-priori, the\nimproved AI-REML algorithm normally runs almost twice as fast compared to the\nstandard version. When an exact low-rank representation is not available, a\ntruncated spectral decomposition is used to determine a low-rank approximation.\nWe show that also in this case, the computational efficiency of the AI-REML\nscheme can often be significantly improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2007 11:36:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2008 12:34:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Mishchenko", "Kateryna", ""], ["Holmgren", "Sverker", ""], ["Ronnegard", "Lars", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1189", "submitter": "Natalia Kudryavtseva", "authors": "N.
