Here, we show that hypocrisy -\nclaiming to be acting cooperatively while acting selfishly - can maintain\nsocial cooperation because it prevents the spread of selfish behavior.

Our aim was to study\nboth theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find\nthe source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through\nprotein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to\nreaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and\nestimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the\nreaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,\nthree patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity\nClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of\nthe reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to\nthe square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small\nones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a\nbacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the\nfew minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough\nto kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living\ntissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects. Pictures of\nsuccessful wound healings confirm these considerations. Various properties of\nClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly,\nbacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with\nbiological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Conclusion\nSelectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different\nbiochemistry, but on their different size. Preliminary clinical results\nencourage further research with this promising local antiseptic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 15:27:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Noszticzius", "Zolt\u00e1n", ""], ["Wittmann", "Maria", ""], ["K\u00e1ly-Kullai", "Krist\u00f3f", ""], ["Beregv\u00e1ri", "Zolt\u00e1n", ""], ["Kiss", "Istv\u00e1n", ""], ["Rosivall", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", ""], ["Szegedi", "J\u00e1nos", ""]]}]
