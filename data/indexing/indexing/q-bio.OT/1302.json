Using the growth equation, we compute growth curve for S. cerevisiae\nand show that it corresponds to available experimental data. Then, we propose a\nnew method for finding amount of synthesized biomass without complicated\nstoichiometric computations and apply this method to evaluation of biomass\nproduction by S. cerevisiae. We found that obtained results are very close to\nvalues obtained by methods of metabolic flux analysis. Since methods of\nmetabolic flux analysis require finding produced biomass, which is one of the\nmost important parameters affecting stoichiometric models, a priori knowledge\nof produced biomass can significantly improve methods of metabolic flux\nanalysis in many aspects, which we also discuss. Besides, based on the general\ngrowth mechanism, we considered evolutionary development of S. cerevisiae and\nfound that it is a more ancient organism than S. pombe and is apparently its\ndirect predecessor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2013 20:36:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Shestopaloff", "Yuri K.", ""]]}]
