Backward simulations,\nalso called coalescent-based simulations, are computationally very efficient.\nHowever, this framework imposes several limitations that forward simulation\ndoes not. In this work, a new simple and efficient model to perform forward\nsimulation of populations and/or genomes is proposed. The basic idea considers\nan individual as the differences (mutations) between this individual and a\nreference or consensus genotype. Thus, this individual is no longer represented\nby its complete sequence or genotype. An example of the efficiency of the new\nmodel with respect to a more classical forward one is demonstrated.

These reaction networks are open systems of chemical reactions\nwith no zero-order reaction rates systems. They are characterized by at least\ntwo stationary points, one of which is a nonzero stable point, and one unstable\ntrivial solution (stability based on a linear stability analysis of the\ndeterministic system). Starting from a nonzero initial condition, the\ndeterministic system never reaches the zero stationary point due to its\nunstable nature. In contrast, the result presented here proves that this\nzero-state is the only stable stationary state for the discrete stochastic\nsystem.

To this\npurpose, we introduce two extra principles to the thermodynamic ones, which are\n(mathematically) compatible with the traditional principles, but have no\nmeaning in inert matter. A traditional balance equation for metabolism will be\nthen extended to the new notion as specified by these principles. We consider\nfar from equilibrium systems and we focus in particular on the production of\nglobal entropy associated to the irreversible character of the processes. A\nclose analysis of this term will be carried on, both in terms of a diffusion\nequation of biomass over complexity and, as a complementary approach and as a\ntool for specifying a source term, in connection to Schroedinger's method for\nhis equation in Quantum Mechanics. We borrow from this equation just the\noperatorial approach and, this, in a classical frame, as we use real\ncoefficients instead of complex ones, away thus from the mathematical frame of\nquantum theories. The first application of our proposal is a simple\nmathematical reconstruction of Gould's complexity curve of biomass over\ncomplexity, as for evolution. We then elaborate, from the existence of\ndifferent time scales, a partition of ontogenetic time, in reference to entropy\nand negative entropy variation. On the grounds of this approach, we analyze\nmetabolism and scaling laws. This allows to compare various relevant\ncoefficients appearing in these scaling laws, which seem to fit empirical data.\nFinally, a tentative and quantitative evaluation of complexity is proposed,\nalso in relation to some empirical data (caenorhabditis elegans).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2008 10:39:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bailly", "Francis", ""], ["Longo", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.2261", "submitter": "Vittoria Colizza", "authors": "Vittoria Colizza, Alain Barrat, Marc Barthelemy, Alessandro Vespignani", "title": "Predictability and epidemic pathways in global outbreaks of infectious\n  diseases: the SARS case study", "comments": "21 pages, 2 tables, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "BMC Medicine 5, 34 (2007)", "doi": "10.1186/1741-7015-5-34", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": null, "abstract": "  Background: The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nepidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range\ntransportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks.\nThe introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an\nimportant step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.\nMethods: We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that\nincorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220\ncountries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of\ncountry outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by\nthe model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of\nrobust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread\nof the disease. Results: In order to assess the predictive power of the model,\nthe case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease\nparameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from\nempirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is\nevaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in\nagreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic. Conclusions:\nThe presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range\nmobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power\nthat can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated.
