Whether quantum-like\ncoherent phenomena are relevant, or even possible at all, at the high\ntemperatures of biological systems remains unsettled. Here, we present a\nbroader perspective on biological organization and how quantum-like dynamics\nand coherence might shape the very fabric from which complex biological systems\nare organized. Regardless of its exact nature, a unique form of coherence seems\napparent at multiple scales in biology and its better characterization may have\nbroad consequences for the understanding of living organisms as complex\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Dec 2012 09:37:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Robert", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0672", "submitter": "David Saakian", "authors": "David B.

The\nreaction kinetic is defined through the energies of different species of\nmolecules following random independent distribution. The related statistical\nphysics model has three phases and these three phases emerged in the dynamics:\nfast dynamics phase, slow dynamic phase and ultra-slow dynamic phase. The\nphenomenon we found is a rather general, does not depend on the details of the\nmodel. We assume as a hypothesis that the transition between these phases\n(glassiness degrees) is related to cancer. The imbalance in the rate of\nprocesses between key aspects of the cell (gene regulation, protein-protein\ninteraction, metabolical networks) creates a change in the fine tuning between\nthese key aspects, affects the logics of the cell and initiates cancer. It is\nprobable that cancer is a change of phase resulting from increased and\nderegulated metabolic reactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 10:50:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Saakian", "David B.", ""], ["Schwartz", "Laurent", ""]]}]
