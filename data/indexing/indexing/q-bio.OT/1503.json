The numbers\nof cases per year appear to be ~ 1000 times larger than the earlier strains,\nsuggesting a greatly enhanced transmissibility. Although the fraction of the\n2014 spike glycoprotein mutations is very small (~3%), the mortality is\nsignificantly reduced, while the transmission appears to have increased\nstrongly. Bioinformatic scaling had previously shown similar inversely\ncorrelated trends in virulence and transmission in N1 (H1N1) and N2 (H3N2)\ninfluenza spike glycoprotein mutations. These trends appear to be related to\nvarious external factors (migration, availability of pure water, and\nvaccination programs). The molecular mechanisms for Ebola's mutational response\ninvolve mainly changes in the disordered mucin-like domain (MLD) of its spike\nglycoprotein amino acids. The MLD has been observed to form the tip of an\noligomeric amphiphilic wedge that selectively pries apart cell-cell interfaces\nvia an oxidative mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 17:57:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Phillips", "J.

The genetic\ncode is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,\nwhich can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original\nrepresentations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced\nrole of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling\ninformation-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is\noffered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting\nspectrograms or scalograms.

However for saving resources, a\nmore economic strategy should be to make a rapid death to the individuals who\nare over the reproduction age rather than to make them aging. Biological\ntheories are proposed to identify the causes and the biological processes of\naging. However, some theories including cell senescence/telomere theory,\ngene-controlling theory, and developmental theory, have unfortunately ignored\nthe influence of damage on aging. Free-radical theory suggests that free\nradicals by causing intrinsic damage are the main cause of aging. However, even\nif intracellular free radicals cause injuries, they could be only associated\nwith some but not all of the aging changes. Damage (fault)-accumulation theory\npredicts that faults as intrinsic damage can accumulate and lead to aging.\nHowever, in fact an unrepaired fault could not possibly remain in a living\norganism, since it can destroy the integrity of tissue structure and cause\nrapid failure of the organism. These traditional theories are all incomplete on\ninterpreting aging phenomena. Nevertheless, developmental theory and damage\n(fault)-accumulation theory are more useful, because they have recognized the\nimportance of damage and development process in aging. Some physical theories\nare useful, because they point out the common characteristics of aging changes,\nincluding loss of complexity, consequence of increase of entropy, and failure\nof information-transmission. An advanced theory, which can include all of these\nuseful ideas in traditional theories, is needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:54:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 15:31:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 15:48:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", "", "DALEMBERT"], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas", "", "DALEMBERT"]]}, {"id": "1503.08076", "submitter": "Thomas Michelitsch", "authors": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch, Thomas Michelitsch (DALEMBERT)", "title": "Development of aging changes: self-accelerating and inhomogeneous", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Aging changes including age spots and atherosclerotic plaques develop in an\ninhomogeneous and accelerated manner. For understanding this phenomenon, some\naging changes are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in\nMisrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for\nsurvival of an organism in situations of severe injuries; however a Misrepair\nalters the structure of a tissue, a cell or a molecule, which are the\nsub-structures of an organism. II. Misrepair of a sub-structure also alters the\nspatial relationship of this sub-structure with its neighbor sub-structures.\nThus a Misrepair leads to increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency of these sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a\ntendency to occur to the sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an\nold Misrepair has taken place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again\nthe damage-sensitivity of these sub-structures and the surrounding\nsub-structures. By such a vicious circle, the frequency of Misrepairs to these\nsub-structures is increased and the range of affected sub-structures is\nenlarged after each time of Misrepair. Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is\nfocalized and self-accelerating. III. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nleads to formation and growing of a \"spot\" or \"plaque\" in a tissue. Growing of\na spot is self-accelerating, and old spots grow faster than new ones. New spots\ntend to develop close to old ones, resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution\nof spots. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous development of aging changes is a\nresult of self-accelerated and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; and the\nprocess of aging is self-accelerating.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:20:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Feb 2018 10:07:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", "", "DALEMBERT"], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas", "", "DALEMBERT"]]}]
