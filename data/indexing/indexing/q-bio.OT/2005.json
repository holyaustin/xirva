This\ncontinuing trend towards automation and digitization enables many new\napproaches to microscopy that would have been impossible or impractical without\ncomputer interfaces. Accordingly, todays development of new microscopes most\noften depends on concurrent software development to bring these custom-build\nsystems to life. This dependence on software brings opportunities and\nchallenges. Most importantly, a key challenge while developing new microscopes\nis to develop the appropriate software. Despite the fact that software is\neasily copied and distributed, remarkably few opportunities are available to\nshare experiences creating microscope control software. In turn, this brings\nchallenges in creating maintainable and flexible software code and writing User\nInterfaces (UIs) that are easily used by researchers, who are primarily life\nscientists. To start to address these challenges by identifying common problems\nand shared solutions, we assembled a small group of researchers that develop or\nuse software to control their custom-build microscopes at the Janelia Research\nCampus for a two-day workshop in February 2020. The outcome of the workshop was\nthe definition of clear milestones, as well as the recognition of an involved\ncommunity, much larger than the one assembled at the workshop. This community\nencounters similar hurdles and shares a great desire to overcome these by\nstronger, community-wide collaborations on Open Source Software. This White\nPaper summarizes the major issues identified, proposes approaches to address\nthese as a community, and outlines the next steps that can be taken to develop\na framework facilitating shared microscope software development, significantly\nspeeding up development of new microscopy systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:10:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chhetri", "Raghav", ""], ["Preibisch", "Stephan", ""], ["Stuurman", "Nico", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.02809", "submitter": "Adejoke Obajuluwa Dr", "authors": "Adejoke Olukayode Obajuluwa, Pius Abimbola Okiki, Tiwalola Madoc\n  Obajuluwa, Olakunle Bamikole Afolabi", "title": "In-silico nucleotide and protein analyses of S-gene region in selected\n  zoonotic coronaviruses reveal conserved domains and evolutionary emergence\n  with trajectory course of viral entry from SARS-CoV2 genomic data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The recent zoonotic coronavirus virus outbreak of a novel type [COVID 19] has\nnecessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic\nviruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to\ncombat the pandemic now and in the future.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since\ncurrent protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,\nincluding essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several\ncountries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.\nThis work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data\nperformed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR\ntest results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for\nhandling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential\nworkforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to\npredict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or\nresults are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow\nfine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed\nmodels can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with\nhigh accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in\nan individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on\nhemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is\nsignificantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,\ncompared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and\nother critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from\nwidely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR\nresults used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist\nstrategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel\nshortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 May 2020 01:45:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Avila", "Eduardo", ""], ["Dorn", "Marcio", ""], ["Alho", "Clarice Sampaio", ""], ["Kahmann", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.10248", "submitter": "Daniel Meyer", "authors": "R.

By the\n1970s, clear diagnostic and prognostic benefits from intrapartum fEEG\nmonitoring were reported, but until today, this monitoring technology has\nremained a curiosity.\n  Objectives: Our goal was to review the studies reporting the use of fEEG\nincluding the insights from interpreting fEEG patterns in response to uterine\ncontractions during labor. We also used the most relevant information gathered\nfrom clinical studies to provide recommendations for enrollment in the unique\nenvironment of a labor and delivery unit.\n  Data sources: PubMed.\n  Eligibility criteria: The search strategy was: (\"fetus\"[MeSH Terms] OR\n\"fetus\"[All Fields] OR \"fetal\"[All Fields]) AND (\"electroencephalography\"[MeSH\nTerms] OR \"electroencephalography\"[All Fields] OR \"eeg\"[All Fields]) AND\n(Clinical Trial[ptyp] AND \"humans\"[MeSH Terms]). Because the landscape of fEEG\nresearch has been international, we included studies in English, French,\nGerman, and Russian.\n  Results: From 256 screened studies, 40 studies were ultimately included in\nthe qualitative analysis. We summarize and report features of fEEG which\nclearly show its potential to act as a direct biomarker of fetal brain health\nduring delivery, ancillary to fetal heart rate monitoring. However, clinical\nprospective studies are needed to further establish the utility of fEEG\nmonitoring intrapartum. We identified clinical study designs likely to succeed\nin bringing this intrapartum monitoring modality to the bedside.\n  Limitations: Despite 80 years of studies in clinical cohorts and animal\nmodels, the field of research on intrapartum fEEG is still nascent and shows\ngreat promise to augment the currently practiced electronic fetal monitoring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 19:58:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:22:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Castel", "Aude", ""], ["Frank", "Yael", ""], ["Feltner", "John", ""], ["Karp", "Floyd", ""], ["Albright", "Catherine", ""], ["Frasch", "Martin G.", ""]]}]
