In particular, it was suggested that the optimal\nlocation for such an artifact is the genetic code, as the least evolving part\nof cells. However, as the mainstream view goes, this scenario is too\nspeculative and cannot be meaningfully tested because encoding/decoding a\nsignature within the genetic code is ill-defined, so any retrieval attempt is\ndoomed to guesswork. Here we refresh the seeded-Earth hypothesis and discuss\nthe motivation for inserting a signature. We then show that \"biological SETI\"\ninvolves even weaker assumptions than traditional SETI and admits a\nwell-defined methodological framework. After assessing the possibility in terms\nof molecular and evolutionary biology, we formalize the approach and, adopting\nthe guideline of SETI that encoding/decoding should follow from first\nprinciples and be convention-free, develop a retrieval strategy. Applied to the\ncanonical code, it reveals a nontrivial precision structure of interlocked\nsystematic attributes. To assess this result in view of the initial assumption,\nwe perform statistical, comparison, interdependence, and semiotic analyses.\nStatistical analysis reveals no causal connection to evolutionary models of the\ncode, interdependence analysis precludes overinterpretation, and comparison\nanalysis shows that known code variations lack any precision-logic structures,\nin agreement with these variations being post-seeding deviations from the\ncanonical code. Finally, semiotic analysis shows that not only the found\nattributes are consistent with the initial assumption, but that they make\nperfect sense from SETI perspective, as they maintain some of the most\nuniversal codes of culture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:39:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Makukov", "Maxim A.", ""], ["shCherbak", "Vladimir I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.05621", "submitter": "Alvaro Vianna Novaes de Carvalho Teixeira", "authors": "Delaine M.
