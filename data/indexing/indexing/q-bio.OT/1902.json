This study was carried out\nto compare the relatedness between virulence characteristics and\n\\b{eta}-lactamase encoding genes producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: A\ntotal of 120 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from both paediatric and\nadult patients of Selayang Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Phenotypic methods\nwere used to detect various virulence factors (Phospholipase, Hemolysin,\nGelatinase, DNAse, and Biofilm). All the isolates were evaluated for production\nof extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) as well as metallo \\b{eta}-lactamase\n(MBL) by Double-disk synergy test (DDST) and E-test while AmpC\n\\b{eta}-lactamase production was detected by disk antagonism test. Results: In\nthis study, 120 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (20 each from blood, wounds,\nrespiratory secretions, stools, urine, and sputum samples) were studied. Among\nPseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, the distribution of virulence factors was\npositive for hemolysin (48.33%), DNAse (43.33%), phospholipase (40.83%),\ngelatinase (31.66%) production and biofilm formation (34%) respectively. The\nprevalence of multiple \\b{eta}-lactamase in P. aeruginosa showed 19.16% ESBL,\n7.5% MBL and 10.83% AmpC production respectively.

Despite their\ndistinct provenance, genomes and computer software share a simple structural\nproperty; they are linear symbol-based discrete systems, and thus they present\nan opportunity to test in a comparative context the predictions of CoHSI. Here,\nwithout any consideration of, or relevance to, their role in specifying\nfunction, we identify that 10 representative genomes (from microbes to human)\nand a large collection of software contain identically structured nested\nsubsystems. In the case of base sequences in genomes, CoHSI predicts that if we\nsplit the genome into n-tuples (a 2-tuple is a pair of consecutive bases; a\n3-tuple is a trio and so on), without regard for whether or not a region is\ncoding, then each collection of n-tuples will constitute a homogeneous discrete\nsystem and will obey a power-law in frequency of occurrence of the n-tuples. We\nconsider 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-tuples of ten species and demonstrate\nthat the predicted power-law behavior is emphatically present, and furthermore\nas predicted, is insensitive to the start window for the tuple extraction i.e.\nthe reading frame is irrelevant.\n  We go on to provide a proof of Chargaff's second parity rule and on the basis\nof this proof, predict higher order tuple parity rules which we then identify\nin the genome data.\n  CoHSI predicts precisely the same behavior in computer software. This\nprediction was tested and confirmed using 2-, 3- and 4-tuples of the\nhexadecimal representation of machine code in multiple computer programs,\nunderlining the fundamental role played by CoHSI in defining the landscape in\nwhich discrete symbol-based systems must operate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:24:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hatton", "Les", ""], ["Warr", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09482", "submitter": "Arni S.R.
