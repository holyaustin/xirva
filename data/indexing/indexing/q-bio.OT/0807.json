However,\nthere is still very little known about the mechanisms that produce this\ntolerance. Evidence that small, non-mutant subpopulations of bacteria are not\naffected by antibiotic challenge has been accumulating and provides an\nattractive explanation for the failure of typical dosing protocols. Although a\ndosing challenge can kill all the susceptible bacteria, the remaining persister\ncells can serve as a source of population regrowth. We give a robust condition\nfor the failure of a periodic dosing protocol for a general chemostat model,\nwhich supports the mathematical conclusions and simulations of an earlier, more\nspecialized batch model. Our condition implies that the treatment protocol\nfails globally, in the sense that a mixed bacterial population will ultimately\npersist above a level that is independent of the initial composition of the\npopulation. We also give a sufficient condition for treatment success, at least\nfor initial population compositions near the steady state of interest,\ncorresponding to bacterial washout. Finally, we investigate how the speed at\nwhich the bacteria are wiped out depends on the duration of administration of\nthe antibiotic. We find that this dependence is not necessarily monotone,\nimplying that optimal dosing does not necessarily correspond to continuous\nadministration of the antibiotic. Thus, genuine periodic protocols can be more\nadvantageous in treating a wide variety of bacterial infections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Jul 2008 00:14:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["De Leenheer", "Patrick", ""], ["Cogan", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2665", "submitter": "Carlos J.

Ecological and\nevolutionary views have focused on the mechanisms that enable or constrain\nspecies coexistence, genetic variation and the genetics of speciation, but a\nunified theory linking those approaches is still missing. Here we introduce\nevolutionary graphs in the context of neutral theories of molecular evolution\nand biodiversity to provide a framework that simultaneously addresses\nspeciation rate and joint genetic and species diversities. To illuminate this\nquestion we also study two models of evolution on graphs with fitness\ndifferences, which provide insights on how genetic and ecological dynamics\ndrive the speed of diversification. Neutral evolution generates the highest\nspeed of speciation, species richness (i.e. five times and twice as many\nspecies as compared to genetic and ecological graphs, respectively) and\ngenetic--species diversity (i.e., twice as many as genetic and ecological\ngraphs, respectively). Thus the speed of speciation, the genetic--species\ndiversity and coexistence can differ dramatically depending on whether genetic\nfactors versus ecological factors drive the evolution of the system. By linking\nmolecular, sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales,\ninteracting graphs can illuminate the origin and evolution of diversity and\norganismal coexistence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2008 22:34:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Melian", "Carlos J.", ""], ["Alonso", "David", ""], ["Vazquez", "Diego P.", ""], ["Regetz", "James", ""]]}]
