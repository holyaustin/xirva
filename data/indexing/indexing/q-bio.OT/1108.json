Our\naim was to develop and to apply a protocol of programmed physical activity\naccording to a non-linear methodology to enhance or diminish the deterioration\nof cognitive and motor functions of adults with this disease, using concepts of\ncomplexity theory for planning and programing the program. We evaluated 18\npatients (12 women and 6 men) diagnosed with mild and moderate grade. We worked\nin small groups (2 people/coach), a total of 16 weeks, 5 sessions per week and\n60 minutes per session. We designed a protocol that integrated work balance,\njoint mobility, coordination, muscular strength and metabolic efficiency. The\nstrong point of this intervention was how to design the planning of tasks for\npatients. The tasks were developed in parallel to processes of evocation and\ncognitive association individually designed and presented in order of\ncomplexity. In all subjects studied, we found an improvement in the results\nobtained in the Mini-Mental State Examination screening test, test of Cricthon,\nSet-Test of Isaacs, Clock Drawing Test and Trail Making Test, and the\nevaluation test of fitness. The physical activity program designed and the\nmethodology used, has been an adecuated tool to improve quality of life and\nautonomy of subjects analyzed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 08:31:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Guerra", "Yves de Sa\u00e1", ""], ["Gonz\u00e1lez", "Juan Manuel Mart\u00edn", ""], ["Montesdeoca", "Samuel Sarmiento", ""], ["Ruiz", "David Rodr\u00edguez", ""], ["Matoso", "Dario Rodr\u00edguez", ""]]}]
