In this paper we provide the first direct\napplication of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from\nexperimental field data. We show that this approach is able to infer general\nrules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or,\nmore generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing\npigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent\nattraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to\nexplain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals\nover time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of\nbuilding complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior.\nTopological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the\ncomponents within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with\nsimulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek\nmodel. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show\nthat the more complex three dimensional models are capable of predicting and\nsimulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics.\nThe simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of\nthe collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the\ninitial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach\nmay be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and\ncollective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement.\nFrom these models, the behavior of the individual agents (animals) may be\ninferred.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Oct 2011 14:08:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kattas", "Graciano Dieck", ""], ["Xu", "Xiao-Ke", ""], ["Small", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2966", "submitter": "Irina Manina", "authors": "I.V.

The first type\nof cost functional considered, seeks to minimize the total time of therapy. An\neasy implementation for this problem suggests that it can be effective in the\nearly stages of treatment as well as for individual-based studies, due to the\n\"hit first and hit hard\" nature of optimal control.\n  An LQR based cost functional is also presented and the solution is found\nusing steepest descent method. It suggests that the optimal therapy must remain\nhigh until the patient shows signs of recovery after which, the therapy\ngradually decreases. This is in line with the biomedical philosophy. Solution\nto a modified problem which includes a weight for total time is approximated\nusing the modified algorithm.
