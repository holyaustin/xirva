The aim of this study is evaluation of\nelectromagnetic effects on viability of Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)\nwithout co-culturing. In this study, stem cells were isolated from human\nadipose tissue enzymatically and proliferated in monolayer culture. Then,\n5.(10^4) adipose-derived stem cells were cultured in each well of the test\nplate. In the first row (4 wells), ADSCs as inducer cells were cultured in\nDMEM1 with 10 ng/ml Fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In adjacent and the last\nrows, ADSCs were cultured without FGF (as detector cells). After the three and\nfive days the viability of cells were evaluated. Moreover, ADSCs were cultured\nin the same conditions but the inducer cells were placed once in the UV-filter\ntube and once in the quartz tube to see whether there is electromagnetic\ninteraction among cells. Inducer cells caused significant cell proliferation in\nadjacent row cells (p- value<0.01) in the fifth day. However, using the\nUV-filter tube and quartz tube both reduced the effect of inducer cells on\nadjacent cells significantly. As a conclusion, we could detect distant cellular\ninteraction (DCI) among adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), but it was not\nelectromagnetic signaling. Our results show that ADSCs affect each other via\nvolatile signaling as a chemical distant cellular interaction (CDCI).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 04:58:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hashemibeni", "B.", ""], ["Sadeghian", "M", ""], ["Aliakbari", "M", ""], ["Alinasab", "Z", ""], ["Akbari", "M.", ""], ["Salari", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.1955", "submitter": "Valeria Aman", "authors": "Valeria Aman", "title": "Is there any measurable benefit in publishing preprints in the arXiv\n  section Quantitative Biology?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A public preprint server such as arXiv allows authors to publish their\nmanuscripts before submitting them to journals for peer review.

Based on three assumptions the\nevolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general law on the direction\nof genome evolution is given. Both the deterministic classical equation and the\nstochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical\nequation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can\nbe used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The\nwave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced\nlogically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the\ngeneral quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed\nsmooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the\nclassical and quantum phases. The speciation event is explained by the quantum\ntransition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the\nquantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for\ncharacterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from\nthe quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may\nbe more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic\nphysics, but also in genome evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 07:20:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Liaofu", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2761", "submitter": "Oleg Usatenko", "authors": "S.S.
