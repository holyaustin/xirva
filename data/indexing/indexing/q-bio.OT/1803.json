This challenge can be partially overcome by\nquantitative, data-driven approaches that utilise massive nutritional\ninformation collected for many different foods. Based on large-scale data of\nfoods' nutrient compositions, the recent concept of nutritional fitness helps\nquantify a nutrient balance within each food with regard to satisfying daily\nnutritional requirements. Nutritional fitness offers prioritisation of\nrecommended foods using the foods' occurrence in nutritionally adequate food\ncombinations. Here, we systematically identify nutritionally recommendable\nfoods for semi- to strict vegetarian diets through the computation of\nnutritional fitness. Along with commonly recommendable foods across different\ndiets, our analysis reveals favourable foods specific to each diet, such as\nimmature lima beans for a vegan diet as an amino acid and choline source, and\nmushrooms for ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets as a vitamin D source.\nFurthermore, we find that selenium and other essential micronutrients can be\nsubject to deficiency in plant-based diets, and suggest nutritionally-desirable\ndietary patterns. We extend our analysis to two hypothetical scenarios of\nhighly personalised, plant-based methionine-restricted diets. Our\nnutrient-profiling approach may provide a useful guide for designing different\ntypes of personalised vegetarian diets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2018 11:19:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 03:50:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Seunghyeon", ""], ["Fenech", "Michael F.", ""], ["Kim", "Pan-Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.05805", "submitter": "Robert Arbon", "authors": "Robert E.
