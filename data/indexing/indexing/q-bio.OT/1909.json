Theses plant has been considered as\nmedicinal plants in Ayurvedic systems for centuries. This present study was\ncarried out to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal properties of\nethanolic, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts of B. monnieri.\nAgar disc diffusion tests were carried out to determine the antimicrobial\neffects of ethanolic, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of B.\nmonnieri against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923),\nGram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) bacterial strains and antifungal\nstrains (Aspergillus flavus, and Candida albicans). Among the various extracts,\ndiethyl ether extracts of B. monnieri has an antibacterial potency against\nStaphylococcus aureus (gram positive), and ethyl acetate extract showed effects\non E. coli (gram negative) at higher concentrations of 300 microgam mL-1. The\nethanolic extract has potent antifungal activity against the fungus\n(Aspergillus flavus, and Candida albicans) compared to diethyl ether and ethyl\nacetate-ether. Both extracts (diethyl ether and ethyl acetate) has a minimum\nantifungal effect while these extracts showed more inhibitory effects on tested\nbacteria. Inhibitory effects of the aqueous extract were not observed at all\nconcentration (100 microgam mL-1, 200 microgam mL-1and 300 microgam mL-1)\nagainst the entire examined bacterial and fungal species. The finding of this\nstudy indicates the antibacterial and antifungal activity exhibited by the\nethanolic, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate extract of B. monnieri can be\nvalidated to the management of medicinal plant throughout the world.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2019 13:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mkk", "Fazlul", ""], ["Sp", "Deepthi", ""], ["Irfan", "Mohammed", ""], ["Y", "Farzana", ""], ["B", "Munira", ""], ["Nazmulmhm", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.02336", "submitter": "Jos\\'e Mar\\'ia Mart\\'in Olalla Dr.", "authors": "Jos\\'e Mar\\'ia Mart\\'in-Olalla", "title": "Scandinavian bed and rise times in the Age of Enlightenment and in the\n  21st century show similarity, helped by Daylight Saving Time", "comments": "3pages, 1figure, 740 words, RevTeX RMP format, longbibliography", "journal-ref": "Journal of Sleep Research 2019 e12916", "doi": "10.1111/jsr.12916", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Letter to the Editor published in the Journal of Sleep Research\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Sep 2019 11:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00edn-Olalla", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.06176", "submitter": "Lorenzo Fassina PhD", "authors": "Lorenzo Fassina, Giovanni Magenes, Roberto Gimmelli, Fabio Naro", "title": "Modulation of the cardiomyocyte contraction inside a hydrostatic\n  pressure bioreactor: $\\textit{in vitro}$ verification of the Frank-Starling\n  law", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "BioMed Research International 2015;2015:542105", "doi": "10.1155/2015/542105", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We have studied beating mouse cardiac syncytia $\\textit{in vitro}$ in order\nto assess the inotropic, ergotropic, and chronotropic effects of both\nincreasing and decreasing hydrostatic pressures.

Indeed, in DNA we\nencounter the biological \"atoms\", the four nucleotide molecules. At the same\ntime these four nucleotides may be considered as the \"letters\" of an alphabet.\nThese four \"letters\", through a genetic code, generate biological \"words\",\n\"phrases\", \"sentences\" (aminoacids, proteins, cells, living organisms). In this\nspirit we may consider equally well a DNA strand as a mathematical statement.\nInspired by the work of Kurt G\\\"odel, we attach to each DNA strand a G\\\"odel's\nnumber, a product of prime numbers raised to appropriate powers. To each DNA\nchain corresponds a single G\\\"odel's number $G$, and inversely given a\nG\\\"odel's number $G$, we can specify the DNA chain it stands for. Next,\nconsidering a single DNA strand composed of $N$ bases, we study the statistical\ndistribution of $g$, the logarithm of $G$. Our assumption is that the choice of\nthe $m$-th term is random and with equal probability for the four possible\noutcomes. The \"experiment\", to some extent, appears as throwing $N$ times a\nfour-faces die. Through the moment generating function we obtain the discrete\nand then the continuum distribution of $g$. There is an excellent agreement\nbetween our formalism and simulated data. At the end we compare our formalism\nto actual data, to specify the presence of traces of non-random dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 10:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nicolaidis", "Argyris", ""], ["Psomopoulos", "Fotis", ""]]}]
