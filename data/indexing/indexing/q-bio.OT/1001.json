In this context, successful\nstrategies spread by imitation. It has been shown that the details of strategy\nupdate rules can have a crucial impact on evolutionary dynamics in theoretical\nmodels and e.g. significantly alter the level of cooperation in social\ndilemmas. But what kind of strategy update rules can describe imitation\ndynamics in humans? Here, we present a way to measure such strategy update\nrules in a behavioral experiment. We use a setting in which individuals are\nvirtually arranged on a spatial lattice. This produces a large number of\ndifferent strategic situations from which we can assess strategy updating. Most\nimportantly, spontaneous strategy changes corresponding to mutations or\nexploration behavior are more frequent than assumed in many models. Our\nexperimental approach to measure properties of the update mechanisms used in\ntheoretical models will be useful for mathematical models of cultural\nevolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2010 10:45:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Traulsen", "Arne", ""], ["Semmann", "Dirk", ""], ["Sommerfeld", "Ralf D.", ""], ["Krambeck", "Hans-Juergen", ""], ["Milinski", "Manfred", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3878", "submitter": "Yonathan Schwarzkopf", "authors": "Yonathan Schwarzkopf, Attila Rakos and David Mukamel", "title": "Epidemic spreading in evolving networks", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036112", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A model for epidemic spreading on rewiring networks is introduced and\nanalyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks.
