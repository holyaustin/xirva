In order to synthesize sugar through artificial\nphotosynthesis, one of the key is to regenerate ATP economically and improve\nthe efficiency of dark reactions. Here 9 kinds of dark reaction pathways are\nproposed, which only NADH is regenearated from hydrogen or electricity for\ndriving, the efficiency of dark reactions is improved, combined with solar\nphotovoltaic or solar hydrogen technology, the total efficiency of artificial\nphotosynthesis can reach 30%, several ten times more than natural\nphotosynthesis. One of them, to use chemical synthesis of formaldehyde from CO2\nand H2, no NADH and ATP is need, to synthesize sugar efficiently through 9\nenzymes, so it will be easier to produce in large scale, and the sugar will be\na good energy carrier as the sugar can be efficiently converted to energy\ncarrier hydrogen through enzymes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Sep 2010 00:58:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Weidong", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3224", "submitter": "Satyan L.
