However, the reproducible\nmeasurement and modelling of charge migration through DNA molecules at the\nnanometer scale remains a challenging and controversial subject even after more\nthan a decade of intense efforts. Here we show, by analysing 162\ndisease-related genes from a variety of medical databases with a total of\nalmost 20,000 observed pathogenic mutations, a significant difference in the\nelectronic properties of the population of observed mutations compared to the\nset of all possible mutations. Our results have implications for the role of\nthe electronic properties of DNA in cellular processes, and hint at the\npossibility of prediction, early diagnosis and detection of mutation hotspots.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2011 17:56:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Shih", "Chi-Tin", ""], ["Wells", "Stephen A.", ""], ["Hsu", "Ching-Ling", ""], ["Cheng", "Yun-Yin", ""], ["R\u00f6mer", "Rudolf A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6065", "submitter": "L.T.

Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected\nnon-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional\n\\phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein\nrepresenting the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions\nbetween individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is\ndetermined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the\nprotein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in\nsome previous works.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2011 00:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Januar", "M.", ""], ["Sulaiman", "A.", ""], ["Handoko", "L.
