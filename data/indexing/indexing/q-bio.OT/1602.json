The protection of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFL) that are\nnot accessible by roads is high on the biodiversity conservation agenda, a\nchallenge for logging concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\n(FSC). A frequently advocated conservation objective is to maximise the\nretention of \"roadless space\", a concept that is based on distance to the\nnearest road from any point. We developed a novel use of the empty space\nfunction - a general statistical tool based on stochastic geometry and random\nsets theory - to calculate roadless space in a part of the Congo Basin where\nthere has recently been rapid expansion of road networks. We compared the\ntemporal development of roadless space in certified and non-certified logging\nconcessions inside and outside areas declared as IFL in the year 2000. Between\n1999 and 2007, rapid road network expansion led to a marked loss of roadless\nspace in IFL. After 2007, this trajectory levelled out in most areas, due to an\nequilibrium between newly built roads and abandoned roads that became\nrevegetated. However, concessions within IFL that have been certified by FSC\nsince around 2007 showed continued decreases in roadless space, thus reaching a\nlevel comparable to all other concessions. Only national parks remained\nroad-free. We recommend that forest management policies make the preservation\nof large connected forest areas a top priority by effectively monitoring - and\nlimiting - the occupation of space by roads that are permanently accessible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 13:09:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kleinschroth", "Fritz", ""], ["Healey", "John R.", ""], ["Gourlet-Fleury", "Sylvie", ""], ["Mortier", "Frederic", ""], ["Stoica", "Radu S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.05847", "submitter": "Fernando Vericat", "authors": "C.

The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a\nprime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with\neach codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer\nquaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of\nthe standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show\nthe advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,\nassociated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type\nquaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order\nquaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the\ntertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this\ncontext, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the\nset of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of\nsubsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by\nputting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D\nand L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,\nrespectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we\ndefine functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer\nquaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a\ngiven D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that\none corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for\nthe amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to\ndescribe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 14:15:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Carlevaro", "C.

Until now, it has not been found a\nway to experimentally verify this supposition although confirmation or\nrefutation of the existence of discrete states is crucial for the solution of\nmyosin motor problem. Here I show that a set of equal myosin heads arranged\nequidistantly along an actin filament produce X-ray pattern which varies with\nthe type of conformation. If the lever arms of all myosin heads reside in one\nand the same position (continuous conformation), all the heads have the same\nform-factor and equally scatter electromagnetic wave. In this case, only the\ngeometric factor associated with a spatial ordering of the heads will determine\nthe X-ray pattern. The situation changes if the average lever arm position is\nthe same, but inherently every head can reside only in several diverse discrete\nstates, hopping irregularly from one to another. In this case, the form-factors\ncorresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases\nof X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every\nquantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,\nthis results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern\nshould slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with\nthe continuous-type conformation. The formulas describing both cases are\ncompared in this article. In general, the distinction between X-ray patterns is\ninsignificant, but they could be appreciably different at some stages of\nconformation process (respective lever arm position depends on the type of\ndiscrete model). Consequently, one can with luck attempt to find out this\ndifference using a high-sensitive equipment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 11:29:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rosenfeld", "E.
