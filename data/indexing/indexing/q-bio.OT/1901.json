However, studying aging -\nthe decline in body function - is expensive and time-consuming. And despite\nresearch success to make model organisms live longer, there still aren't really\nany feasible solutions for delaying aging in humans. With space travel,\nscientists couldn't know what it would take to get to the moon. They had to\nextrapolate from theory and shorter-range tests. Perhaps with aging, we need a\nsimilar moonshot philosophy. And though \"shot\" might imply medicine, perhaps we\nneed to think beyond biological interventions. Like the moon, we seem a long\nway away from provable therapies to increase human healthspan (the healthy\nperiod of one's life) or lifespan (how long one lives). This review therefore\nfocuses on radical proposals. We hope it might stimulate discussion on what we\nmight consider doing significantly differently than ongoing aging research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jan 2019 20:10:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:47:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Sandeep", ""], ["Peterson", "Timothy R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06105", "submitter": "A.

The samples\nof leaves and the root of Nicotiana tabacum, the stems and tubers of Solanum\ntuberosum and the stems of pea Pisum sativum were examined by scanning probe\nmicroscopy (in atomic force and magnetic power modes), and it was found that\nthe BMNs are located in the form of chains in the wall of the phloem sieve\ntubes (ie, the vascular tissue of plants). Such a localization of BMNs supports\nthe idea that the chains of BMNs in different organs of plants have common\nmetabolic functions. Stray gradient magnetic fields about several thousand Oe,\nwhich are created by chains of BMNs, can significantly affect the processes of\nmass transfer near the membrane of vesicles, granules, organelles, structural\nelements of the membrane, and others. This process is enhanced in plants when\nartificial magnetite is added to the soil.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2019 08:56:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gorobets", "Svitlana", ""], ["Gorobets", "Oksana", ""], ["Magerman", "Alona", ""], ["Gorobets", "Yuri", ""], ["Sharay", "Iryna", ""]]}]
