It states that the variance of species\npopulation density scales as a power-law function of the mean population\ndensity. Taylor's power law was named after the British ecologist Lionel Roy\nTaylor. During the past half-century, Taylor's power law was confirmed for\nthousands of biological species and even for non-biological quantities.\nNumerous theories and models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of\nTaylor's power law. However an understanding of the historical origin of this\nubiquitous scaling pattern is lacking. This work reviews two research aspects\nthat are fundamental to the discovery of Taylor's power law and provides an\noutlook of its future studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2015 18:03:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 19:50:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.04656", "submitter": "Fernando Vericat", "authors": "C.

It incorporates, in a way that resembles the energy levels of an\natom, the physical notion of broken symmetry and it is consistent with original\nideas by Crick on the origin and evolution of the code as well as with the\nchronological order of appearence of the amino acids along the evolution as\ninferred from work that mixtures known experimental results with theoretical\nspeculations. Suggested by the diagram we propose a Hamilton quaternions based\nmathematical representation of the code as it stands now-a-days. The central\nobject in the description is a codon function that assigns to each amino acid\nan integer quaternion in such a way that the observed code degeneration is\npreserved. We emphasize the advantages of a quaternionic representation of\namino acids taking as an example the folding of proteins. With this aim we\npropose an algorithm to go from the quaternions sequence to the protein three\ndimensional structure which can be compared with the corresponding experimental\none stored at the Protein Data Bank. In our criterion the mathematical\nrepresentation of the genetic code in terms of quaternions merits to be taken\ninto account because it describes not only most of the known properties of the\ngenetic code but also opens new perspectives that are mainly derived from the\nclose relationship between quaternions and rotations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2015 14:23:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2015 19:15:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Carlevaro", "C.
