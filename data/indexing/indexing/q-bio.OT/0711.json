The linear\nconstraints, like mass conservation constraint, reversibility constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, can be imposed on linear algorithms. However,\nrecently a non-linear constraint based on the second thermodynamic law, known\nas \"loop law\", has emerged and challenged the existing algorithms. Proven to be\nunfeasible with linear solutions, this non-linear constraint has been\nsuccessfully imposed on the sampling process. In this place, Monte - Carlo\nsampling with Metropolis criterion and Simulated Annealing has been introduced\nto optimize the Biomass synthesis of genome scale metabolic network of\nHelicobacter pylori (iIT341 GSM / GPR) under mass conservation constraint,\nbiological capacity constraint, and thermodynamic constraints including\nreversibility and \"loop law\". The sampling method has also been employed to\noptimize a non-linear objective function, the Biomass synthetic rate, which is\nunified by the total income number of reducible electrons. To verify whether a\nsample contains internal loops, an automatic solution has been developed based\non solving a set of inequalities. In addition, a new type of pathway has been\nproposed here, the Futile Pathway, which has three properties: 1) its mass flow\ncould be self-balanced; 2) it has exchange reactions; 3) it is independent to\nthe biomass synthesis. To eliminate the fluxes of the Futile Pathways in the\nsampling results, a linear programming based method has been suggested and the\nresults have showed improved correlations among the reaction fluxes in the\npathways related to Biomass synthesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2007 03:22:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 16:04:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2007 09:53:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2007 16:30:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2008 13:34:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 01:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Lu", ""], ["Zhang", "Yi", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2619", "submitter": "Kateryna Mishchenko", "authors": "Kateryna Mishchenko, Sverker Holmgren, Lars Ronnegard", "title": "Newton-type Methods for REML Estimation in Genetic Analysis of\n  Quantitative Traits", "comments": "20 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT q-bio.QM", "license": null, "abstract": "  Robust and efficient optimization methods for variance component estimation\nusing Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) models for genetic mapping of\nquantitative traits are considered.
