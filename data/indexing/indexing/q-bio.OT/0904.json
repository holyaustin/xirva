The age of the\nmost developed insect larvae (mostly blow fly larvae) gives reasonably reliable\ninformation about the minimum time a person has been dead. Methods such as\nisomegalen diagrams or ADH calculations can have problems in their reliability,\nso we established in this study a new growth model to calculate the larval age\nof \\textit{Lucilia sericata} (Meigen 1826). This is based on the actual\nnon-linear development of the blow fly and is designed to include\nuncertainties, e.g. for temperature values from the crime scene. We used\npublished data for the development of \\textit{L. sericata} to estimate\nnon-linear functions describing the temperature dependent behavior of each\ndevelopmental state. For the new model it is most important to determine the\nprogress within one developmental state as correctly as possible since this\naffects the accuracy of the PMI estimation by up to 75%. We found that PMI\ncalculations based on one mean temperature value differ by up to 65% from PMIs\nbased on an 12-hourly time temperature profile. Differences of 2\\degree C in\nthe estimation of the crime scene temperature result in a deviation in PMI\ncalculation of 15 - 30%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 12:49:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2009 08:58:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 18:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Reibe", "S.", ""], ["von Doetinchem", "Ph.", ""], ["Madea", "B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1215", "submitter": "Jerome Vanclay", "authors": "Jerome K Vanclay", "title": "Tree diameter, height and stocking in even-aged forests", "comments": "15 pages, 8 figures.
