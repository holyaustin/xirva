We analyze the\nstationary solutions corresponding to macroscopic collective motion with finite\ncenter of mass velocity (ordered state) and the disordered solution with no\ncollective motion in the spatially homogeneous system. In particular, we\ndiscuss the impact of two different propulsion functions governing the\nindividual dynamics. Our results predict a strong impact of the individual\ndynamics on the mean field onset of collective motion (continuous vs\ndiscontinuous). In addition to the macroscopic density and velocity field we\nconsider explicitly the dynamics of an effective temperature of the agent\nsystem, representing a measure of velocity fluctuations around the mean\nvelocity. We show that the temperature decreases strongly with increasing level\nof collective motion despite constant fluctuations on individual level, which\nsuggests that extreme caution should be taken in deducing individual behavior,\nsuch as, state-dependent individual fluctuations from mean-field measurements\n[Yates {\\em et al.}, PNAS, 106 (14), 2009].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 13:05:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 12:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Romanczuk", "Pawel", ""], ["Schimansky-Geier", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1998", "submitter": "Miloje Rakocevic M.", "authors": "Miloje M.

The first type includes two amino acids (G, P), both without\nstandard hydrocarbon side chains; the second one four amino acids, as two pairs\n[(A, L), (V, I)], all with standard hydrocarbon side chains; the third type\ncomprises the six amino acids, as three pairs [(F, Y), (H, W), (C, M)], two\naromatic, two hetero aromatic and two \"hetero\" non-aromatic); finally, the\nfourth type consists of eight amino acids, as four pairs [(S, T), (D, E), (N,\nQ), (K, R)], all with a functional group which also exists in amino acid\nfunctional group (wholly presented: H2N-\\.CH-COOH; separately: OH, COOH, CONH2,\nNH2). The insight into existence of four types of diversity was possible only\nafter an insight into the existence of some very new arithmetical regularities,\nwhich were so far unknown. Also, as for showing these four types was necessary\nto reveal the relationships between several key harmonic structures of the\ngenetic code (which we presented in our previous works), this paper is also a\nreview article of the author's researches of the genetic code. By this, the\nreview itself shows that the said harmonic structures are connected through the\nsame (or near the same) chemically determined amino acid pairs, 10 pairs out of\nthe 190 possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2011 11:16:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2011 08:18:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rakocevic", "Miloje M.", ""]]}]
