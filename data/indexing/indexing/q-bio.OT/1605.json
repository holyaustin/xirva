Today, however, theoretical biology\nhas generally become synonymous with computational and mathematical biology.\nThis could in part be explained by a relatively recent tendency in which a\n\"data first\", rather than a \"theory first\", approach is preferred. Moreover,\ngenerating hypotheses has at times become procedural rather than theoretical.\nThis situation leaves our understanding enmeshed in data, which should be\ndisentangled from much noise. Given the many unresolved questions in biology\nand medicine, it seems apt to revive the role of pure theory in the biological\nsciences. This paper makes the case for a \"philosophical biology\"\n(philbiology), distinct from but quite complementary to philosophy of biology\n(philobiology), which would entail biological investigation through\nphilosophical approaches. Philbiology would thus be a reincarnation of\ntheoretical biology, adopting the true sense of the word \"theory\" and making\nuse of a rich tradition of serious philosophical approaches in the natural\nsciences. A philbiological investigation, after clearly defining a given\nbiological problem, would aim to propose a set of empirical questions, along\nwith a class of possible solutions, about that problem. Importantly, whether or\nnot the questions can be tested using current experimental paradigms would be\nsecondary to whether the questions are inherently empirical or not. The final\ngoal of a philbiological investigation would be to develop a theoretical\nframework that can lead observational and/or interventional experimental\nstudies of the defined problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 21:45:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Ehsani", "Sepehr", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01893", "submitter": "Hiroshi Ito", "authors": "Hiroshi C.
