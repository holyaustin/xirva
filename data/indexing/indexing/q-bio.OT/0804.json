This paper presents calculations of the chemotactic drift velocity vd\n(the mean velocity up the chemoattractant gradient) of an E. coli cell\nperforming chemotaxis in a uniform, steady shear flow, with a weak\nchemoattractant gradient at right angles to the flow. Extending earlier models,\na combined analytic and numerical approach is used to assess the effect of\nseveral complications, namely (i) a cell cannot detect a chemoattractant\ngradient directly but rather makes temporal comparisons of chemoattractant\nconcentration, (ii) the tumbles exhibit persistence of direction, meaning that\nthe swimming directions before and after a tumble are correlated, (iii) the\ncell suffers random re-orientations due to rotational Brownian motion, and (iv)\nthe non-spherical shape of the cell affects the way that it is rotated by the\nshear flow. These complications influence the dependence of vd on the shear\nrate gamma. When they are all included, it is found that (a) shear disrupts\nchemotaxis and shear rates beyond gamma = 2/second cause the cell to swim down\nthe chemoattractant gradient rather than up it, (b) in terms of maximising\ndrift velocity, persistence of direction is advantageous in a quiescent fluid\nbut disadvantageous in a shear flow, and (c) a more elongated body shape is\nadvantageous in performing chemotaxis in a strong shear flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2008 11:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Locsei", "J.

Life does work\nto acquire more energy, then uses the available energy it has gained to perform\nmore work. It is plausible that natural selection has optimized many biological\nsystems for power efficiency: useful power generated per unit fuel. In this\nletter we begin to investigate these questions for random Boolean networks\nusing Landauer's erasure principle, which defines a minimum entropy cost for\nbit erasure. We show that critical Boolean networks maximize available power\nefficiency, which requires that the system have a finite displacement from\nequilibrium.
