In\nfact, at first, great scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner\n(initially) believed that the wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is\ncaused by the consciousness of observer. However, this issue has been stayed\nyet very controversial. In fact, there are many challenging discussions about\nthe survival of quantum effects in microscopic structures of the human brain,\nwhich is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet\nand noisy environment of the brain that forbids long life coherence for brain\nprocessing. Nevertheless, there are also several arguments and evidences that\nemergence of large coherent states is feasible in the brain. In this paper, our\napproach is based on the latter in which macroscopic quantum states are\nprobable in the human brain. Here, we simulate the delayed luminescence of\nphotons in neurons with a Brassard-like teleportation circuit, i.e. equivalent\nto the transfer of quantum states of photons through the visual pathways from\nretina to the visual cortex. Indeed, our simulation considers both classical\nand quantum mechanical aspects of processing in neurons. As a result and based\non our simulation, it is possible for our brain to receive the exact quantum\nstates of photons in the visual cortex to be collapsed by our consciousness,\nwhich supports the Copenhagen-Interpretation of measurement problem in quantum\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 21:28:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 09:42:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Valian", "H.", ""], ["Bassereh", "H.", ""], ["Barkhordari", "A.", ""], ["Salari", "V.", ""]]}]
