The medial longitudinal arch (MLA) and the transverse\ntarsal arch (TTA) are key adaptations that increase the human midfoot's\nlongitudinal bending stiffness. The TTA is hypothesized to increase stiffness\nthrough a cross-axis coupling between transverse tissue stiffness and\nlongitudinal midfoot stiffness. However, we currently lack in vivo tests of\nthis hypothesis. Such tests are crucial because muscle contraction considerably\nmodulates MLA function and may also affect the TTA's predicted cross-axis\ncoupling. Here we show in vivo evidence for substantial cross-axis coupling in\nstanding human subjects. We found that longitudinal midfoot bending stiffness\nincreased upon increasing transverse forefoot stiffness using an elastic tape\n(mean$\\pm$standard error = $76\\% \\pm 19\\%$, p=0.0002), thus supporting the TTA\nhypothesis. The cross-axis coupling could be a potential therapeutic target for\nsome foot disorders and help augment foot stiffness for athletics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 17:56:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:32:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Yawar", "Ali", ""], ["Korpas", "Lucia", ""], ["Mandre", "Shreyas", ""], ["Venkadesan", "Madhusudhan", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05043", "submitter": "Christopher Kempes", "authors": "Christopher P.

Moreover, ever since Landauer's bound was proposed it has been known\nthat all computation has some thermodynamic cost -- and that the same\ncomputation can be achieved with greater or smaller thermodynamic cost\ndepending on how it is implemented. Accordingly an important issue concerning\nthe evolution of life is assessing the thermodynamic efficiency of the\ncomputations performed by organisms. This issue is interesting both from the\nperspective of how close life has come to maximally efficient computation\n(presumably under the pressure of natural selection), and from the practical\nperspective of what efficiencies we might hope that engineered biological\ncomputers might achieve, especially in comparison with current computational\nsystems. Here we show that the computational efficiency of translation, defined\nas free energy expended per amino acid operation, outperforms the best\nsupercomputers by several orders of magnitude, and is only about an order of\nmagnitude worse than the Landauer bound. However this efficiency depends\nstrongly on the size and architecture of the cell in question. In particular,\nwe show that the {\\it useful} efficiency of an amino acid operation, defined as\nthe bulk energy per amino acid polymerization, decreases for increasing\nbacterial size and converges to the polymerization cost of the ribosome. This\ncost of the largest bacteria does not change in cells as we progress through\nthe major evolutionary shifts to both single and multicellular eukaryotes.\nHowever, the rates of total computation per unit mass are nonmonotonic in\nbacteria with increasing cell size, and also change across different biological\narchitectures including the shift from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 18:58:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kempes", "Christopher P.", ""], ["Wolpert", "David", ""], ["Cohen", "Zachary", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Mercader", "Juan", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.06868", "submitter": "Yongguang Yang", "authors": "Li Ma, Shuangjie Chen, Yongguang Yang", "title": "Analysis of Bacteriostatic Effect of Chinese Herbal Medicine Against\n  E.coli", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To analyze the bacteriostatic effect of Chinese traditional herbal medicines\non E. coli, total 35 different preparations (decoction, volatile oil and\ndistillate) of Chinese traditional herbal medicines were tested using plate\nculture method.

The likelihood of conception of a\nmale is at its highest point five days after the full moon, whereas the highest\nlikelihood of female conception occurs nineteen days after the full moon.\nFurthermore, we found that the strength of this influence is correlated with\nthe amount of solar radiation (which is proportional to moonlight).
