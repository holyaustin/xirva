It is shown that some well known tools in field theory can be\nutilized to describe the physical phenomena in life matters, in particular at\nelementary biomatters like DNA and proteins. In this approach, the biomatter\ndynamics are represented as results of interactions among its elementary\nmatters in the form of lagrangian. Starting from the lagrangian would provide\nstronger underlying theoretical consideration for further extension. Moreover,\nit also enables us to acquire rich physical observables using statistical\nmechanics instead of relying on the space-time dynamics from certain equation\nof motions which is not solvable due to its nonlinearities. Few examples from\nprevious results are given and explained briefly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2012 11:43:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Handoko", "L.

It was discovered that the growth cycle is predefined by the\ndistribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass\nproduction. This distribution is quantitatively defined by the growth ratio\nparameter, which depends on the geometry of an organism, phase of growth and,\nindirectly, organism's biochemical machinery. The amount of produced biomass,\nin turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions. Changing amount of\nnutrients diverted to biomass production is what forces organisms to proceed\nthrough the whole growth and replication cycle. The growth law can be\nformulated as follows: the rate of growth is proportional to influx of\nnutrients and growth ratio. Considering specific biochemical components of\ndifferent organisms, we find influxes of required nutrients and substitute them\ninto the growth equation; then, we compute growth curves for amoeba, wild type\nfission yeast, fission yeast's mutant. In all cases, predicted growth curves\ncorrespond very well to experimental data. Obtained results prove validity and\nfundamental scientific value of the discovery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2012 16:16:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Shestopaloff", "Yu.
