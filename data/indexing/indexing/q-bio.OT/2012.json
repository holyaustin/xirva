We are witnessing a helpless situation due to\nCOVID-19 as no vaccine or drug is effective against the disease. In the present\nstudy, we have tested the applicability of some combination drugs against\nCOVID-19. We have tried to understand the mechanism of action of some\nrepurposed drugs: Favipiravir (F), Hydroxychloroquine (H) and Oseltamivir (O).\nThe ADME analysis have suggested strong inhibitory possibility of F, H, O\ncombination towards receptor protein of $3CL^{pro}$ of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The\nstrong binding affinity, number of hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor,\nreceptor and lower inhibition constant computed from molecular docking\nvalidated the better complexation possibility of F+H+O: $3CL^{pro}$\ncombination. Various thermodynamical output from Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations like potential energy ($E_g$), temperature (T), density, pressure,\nSASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_{bind}$) etc.,\nalso favored the complexation between F+H+O and CoV-2 protease. Our In-Silico\nresults have recommended the strong candidature of combination drugs\nFavipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir as a potential lead inhibitor\nfor targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2020 08:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pooja", "", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Papia", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02628", "submitter": "Jonathan Cohen", "authors": "Jonathan D.

From 2016 to 2019, the group gathered researchers and practitioners\nat the crossing point between information technology and agricultural science,\nto study all aspects in the life cycle of semantic resources:\nconceptualization, edition, sharing, standardization, services, alignment, long\nterm support. First, the working group realized a landscape study, a study of\nthe uses of semantics in agrifood, then collected use cases for the\nexploitation of semantics resources-a generic term to encompass vocabularies,\nterminologies, thesauri, ontologies. The resulting requirements were\nsynthesized into 39 \"hints\" for users and developers of semantic resources, and\nproviders of semantic resource services. We believe adopting these\nrecommendations will engage agrifood sciences in a necessary transition to\nleverage data production, sharing and reuse and the adoption of the FAIR data\nprinciples.
