The role of the temperature factor in life origin\nis considered. It is supposed, that three stages of abiogenesis (DNA world, RNA\nworld and the Protein world) consistently followed each other during Darwinian\nevolution. At the same time, the natural directional selection of the most\nstable macromolecules and effective catalytic reactions took place. The\ndirection of this selection is related to action of the principle of\n{\\guillemotleft}Increasing Independence from the Environment{\\guillemotright}\n(IIE) and is caused by temperature evolution of the atmosphere of the Earth.\nThe direction of Anagenesis and inevitability of occurrence of genetic\nmechanisms is discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Jan 2012 20:55:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Novikov", "Victor P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0912", "submitter": "Hung-Chung Huang", "authors": "Hung-Chung Huang, Rongqing Xie", "title": "New Osmosis Law and Theory: the New Formula that Replaces van't Hoff\n  Osmotic Pressure Equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article derived a new abstract concept from the osmotic process and\nconcluded it via \"osmotic force\" with a new law -- \"osmotic law\".

In\naddition, it was proved mathematically that the osmotic process could be\nexplained perfectly via \"osmotic force\" and \"osmotic laws\", which can prevent\nthe difficulties in using current \"osmotic pressure\" concept to explain the\nosmotic process and phenomenon. A theory and equation to describe the curve of\nosmotic pressure vs. different ideal solution concentrations are also derived,\nwhich can overcome the limitedness and incompleteness of van't Hoff osmotic\npressure formula (a linear equation) which is applicable to ideal dilute\nsolution only.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 04:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Hung-Chung", ""], ["Xie", "Rongqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2069", "submitter": "Ma\\\"el Mont\\'evil", "authors": "Giuseppe Longo and Ma\\\"el Mont\\'evil and Stuart Kauffman", "title": "No entailing laws, but enablement in the evolution of the biosphere", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biological evolution is a complex blend of ever changing structural\nstability, variability and emergence of new phenotypes, niches, ecosystems. We\nwish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view\nof law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the\nvariability of the very \"contexts of life\": the interactions between organisms,\nbiological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically\nindeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the \"niches\"\nwhich constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the\nmathematical unprestatability of the \"phase space\" (space of possibilities), no\nlaws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,\nfrom life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation\nand diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a\nnovel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be\ncarried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions\nof phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as\ninvariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of\nphysical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound\nbiological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of\n\"enablement\". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a\ndifference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences\nwill allow us to stress that \"non conservation principles\" are at the core of\nevolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation\nprinciples as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry\nchanges in physics, will be discussed, and lead to \"extended criticality\" as a\nconceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Longo", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Mont\u00e9vil", "Ma\u00ebl", ""], ["Kauffman", "Stuart", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5827", "submitter": "Andrea Perna", "authors": "Andrea Perna, Boris Granovskiy, Simon Garnier, Stamatios Nicolis,\n  Marjorie Lab\\'edan, Guy Theraulaz, Vincent Fourcassi\\'e, David Sumpter", "title": "Individual rules for trail pattern formation in Argentine ants\n  (Linepithema humile)", "comments": "final version, 9 figures, submitted to Plos Computational Biology\n  (accepted)", "journal-ref": "(2012) PLoS Comput Biol 8(7): e1002592", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002592", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an\nempty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated\npheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and\nat different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to\npheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and\nchanges in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response\nto local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by\nthese concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over\ntime, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant\ndetermining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a\nWeber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the\ntwo sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the\nturning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the\nwell-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the\nresults of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990).\nHowever, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function\nled to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the\nliterature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that\nin the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be\nderived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations\nthat we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the\npreferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jan 2012 16:43:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2012 12:51:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Perna", "Andrea", ""], ["Granovskiy", "Boris", ""], ["Garnier", "Simon", ""], ["Nicolis", "Stamatios", ""], ["Lab\u00e9dan", "Marjorie", ""], ["Theraulaz", "Guy", ""], ["Fourcassi\u00e9", "Vincent", ""], ["Sumpter", "David", ""]]}]
