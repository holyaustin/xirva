In this tutorial overview we aim to bring out\nfundamental assumptions and questions in the field, identify basic design\nprinciples and develop a key underlying theme -- the dynamics of quantum\ndynamical networks in the presence of an environment and the fruitful interplay\nthat the two may enter. At the hand of three biological phenomena whose\nunderstanding is held to require quantum mechanical processes, namely\nexcitation and charge transfer in photosynthetic complexes, magneto-reception\nin birds and the olfactory sense, we demonstrate that this underlying theme\nencompasses them all, thus suggesting its wider relevance as an archetypical\nframework for quantum biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 20:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Huelga", "S.

Observations are now made with increasing sophistication from both\nground and space-based instruments, and exoplanets are characterized with\nincreasing precision. There is a class of particularly interesting exoplanets,\nfalling in the habitable zone, which is defined as the area around a star where\nthe planet is capable of supporting liquid water on its surface. Theoretical\ncalculations also suggest that close-in exoplanets are more likely to have\nweaker planetary magnetic fields, especially in case of super earths. Such\nexoplanets are subjected to a high flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) due to\ntheir weak magnetic moments. GCRs are energetic particles of astrophysical\norigin, which strike the planetary atmosphere and produce secondary particles,\nincluding muons, which are highly penetrating. Some of these particles reach\nthe planetary surface and contribute to the radiation dose. Along with the\nmagnetic field, another factor governing the radiation dose is the depth of the\nplanetary atmosphere. The higher the depth of the planetary atmosphere, the\nlower the flux of secondary particles will be on the surface. If the secondary\nparticles are energetic enough, and their flux is sufficiently high, the\nradiation from muons can also impact the sub-surface regions, such as in the\ncase of Mars. If the radiation dose is too high, the chances of sustaining a\nlong-term biosphere on the planet are very low. We explore the dependence of\nthe GCR induced radiation dose on the strength of the planetary magnetic field\nand its atmospheric depth, finding that the latter is the decisive factor for\nthe protection of a planetary biosphere.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jul 2013 17:11:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2013 12:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Atri", "Dimitra", ""], ["Hariharan", "B.", ""], ["Griessmeier", "Jean-Mathias", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7882", "submitter": "Sergey Petoukhov", "authors": "Sergey Petoukhov", "title": "The genetic code, algebra of projection operators and problems of\n  inherited biological ensembles", "comments": "110 pages,82 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is devoted to applications of projection operators to simulate\nphenomenological properties of the molecular-genetic code system. Oblique\nprojection operators are under consideration, which are connected with matrix\nrepresentations of the genetic coding system in forms of the Rademacher and\nHadamard matrices. Evidences are shown that sums of such projectors give\nabilities for adequate simulations of ensembles of inherited biological\nphenomena including ensembles of biological cycles, morphogenetic ensembles of\nphyllotaxis patterns, mirror-symmetric patterns, etc. For such modeling, the\nauthor proposes multidimensional vector spaces, whose subspaces are under a\nselective control (or coding) by means of a set of matrix operators on base of\ngenetic projectors. Development of genetic biomechanics is discussed. The\nauthor proposes and describes special systems of multidimensional numbers under\nnames united-hypercomplex numbers, which attracted his attention when he\nstudied genetic systems and genetic matrices. New rules of long nucleotide\nsequences are described on the base of the proposed notion of tetra-groups of\nequivalent oligonucleotides.
