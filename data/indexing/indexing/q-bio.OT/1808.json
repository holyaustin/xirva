The goal of the summit was to provide a venue promoting a vibrant\ninterchange among leading basic and clinical researchers working on\nleading-edge aspects of melanocyte biology and disease. The philosophy of the\nmeeting, entitled Breakthroughs in Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research, was to\ndeliver a comprehensive program in an inclusive environment fostering\nscientific exchange and building new academic bridges. This document provides\nan outlook on the history, accomplishments, and sustainability of the pigment\ncell and melanoma research community. Shared progress in the understanding of\ncellular homeostasis of pigment cells but also clinical successes and hurdles\nin the treatment of melanoma and dermatological disorders continue to drive\nfuture research activities. A sustainable direction of the societies creates an\ninternational forum identifying key areas of imminent needs in laboratory\nresearch and clinical care and ensures the future of this vibrant, diverse and\nunique research community at the same time. Important advances showcase wealth\nand breadth of the field in melanocyte and melanoma research and include\nemerging frontiers in melanoma immunotherapy, medical and surgical oncology,\ndermatology, vitiligo, albinism, genomics and systems biology, precision\nbench-to-bedside approaches, epidemiology, pigment biophysics and chemistry,\nand evolution. This report recapitulates highlights of the federate meeting\nagenda designed to advance clinical and basic research frontiers from melanoma\nand dermatological sciences followed by a historical perspective of the\nassociated societies and conferences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2018 19:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2018 14:22:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Box", "Neil F.", ""], ["Larue", "Lionel", ""], ["Manga", "Prashiela", ""], ["Montoliu", "Lluis", ""], ["Spritz", "Richard A.", ""], ["Filipp", "Fabian V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.05766", "submitter": "Yongshuai Jiang", "authors": "Yongshuai Jiang, Jing Xu, Simeng Hu, Di Liu, Linna Zhao and Xu Zhou", "title": "The Function Transformation Omics - Funomics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  There are no two identical leaves in the world, so how to find effective\nmarkers or features to distinguish them is an important issue. Function\ntransformation, such as f(x,y) and f(x,y,z), can transform two, three, or\nmultiple input/observation variables (in biology, it generally refers to the\nobserved/measured value of biomarkers, biological characteristics, or other\nindicators) into a new output variable (new characteristics or indicators).\nThis provided us a chance to re-cognize objective things or relationships\nbeyond the original measurements. For example, Body Mass Index, which transform\nweight and high into a new indicator BMI=x/y^2 (where x is weight and y is\nhigh), is commonly used in to gauge obesity. Here, we proposed a new system,\nFunomics (Function Transformation Omics), for understanding the world in a\ndifferent perspective. Funome can be understood as a set of math functions\nconsist of basic elementary functions (such as power functions and exponential\nfunctions) and basic mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction).\nBy scanning the whole Funome, researchers can identify some special functions\n(called handsome functions) which can generate the novel important output\nvariable (characteristics or indicators). We also start \"the Funome project\" to\ndevelop novel methods, function library and analysis software for Funome\nstudies. The Funome project will accelerate the discovery of new useful\nindicators or characteristics, will improve the utilization efficiency of\ndirectly measured data, and will enhance our ability to understand the world.\nThe analysis tools and data resources about the Funome project can be found\ngradually at http://www.funome.com.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Aug 2018 05:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Yongshuai", ""], ["Xu", "Jing", ""], ["Hu", "Simeng", ""], ["Liu", "Di", ""], ["Zhao", "Linna", ""], ["Zhou", "Xu", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.08122", "submitter": "Nicholas Battista", "authors": "Nicholas A.
