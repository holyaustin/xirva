Their\nquantitative analysis relied primarily on the \"disparity equivalence\"\napproximation. In this article we show that retinal motion from lateral\ntranslation satisfies a strong (\"asymptotic\") approximation to binocular\ndisparity. This precise mathematical similarity is also practical in the sense\nthat it applies at normal viewing distances. The approximation is an extension\nto peripheral vision of (Cormac & Fox's 1985) well-known non-trig central\nvision approximation for binocular disparity. We hope our simple algebraic\nformula will be useful in analyzing experiments outside central vision where\nless precise approximations have led to a number of quantitative errors in the\nvision literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 19:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Stroyan", "Keith", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4726", "submitter": "Peter Thomas PhD", "authors": "Edward K.

Some scholars have proposed that information\nshould provide the central explanatory principle in biology, in the sense that\nany behavioral strategy that is optimal for an organism's survival must\nnecessarily involve efficient information processing. We challenge this view by\nproviding a counterexample. We present an analytically tractable model for a\nparticular instance of a perception-action loop: a creature searching for a\nfood source confined to a one-dimensional ring world. The model incorporates\nthe statistical structure of the creature's world, the effects of the\ncreature's actions on that structure, and the creature's strategic decision\nprocess. The model takes the form of a Markov process on an infinite\ndimensional state space. To analyze it we construct an exact coarse graining\nthat reduces the model to a Markov process on a finite number of \"information\nstates\". This technique allows us to make quantitative comparisons between the\nperformance of an information-theoretically optimal strategy with other\ncandidate strategies on a food gathering task. We find that: 1. Information\noptimal search does not necessarily optimize utility (expected food gain). 2.\nThe rank ordering of search strategies by information performance does not\npredict their ordering by expected food obtained. 3. The relative advantage of\ndifferent strategies depends on the statistical structure of the environment,\nin particular the variability of motion of the source. We conclude that there\nis no simple relationship between information and utility. Behavioral\noptimality does not imply information efficiency, nor is there a simple\ntradeoff between gaining information about a food source versus obtaining the\nfood itself.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Oct 2010 14:33:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Agarwala", "Edward K.", ""], ["Chiel", "Hillel J.", ""], ["Thomas", "Peter J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5178", "submitter": "Herbert S.

Although the most informative way of investigating and\ninterpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection\nof high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are\nscarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a\nnatural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we\npresent results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in\nflocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution\nlightweight GPS devices and analyzed using a variety of correlation functions\ninspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined\nhierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise\ninteractions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds'\ndirectional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock\nstrongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more\nquickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye - both results\nrevealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with\nrespect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest\nthat hierarchical organisation of group flight may be more efficient than an\negalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise\ninteractions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships\nare consistently manifested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Oct 2010 13:45:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Nagy", "Mate", ""], ["Akos", "Zsuzsa", ""], ["Biro", "Dora", ""], ["Vicsek", "Tamas", ""]]}]
