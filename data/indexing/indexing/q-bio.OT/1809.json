After summarizing\nrecent results in understanding the physiology and system-level performance of\na variety of biological systems, we describe computational algorithms that can\ngenerate similar patterns and have the potential for distributed\nimplementation. We find that the existing body of work predominately treats\ncomponent technology in an isolated manner that precludes a material-like\nimplementation that is scale-free and robust. We conclude with open research\nchallenges towards the realization of integrated camouflage solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 21:19:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Yang", ""], ["Correll", "Nikolaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.06232", "submitter": "Samad Noeiaghdam", "authors": "Samad Noeiaghdam, Emran Khoshrouye Ghiasi", "title": "Solving a non-linear model of HIV infection for CD4+T cells by combining\n  Laplace transformation and Homotopy analysis method", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to find the approximate solution of HIV infection\nmodel of CD4+T cells. For this reason, the homotopy analysis transform method\n(HATM) is applied. The presented method is combination of traditional homotopy\nanalysis method (HAM) and the Laplace transformation. The convergence of\npresented method is discussed by preparing a theorem which shows the\ncapabilities of method. The numerical results are shown for different values of\niterations. Also, the regions of convergence are demonstrated by plotting\nseveral h-curves.

I was surprised to find that\neverything I wanted my biophysics students to know about light, including image\nformation, x-ray diffraction, and even Bessel beams, could be expressed as well\n(or better) from the quantum viewpoint pioneered by Richard Feynman. Even my\nundergraduate students grasp this viewpoint as well as (or better than) the\ntraditional one, and by mid-semester they are already well positioned to\nintegrate the latest advances into their understanding.
