An initial screening of different species of\nfungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete\nplate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The\nresults showed that, due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of\nthe growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the\ndrastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into\nhyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that the\ncrystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite. These\nresults indicate that T. reesei has great potential to be used in bio-based\nself-healing concrete for sustainable infrastructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Aug 2017 00:19:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Dec 2017 02:51:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Jing", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaobo", ""], ["Crump", "Jada", ""], ["Zhou", "Hui", ""], ["Davies", "David G.", ""], ["Zhou", "Guangwen", ""], ["Zhang", "Ning", ""], ["Jin", "Congrui", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02651", "submitter": "Ioana Cristescu", "authors": "Pierre Boutillier (1), Ioana Cristescu (1) ((1) HMS)", "title": "When rule-based models need to count", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rule-based modelers dislike direct enumeration of cases when more efficient\nmeans of enumeration are available.

Skin color is often used in human skin detection\nbecause it is invariant to orientation and size and is fast to process. A new\nhuman skin detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The three main\nparameters for recognizing a skin pixel are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue,\nSaturation, Value) and YCbCr (Luminance, Chrominance) color models. The\nobjective of proposed algorithm is to improve the recognition of skin pixels in\ngiven images. The algorithm not only considers individual ranges of the three\ncolor parameters but also takes into ac- count combinational ranges which\nprovide greater accuracy in recognizing the skin area in a given image.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Aug 2017 02:08:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kolkur", "S.", ""], ["Kalbande", "D.", ""], ["Shimpi", "P.", ""], ["Bapat", "C.", ""], ["Jatakia", "J.", ""]]}]
