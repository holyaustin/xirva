An increasing\nnumber of studies focus on animals' movement in three dimensions (3D), but the\nkey properties of CRW, such as the way the mean squared displacement is related\nto the path length, are well known only in 1D and 2D. In this paper I derive\nsuch properties for 3D CRW, in a consistent way with the expression of these\nproperties in 2D. This should allow 3D CRW to act as a null model when\nanalyzing actual 3D movements similarly to what is done in 2D\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jan 2018 14:24:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 25 Feb 2018 12:25:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Jun 2018 16:34:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2019 12:28:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Benhamou", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.05452", "submitter": "Bob Eisenberg", "authors": "Bob Eisenberg", "title": "Asking Biological Questions of Physical Systems: the Device Approach to\n  Emergent Properties", "comments": "Journal of Molecular Liquids, in the press, January 16, 2018, Article\n  Reference MOLLIQ8542", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.molliq.2018.01.088", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Life occurs in concentrated `Ringer Solutions' derived from seawater that\nLesser Blum studied for most of his life. As we worked together, Lesser and I\nrealized that the questions asked of those solutions were quite different in\nbiology from those in the physical chemistry he knew. Biology is inherited.\nInformation is passed by handfuls of atoms in the genetic code. A few atoms in\nthe proteins built from the code change macroscopic function. Indeed, a few\natoms often control biological function in the same sense that a gas pedal\ncontrols the speed of a car. Biological questions then are most productive when\nthey are asked in the context of evolution. What function does a system\nperform? How is the system built to perform that function? What forces are used\nto perform that function? How are the modules that perform functions connected\nto make the machinery of life. Physiologists have shown that much of life is a\nnested hierarchy of devices, one on top of another, linking atomic ions in\nconcentrated solutions to current flow through proteins, current flow to\nvoltage signals, voltage signals to changes in current flow, all connected to\nmake a regenerative system that allows electrical action potentials to move\nmeters, under the control of a few atoms. The hierarchy of devices allows\nmacroscopic properties to emerge from atomic scale interactions. The structures\nof biology create these devices. The concentration and electrical fields of\nbiology power these devices, more than anything else. The resulting organisms\nreproduce. Evolution selects the organisms that reproduce more and thereby\nselects the devices that allow macroscopic control to emerge from the atomic\nstructures of genes and proteins and their motions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jan 2018 19:21:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenberg", "Bob", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.08073", "submitter": "Marko Popovic", "authors": "Marko Popovic", "title": "Thermodynamic Mechanism of Life and Aging", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Life is a complex biological phenomenon represented by numerous chemical,\nphysical and biological processes performed by a biothermodynamic\nsystem/cell/organism. Both living organisms and inanimate objects are subject\nto aging, a biological and physicochemical process characterized by changes in\nbiological and thermodynamic state. Thus, the same physical laws govern\nprocesses in both animate and inanimate matter. All life processes lead to\nchange of an organism's state. The change of biological and thermodynamic state\nof an organism in time underlies all of three kinds of aging (chronological,\nbiological and thermodynamic). Life and aging of an organism both start at the\nmoment of fertilization and continue through entire lifespan. Fertilization\nrepresents formation of a new organism. The new organism represents a new\nthermodynamic system. From the very beginning, it changes its state by changing\nthermodynamic parameters. The change of thermodynamic parameters is observed as\naging and can be related to change in entropy. Entropy is thus the parameter\nthat is related to all others and describes aging in the best manner. In the\nbeginning, entropy change appears as a consequence of accumulation of matter\n(growth). Later, decomposition and configurational changes dominate, as a\nconsequence of various chemical reactions (free radical, decomposition,\nfragmentation, accumulation of lipofuscin-like substances...).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 09:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Popovic", "Marko", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.08137", "submitter": "Jean Gaudart", "authors": "Louis Gaudart and Jean Gaudart", "title": "Nerve impulse propagation and wavelet theory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  A luminous stimulus which penetrates in a retina is converted to a nerve\nmessage.
