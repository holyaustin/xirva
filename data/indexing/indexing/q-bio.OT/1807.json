The statistical mechanism at the sequence level may play a\nsignificant role in the prebiotic evolution. Based on statistical analysis of\ngenome sequences, it has been observed that there is a close relationship\nbetween the evolution of the genetic code and the organisation of genomes. A\nbiodiversity space for species is constructed based on comparing the\ndistributions of codons in genomes for different species according to\nrecruitment order of codons in the prebiotic evolution, by which a closely\nrelationship between the evolution of the genetic code and the tree of life has\nbeen confirmed. On one hand, the three domain tree of life can be reconstructed\naccording to the distance matrix of species in this biodiversity space, which\nsupports the three-domain tree rather than the eocyte tree. On the other hand,\nan evolutionary tree of codons can be obtained by comparing the distributions\nof the 64 codons in genomes, which agrees with the recruitment order of codons\non the roadmap. This is a simple phylogenomic method to study the origins of\nmetazoan, the evolution of primates, etc. This study should be regarded as an\nexploratory attempt to explain the diversification of the three domains of life\nby statistical mechanism in prebiotic sequence evolution. It is indicated that\nthe number of bases in the triplet codons might be explained statistically by\nthe number of strands in the triplex DNAs. The adaptation of life to the\nchanging environment might be due to assembly of redundant genomes at the\nsequence level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2018 17:20:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Dirson Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.04190", "submitter": "Tomokazu Konishi", "authors": "Tomokazu Konishi", "title": "Concerns regarding the deterioration of objectivity in molecular biology", "comments": "13 pages, 4 figures, a review article", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Scientific objectivity was not a problem in the early days of molecular\nbiology.

According to distributions of codons in genome\nsequences, I found a relationship between the genetic code and the tree of\nlife. This remote and profound relationship involves the origin and evolution\nof the genetic code and the diversification and expansion of genomes. Here, a\nprebiotic picture of the triplex nucleic acid evolution is proposed to explain\nthe origin of the genetic code, where the transition from disorder to order in\nthe origin of life might be due to the increasing stabilities of triplex base\npairs. The codon degeneracy can be obtained in detail based on the coevolution\nof the genetic code with amino acids, or equivalently, the coevolution of tRNAs\nwith aaRSs. This theory is based on experimental data such as the stability of\ntriplex base pairs and the statistical features of genomic codon distributions.\nSeveral experimentally testable proposals have been developed. This study\nshould be regarded as an exploratory attempt to reveal the early evolution of\nlife based on sequence information in a statistical manner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2018 15:13:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Dirson Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.05016", "submitter": "Philip Bourne", "authors": "Philip E.

To evaluate the environmental impacts of\nlight pollution, it is crucial to understand both the natural and artificial\ncomponents of light at night under all weather conditions. The night sky\nbrightness for clear skies is relatively well understood and a reference point\nfor a lower limit is defined. However, no such reference point exists for\ncloudy skies. While some studies have examined the brightening of the night sky\nby clouds in urban areas, the published data on the (natural) darkening by\nclouds is very sparse. Knowledge of reference points for the illumination of\nnatural nocturnal environments however, is essential for experimental design\nand ecological modeling to assess the impacts of light pollution. Here we use\ndifferential all-sky photometry with a commercial digital camera to investigate\nhow clouds darken sky brightness at two rural sites. The spatially resolved\ndata enables us to identify and study the nearly unpolluted parts of the sky\nand to set an upper limit on ground illumination for overcast nights at sites\nwithout light pollution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2018 13:15:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 20:09:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Jechow", "Andreas", ""], ["H\u00f6lker", "Franz", ""], ["Kyba", "Christopher C.
