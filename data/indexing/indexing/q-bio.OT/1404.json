Functioning of biochemical networks\nsuggests that such serendipitous collisions, as a whole, result into a perfect\nsynchronous order. Nonetheless, owing to the very nature of Brownian\ncollisions, a small yet non-trivial probability can always be associated with\nthe events when such synchronizations fail to emerge consistently; which\naccount for a damage of a biochemical pathway. The repair mechanism of the\nsystem then attempts to minimize the damage, in the pursuit to bring restore\nthe appropriate level of synchronization between reactant concentrations.\nPresent work presents a predictive probabilistic model that describes the\nvarious facets of this complicated and coupled process(damaging and repairing).\nBy describing the cytosolic reality of Brownian collisions with\nChapman-Kolmogorov equations, the model presents analytical answers to the\nquestions, with what probability a fragment of any pathway may suffer damage\nwithin an arbitrary interval of time? and with what probability the damage to a\npathway can be repaired within any arbitrary interval of time?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 20:44:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Banerji", "Anirban", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0936", "submitter": "Stefan Z Stefanov", "authors": "I.
