To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract\norganizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as\nthe scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to\norganisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage\nproduced by stretch. We propose to study the consequences of deformation of\nbiological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than\npreviously considered relevant. We show that structural robustness is present\nas a basic principle in many facets of biomedicine: many pathological\nconditions may derive from the failure of molecules, cells and their\nhigher-order assemblies to maintain robustness against deformation.\nFurthermore, structural robustness could have been the key selective criterion\nduring pre-biotic evolution and afterwards, and its universality can be\ndemonstrated by modeling using genetic algorithms. Thus, the specific\ninvestigation of bio-structural robustness as anapedesis could help the solving\nof fundamental problems of biology and medicine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 07:05:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 23:09:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moldovan", "Nicanor I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0690", "submitter": "Vladimir Ivancevic", "authors": "Vladimir Ivancevic, Eugene Aidman, Leong Yen and Darryn Reid", "title": "Phase Transitions, Chaos and Joint Action in the Life Space Foam", "comments": "20 pages, no figures, elsart", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper extends our recently developed Life Space Foam (LSF) model of\nmotivated cognitive dynamics \\cite{IA}. LSF uses adaptive path integrals to\ngenerate Lewinian force--fields on smooth manifolds, in order to characterize\nthe dynamics of individual goal--directed action. According to explanatory\ntheories growing in acceptance in cognitive neuroscience, one of the key\nproperties of this dynamics, capable of linking it to microscopic-level\ncortical neurodynamics, is its meta-stability and the resulting phase\ntransitions. Our extended LSF model incorporates the notion of phase\ntransitions and complements it with embedded geometrical chaos. To describe\nthis LSF phase transition, a general path--integral is used, along the\ncorresponding LSF topology change. As a result, our extended LSF model is able\nto rigorously represent co-action by two or more actors in the common\nLSF--manifold. The model yields substantial qualitative differences in\ngeometrical properties between bilateral and multi-lateral co-action due to\nintrinsic chaotic coupling between $n$ actors when $n\\geq 3$.\n  Keywords: cognitive dynamics, adaptive path integrals, phase transitions,\nchaos, topology change, human joint action, function approximation\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jun 2008 05:06:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir", ""], ["Aidman", "Eugene", ""], ["Yen", "Leong", ""], ["Reid", "Darryn", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2308", "submitter": "Fernando Peruani", "authors": "Fernando Peruani and Gustavo J.
