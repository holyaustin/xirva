Here we analyze data on the\ntime-resolved face-to-face proximity of individuals in large-scale real-world\nscenarios. We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific\nconference and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral\nnetworks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static\nand a dynamic point of view, exposing important differences as well as striking\nsimilarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a\nsusceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical\nnetworks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for\nthe conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the\ncausal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths\nshows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to\nerroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 14:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2010 07:58:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 11:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Isella", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Stehl\u00e9", "Juliette", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Pinton", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1585", "submitter": "Ximena Celeste Abrevaya", "authors": "Ximena C.

It is usually required that the methodology can detect life\nindependently from its composition or form, and that the chosen biological\nsignature points to a feature common to all living systems, as the presence of\nmetabolism. In this paper we evaluate the use of Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs)\nfor the detection of microbial life in situ. MFCs are electrochemical devices\noriginally developed as power electrical sources, and can be described as fuel\ncells in which the anode is submerged in a medium that contains microorganisms.\nThese microorganisms, as part of their metabolic process, oxidize organic\nmaterial releasing electrons that contribute to the electric current, which is\ntherefore proportional to metabolic and other redox processes. We show that\npower and current density values measured in MFCs using microorganism cultures\nor soil samples in the anode are much larger than those obtained using a medium\nfree of microorganisms or sterilized soil samples, respectively. In particular,\nwe found that this is true for extremophiles, usually proposed to live in\nextraterrestrial environments. Therefore, our results show that MFCs have the\npotential to be used to detect microbial life in situ.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 15:21:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 01:10:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Abrevaya", "Ximena C.", ""], ["Mauas", "Pablo J.

We argue that a triadic\nconceptual structure offers an alternative perspective under which the\ninformation generating role of evolution as a physical process can be analyzed,\nand propose a new diagrammatic approach. Peirce's natural philosophy was deeply\ninfluenced by his reception of both Darwin's theory and thermodynamics. Thus,\nwe elaborate on a new synthesis which puts together his theory of signs and\nmodern Maximum Entropy approaches to evolution. Following recent contributions\nto the naturalization of Peircean semiosis, we show that triadic structures\ninvolve the conjunction of three different kinds of causality, efficient,\nformal and final. We apply this on Ulanowicz's analysis of autocatalytic cycles\nas primordial patterns of life. This paves the way for a semiotic view of\nthermodynamics which is built on the idea that Peircean interpretants are\nsystems of physical inference devices evolving under natural selection. In this\nview, the principles of Maximum Entropy, Maximum Power, and Maximum Entropy\nProduction work together to drive the emergence of information carrying\nstructures, which at the same time maximize information capacity as well as the\ngradients of energy flows, such that ultimately, contrary to Schroedinger's\nseminal contribution, the evolutionary process is seen to be a physical\nexpression of the Second Law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2010 04:37:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Herrmann-Pillath", "Carsten", ""], ["Salthe", "Stanley N.", ""]]}]
