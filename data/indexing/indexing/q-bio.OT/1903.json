This review aims to explore the\ndevelopment, challenges, and the current state of antibiotic resistance\navailable literature in Malaysia. This review reiterates the antibiotic\nresistance among the gram-negative bacteria is increasing and they are becoming\nresistant to nearly all groups of antibiotics. The antibiotic treatments are\nminimal and hard to treat in multi-drug resistance bacterial infection,\nresulting in morbidity and mortality. The prevalence rate of antibiotic\nresistance from the literature suggests that educating patients and the public\nis essential to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance.

Processes of this kind characterize\nboth living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is\nat the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering.\nPlaced at the frontiers between disciplines, Artificial Life (ALife) has\nheavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization,\nproviding mechanistic interpretations of life-like phenomena as well as useful\nconstructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage\nwithin ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively\nstretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with\ntracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered\nself-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of\nself-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains,\nnamely \"soft\" (mathematical/computational modeling), \"hard\" (physical robots),\nand \"wet\" (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification\nto locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of\nself-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to\nperspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions. We\nhope that this work will motivate discussions related to self-organization in\nALife and related fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Mar 2019 21:26:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2020 13:37:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gershenson", "Carlos", ""], ["Trianni", "Vito", ""], ["Werfel", "Justin", ""], ["Sayama", "Hiroki", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.10694", "submitter": "Anna Khudayarov", "authors": "Anna Khudayarov", "title": "Revising the Wilks Scoring System for pro RAW Powerlifting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Purpose: In powerlifting the total result is highly dependent on the athletes\nbodyweight. Powerlifting is divided to equipped and RAW types. Pro RAW\npowerlifting competitions use the Wilks scoring system to compare and rank\npowerlifting results across bodyweights, to choose the winners. The Wilks\nformulas are 5th order polynomials fitted to equipped powerlifting results from\nthe years 1987 - 1994. The Wilks formulas were meant to be updated every 2 to 5\nyears, but have never been revised. This study aims to update the Wilks scoring\nsystem for use in pro RAW powerlifting.\n  Methods: The 10 highest RAW powerlifting totals per weight class for\nbodyweights 60 - 175 kg for men, and 44 kg and up for women, were collected\nfrom the openpowerlifting.org database. Polynomials were fitted to these data\nseparately for men and women, using polynomial regression. The scores for men\nand women were calculated using these fits, and the results are assessed.\n  Results: 4th order polynomials were chosen for best describing the dependence\nof powerlifting total result on bodyweight. The mens scores were normalized to\n500 points, and womens to 455 points, on those fitted curves, to bring the top\nscores to the same level across weight classes of each sex. These scores\nappeared similar across the different weight classes for both men and women.\nThis even scoring across body weights is here considered the single most\nimportant characteristic of a scoring system for pro competitions.\n  Key words: Wilks score, revised prediction curve, polynomial regression,\npowerlifting\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2019 17:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Khudayarov", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.10859", "submitter": "Reza Pourimani", "authors": "Reza Pourimani, Sedigheh Kashian, Ali Asghar Fathivand", "title": "Measurement of trace elements in five popular medicinal plants using\n  Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis method (INAA) in Arak, Iran", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, the specific mass of twelve elements were determined in five of\nthe most commonly used medicinal plants as Caraway (Carum carvi), Savory\n(Satureia hortensis), Purslane (Portulaca oleracea), Fenugreek (Trigonella\nfoenum-graecum) and Milk thistle (Silibum marianum) prepared from herbal\npharmacies.
