A distribution\npattern of triplet frequencies in the Siberian larch (\\textit{Larix\nsibirica}~Ledeb.) transcriptome sequences was investigated in the presented\nstudy. It was found that the larch transcriptome demonstrates a number of\nunexpected symmetries in the statistical and combinatorial properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 15:52:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sadovsky", "Michael G.", ""], ["Birukov", "Vladislav V.", ""], ["Putintseva", "Yuliya A.", ""], ["Krutovsky", "Konstantin V.", ""]]}]
