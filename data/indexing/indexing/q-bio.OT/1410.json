This\nallows for a convenient description of their extent in space as well as all\nmanner of cell surface gradients. We assume that a spectrum of such cell\nsurface markers determines an epigenetic code for organism shape. The union of\ncells in space at a moment in time is by definition the organism taken as a\nmetric subspace of Euclidean space, which can be further equipped with an\narbitrary measure. Each cell determines a point in space thus assigning a\nfinite configuration of distinct points in space to an organism, and a bundle\nover this configuration space is introduced with fiber a Hilbert space\nrecording specific epigenetic data. On this bundle, a Lagrangian formulation of\nmorphogenetic dynamics is proposed based on Gromov-Hausdorff distance which at\nonce describes both embryo development and regenerative growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 10:23:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Morozova", "Nadya", ""], ["Penner", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1134", "submitter": "Vahid Salari", "authors": "Narges Moradi, Felix Scholkmann, Vahid Salari", "title": "Selectivity filter gate versus voltage-sensitive gate: A study of\n  quantum probabilities in the Hodgkin-Huxley equation", "comments": "15 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, Accepted in J Integrative Neuroscience", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is a powerful model to explain different\naspects of spike generation in excitable cells. However, the HH model was\nproposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is\nnow common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through\nthe pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter\ninside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The\nselectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast\nconduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other\n(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control\nthe access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are\nconsidered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage\nsensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate\n(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small\ndimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion\nchannel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see\nwhether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that\nthe previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider\nand Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different\nconditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases. We conclude\nthat the BS model can refine the classical HH model substantially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Oct 2014 08:55:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Moradi", "Narges", ""], ["Scholkmann", "Felix", ""], ["Salari", "Vahid", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.5690", "submitter": "Valentina Agoni", "authors": "Valentina Agoni", "title": "The role of Junk DNA", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many efforts have been done in order to explain the role of junk DNA, but its\nfunction remain to be elucidated.
