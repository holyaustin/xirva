We show that the cells of a homogeneous excitable tissue,\ndepending on the ratio of the durations of the functional intervals, can\noperate in the mode of solitary waves conduction or in one of three modes of\nselfgeneration. It is proved that the propagation of a solitary wave through\nthe boundary of homogeneous conducting tissues can be accompanied by a block or\nmultiplex reflection. Block and reflection are unidirectional phenomena, and\nthere are not compatible on the same boundary.

Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,\nburn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving\nenvironments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other\nanimals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in\nexercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases\nin daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals\nexhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating\nsome of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by\ndecreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy\ncompensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But\nthe processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy\ncompensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how\nenergy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant\nexercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates\nconflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level\nactivity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body\ncomposition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity\nare not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss\nhow changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations\nin BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management.
