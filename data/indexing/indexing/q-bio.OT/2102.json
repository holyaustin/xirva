Flowers of A.\nofficinalis and leaves of T. cordata and P. guaja have been used to treat\ncough, sore throat, catarrh, oral and pharyngeal mucosa irritation. Therefore,\nthis study was designed to examine the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of\nthese plants individually as well as in combination, as a formula against\nrespiratory infections causing pathogens. The tested pathogens were Extended\nSpectrum Beta-Lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBL), Beta-Lactamase\nproducing Escherichia coli (BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae\n(BL), Beta-Lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BL), Enterobacter\ncloacae, and Beta-Lactamase producing Staphylococcus aureus (BL). The tested\nplants were extracted using ethanol and then fractionated using different\npolarity solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate and water). Disc diffusion and\nmicrodilution (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) methods were used to evaluate\nthe antibacterial activity while the antibiofilm activity was tested using\ncrystal violet assay. The results showed that A. officinalis and T. cordata\nextracts and fractions exhibited weak antibacterial activity having MIC values\nranged from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL. P. guaja exhibited moderate antibacterial\nactivity with MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 1.56 mg/mL. Combination between\nthese plants extracts and fractions in equal proportion provides stronger\nantibacterial (with MIC values ranged from 6.25 to 0.8 mg/mL) and antibiofilm\nactivities (MBIC50 was 0.2 mg/mL). Therefore, this study provides a valuable\nscientific knowledge to support the use of plants in combination rather than\nindividually.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 20:34:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Qaralleh", "H.

Routine RT-qPCR tests including TaqPath or similar assays based on a\ndrop-out of the Spike gene target are incapable of distinguishing among these\nlineages and often lead to the false conclusion that clinical samples contain\nthe B.1.1.7 variant, which recently emerged in the United Kingdom and is\nquickly spreading through the human population. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 samples\ncollected from various regions of Slovakia between November and December 2020\nthat were presumed to contain the B.1.1.7 variant due to traveling history of\nthe virus carriers or their contacts. Sequencing of these isolates revealed\nthat although in some cases the samples were indeed confirmed as B.1.1.7, a\nsubstantial fraction of isolates contained another $\\Delta$H69/$\\Delta$V70\ncarrying mutant belonging to the lineage B.1.258, which has been circulating in\nCentral Europe since August 2020, long before the import of B.1.1.7.\nPhylogenetic analysis shows that the early sublineage of B.1.258 acquired the\nN439K substitution in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein\nand, later on, also the deletion $\\Delta$H69/$\\Delta$V70 in the Spike\nN-terminal domain (NTD).
