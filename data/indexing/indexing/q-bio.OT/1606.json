This variability in body dimensions (called\n\"anthropometry\") is involved in design tools commonly used today to assess\nuser's accommodation (physical mock-ups, population models, database, boundary\nmanikins, hybrid methods or digital human modeling). Databases are created from\ncampaigns of measurement. Besides the fact that such measures are costly in\ntime and money, they give more \"static\" measures of man. They do not take into\naccount possible stretching limbs that could allow increased accessibility.\nThis paper presents a methodology for human body modeling, in a dynamic way,\nnot static. The methodology allows to highlight influences of design and human\nbehaviour on reach skills, directly induced by the interaction with real\nprototypes and not just considered by human physical dimensions. The first part\nof the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip\nbreadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed. The\naccessibility field is determined purely numerically. In parallel, an\nexperiment is set up to measure the extension of the accessibility field, with\nthe same people. A comparison of the results is then performed and a new model\nof the human body is proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 13:34:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Delangle", "Mathieu", ""], ["Poirson", "\u00c9milie", ""], ["Petiot", "Jean Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03620", "submitter": "Ben Shirt-Ediss", "authors": "Benjamin John Shirt-Ediss", "title": "Modelling Early Transitions Toward Autonomous Protocells", "comments": "205 Pages, 27 Figures, PhD Thesis Defended Feb 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  This thesis broadly concerns the origins of life problem, pursuing a joint\napproach that combines general philosophical/conceptual reflection on the\nproblem along with more detailed and formal scientific modelling work oriented\nin the conceptual perspective developed.

Sea shells are made up of CaCO3 mainly in the aragonite form, which\nare columnar or fibrous or microsphere structured crystals. The bioactivity of\nnanoparticles of sea shell has been studied in this work. The sea shells\ncollected were thoroughly washed, dried and pulverized. The powder was sieved\nand particles in the range of 45 to 63 microns were collected. The powdered sea\nshells were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction and Field Emission Scanning\nElectron Microscopy. The XRD data showed that the particles were mainly\nmicrospheres. Traces of calcite and vaterite were also present. Experiments\nwere conducted to study the aspirin and strontium ranelate drug loading into\nthe sea shell powder using soak and dry method. Different concentrations of\ndrug solution was made in ethanol and water. The shell powder was soaked in\ndrug solutions and was kept soaking for 48 hrs with intermittent\nultrasonication. The mixture was gently dried in a vacuum oven. The in vitro\ndrug release studies were done using Phosphate Buffered Saline. The FESEM\nimages displayed a distribution of differently sized and shaped particles. The\nsea shells due to its natural porosity and crystallinity are expected to be\nuseful for drug delivery. About 50% drug entrapment efficiency for aspirin and\n39% for strontium ranelate was seen. A burst release of the drug (80 percent)\nwas observed within two hours for both the drugs studied. Rest of the drug was\nreleased slowly in 19 hrs. Further modification of the sea shell with non toxic\npolymers is also planned as a part of this work. Sea shell powder has become a\npotential candidate for drug delivery due to all the aforementioned advantages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 13:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sali", "Sonali S.", ""]]}]
