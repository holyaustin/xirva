Currently,\nthere is insufficient scientific data, which represents the arrangement of\namino acid in the proteins based on atomic composition. Our deep observational\nand analytical studies indicate that the distribution of carbon in the protein\nsequence can bring differences in the function of proteins. Until now, it is\nbelieved that carbon content elicits the hydrophobic interactions in proteins.\nThis distinct feature classifies normal proteins and viral proteins based on\nthe carbon content. One of the objectives of this investigation is to show the\nsignificance of carbon composition in protein structure evaluation. Since, the\nlevel of perceived benefit is likely to be high in the field of proteomics for\nstructural analysis, the position of this paper is to prioritize only the avian\nviral protein sequences based on carbon content when compared with the normal\nprotein sequences. Here, we present the evaluation of carbon along the avian\nprotein sequence in order to show the differences in the distribution of carbon\nusing the software technology. The evaluation results provide a deep view in to\nthe molecular structure of avian viral protein, which can further enable the\nprogress of research in the proteomics domain based on carbon classification.\nThis systematic approach in computing carbon level of avian viruses aim towards\nthe benefit of individual, regional and global health in addition to opening of\nfurther effective research on avian viral protein based on the aforementioned\nresults\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2011 04:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["A.", "Baby Jerald", ""], ["Nair", "T.
