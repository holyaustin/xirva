This has\nbeen utilized to enhance the contrast of the seizure signatures in depth EEG or\nECoG. We have actually taken normalized exponential of absolute value of single\nor double derivative of epileptic ECoG. Variance operation has been performed\nto automatically detect seizures. A novel method for determining the duration\nof seizure has also been proposed. Since all operations take only linear time,\nthe whole method is extremely fast. Seven novel parameters have been introduced\nwhose patient specific thresholding brings down the rate of false detection to\na bare minimum. Results of implementation on the ECoG data of four epileptic\npatients have been reported with an ROC curve analysis. High value of the area\nunder the ROC curve indicates excellent detection performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Nov 2009 18:47:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Majumdar", "Kaushik", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0344", "submitter": "Stefano  Allesina", "authors": "Stefano Allesina", "title": "Accelerating the pace of discovery by changing the peer review algorithm", "comments": "9 pages 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The number of scientific publications is constantly rising, increasing the\nstrain on the review process. The number of submissions is actually higher, as\neach manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the\ndeluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of\nmanuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The\nsituation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently,\nseveral editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating\nfor urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how\nto improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform\nexperiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly,\nrelatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a\nsimulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively\ntested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an\nagent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As\na proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in\nwhich authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which\njournals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things\nbeing equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently\nassociated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster,\nauthors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally\nutilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework\ncan be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an\nimprovement of how science is disseminated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 18:49:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Allesina", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.1672", "submitter": "Balaji Akula", "authors": "Balaji Akula, James Cusick", "title": "Biological Computing Fundamentals and Futures", "comments": "Introduction to Biological computing, 7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fields of computing and biology have begun to cross paths in new ways.
