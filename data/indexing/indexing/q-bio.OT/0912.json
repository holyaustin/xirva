To address the question\nof whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience\nhypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified\nversion of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this\napproach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the\nprobabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided\ndetermination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain\nemployed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the\nbrain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine\nwhether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to\nwithin any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the\nrelationship between the two. This may provide motivation for\ncross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2009 06:01:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Feb 2011 21:29:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 6 Aug 2011 00:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Vogelstein", "Joshua T.", ""], ["Vogelstein", "R.

Also, the critical\npressures needed to move the interface are measured and compared to theoretical\nresult. A second way to control the interface motion is by ultrasonic\nexcitation. When the excitation is weak, the interface exhibits traveling\nwaves, which follow a dispersion equation. At stronger ultrasonic levels,\nstanding waves appear on the interface, with frequencies that are half integer\nmultiple of the excitation frequency. An associated microstreaming flow field\nobserved in the vicinity of the interface is characterized.
