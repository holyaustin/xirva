Monod's necessity and chance, gives rise to an evolutionary process in\nDarwinian sense, in terms of discrete jumps among attractors, with punctuated\nequilibrium, spontaneous random \"mutations\" and \"adaptations\". On an\nevlutionary time scale it produces sustainable diversity among individuals in a\nhomogeneous population rather than convergence as usually predicted by a\ndeterministic dynamics. The emergent discrete states in such a system, i.e.,\nattractors, have natural robustness against both internal and external\nperturbations. Phenotypic states of a biological cell, a mesoscopic nonlinear\nstochastic open biochemical system, could be understood through such a\nperspective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 20:12:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 05:43:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.4289", "submitter": "Michael Hentrich", "authors": "Michael Hentrich", "title": "Health Matters: Human Organ Donations, Sales, and the Black Market", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper I explore the human organ procurement system. Which is better\nfor saving lives and limiting black market use, the present altruistic system\nof donations or a free and open sales market? I explain that there is a risk\nwith maintaining the present system, the altruistic vision, and that people may\ndie who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is\nno guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current\nsupply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to\ndiscussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to\nincrease organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and\nexplicit consent. Ultimately, I conclude that the altruistic donation system,\nbolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate\nfinancial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of\nits shortcomings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2012 23:54:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Mar 2012 00:13:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 00:46:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2012 18:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 19:35:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hentrich", "Michael", ""]]}]
