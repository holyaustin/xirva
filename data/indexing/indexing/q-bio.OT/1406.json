Positive and negative feedback are the\nexamples of how the idea to unite anatomical elements in the whole functional\nstructure was successfully used in practice to explain regulatory mechanisms in\nbiology and medicine. There are numerous examples of functional and metabolic\npathways which are not regulated by feedback loops and have a structure of\nreciprocal relationships. Expressed in the matrix form positive feedback,\nnegative feedback, and reciprocal links represent three basis elements of a Lie\nalgebra sl(2,R)of a special linear group SL(2,R). It is proposed that the\nmathematical group structure can be realized through the three regulatory\nelements playing a role of a functional basis of biologic systems. The\nstructure of the basis elements endows the space of biological variables with\nindefinite metric. Metric structure resembles Minkowski's space-time (+, -, -)\nmaking the carrier spaces of biologic variables and the space of\ntransformations inhomogeneous. It endows biologic systems with a rich\nfunctional structure, giving the regulatory elements special differentiating\nfeatures to form steady autonomous subsystems reducible to one-dimensional\ncomponents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 17:47:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Davydyan", "Garri", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.2730", "submitter": "Eric Chaisson", "authors": "Eric J.

All organized systems are subject to physical, biological or cultural\nevolution, which together comprise the grander interdisciplinary subject of\ncosmic evolution. This is global history greatly extended, big history with a\nscientific basis, and natural history broadly portrayed across 14 billion years\nof time. Such evolution writ large has significant potential to unify the\nnatural sciences into a holistic understanding of who we are and whence we\ncame. No new science (beyond frontier, non-equilibrium thermodynamics) is\nneeded to describe cosmic evolution's major milestones at a deep and empirical\nlevel. Quantitative models and experimental tests imply that a remarkable\nsimplicity underlies the emergence and growth of complexity for a wide spectrum\nof known and diverse systems.

In regions where the\nnatural light source, i.e. solar radiation, is not sufficient for growth\noptimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light\nsources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not\nvery efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable\nsolutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent\ndevelopments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new\nperspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of\nlight-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses\non the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the\ngreenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,\nwe show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost\nof vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy\nefficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate\nLEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant\nresponse to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study. However,\nmore detailed scientific studies are necessary to understand the effect of\ndifferent LED spectra on plants physiology. Technical innovations are required\nto design and realize an energy efficient light source with a spectrum tailored\nfor optimal plant growth in specific plant species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jun 2014 09:33:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Devesh", ""], ["Basu", "Chandrajit", ""], ["Meinhardt-Wollweber", "Merve", ""], ["Roth", "Bernhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.3051", "submitter": "Ronald Rousseau", "authors": "Xiaojun Hu and Ronald Rousseau", "title": "Synthetic biology: From a word to a world", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Synthetic biology is one of the battlefields where the main countries fight\nfor the supremacy in science.
