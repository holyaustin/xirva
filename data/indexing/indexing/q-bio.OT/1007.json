In the next part I introduce available\nexperiments and discuss their information con-tent. Namely, I show that light\nmicroscopy may be designed to give resolution com-parable to that of electron\nmicroscopy and that may be used for experiments using living cells. I show\navenues to objective analysis of cell behavior observation.

Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for\ncollective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while\nhigh-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to\nrelatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental\nframework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social\ninteractions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a\ndistributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the\ndynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three\nhigh-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in\ncommunity size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of\na characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association\nbetween the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting\nsuper-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining\nsuper-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking\nadvantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the\nmonitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way\nindividuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of\nsuper-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our\nunderstanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the\nspreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 15:35:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Colizza", "Vittoria", ""], ["Pinton", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Vespignani", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4523", "submitter": "Sanmay Das", "authors": "Teruhiko Yoneyama, Sanmay Das and Mukkai Krishnamoorthy", "title": "A Hybrid Model for Disease Spread and an Application to the SARS\n  Pandemic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and\nsocieties. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale\ndifference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed\nmicro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This\npaper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local\nspread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease\nbetween regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the\nspread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the\nspread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global\nspread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the\nlocal spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a\nsimulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available\ndata on population, population density, and traffic networks between different\nregions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global\ntraffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results\nshow that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly\nimprove the results of modeling disease spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 17:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Yoneyama", "Teruhiko", ""], ["Das", "Sanmay", ""], ["Krishnamoorthy", "Mukkai", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4529", "submitter": "Susana Iglesias-Groth", "authors": "Susana Iglesias-Groth, Franco Cataldo, Ornella Ursini, Arturo Manchado", "title": "Amino Acids in Comets and Meteorites: Stability under Gamma Radiation\n  and Preservation of Chirality", "comments": "20 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17526.x", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph astro-ph.EP q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Amino acids in solar system bodies may have played a key role in the\nchemistry that led to the origin of life on Earth. We present laboratory\nstudies testing the stability of amino acids against gamma radiation\nphotolysis. All the 20 chiral amino acids in the levo form used in the proteins\nof the current terrestrial biochemistry have been irradiated in the solid state\nwith gamma radiation to a dose of 3.2 MGy which is the dose equivalent to that\nderived by radionuclide decay in comets and asteroids in 1.05x109 years. For\neach amino acid the radiolysis degree and the radioracemization degree was\nmeasured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and by optical rotatory\ndispersion (ORD) spectroscopy. From these measurements a radiolysis rate\nconstant kdsc and a radioracemization rate constant krac have been determined\nfor each amino acid and extrapolated to a dose of 14 MGy which corresponds to\nthe expected total dose delivered by the natural radionuclides decay to all the\norganic molecules present in comets and asteroids in 4.6x109 years, the age of\nthe Solar System. It is shown that all the amino acids studied can survive a\nradiation dose of 14 MGy in significant quantity although part of them are lost\nin radiolytic processes. Similarly, also the radioracemization process\naccompanying the radiolysis does not extinguish the chirality. The knowledge of\nthe radiolysis and radioracemization rate constants may permit the calculation\nof the original concentration of the amino acids at the times of the formation\nof the Solar System starting from the concentration found today in carbonaceous\nchondrites. For some amino acids the concentration in the presolar nebula could\nhave been up to 6 times higher than currently observed in meteorites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 18:25:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Iglesias-Groth", "Susana", ""], ["Cataldo", "Franco", ""], ["Ursini", "Ornella", ""], ["Manchado", "Arturo", ""]]}]
