Each of the\nfour mRNA bases is assigned a unique 2-bit identifier, so that the 64 triplet\ncodons are each indexed by a 6-bit label. The ordering of the bits reflects the\nhierarchical organization manifested by the DNA replication/repair and tRNA\ntranslation systems. In this system, transition and transversion mutations are\nnaturally expressed as binary operations, and the severities of the different\npoint mutations can be analyzed. Using a principal component analysis, it is\nshown that the physicochemical properties of amino acids related to protein\nfolding also correlate with certain bit positions of their respective labels.\nThus, the likelihood for a point mutation to be conservative, and less likely\nto cause a change in protein functionality, can be estimated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2016 15:15:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:58:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Nemzer", "Louis R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02621", "submitter": "Bohdan Khomtchouk", "authors": "Bohdan B.

We will point out several important\nkey features that distinguish languages of the Lisp family from other\nprogramming languages and we will explain how these features can aid\nresearchers in becoming more productive and creating better code. We will also\nshow how these features make these languages ideal tools for artificial\nintelligence and machine learning applications. We will specifically stress the\nadvantages of domain-specific languages (DSL): languages which are specialized\nto a particular area and thus not only facilitate easier research problem\nformulation, but also aid in the establishment of standards and best\nprogramming practices as applied to the specific research field at hand. DSLs\nare particularly easy to build in Common Lisp, the most comprehensive Lisp\ndialect, which is commonly referred to as the \"programmable programming\nlanguage.\" We are convinced that Lisp grants programmers unprecedented power to\nbuild increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that may\nultimately transform machine learning and AI research in bioinformatics and\ncomputational biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 20:58:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 03:29:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Khomtchouk", "Bohdan B.", ""], ["Weitz", "Edmund", ""], ["Wahlestedt", "Claes", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.06305", "submitter": "Benjamin Pope", "authors": "Michael W.
