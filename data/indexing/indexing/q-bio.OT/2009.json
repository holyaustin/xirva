The basic principle is\nthat constituents of a complex organization can produce outputs whose \"volume\"\nshould precisely match the sum of external demand plus inputs absorbed by other\nconstituents to function. The solution typically requires a case-by-case\ninversion of large matrices, which provides little to no insight on the\nstructural features responsible for the hierarchical organization of resources.\nHere we show that -- under very general conditions -- the solution of the\ninput-output balance equation for open systems can be described by a universal\nmaster curve, which is characterized analytically in terms of simple \"mass\ndefect\" parameters -- for instance, the fraction of resources wasted by each\nspecies of an ecosystem into the external environment. Our result follows from\na stochastic formulation of the interaction matrix between constituents: using\nthe replica method from the physics of disordered systems, the average (or\ntypical) value of the rankings of a generic hierarchy can be computed, whose\nleading order is shown to be largely independent of the precise details of the\nsystem under scrutiny. We test our predictions on systems as diverse as the WWW\nPageRank, trophic levels of generative models of ecosystems, input-output\ntables of large economies, and centrality measures of Facebook pages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 10:16:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:18:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2020 10:16:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bartolucci", "Silvia", ""], ["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Caravelli", "Francesco", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06499", "submitter": "Janusz Petkowski", "authors": "William Bains, Janusz J.

We thoroughly explore\nthe potential pathways of formation of phosphine in a Venusian environment,\nincluding in the planet's atmosphere, cloud and haze layers, surface, and\nsubsurface. We investigate gas reactions, geochemical reactions,\nphotochemistry, and other non-equilibrium processes. None of these potential\nphosphine production pathways are sufficient to explain the presence of ppb\nphosphine levels on Venus. If PH3's presence in Venus' atmosphere is confirmed,\nit therefore is highly likely to be the result of a process not previously\nconsidered plausible for Venusian conditions. The process could be unknown\ngeochemistry, photochemistry, or even aerial microbial life, given that on\nEarth phosphine is exclusively associated with anthropogenic and biological\nsources. The detection of phosphine adds to the complexity of chemical\nprocesses in the Venusian environment and motivates in situ follow up sampling\nmissions to Venus.

For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we\nhave calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length,\nand its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the\nclassification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes\nspanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In\ncertain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well\ncalling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the\nclassification.

Identifying intermediate host\nspecies is critical to understanding the evolution and transmission mechanisms\nof COVID-19. However, determining which animals are intermediate hosts remains\na key challenge. Virus host-genome similarity (HGS) is an important factor that\nreflects the adaptability of virus to host. SARS-CoV-2 may retain beneficial\nmutations to increase HGS and evade the host immune system. This study\ninvestigated the HGSs between 399 SARS-CoV-2 strains and 10 hosts of different\nspecies, including bat, mouse, cat, swine, snake, dog, pangolin, chicken, human\nand monkey. The results showed that the HGS between SARS-CoV-2 and bat was the\nhighest, followed by mouse and cat. Human and monkey had the lowest HGS values.\nIn terms of genetic similarity, mouse and monkey are halfway between bat and\nhuman. Moreover, given that COVID-19 outbreaks tend to be associated with live\npoultry and seafood markets, mouse and cat are more likely sources of infection\nin these places. However, more experimental data are needed to confirm whether\nmouse and cat are true intermediate hosts. These findings suggest that animals\nclosely related to human life, especially those with high HGS, need to be\nclosely monitored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2020 10:23:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tao", "Daniel H.", ""], ["Sun", "Weitao", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.10646", "submitter": "Maxim Olshanskii", "authors": "Alexander Danilov, Yushui Han, Chun H.
