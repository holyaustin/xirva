Therapeutic knowledge and drug\nmechanism play a crucial role in determining the strategy and defining the\nestimand for clinical trial designs. Clinical trials in patients with\nhematological malignancies often present unique challenges for trial design due\nto complexity of treatment options and existence of potential curative but\nhighly risky procedures, e.g. stem cell transplant or treatment sequence across\ndifferent phases (induction, consolidation, maintenance). Here, we illustrate\nhow to apply the estimand framework in hematological clinical trials and how\nthe estimand framework can address potential difficulties in trial result\ninterpretation.\n  This paper is a result of a cross-industry collaboration to connect the\nInternational Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 addendum concepts to\napplications. Three randomized phase 3 trials will be used to consider common\nchallenges including intercurrent events in hematologic oncology trials to\nillustrate different scientific questions and the consequences of the estimand\nchoice for trial design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.\nTemplate language for describing estimand in both study protocols and\nstatistical analysis plans is suggested for statisticians' reference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 15:38:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Steven", ""], ["Weber", "Hans-Jochen", ""], ["Butler", "Emily", ""], ["Rufibach", "Kaspar", ""], ["Roychoudhury", "Satrajit", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.10107", "submitter": "Jason Swedlow", "authors": "Jason R.

Janus kinase enzymes of Jak-1, Jak-2,\nJak-3, and Tyk2 seem to be good targets for inhibition by medications to\ncontrol cytokine storm in this context. In the present work, the inhibitory\nproperties of different analgesic drugs on these targets are studied to assess\ntheir ability for clinical application from different points of view. Our\ndocking results indicated that naproxen, methadone, and amitriptyline\nconsidering their higher binding energy, lower energy variance, and higher\nhydrophobicity, seem to express more inhibitory effects on Janus kinase enzymes\nthan thats for approved inhibitors i.e. baricitinib and ruxolitinib.\nAccordingly, we suggest our wide list of candidate drugs including\nindomethacin, etodolac, buprenorphine, rofecoxib, duloxetine, valdecoxib,\nnaproxen, methadone, and amitriptilin for clinical assessments for their\nusefulness in COVID-19 treatment, especially taking into account that up to\nnow, there is no approved cure for this disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2020 13:09:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Dayer", "Mohammad Reza", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16154", "submitter": "Musa Mhlanga", "authors": "Partha P.
