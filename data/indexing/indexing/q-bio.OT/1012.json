The solution is to make use of so-called thermals, which are localized,\nwarmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the\ndescent rate of birds and planes. Saving energy by exploiting the environment\nmore efficiently is an important possibility for autonomous UAVs as well.\nSuccessful control strategies have been developed recently for UAVs in\nsimulations and in real applications. This paper first presents an overview of\nour knowledge of the soaring flight and strategy of birds, followed by a\ndiscussion of control strategies that have been developed for soaring UAVs both\nin simulations and applications on real platforms. To improve the accuracy of\nsimulation of thermal exploitation strategies we propose a method to take into\naccount the effect of turbulence. Finally we propose a new GPS independent\ncontrol strategy for exploiting thermal updraft.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Dec 2010 14:42:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["\u00c1kos", "Zsuzsa", ""], ["Nagy", "M\u00e1t\u00e9", ""], ["Leven", "Severin", ""], ["Vicsek", "Tam\u00e1s", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1620", "submitter": "Adrian Paschke", "authors": "Maria R\\\"uther, Thomas Bandholtz, Antoine Logean", "title": "Linked Environment Data for the Life Sciences", "comments": "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.

The\nemergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing\npresence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and\nveterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention\nshould be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a\nnew compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential\nequations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter\ndriven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted\ncontact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions\nand the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for\neach set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among\nregions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not\nonly treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated\ninto the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data\nfrom the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the\nepidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive\nset of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for\naccurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the\nworld. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model\ndifferentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different\nprovinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the\noutbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction\nnumber is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction\nnumber are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 04:38:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2011 03:16:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2012 15:29:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xue", "Ling", ""], ["Scott", "H.
