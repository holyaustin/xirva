Biological entities undoubtedly obey\nthe laws of quantum physics and statistical mechanics. However, is modern\nphysics sufficient to adequately describe, model and explain the evolution of\nbiological complexity? Detailed parallels have been drawn between statistical\nthermodynamics and the population-genetic theory of biological evolution. Based\non these parallels, we outline new perspectives on biological innovation and\nmajor transitions in evolution, and introduce a biological equivalent of\nthermodynamic potential that reflects the innovation propensity of an evolving\npopulation. Deep analogies have been suggested to also exist between the\nproperties of biological entities and processes, and those of frustrated states\nin physics, such as glasses. We extend such analogies by examining\nfrustration-type phenomena, such as conflicts between different levels of\nselection, in biological evolution. We further address evolution in\nmultidimensional fitness landscapes from the point of view of percolation\ntheory and suggest that percolation at level above the critical threshold\ndictates the tree-like evolution of complex organisms. Taken together, these\nmultiple connections between fundamental processes in physics and biology imply\nthat construction of a meaningful physical theory of biological evolution might\nnot be a futile effort.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 13:09:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Feb 2018 12:52:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Katsnelson", "Mikhail I.", ""], ["Wolf", "Yuri I.", ""], ["Koonin", "Eugene V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.01712", "submitter": "Les Hatton", "authors": "Les Hatton, Gregory Warr", "title": "Information Theory and the Length Distribution of all Discrete Systems", "comments": "70 pages, 53 figures, inc. 30 pages of Appendices", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT cs.IT math.IT physics.bio-ph physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We begin with the extraordinary observation that the length distribution of\n80 million proteins in UniProt, the Universal Protein Resource, measured in\namino acids, is qualitatively identical to the length distribution of large\ncollections of computer functions measured in programming language tokens, at\nall scales. That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural\nproperties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might\nshare the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.\n  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components\nbuilt from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the\nConservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical\nmechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous\nand homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique\nalphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp\nunimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain\ncomponents each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and\nyield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.\n  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer\nsoftware, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the\nelements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour\nco-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts). In\neach case, the predictions of the theory are tested and supported to high\nlevels of statistical significance. We also show that in the same heterogeneous\nsystem, different but consistent alphabets must be related by a power-law. We\ndemonstrate this on a large body of music by excluding and including note\nduration in the definition of the unique alphabet of notes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 08:23:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hatton", "Les", ""], ["Warr", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.04943", "submitter": "Sergey Petoukhov", "authors": "Sergey Petoukhov", "title": "The rules of long DNA-sequences and tetra-groups of oligonucleotides", "comments": "174 pages, 155 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The article represents a new class of hidden symmetries in long sequences of\noligonucleotides of single stranded DNA from their representative set.

These new symmetries and their rules concern collective probabilities\nof oligonucleotides from special tetra-groups and their subgroups in long\nDNA-texts including complete sets of chromosomes of human and some model\norganisms. These rules of tetra-group probabilities are considered as possible\ncandidacies for the role of universal rules of long DNA-sequences.

In this model, nitrogenous bases C, T, G,\nA of DNA are represented as computational basis states of 2-qubit quantum\nCTGA-systems.

To this end we performed experiments and validated the results on (1) a\nvery large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different\ntopologies, and (3) biological networks from a widely studied and validated\ngenetic network (e.coli) as well as on a significant number of differentiating\n(Th17) and differentiated human cells from high quality databases (Harvard's\nCellNet) with results conforming to experimentally validated biological data.\nBased on these results we introduce a conceptual framework, a model-based\ninterventional calculus and a reprogrammability measure with which to steer,\nmanipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics of non- linear dynamical systems from\npartial and disordered observations. The method consists in finding and\napplying a series of controlled interventions to a dynamical system to estimate\nhow its algorithmic information content is affected when every one of its\nelements are perturbed. The approach represents an alternative to numerical\nsimulation and statistical approaches for inferring causal\nmechanistic/generative models and finding first principles. We demonstrate the\nframework's capabilities by reconstructing the phase space of some discrete\ndynamical systems (cellular automata) as case study and reconstructing their\ngenerating rules.

During the last ten years the problem of the\norigin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many\nauthors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the\nproblem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second\npresents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded\non the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in\nthe third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum\norigin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two\nof which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and\nbiosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and\nexperimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main\nresearch themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a\nphysicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life\nwhile the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the\nessence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the\nInformation Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life\nthrough replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is\nfundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum\ncomputation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto\nreplicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence\nof quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve\nthe question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put\nforward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in\nthe origin of genetic language.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 11:34:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Quemada", "Juan Campos", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06562", "submitter": "Juan Campos Quemada", "authors": "Juan Campos Quemada", "title": "The epistemological status of Astrobiology: a problematic case of\n  integration of scientific disciplines", "comments": "22 pages, bibliography, Spanish. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1709.05971", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Astrobiology is a scientific discipline that studies life in the Universe.
