Cellulose-coated magnetic\nnanoparticles with covalently immobilized thermostable {\\alpha}-amylase and\nchitosan particles with immobilized glucoamylase were also prepared. The\nimmobilized cells and enzymes were applied in column reactors - 1/for\nsimultaneous corn starch saccharification with the immobilized glucoamylase and\nproduction of ethanol with the entrapped or covalently immobilized yeast cells,\n2/ for separate ethanol fermentation of the starch hydrolysates with the fixed\nyeasts. Hydrolysis of corn starch with the immobilized {\\alpha}-amylase and\nglucoamylase, and separate hydrolysis with the immobilized {\\alpha}-amylase\nwere also examined. In the first reactor the ethanol yield reached approx. 91%\nof the theoretical; the yield was approx. 86% in the second. The ethanol\nfermentation was affected by the type of immobilization, the initial particle\nloading, feed sugar concentration and the dilution rate. The ethanol\nproductivity with entrapped cells reached 264.0 g/L.h at particle loading rate\n70% and dilution rate 3.0 h-1 with reducing sugar concentration of 200.0 g/L.\nThe prepared magnetic particles with fixed yeast cells were stable at 4oC in\nsaline for more than 1 month. .\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2011 16:03:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ivanova", "Viara", ""], ["Petrova", "Petia", ""], ["Hristov", "Jordan", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1424", "submitter": "Maurice Margenstern", "authors": "Maurice Margenstern and Pascal Mayer and Sergey Verlan", "title": "DNA Circuits Based on Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA\n  Amplification", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension\nDNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining\nthe advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement\namplification (SDA).
