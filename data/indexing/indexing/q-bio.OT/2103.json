It has\nbeen applied to wide applications, including the measure of the severity of the\ninfection, the estimation of the number of infected cases, risk assessment etc.\nHowever, there remains a lack of understanding on several aspects of CFR,\nincluding population factors that are important to CFR, the apparent\ndiscrepancy of CFRs in different countries, and how the age effect comes into\nplay. We analyze the CFRs at two different time snapshots, July 6 and Dec 28,\n2020, with one during the first wave and the other a second wave of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. We consider two important population covariates, age and GDP\nas a proxy for the quality and abundance of public health. Extensive\nexploratory data analysis leads to some interesting findings. First, there is a\nclear exponential age effect among different age groups, and, more importantly,\nthe exponential index is almost invariant across countries and time in the\npandemic. Second, the roles played by the age and GDP are a little surprising:\nduring the first wave, age is a more significant factor than GDP, while their\nroles have switched during the second wave of the pandemic, which may be\npartially explained by the delay in time for the quality and abundance of\npublic health and medical research to factor in.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Mar 2021 21:09:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Donghui", ""], ["Chen", "Aiyou", ""], ["Yang", "Buqing", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.01959", "submitter": "Alexander Gorban", "authors": "A.N.

Cannon in\nhis \"The wisdom of the body\" (1932) used the engineering vision of regulation.\nIn 1938, Selye enriched this approach by the notion of adaptation energy. This\nterm causes much debate when one takes it literally, i.e. as a sort of energy.\nSelye did not use the language of mathematics, but the formalization of his\nphenomenological theory in the spirit of thermodynamics was simple and led to\nverifiable predictions. In 1980s, the dynamics of correlation and variance in\nsystems under adaptation to a load of environmental factors were studied and\nthe universal effect in ensembles of systems under a load of similar factors\nwas discovered: in a crisis, as a rule, even before the onset of obvious\nsymptoms of stress, the correlation increases together with variance (and\nvolatility). During 30 years, this effect has been supported by many\nobservations of groups of humans, mice, trees, grassy plants, and on financial\ntime series. In the last ten years, these results were supplemented by many new\nexperiments, from gene networks in cardiology and oncology to dynamics of\ndepression and clinical psychotherapy. Several systems of models were\ndeveloped: the thermodynamic-like theory of adaptation of ensembles and several\nfamilies of models of individual adaptation. Historically, the first group of\nmodels was based on Selye's concept of adaptation energy and used fitness\nestimates. Two other groups of models are based on the idea of hidden attractor\nbifurcation and on the advection--diffusion model for distribution of\npopulation in the space of physiological attributes. We explore this world of\nmodels and experiments, starting with classic works, with particular attention\nto the results of the last ten years and open questions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2021 18:04:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Mar 2021 02:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Gorban", "A.

While no impact is evidenced on germination\nrates (caping nearly at 100% with/without plasma exposure), seeds vigor is\nclearly improved with a median germination time decreasing from 1850 min (31h)\nto 1500 min (26 h), hence representing a time saving of at least 5 hours. We\nshow that the admixture of nitrogen to helium can further increase this time\nsaving up to 8 hours. Contrarily, we demonstrate that the addition of molecular\noxygen to the helium discharge does not promote seeds vigor. Whatever the\nplasma chemistry utilized, these biological effects are accompanied with strong\nhydrophilization of the seed coating (with a decrease in contact angles from\n118{\\deg} to 25{\\deg}) as well as increased water absorption (water uptakes\nmeasured 8 hours after imbibition are close to 50% for plasma-treated seeds\ninstead of 37% for seeds from the control group). A follow-up of the seeds over\na 45-days ageing period shows the sustainability of the plasma-triggered\nbiological effects: whatever the plasma treatment, seeds vigor remains stable\nand much higher than for seeds unexposed to plasma). For these reasons, the\nseed-packed dielectric barrier device (SP-DBD) supplied with a He-N2 gas\nmixture can be considered as a relevant dry atmospheric priming plasma (DAPP)\nin the same way as those used in routine by seed companies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2021 10:55:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dufour", "T.", ""], ["Gutierrez", "Q.", ""], ["Bailly", "C.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.09614", "submitter": "David N.
