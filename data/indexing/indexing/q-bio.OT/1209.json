Physics education researchers have\ninvestigated student problem solving for the last three decades. Although\nphysics and biology problems differ in structure and content, the instructional\npurposes align closely: explaining patterns and processes in the natural world\nand making predictions about physical and biological systems. In this paper, we\ndiscuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education\nresearchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving\nskills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically\nasked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the\ndevelopment of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills\nin problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems\nrequires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use\nin representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and\nverifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help\nbiology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how\nbiology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms\nand inspire new studies in biology education research.\n  (To appear in Cell Biology Education - Life Sciences Education)\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 19:25:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 19:57:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:54:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hoskinson", "Anne-Marie", ""], ["Caballero", "Marcos D.", ""], ["Knight", "Jennifer K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1467", "submitter": "Quang-Cuong Pham", "authors": "Quang-Cuong Pham and Daniel Bennequin", "title": "Affine invariance of human hand movements: a direct test", "comments": "23 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Geometrical invariance, in particular affine invariance, has been recently\nproposed as an important principle underlying the production of hand movements.\nHowever, tests of affine invariance have traditionally been applied to the\nconsequences of this principle rather to the principle itself. Here, we\ndesigned and performed an original, direct, test of affine invariance in a\nscribbling experiment. In each of the 10800 pairs of randomly-selected\nscribbling segments, we compared the time parameterizations obtained by\ntransforming the first segment using four different transportation rules -\naffine, equi-affine, Euclidian and constant - with the experimentally-observed\nparameterization of the second segment. We observed that, when the two paths\nare affinely-similar, the affine transportation of the first segment yields the\ntime parameterization that best matches the experimental parameterization of\nthe second segment, which directly demonstrates the existence of affine\ninvariance in the production of hand movements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2012 09:13:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Pham", "Quang-Cuong", ""], ["Bennequin", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4113", "submitter": "Robert Finkel", "authors": "Robert W.

Here\nwe model a quantum process in cells based on coherent waves of established\nultrafast energy transfers in water.

The\nmodel is compared with observations and diverse numerical applications lend\nsupport to the hypothesis that rapid energy transfers in water are\ncharacteristic of living cells. Close agreements are found for the dipole\nmoment of water dimers, microwave radiation on yeast, and the Kleiber law of\nmetabolic rates.
