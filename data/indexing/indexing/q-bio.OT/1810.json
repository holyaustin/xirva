Current protein-sugar\ncomputational models are based, at least partially, on prior biochemical\nfindings and knowledge. They incorporate different parts of these findings in\npredictive black-box models. We investigate the empirical support for\nbiochemical findings by comparing Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) induced\nrules to actual biochemical results. We mine the Protein Data Bank for a\nrepresentative data set of hexose binding sites, non-hexose binding sites and\nsurface grooves. We build an ILP model of hexose-binding sites and evaluate our\nresults against several baseline machine learning classifiers. Our method\nachieves an accuracy similar to that of other black-box classifiers while\nproviding insight into the discriminating process. In addition, it confirms\nwet-lab findings and reveals a previously unreported Trp-Glu amino acids\ndependency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 19:59:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Nassif", "Houssam", ""], ["Al-Ali", "Hassan", ""], ["Khuri", "Sawsan", ""], ["Keirouz", "Walid", ""], ["Page", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.04796", "submitter": "Johan Nygren", "authors": "Johan Nygren", "title": "Hominin evolution was caused by introgression from Gorilla", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1808.06307", "journal-ref": "Natural Science Vol.10 No.09(2018), Article ID:87215, 9 pages", "doi": "10.4236/ns.2018.109033", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The discovery of Paranthropus deyiremeda in 3.3-3.5 million year old fossil\nsites in Afar, together with 30% of the gorilla genome showing lineage sorting\nbetween humans and chimpanzees, and a NUMT (\"nuclear mitochondrial DNA\nsegment\") on chromosome 5 that is shared by both gorillas, humans and\nchimpanzees, and shown to have diverged at the time of the Pan-Homo split\nrather than the Gorilla/Pan-Homo split, provides conclusive evidence that\nintrogression from the gorilla lineage caused the Pan-Homo split, and the\nspeciation of both the Australopithecus lineage and the Paranthropus lineage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 22:35:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Nygren", "Johan", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.08614", "submitter": "Les Hatton", "authors": "Les Hatton, Gregory Warr", "title": "CoHSI III: Long proteins and implications for protein evolution", "comments": "20 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 37 references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The length distribution of proteins measured in amino acids follows the CoHSI\n(Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) probability distribution. In\nprevious papers we have verified various predictions of this using the Uniprot\ndatabase but here we explore a novel predicted relationship between the longest\nproteins and evolutionary time. We demonstrate from both theory and experiment\nthat the longest protein and the total number of proteins are intimately\nrelated by Information Theory and we give a simple formula for this. We stress\nthat no evolutionary explanation is necessary; it is an intrinsic property of a\nCoHSI system. While the CoHSI distribution favors the appearance of proteins\nwith fewer than 750 amino acids (characteristic of most functional proteins or\ntheir constituent domains) its intrinsic asymptotic power-law also favors the\nappearance of unusually long proteins; we predict that there are as yet\nundiscovered proteins longer than 45,000 amino acids. In so doing, we draw an\nanalogy between the process of protein folding driven by favorable pathways (or\nfunnels) through the energy landscape of protein conformations, and the\npreferential information pathways through which CoHSI exerts its constraints in\ndiscrete systems.\n  Finally, we show that CoHSI predicts the recent appearance in evolutionary\ntime of the longest proteins, specifically in eukaryotes because of their\nricher unique alphabet of amino acids, and by merging with independent\nphylogenetic data, we confirm a predicted consistent relationship between the\nlongest proteins and documented and potential undocumented mass extinctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2018 15:33:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hatton", "Les", ""], ["Warr", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10389", "submitter": "Marko Popovic", "authors": "Marko Popovic", "title": "Wanted Dead or Alive Extraterrestrial Life Forms (Thermodynamic\n  criterion for life is a growing open system that performs self-assembly\n  processes)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For more than 100 years, humanity (both specialists and enthusiastic laics)\nhas been searching for extraterrestrial life hoping we are not alone. The first\nstep in the quest for extraterrestrial life is to define what and where exactly\nto look for. Thus, the basic definition of living matter is a conditio sine qua\nnon for the quest. The diversity of species on Earth is so large that our quest\nfor extraterrestrial life cannot be limited to forms and shapes present and\nknown to us from our environment. However, there are two formal conditions that\nmust be fulfilled in order for something to be assumed as living matter. First,\nit should represent a growing open thermodynamic system (in biological terms -\na cell), and thus be a system out of equilibrium. Second, it must perform\nsynthesis, self-assembly and accumulation processes (in biological terms to\ngrow, maintain homeostasis, respond to environment, reproduce, exchange matter\nand energy, evolve). Populated planets are consisted of two components:\nbiosphere and its environment (geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere). Living\nmatter and its environment are out of equilibrium. Thus, the candidate planets\nare dynamic inhomogeneous systems for two reasons. First, a planet receives\nenergy from its star, which leads to disequilibrium for external reasons.\nAnimate matter contributes to disequilibrium for internal reasons: accumulation\nof matter and self-assembly. In practice, for a screening, an astrobiologist\nshould search for increase in inhomogeneity on a candidate planet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:37:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Popovic", "Marko", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.11737", "submitter": "Dante Chialvo", "authors": "Dante R.
