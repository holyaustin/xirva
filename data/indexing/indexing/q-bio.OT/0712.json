The detailed knowledge of this code\ncontrasts the ignorance of the fiber structure which it regulates, and none of\nthe suggested fiber models are capable of predicting the most basic quantities\nof the fiber (diameter, nucleosome line density, etc.). We address this\nthree-decade-old problem by constructing a simple geometrical model based on\nthe nucleosome shape alone. Without fit parameters we predict the observed\nproperties of the condensed chromatin fiber (e.g. its 30 nm diameter), the\nstructure, and how the fiber changes with varying nucleosome repeat length. Our\napproach further puts the plethora of previously suggested models within a\ncoherent framework, and opens the door to detailed studies of the interplay\nbetween chromatin structure and function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2007 15:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Depken", "Martin", ""], ["Schiessel", "Helmut", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.1380", "submitter": "Daniel T Schmitt", "authors": "Daniel T.
