It\naccounts for most of the heterotrophic soil respiration and results in\nformation of more stable soil organic carbon (SOC) which is the largest\nterrestrial carbon stock. Litter decomposition may induce remarkable feedbacks\nto climate change because it is a climate-dependent process. To investigate the\nglobal patterns of litter decomposition, we developed a description of this\nprocess and tested the validity of this description using a large set of foliar\nlitter mass loss measurements (nearly 10 000 data points derived from\napproximately 70 000 litter bags). We applied the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethod to estimate uncertainty in the parameter values and results of our model\ncalled Yasso07. The model appeared globally applicable. It estimated the\neffects of litter type (plant species) and climate on mass loss with little\nsystematic error over the first 10 decomposition years, using only initial\nlitter chemistry, air temperature and precipitation as input variables.\nIllustrative of the global variability in litter mass loss rates, our example\ncalculations showed that a typical conifer litter had 68% of its initial mass\nstill remaining after two decomposition years in tundra while a deciduous\nlitter had only 15% remaining in the tropics. Uncertainty in these estimates, a\ndirect result of the uncertainty of the parameter values of the model, varied\naccording to the distribution of the litter bag data among climate conditions\nand ranged from 2% in tundra to 4% in the tropics. This reliability was\nadequate to use the model and distinguish the effects of even small differences\nin litter quality or climate conditions on litter decomposition as\nstatistically significant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 11:35:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tuomi", "M.", ""], ["Thum", "T.", ""], ["J\u00e4rvinen", "H.", ""], ["Fronzek", "S.", ""], ["Berg", "B.", ""], ["Harmon", "M.", ""], ["Trofymow", "J.

We deduce an integral equation for the\nage-dependent force of infection, which depends on a number of parameters that\ncan be estimated from the force of infection in steady state prior to the\nvaccination program. We present the results of our simulations, which are\ncompared with observed data. We also examine the influence of contact patterns\namong members of a community on the age-dependent intensity of transmission of\nrubella and on the results of vaccination strategies. As an example of the\ntheory proposed, we calculate the effects of vaccination strategies for four\ncommunities from Caieiras (Brazil), Huixquilucan (Mexico), Finland and the\nUnited Kingdom. The results for each community differ considerably according to\nthe distinct intensity and pattern of transmission in the absence of\nvaccination. We conclude that this simple vaccination program is not very\nefficient (very slow) in the goal of eradicating the disease. This gives\nsupport to a mixed strategy, proposed by Massad et al., accepted and\nimplemented by the government of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 14:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Amaku", "M.", ""], ["Coutinho", "F.

At the micro level the\nsystem is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid\nfoundation through breakable springs. Such system can be viewed as prototypical\nfor the description of a wide range of phenomena from peeling of polymeric\ntapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and\ndenaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete\nmodel which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a\ndetailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive\ninteractions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed\nabrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a\nsudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As\nthe microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from\nquasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the\nadhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a\n`localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We\nobtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit\nwhen the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.\nThe achieved parametric control of the microscopic mechanism can be used in the\ndesign of new biological inspired adhesion devices and machines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2009 12:19:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Maddalena", "F.", ""], ["Percivale", "D.", ""], ["Puglisi", "G.", ""], ["Truskinovsky", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3319", "submitter": "Joanna Pressley", "authors": "Erika M.
