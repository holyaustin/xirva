Next we define the concept of being a-p for i-indexed\nsequences of spin-1/2 particles: it turns out that a sequence of spin-1/2\nparticles is a-p if and only if the particles behave as if they had indeed been\nprepared (in the usual sense) to have definite spins +1 or -1 along the axis a,\nthe sequence of signs being pre-determined. The a-p property is formulated in a\nway abstract enough to let one generalize it and we define the concept of being\na-p and b-p. However, using our chosen Boole inequality we prove that no\nparticle sequence can be both a-p and b-p when a and b are not co-linear. We\nnext consider two modifications of Quantum Mechanics:\n  - The first one by assuming both Weak Realism, the weakest form of Realism\nneeded to develop any main theorem in Bell's Theory, and Locality. - The second\none by assuming Weak Realism and an hypothesis that turns out to be none else\nthan (relativistic) Causality extended to cover as well the observable values\nthat make sense only if one assumes Weak Realism. In both cases we arrive at\nthe conclusion that in the EPRB setting where successive pairs of spin-1/2\nparticles are prepared in the so-called singlet state, one of these particles\nsequences is both a-p and b-p and a and b are the opposite of the vectors\nrespectively used to project the spin of the other particle and to get the\nRealism-based alternate value for a projection.

The study of linear spectra provides us with the basis to\nunderstand the dynamical features arising from the vibronic structure in\nnon-linear spectra in a progressive fashion, starting from a microscopic model\nto finally performing an inhomogenous average.

Supported by analytical and numerical\ncalculations, we show that nondiagonal resonances in the 2D spectra in the\nwaiting time, further capture the discreteness of vibrations through a\nmodulation of the amplitude without any effect in the signal intrinsic\nfrequency. This fact generates a signal that is highly sensitive to\ncorrelations in the static disorder of the excitonic energy albeit protected\nagainst dephasing due to inhomogeneities of the vibrational ensemble.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 17:21:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 May 2012 14:12:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Caycedo-Soler", "Felipe", ""], ["Chin", "Alex W.", ""], ["Almeida", "Javier", ""], ["Huelga", "Susana F.", ""], ["Plenio", "Martin B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0172", "submitter": "Sergei Rakityansky", "authors": "S.

From a user's perspective, an ideal\namplifier has very low noise, operates over a broad frequency range, and has a\nhigh dynamic range - it is capable of handling strong signals with little\ndistortion. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these\ncharacteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer\nmulti-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise\nremains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of\nquantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers\nand are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power\nfrom a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely\nreactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the\nquantum-mechanical limit. Indeed, microwave frequency superconducting Josephson\nparametric amplifiers do approach the quantum limit, but generally are narrow\nband and have very limited dynamic range. In this paper, we describe a\nsuperconducting parametric amplifier that overcomes these limitations. The\namplifier is very simple, consisting only of a patterned metal film on a\ndielectric substrate, and relies on the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a\nsuperconducting transmission line. We measure gain extending over 2 GHz on\neither side of an 11.56 GHz pump tone, and we place an upper limit on the added\nnoise of the amplifier of 3.4 photons at 9.4 GHz.

This method, which we\nrecently proposed and demonstrated, consists of driving two\ntransversely-coupled quantum bits (qubits) with a driving field that is\nresonant with one of the two qubits. For specific relative amplitudes and\nphases of the driving field felt by the two qubits, one of the two transitions\nin the degenerate pair is darkened, or in other words, becomes forbidden by\neffective selection rules. At these driving conditions, the evolution of the\ntwo-qubit state realizes a CNOT gate. The gate speed is found to be limited\nonly by the coupling energy J, which is the fundamental speed limit for any\nentangling gate. Numerical simulations show that at gate speeds corresponding\nto 0.48J and 0.07J, the gate fidelity is 99% and 99.99%, respectively, and\nincreases further for lower gate speeds. In addition, the effect of\nhigher-lying energy levels and weak anharmonicity is studied, as well as the\nscalability of the method to systems of multiple qubits. We conclude that in\nall these respects this method is competitive with existing schemes for\ncreating entanglement, with the added advantages of being applicable for qubits\noperating at fixed frequencies (either by design or for exploitation of\ncoherence sweet-spots) and having the simplicity of microwave-only operation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 21:00:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 21:46:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["de Groot", "P.

This simple system displays a\nrich and complex behavior: as the core width is varied, this system is\ncharacterized by two peculiar transitions where, for different reasons, it\ndisplays characteristics similar to a few-particle quantum phase transition.\nThe first occurrence corresponds to something akin to a second order quantum\nphase transition, while the second transition is marked by a discontinuity,\nwith respect to the driving parameter, in the first derivatives of quantities\nlike energy and entanglement. The study of this system allows to shed light on\nthe sudden variation of entanglement and energy observed in S. Abdullah et al.\n[Phys. Rev. B 80, 235302 (2009)]. We also compare the core-shell system with a\nsystem where a core well is absent: this shows that, even when extremely\nnarrow, the core well has a relevant `pinning' effect. Interestingly, depending\non the potential symmetry, the pinning of the wavefunction may either halve or\ndouble the system entanglement (with respect to the no-core-well system) when\nthe ground state is already bounded to the outer (shell) well. In the process\nwe discuss the system fidelity and show the usefulness of considering the\nparticle density fidelity as opposed to the more commonly used -- but much more\ndifficult to access -- wavefunction fidelity.

Measurements were\nperformed using an atomic force microscope in a high vacuum chamber. The\nmeasurement system was calibrated electrostatically. Special analysis of the\nsystematic deviations is performed, and respective corrections in the\ncalibration parameters are introduced. The corrected parameters are free from\nanomalies discussed in the literature. The experimental data for the Casimir\nforce from two measurement sets for both untreated and UV-treated samples are\npresented. The experimental errors are determined at a 95% confidence level. It\nis demonstrated that the UV treatment of an I TO plate results in a significant\ndecrease in the magnitude of the Casimir force (from 21% to 35% depending on\nseparation). However, ellipsometry measurements of the imaginary parts of\ndielectric permittivities of the untreated and UV-treated samples did not\nreveal any significant differences. The experimental data are compared with\ncomputations in the framework of the Lifshitz theory. It is found that the data\nfor the untreated sample are in a very good agreement with theoretical results\ntaking into account the free charge carriers in an ITO film. For the UV-treated\nsample the data exclude the theoretical results obtained with account of free\ncharge carriers. These data are in a very good agreement with computations\ndisregarding the contribution of free carriers. According to the explanation\nprovided, this is caused by the phase transition of the ITO film from metallic\nto dielectric state caused by the UV treatment.

We also show how the antiferromagnetic RKKY interaction produces\nan effective decoupling of the impurities from the bulk already for\nintermediate strengths of this interaction, and, furthermore, exhibit how the\nnon-Fermi liquid quantum critical point is signaled in the quantum entanglement\nbetween various parts of the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 20:16:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2012 15:08:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bayat", "Abolfazl", ""], ["Bose", "Sougato", ""], ["Sodano", "Pasquale", ""], ["Johannesson", "Henrik", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6671", "submitter": "Alejandro Bermudez", "authors": "A.
