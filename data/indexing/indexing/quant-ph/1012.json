The signal and idler modes of this\nquantum state are found to be a superpositions of the electric and noise\npolarization fields.

The nonlinear\ninteraction with the noise polarization field were shown to cause an increase\nin the rate on the order of 10^{-12} for absorption of 10% per cm.

Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,\nthere is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality\nof free fall. We also show that frameworks in which atom interferometers would\ntest the redshift pose serious problems, such as (i) violation of the Schiff\nconjecture, (ii) violation of the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum\nmechanics and of the principle of least action for matter waves, (iii)\nviolation of energy conservation, and more generally (iv) violation of the\nparticle-wave duality in quantum mechanics.

This is illustrated by a family of models in which local\nstate spaces are regular polygons, where a natural analogue of a maximally\nentangled state of two systems exists. We characterize the nonlocal\ncorrelations obtainable from such states. The family allows us to study the\ntransition between classical, quantum, and super-quantum correlations, by\nvarying only the local state space. We show that the strength of nonlocal\ncorrelations - in particular whether the maximally entangled state violates\nTsirelson's bound or not - depends crucially on a simple geometric property of\nthe local state space, known as strong self-duality. This result is seen to be\na special case of a general theorem, which states that a broad class of\nentangled states in probabilistic theories - including, by extension, all\nbipartite classical and quantum states - cannot violate macroscopic locality.\nFinally, our results show that there exist models which are locally almost\nindistinguishable from quantum mechanics, but can nevertheless generate\nmaximally nonlocal correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Dec 2010 16:08:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 09:50:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 16:42:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Janotta", "Peter", ""], ["Gogolin", "Christian", ""], ["Barrett", "Jonathan", ""], ["Brunner", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1253", "submitter": "Yuri Khodorkovsky", "authors": "Yuri Khodorkovsky, Kenta Kitano, Hirokazu Hasegawa, Yasuhiro Ohshima,\n  and Ilya Sh.

Applications to several sets of data for gold films are presented to\ndemonstrate viability of the new dispersion formulae.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 15:35:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 13:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bimonte", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1548", "submitter": "Stuart Dowker", "authors": "J.S.Dowker", "title": "Entanglement entropy for odd spheres", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th gr-qc math.SP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is shown, non--rigorously, that the effective action on a Z_q factored odd\nspheres (lune) has a vanishing derivative at q=1.

We review the procedure as implemented in\nexperiments (Smith et al., PRL 97 180403 (2006)). We extend the protocol to the\nmore ambitious case of reconstruction of states in the full 16-dimensional\nelectronic-ground subspace (F=3 \\oplus F=4), controlled by microwaves and\nradio-frequency magnetic fields. We give detailed derivations of all physical\ninteractions, approximations, numerical methods, and fitting procedures,\ntailored to the realistic experimental setting. For the case of light-shift and\nmagnetic control, reconstruction fidelities of \\sim 0.95 have been achieved,\nlimited primarily by inhomogeneities in the light shift. For the case of\nmicrowave/RF-control we simulate fidelity >0.97, limited primarily by\nsignal-to-noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 21:33:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Riofr\u00edo", "Carlos A.", ""], ["Jessen", "Poul S.", ""], ["Deutsch", "Ivan H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.3481", "submitter": "M.

Alkali atoms appear as good candidates for\ninterferometric measurements but there are challenges to be overcome. The only\npractical way to generate a suitable E-field is to use the ac Stark effect\nwhich induces an instability of the dressed atom. Besides atom loss, this might\ninvalidate Berry's phase derivation but this latter problem can be solved by an\nappropriate detuning. The former puts an upper limit to the cycle duration,\nwhich is bounded below by the adiabatic condition. By relying upon our previous\nanalysis of the non-adiabatic corrections, we have been able to reach a\ncompromise for the $^{87}$Rb hf level F=2, m=0 state, which is our candidate\nfor an interferometric measurement of the exotic Berry's phase generated by a\nrotation of the E-field around the fixed B-field. By a numerical simulation we\nhave shown that the non-adiabatic corrections can be kept below the 0.1% level.\nAs an alternative candidate, we discuss the chromium ground state J=S=3, where\nthe instability problem is easily solved. We make a proposal to extend the\nmeasurement of Aharonov-Anandan's phase beyond S=1/2 to the $^{87}$Rb hf level\nF=m=1, by constructing, with the help of light-shifts, a Hamiltonian able to\nperform a parallel transport along a closed circuit upon the density matrix\nspace, without any adiabatic constraint.

A natural measure is the increase of payoff. We consider natural mappings\nbetween classical and quantum states, and study how well those mappings\npreserve the equilibrium properties. Among other results, we exhibit correlated\nequilibrium $p$ whose quantum superposition counterpart $\\sum_s\n\\sqrt{p(s)}\\ket{s}$ is far from being a quantum correlated equilibrium;\nactually a player can increase her payoff from almost 0 to almost 1 in a\n[0,1]-normalized game.

For studying the hardness of generating correlated equilibria, we propose\nto examine \\emph{correlation complexity}, a new complexity measure for\ncorrelation generation. We show that there are $n$-bit correlated equilibria\nwhich can be generated by only one EPR pair followed by local operation\n(without communication), but need at least $\\log(n)$ classical shared random\nbits plus communication.

An interferometer using N independent\nparticles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the \"standard quantum\nlimit\" (SQL) of sensitivity {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-1/2}. The same interferometer\nusing N entangled particles can achieve in principle the \"Heisenberg limit\"\n{\\delta}X \\propto N^{-1}, using exotic states. Recent theoretical work argues\nthat interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum\nmetrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a\nk-particle interaction will produce sensitivity {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-k} with\nappropriate entangled states and {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-(k-1/2)} even without\nentanglement. Here we demonstrate this \"super-Heisenberg\" scaling in a\nnonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetisation of an atomic\nensemble. We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise\nphoton-photon interaction (k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited\nperformance, to produce {\\delta}X \\propto N^{-3/2}. We observe super-Heisenberg\nscaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large N by higher-order\nnonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory. For a measurement of limited\nduration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake\nin sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons.\nIn other scenarios, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover\nfrom occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship of scaling to sensitivity in\nnonlinear systems. This work shows that inter-particle interactions can improve\nsensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and introduces a fundamentally\nnew resource for quantum metrology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Dec 2010 16:14:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Napolitano", "M.", ""], ["Koschorreck", "M.", ""], ["Dubost", "B.", ""], ["Behbood", "N.", ""], ["Sewell", "R.
