However, the energy shift due to dipole-dipole\ninteractions causing the blockade falls off rapidly with the interatomic\ndistance and protocols based on direct Rydberg blockade typically fail to\noperate between atoms separated by more than one lattice site. In this work, we\npropose an extension of the protocol of Jaksch \\emph{et al.}\\ for controlled-Z\nand controlled-NOT gates which works in the general case where the qubits are\nnot nearest-neighbor in the array. Our proposal relies on the Rydberg\nexcitation hopping along a chain of ancilla non-coding atoms connecting the\nqubits on which the gate is to be applied. The dependence of the gate fidelity\non the number of ancilla atoms, the blockade strength and the decay rates of\nthe Rydberg states is investigated. A comparison between our implementation of\ndistant controlled-NOT gate and one based on a sequence of nearest-neighbor\ntwo-qubit gates is also provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 09:00:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 13:08:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cesa", "A.", ""], ["Martin", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01783", "submitter": "Foroud Bemani", "authors": "F.

Consequently, we propose the monogamy power of\nan entanglement measure and the polygamy power for its dual quantity, the\nassisted entanglement, and show that both the monogamy power and the polygamy\npower exist in any multipartite systems with any dimension, from which we\nformalize exactly for the first time when an entanglement measure and an\nassisted entanglement obey the monogamy relation and the polygamy relation\nrespectively in a unified way. In addition, we show that any entanglement\nmeasure violates the polygamy relation, which is misstated in some recent\npapers. Only the existence of monogamy power is conditioned on the conjecture,\nall other results are strictly proved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 15:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01947", "submitter": "Kaisa Laiho", "authors": "A.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all\noptical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously\nradiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired\nchannels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage\nerror that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously\nknown bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:30:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:23:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Asenjo-Garcia", "A.", ""], ["Moreno-Cardoner", "M.", ""], ["Albrecht", "A.", ""], ["Kimble", "H.

The relevant figure of merit is the maximal ratio\n(called data hiding ratio) between the distinguishability norms associated with\nthe two sets of measurements we are comparing, typically all measurements vs\nLOCC protocols. For a bipartite $n\\times n$ quantum system, it is known that\nthe data hiding ratio scales as $n$, i.e. the square root of the real dimension\nof the local state space of density matrices. We show that for bipartite\n$n_A\\times n_B$ systems the maximum data hiding ratio against LOCC protocols is\n$\\Theta\\left(\\min\\{n_A,n_B\\}\\right)$. This scaling is better than the\npreviously obtained upper bounds $O\\left(\\sqrt{n_A n_B}\\right)$ and\n$\\min\\{n_A^2, n_B^2\\}$, and moreover our intuitive argument yields constants\nclose to optimal. In this paper, we investigate data hiding in the more general\ncontext of general probabilistic theories (GPTs), an axiomatic framework for\nphysical theories encompassing only the most basic requirements about the\npredictive power of the theory. The main result of the paper is the\ndetermination of the maximal data hiding ratio obtainable in an arbitrary GPT,\nwhich is shown to scale linearly in the minimum of the local dimensions. We\nexhibit an explicit model achieving this bound up to additive constants,\nfinding that the quantum mechanical data hiding ratio is only of the order of\nthe square root of the maximal one. Our proof rests crucially on an unexpected\nlink between data hiding and the theory of projective and injective tensor\nproducts of Banach spaces. Finally, we develop a body of techniques to compute\ndata hiding ratios for a variety of restricted classes of GPTs that support\nfurther symmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:46:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lami", "Ludovico", ""], ["Palazuelos", "Carlos", ""], ["Winter", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.03396", "submitter": "Xiong-Jun Liu", "authors": "Cheung Chan, Lin Zhang, Ting Fung Jeffrey Poon, Ying-Ping He, Yan-Qi\n  Wang, and Xiong-Jun Liu", "title": "A generic theory for Majorana zero modes in 2D superconductors", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, plus Supplementary Material", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This fractional quantization of spin is topological, and is a direct\nconsequence of the additional symmetries ensuing from the commensuration of the\nperiodic field with the underlying lattice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 19:00:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 08:56:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Marra", "Pasquale", ""], ["Citro", "Roberta", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.03816", "submitter": "Eduardo Martin-Martinez", "authors": "Nayeli A.

Plenoptic imaging was\nintroduced a few years ago to remedy this trade off. To this aim, plenoptic\nimaging reconstructs the path of light rays from the lens to the sensor.\nHowever, the improvement offered by standard plenoptic imaging is practical and\nnot fundamental: the increased DOF leads to a proportional reduction of the\nresolution well above the diffraction limit imposed by the lens NA. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that correlation measurements enable pushing plenoptic\nimaging to its fundamental limits of both resolution and DOF.

And we define two important probabilities $P_{\\rm loss}$ and $P_{\\rm\nerror}$ to evaluate the IFM process, which describe the photon loss rate and\nthe error of discriminating the presenece/absence of the object respectively.\nThe minimum values of these two probabilities and the corresponding initial\ninput states to reach them are attained via this model. And we find that when\nthe interrogation cycle $N$ approaches infinity, the object can be perfectly\ndetected, where the minimum values of these two probabilities are both zero and\nthe initial input state to reach them becomes the same state $|1\\rangle$ in our\nsystem. In addition, we also study whether quantum correlation can benefit IFM\nor not, but the answer is no, in the sense that the entangled photon input\nstate cannot minimize $P_{\\rm loss}$, $P_{\\rm error}$ more than single photon\ninput state.

A\npowerful line of argument in favour of quantum gravity considers models of\nhybrid systems consisting of coupled quantum-classical sectors. The conclusion\nis that such models are inconsistent: either the quantum sector's defining\nproperties necessarily spread to the classical sector, or they are violated.\nThese arguments have a long history, starting with the debates about the\nquantum nature of the electromagnetic fields in the early days of quantum\ntheory. Yet, they have limited scope because they rely on particular dynamical\nmodels obeying restrictive conditions, such as unitarity. In this paper we\npropose a radically new, more general argument, relying on less restrictive\nassumptions. The key feature is an information-theoretic characterisation of\nboth sectors, including their interaction, via constraints on copying\noperations. These operations are necessary for the existence of observables in\nany physical theory, because they constitute the most general representation of\nmeasurement interactions. Remarkably, our argument is formulated without\nresorting to particular dynamical models, thus being applicable to any hybrid\nsystem, even those ruled by \"post-quantum\" theories. Its conclusion is also\ncompatible with partially quantum systems, such as those that exhibit features\nlike complementarity, but may lack others, such as entanglement.

Radiation, in its interactions with matter and antimatter, is\nshown to be decoherence-neutral. The symmetric and antisymmetric assumptions\nresult in different interactions of radiation with matter and antimatter. The\ntheoretical predictions for these differences are testable by comparing\nabsorption (emission) of light by thermodynamic systems made of matter and\nantimatter. Canonical typicality for quantum mixtures is briefly discussed in\nthe Appendix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 05:28:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 05:28:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Klimenko", "A.

Somewhat\nsurprisingly, we find that the commutativity of the canonical parent\nHamiltonian one may associate to the target state does not directly relate to\nits finite-time stabilizability properties, although in all cases where we can\nguarantee robust stabilization, a (possibly non-canonical) commuting parent\nHamiltonian may be found. Beside graph states, quantum states amenable to\nfinite-time robust stabilization include a class of universal resource states\ndisplaying two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological order, along with\ntensor network states obtained by generalizing a construction due to Bravyi and\nVyalyi. Extensions to representative classes of mixed graph-product and thermal\nstates are also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 19:54:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "Peter D.", ""], ["Ticozzi", "Francesco", ""], ["Viola", "Lorenza", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06190", "submitter": "Erik D\\'iaz-Bautista", "authors": "Erik D\\'iaz-Bautista, David J.

Ultra-sensitive force\nmeasurements are therefore a crucial tool for investigating the fundamental\nphysics of magnetic, atomic, quantum, and surface phenomena. Laser cooled\ntrapped atomic ions are a well controlled quantum system and a standard\nplatform for precision metrology. Their low mass, strong Coulomb interaction,\nand readily detectable fluorescence signal make trapped ions favourable for\nperforming high-sensitivity force measurements. Here we demonstrate a\nthree-dimensional sub-attonewton sensitivity force sensor based on\nsuper-resolution imaging of the fluorescence from a single laser cooled\n$^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a Paul trap. The force is detected by measuring the net\nion displacement with nanometer precision, and does not rely on mechanical\noscillation.

These sources are capable of producing pairs of\nindistinguishable photons but typically suffer from an effective $50\\%$ loss.\nBy slightly decoupling the input waveguide from the ring, the drop port\ncoincidence ratio can be significantly increased with the trade-off being that\nthe pump is less efficiently coupled into the ring.

Through the\nmodification of the coupling design that relies on additional spectral\ndependence, it is possible to achieve similar coincidence ratios without the\nincreased pumping requirement.

A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on entities\nor distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. An epistemic formalism is developed, where concepts like\nindividual and collective knowledge are used, and knowledge may be actual or\npotential. The physical state $S$ corresponds to the collective potential\nknowledge. The state $S$ is a subset of a state space $\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such\nthat $S$ always contains several elements $Z$, which correspond to unattainable\nstates of complete potential knowledge of the world. The evolution of $S$\ncannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution of the elements $Z$,\nunlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase space. The evolution of\n$S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in \\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which\nis updated according to $n\\rightarrow n+1$ each time potential knowledge\nchanges. In certain experimental contexts $C$, there is initial knowledge at\ntime $n$ that a given series of properties $P,P',\\ldots$ will be observed\nwithin a given time frame, meaning that a series of values $p,p',\\ldots$ of\nthese properties will become known.

We\napply the quantum theory of photodetection to the sideband technique and\npropose signatures in sideband photon-counting statistics and second-order\ncorrelation measurement of sideband signals that indicates the degree of phonon\ncoherence. Our theory can be implemented in recently performed experiments to\nbridge the gap of determining phonon coherence to be on par with that of\nphotons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:32:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Ding", ""], ["Yin", "Xiaobo", ""], ["Li", "Baowen", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.09404", "submitter": "Shahriar Salimi", "authors": "F.

The method is then applied naturally to\nalphabets greater than two for multi-valued logical gates used for quantum\nFourier transform, min-max decision circuits and multivalued adders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 08:23:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 10:07:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 13:32:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Feb 2018 14:25:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Toffano", "Zeno", ""], ["Dubois", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10793", "submitter": "Maria Schuld", "authors": "Maria Schuld, Mark Fingerhuth, Francesco Petruccione", "title": "Implementing a distance-based classifier with a quantum interference\n  circuit", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/119/60002", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lately, much attention has been given to quantum algorithms that solve\npattern recognition tasks in machine learning.
