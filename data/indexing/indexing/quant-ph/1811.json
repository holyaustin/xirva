The solution we suggest to the paradox\nis that in entangled systems, one can find pairs of \"entangled events\" which\nhave symmetrical causality relations. Each of the events can serve as a cause\nor as an effect, depending on the frame of reference in which they are\nobserved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 07:22:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kirsh", "Yoram", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.00380", "submitter": "Bekir Can L\\\"utf\\\"uo\\u{g}lu", "authors": "B.C.

AQC remains, however, poorly understood theoretically\nand its mathematical underpinnings are yet to be satisfactorily identified.\nThrough Morse theory, we bring a novel perspective that we expect will open the\ndoor for using such mathematics in the realm of quantum computations, providing\na secure foundation for AQC. Here we show that the singular homology of a\ncertain cobordism, which we construct from the given Hamiltonian, defines the\nadiabatic evolution. Our result is based on E.

We first define what conservation of\ninformation means in a computational setting. We emphasize that computations\nmust be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled\nusing topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations. We\nillustrate this idea using three notions of data. The first assumes\nunstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding\nnotion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We then consider a\nstructured notion of data based on the Curry-Howard correspondence; here\nreversible deformations, as a programming language for witnessing type\nisomorphisms, comes from proof terms for commutative semirings. We then \"move\nup a level\" to treat programs as data. The corresponding notion of reversible\nprograms equivalences comes from the \"higher dimensional\" analog to commutative\nsemirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these are exactly\nthe program equivalences we seek.\n  We conclude with some generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and\nsurvey directions for further research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2018 21:03:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2018 19:22:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Carette", "Jacques", ""], ["James", "Roshan P.", ""], ["Sabry", "Amr", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.03722", "submitter": "Christina Giarmatzi", "authors": "Christina Giarmatzi and Fabio Costa", "title": "Witnessing quantum memory in non-Markovian processes", "comments": "Main text: 5 pages, 2 figures.

The origin of such advantages lies in the role of\nquantum correlations, which may arise during the charging and discharging\nprocesses performed on the battery. In this theoretical work, we introduce a\nsystematic characterization of the relevant quantities of quantum batteries,\ni.e., the capacity and the power, in relation to such correlations. For these\nquantities, we derive upper bounds for batteries that are a collection of\nnoninteracting quantum cells with fixed Hamiltonians. The capacity, that is, a\nbound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the\nenergy-entropy diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and\ndischarging processes are entropy preserving. While studying power, we consider\na geometric approach for the evolution of the battery state in the energy\neigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is\nderived for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and\nthe energy variance of the battery.

When the emitters frequency lies within the\ntopological band-gap, a chiral bound state emerges, which is located at just\none side (right or left) of the emitter. In the presence of several emitters,\nit mediates topological, long-range tunable interactions between them, that can\ngive rise to exotic phases such as double N\\'eel ordered states. On the\ncontrary, when the emitters' optical transition is resonant with the bands, we\nfind unconventional scattering properties and different super/subradiant states\ndepending on the band topology. We also investigate the case of a bath with\nopen boundary conditions to understand the role of topological edge states.\nFinally, we propose several implementations where these phenomena can be\nobserved with state-of-the-art technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Nov 2018 10:47:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 20:39:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Bello", "Miguel", ""], ["Platero", "Gloria", ""], ["Cirac", "Juan Ignacio", ""], ["Gonz\u00e1lez-Tudela", "Alejandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.04395", "submitter": "Yuyu Zhang", "authors": "Yu-Yu Zhang, Tian-Ran Yang, Libin Fu, Xiaoguang Wang", "title": "Powerful harmonic charging in quantum batteries", "comments": "7 pages,7 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Indistinguishability is the key to\nquantum interference. Therefore, the success of many protocols in optical\nquantum information processing relies on the availability of photon states with\na well-defined spatial and temporal mode. Photons in single spatial mode can be\nobtained from nonlinear processes in single-mode waveguides. For the temporal\nmode, the common approach is to engineer the nonlinear processes. But it is\ncomplicated because the spectral properties and the nonlinear interaction are\noften intertwined through phase matching condition. In this paper, we study a\ndifferent approach which is based on an SU(1,1) nonlinear interferometer with a\npulsed pump and a controllable linear spectral phase shift for precise\nengineering. We systematically analyze the important figures of merit such as\nmodal purity and heralding efficiency to investigate the feasibility of this\napproach. Specifically, we analyze in detail the requirement on the spectral\nphase engineering to optimize the figures of merit and apply numerical\nsimulations to a fiber system. Both modal purity and efficiency are improved\nsimultaneously. Furthermore, a novel multi-stage nonlinear interferometer is\nproposed and shown to achieve more precise state engineering for near-ideal\nsingle-mode operation and near-unity efficiency. We also extend the study to\nthe case of high gain in the four-wave mixing process for the spectral\nengineering of quantum entanglement in continuous variables.

The same process occurs in lasers which limits its intrinsic\nlinewidth and makes the phase uncertainty difficult to calculate. The most\ncommonly used simplification is to assume a narrow photon-number distribution\nfor the optical field (which we call the small-noise approximation). For\ncoherent light, this condition is determined by the average photon number. The\nsmall-noise approximation relies on (i) the input to have a good\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) that such a signal-to-noise ratio can be\nmaintained throughout the amplification process. Here we ask: For a coherent\ninput, how many photons must be present in the input to a quantum linear\namplifier for the phase noise at the output to be amenable to a small-noise\nanalysis? We address these questions by showing how the phase uncertainty can\nbe obtained without recourse to the small-noise approximation. It is shown that\nfor an ideal linear amplifier (i.e. an amplifier most favourable to the\nsmall-noise approximation), the small-noise approximation breaks down with only\na few photons on average.

Such expectation values can be estimated by performing\nprojective measurements on $O(M^3 \\log(M/\\delta)/\\epsilon^2)$ copies of the\nstate, where $M$ is the dimension of an associated Lie algebra, $\\epsilon$ is a\nprecision parameter, and $1-\\delta$ is the required confidence level. The\nmethod can be implemented on a classical computer and runs in time $O(M^4\n\\log(M/\\epsilon))$. It provides $O(M \\log(M/\\epsilon))$ simple unitaries that\nform the sequence. The number of all computational resources is then polynomial\nin $M$, making the whole procedure very efficient in those cases where $M$ is\nsignificantly smaller than the Hilbert space dimension. When the algebra of\nrelevant observables is determined by some Pauli matrices, each simple unitary\nmay be easily decomposed into two-qubit gates.

Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60\nqubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical\ncomputers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed\nas quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware,\nbecause the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the\nqubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the\ncircuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional\ngate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the\nhardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect\nthat the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates.\nTherefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated\n(placed) initially to the hardware qubits? The novelty of this work relies on\nthe methodology used to investigate the influence of the initial placement. To\nthis end, we introduce a novel heuristic and cost model to estimate the number\nof gates necessary to adapt a circuit to a given NISQ architecture.

We focus specifically on classical-quantum\n(cq) sources, for which one edge of the rate region, corresponding to the\ncompression of the classical part, using the quantum part as side information\nat the decoder, was previously determined by Devetak and Winter [Phys. Rev. A\n68, 042301 (2003)]. Whereas the Devetak-Winter protocol attains a rate-sum\nequal to the von Neumann entropy of the joint source, here we show that the\nfull rate region is much more complex, due to the partially quantum nature of\nthe source. In particular, in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part\nof the source, using the classical part as side information at the decoder,\ntypically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy of the\ntotal source.\n  We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart\nfrom the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a\nrate sum strictly larger than the joint entropy.

Rev. Lett. 119, 083403\n(2017)]. Here, we develop a virtual photon description of three-body ICD,\nshowing that a mediator atom can have a significant influence at much larger\ndistances. In this regime, this impact is due to the scattering of virtual\nphotons off the mediator, allowing for simple analytical results and being\nmanifest in a distinct geometry-dependence which includes interference effects.\nAs a striking example, we show that in the retarded regime ICD can be\nsubstantially enhanced or suppressed depending on the position of the\nICD-inactive object, even if the latter is far from both donor and acceptor\nspecies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Nov 2018 14:23:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bennett", "Robert", ""], ["Votavov\u00e1", "Petra", ""], ["Koloren\u010d", "P\u0159emysl", ""], ["Miteva", "Tsveta", ""], ["Sisourat", "Nicolas", ""], ["Buhmann", "Stefan Yoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.09500", "submitter": "Niko Jokela", "authors": "Vijay Balasubramanian, Niko Jokela, Arttu P\\\"onni, Alfonso V.

The magnons are embodied by a collective motion\nof a large number of spins in a macroscopic ferrimagnet, and couple to cavity\nmicrowave photons and phonons (vibrational modes of the ferrimagnet) via the\nmagnetic dipole interaction and magnetostrictive interaction, respectively. The\ncavity is driven by a weak squeezed vacuum field generated by a flux-driven\nJosephson parametric amplifier, which is essential to get squeezed states of\nthe magnons and phonons. We show that the magnons can be prepared in a squeezed\nstate via the cavity-magnon beamsplitter interaction, and by further driving\nthe magnon mode with a strong red-detuned microwave field, the phonons are\nsqueezed. We show optimal parameter regimes for obtaining large squeezing of\nthe magnons and phonons, which are robust against temperature and could be\nrealized with experimentally reachable parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2018 00:12:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2018 05:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Jan 2019 05:37:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2019 01:14:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jie", ""], ["Zhu", "Shi-Yao", ""], ["Agarwal", "G.

We\ninvestigate a X and Z stabilizing circuit realized by two data qubits, two\nancillas and four resonators. The aim is to assess the consequences of unitary\nevolution of the interacting system, in particular for given stable initial\nstates, on fidelities and error syndrome probabilities. We model the system\nwith a Jaynes-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and construct the low-excitation level\nevolution operators. The analysis is limited to two stable input states. We\nassume an ideal system with perfect gates, perfect measurements and no\ndecoherence or leakage. Our analysis shows that the capture probabilities after\nthe execution of a single stabilizer round are not equal to 100%, but vary\nbetween 99.2% and 99.99%. This is caused solely by the unitary evolution of the\ninteracting system. Two consecutive rounds of stabilizer measurements result in\ncapture probability values that depend heavily on the duration of the\nevolution, but vary between 0% and 99%. Also due to the unitary evolution, the\nfinal state of the data qubits leaves the the four-dimensional subspace, which\nresults in a state fidelity oscillating between 0 and 1.

Our motivating question is whether there\nis a family of $t$-player XOR games for which the entangled bias is $1$ but for\nwhich the classical bias goes down to $0$, for fixed $t$. Answering this\nquestion would have important consequences in the study of multi-party\ncommunication complexity, as a positive answer would imply an unbounded\nseparation between randomized communication complexity with and without\nentanglement. Our contribution to answering the question is identifying several\ngeneral classes of games for which the classical bias can not go to zero when\nthe entangled bias stays above a constant threshold. This rules out the\npossibility of using these games to answer our motivating question. A\npreviously studied set of XOR games, known not to give a positive answer to the\nquestion, are those for which there is a quantum strategy that attains value 1\nusing a so-called Schmidt state. We generalize this class to mod-$m$ games and\nshow that their classical value is always at least $\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{m-1}{m}\nt^{1-t}$.

Based on this method, we propose a design for on-chip\nmultiplexed single-photon sources that allow localized frequency modes to be\nconverted into propagating continuous-mode photon wave packets using a single\noperation.

These waveguide-integrated\nsensors might open up new applications, like determining magnetic field\ndistributions inside opaque or scattering media, or photosensitive samples,\nlike biological tissue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:16:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:15:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Landowski", "Alexander", ""], ["Gutsche", "Jonas", ""], ["Guckenbiehl", "Stefan", ""], ["Sch\u00f6nberg", "Marius", ""], ["von Freymann", "Georg", ""], ["Widera", "Artur", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12872", "submitter": "Piotr Mironowicz", "authors": "Piotr Mironowicz, Marcin Paw{\\l}owski", "title": "Experimentally feasible semi-device-independent certification of $4$\n  outcome POVMs", "comments": "3+2 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.
