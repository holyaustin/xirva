Recent advances have uncovered an\nintrinsically many-body generalization of quantum teleportation, with an\nelegant and surprising connection to gravity. In particular, the teleportation\nof quantum information relies on many-body dynamics, which originate from\nstrongly-interacting systems that are holographically dual to gravity; from the\ngravitational perspective, such quantum teleportation can be understood as the\ntransmission of information through a traversable wormhole. Here, we propose\nand analyze a new mechanism for many-body quantum teleportation -- dubbed\npeaked-size teleportation. Intriguingly, peaked-size teleportation utilizes\nprecisely the same type of quantum circuit as traversable wormhole\nteleportation, yet has a completely distinct microscopic origin: it relies upon\nthe spreading of local operators under generic thermalizing dynamics and not\ngravitational physics. We demonstrate the ubiquity of peaked-size\nteleportation, both analytically and numerically, across a diverse landscape of\nphysical systems, including random unitary circuits, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\nmodel (at high temperatures), one-dimensional spin chains and a bulk theory of\ngravity with stringy corrections. Our results pave the way towards using\nmany-body quantum teleportation as a powerful experimental tool for: (i)\ncharacterizing the size distributions of operators in strongly-correlated\nsystems and (ii) distinguishing between generic and intrinsically gravitational\nscrambling dynamics. To this end, we provide a detailed experimental blueprint\nfor realizing many-body quantum teleportation in both trapped ions and Rydberg\natom arrays; effects of decoherence and experimental imperfections are\nanalyzed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 19:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Schuster", "Thomas", ""], ["Kobrin", "Bryce", ""], ["Gao", "Ping", ""], ["Cong", "Iris", ""], ["Khabiboulline", "Emil T.", ""], ["Linke", "Norbert M.", ""], ["Lukin", "Mikhail D.", ""], ["Monroe", "Christopher", ""], ["Yoshida", "Beni", ""], ["Yao", "Norman Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.00013", "submitter": "Michal P.

An\nunsolved issue is how to selectively excite one qubit deep in a 3D atomic array\nto Rydberg states. In this work, we show two methods for this purpose. The\nfirst method relies on a well-known result: in a dipole transition between two\nquantum states driven by two off-resonant fields of equal strength but opposite\ndetunings $\\pm\\Delta$, the transition is characterized by two counter-rotating\nRabi frequencies $\\Omega e^{\\pm i\\Delta t}$~[or $\\pm\\Omega e^{\\pm i\\Delta t}$\nif the two fields have a $\\pi$-phase difference]. This pair of detuned fields\nlead to a time-dependent Rabi frequency $2\\Omega \\cos(\\Delta t)$~[or $2i\\Omega\n\\sin(\\Delta t)$], so that a full transition between the two levels is\nrecovered. We show that when the two detuned fields are sent in different\ndirections, one atom in a 3D optical lattice can be selectively addressed for\nRydberg excitation, and when its state is restored, the state of any nontarget\natoms irradiated in the light path is also restored. Moreover, we find that the\nRydberg excitation by this method can significantly suppress the fundamental\nblockade error of a Rydberg gate, paving the way for a high-fidelity entangling\ngate with commonly used quasi-rectangular pulse that is easily obtained by\npulse pickers.

First, we look at the\ncelebrated case of data hiding 'against' the set of local operations and\nclassical communication. While previous studies have placed upper bounds on its\nmaximum efficiency in terms of the local dimension and are thus not applicable\nto continuous variable systems, we tackle this latter case by establishing more\ngeneral bounds that rely solely on the local mean photon number of the states\nemployed. Along the way, we perform a quantitative analysis of the error\nintroduced by the non-ideal Braunstein--Kimble quantum teleportation protocol,\ndetermining how much two-mode squeezing and local detection efficiency is\nneeded in order to teleport an arbitrary local state of known mean energy with\na prescribed accuracy. Finally, following a seminal proposal by Winter, we look\nat data hiding against the set of Gaussian operations and classical\ncomputation, providing the first example of a relatively simple scheme that\nworks with a single mode only. The states employed can be generated from a\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum by local photon counting; the larger the squeezing,\nthe higher the efficiency of the scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2021 19:00:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lami", "Ludovico", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.01140", "submitter": "Anna Szczepanek", "authors": "Anna Szczepanek", "title": "Ergodicity of Kusuoka measures on quantum trajectories", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In 1989 Kusuoka started the study of probability measures on the shift space\nthat are defined with the help of products of matrices.

These research areas\nare highly relevant for the foundations of physics as well as the development\nof quantum technologies. In the first part, focussing on causality, we develop\ntechniques for using generalised entropies to analyse distinctions between\nclassical and non-classical causal structures. We derive new properties of\nTsallis entropies of systems that follow from the relevant causal structure,\nand apply these to obtain new necessary constraints for classicality in the\nTriangle causal structure. Supplementing the method with the post-selection\ntechnique, we provide evidence that Shannon and Tsallis entropic constraints\nare insufficient for detecting non-classicality in Bell scenarios with\nnon-binary outcomes. This points to the need for better methods of\ncharacterising correlations in non-classical causal structures. Further, we\ninvestigate the relationships between causality and space-time by developing a\nframework for modelling cyclic and fine-tuned influences in non-classical\ntheories. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such causal models\nto be compatible with a space-time structure and for ruling out operationally\ndetectable causal loops. In particular, this provides an operational framework\nfor analysing post-quantum theories admitting jamming non-local correlations.\nIn the second part, we investigate multi-agent logical paradoxes such as the\nFrauchiger-Renner paradox and develop a framework for analysing such paradoxes\nin arbitrary physical theories. Applying this to box world, a post-quantum\ntheory, we derive a stronger paradox that does not rely on post-selection. Our\nresults reveal that reversible evolution of agents' memories is not necessary\nfor deriving multi-agent paradoxes, and that certain forms of contextuality\nmight be.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2021 03:35:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Vilasini", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.02416", "submitter": "Ying-Jer Kao", "authors": "Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chih-Min Huang, Chia-Wei Hsing and Ying-Jer Kao", "title": "An end-to-end trainable hybrid classical-quantum classifier", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:2011.14651", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a hybrid model combining a quantum-inspired tensor network and a\nvariational quantum circuit to perform supervised learning tasks.

As\nquantum technologies emerge, the need to identify and characterize the\nresources which provide an advantage over existing classical technologies\nbecomes more pressing. Here we derive witnesses for Wigner negativity of single\nmode and multimode quantum states, based on fidelities with Fock states, which\ncan be reliably measured using standard detection setups. They possess a\nthreshold expectation value indicating whether the measured state has a\nnegative Wigner function. Moreover, the amount of violation provides an\noperational quantification of Wigner negativity. We phrase the problem of\nfinding the threshold values for our witnesses as an infinite-dimensional\nlinear optimisation. By relaxing and restricting the corresponding linear\nprograms, we derive two hierarchies of semidefinite programs, which provide\nnumerical sequences of increasingly tighter upper and lower bounds for the\nthreshold values. We further show that both sequences converge to the threshold\nvalue. Moreover, our witnesses form a complete family - each Wigner negative\nstate is detected by at least one witness - thus providing a reliable method\nfor experimentally witnessing Wigner negativity of quantum states from few\nmeasurements. From a foundational perspective, our findings provide insights on\nthe set of positive Wigner functions which still lacks a proper\ncharacterisation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 18:55:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 19:09:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2021 16:04:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2021 11:18:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chabaud", "Ulysse", ""], ["Emeriau", "Pierre-Emmanuel", ""], ["Grosshans", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.06218", "submitter": "Luis Poveda", "authors": "Luis A.

In the light of our previous work the Tan, Walls\nand Collett setup can be described by a precise local hidden variable model,\nhence the claimed nonclassicality of this proposal is apparent, whereas the\nnonclassicality proof proposed by Hardy is impeccable. In this work we resolve\nthe following problem: which feature of the Hardy's approach is crucial for its\nsuccessful confirmation of nonclassicality. The scheme of Hardy differs from\nthe Tan, Walls and Collett setup in two aspects. (i) It introduces a\nsuperposition of a single photon excitation with vacuum as the initial state of\none of the input modes of a 50-50 beamsplitter, which creates the superposition\nstate of two separable (exit) modes under investigation. (ii) In the final\nmeasurements Hardy's proposal utilises a varying strengths of the local\noscillator fields, whereas in the TWC case they are constant. In fact the local\noscillators in Hardy's scheme are either on or off (the local setting is\nspecified by the presence or absence of the local auxiliary field). We show\nthat it is the varying strength of the local oscillators, from setting to\nsetting, which is the crucial feature enabling violation of local realism in\nthe Hardy setup, whereas it is not necessary to use initial superposition of a\nsingle photon excitation with vacuum as the initial state of the input mode.\nNeither one needs to operate in the fully on/off detection scheme.

Even in isolated quantum many-body systems, limited to reversible\ndynamics, thermalization typically prevails. However, in these systems, there\nis another possibility: many-body localization (MBL) can result in preservation\nof a non-thermal state. While disorder has long been considered an essential\ningredient for this phenomenon, recent theoretical work has suggested that a\nquantum many-body system with a uniformly increasing field -- but no disorder\n-- can also exhibit MBL, resulting in `Stark MBL.' Here we realize Stark MBL in\na trapped-ion quantum simulator and demonstrate its key properties: halting of\nthermalization and slow propagation of correlations. Tailoring the interactions\nbetween ionic spins in an effective field gradient, we directly observe their\nmicroscopic equilibration for a variety of initial states, and we apply\nsingle-site control to measure correlations between separate regions of the\nspin chain. Further, by engineering a varying gradient, we create a\ndisorder-free system with coexisting long-lived thermalized and nonthermal\nregions.

In this paper we characterize this ensemble\nand classify the phases that can be established as steady states. Symmetry\nplays a nonstandard role in that the physical symmetry imposed on the circuit\nelements does not on its own dictate the possible phases. Instead, it is\nextended by dynamical symmetries associated with this ensemble to form an\nenlarged symmetry. Thus we predict phases that have no equilibrium counterpart\nand could not have been supported by the physical circuit symmetry alone. We\ngive the following examples. First, we classify the phases of a circuit\noperating on qubit chains with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. One striking\nprediction, corroborated with numerical simulation, is the existence of\ndistinct volume-law phases in one dimension, which nonetheless support true\nlong-range order. We furthermore argue that owing to the enlarged symmetry,\nthis system can in principle support a topological area-law phase, protected by\nthe combination of the circuit symmetry and a dynamical permutation symmetry.\nSecond, we consider a gaussian fermion circuit that only conserves fermion\nparity. Here the enlarged symmetry gives rise to a $U(1)$ critical phase at\nmoderate measurement rates and a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an area-law\nphase.

As such,\nthey are usually confined in an external potential that often depends on the\natomic spin, which may lead to inhomogeneous broadening, phase separation and\ndecoherence. Dynamical decoupling provides an approach to mitigate these\neffects by applying an external field that induces rapid spin rotations.\nHowever, a continuous periodic driving of a generic interacting many-body\nsystem eventually heats it up. The question is whether dynamical decoupling can\nbe applied at intermediate times without altering the underlying physics. Here\nwe answer this question affirmatively for a strongly interacting degenerate\nFermi gas held in a flat box-like potential. We counteract most of the\ngravitational force by applying an external magnetic field with an appropriate\ngradient. Since the magnetic force, and consequently, the whole potential, is\nspin-dependent, we employ rf to induce a rapid spin rotation. The driving\ncauses atoms in both spin states to experience the same time-average flat\npotential, leading to a uniform cloud. Most importantly, we find that when the\ndriving frequency is high enough, there is no heating on experimentally\nrelevant timescales, and physical observables are similar to those of a\nstationary gas. In particular, we measure the pair-condensation fraction of a\nfermionic superfluid at unitarity and the contact parameter in the BEC-BCS\ncrossover. The condensate fraction exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the\ndrive frequency and reaches a value higher than its value without driving.

Does dephasing assisted transport still manifest\nfor non-Markovian dephasing? Here, we address these open questions in a setup\nof coupled two-level systems. Our results show that the manifestation of\nnon-Markovian dephasing assisted transport depends on the way in which the\nincoherent energy sources are locally coupled to the chain. This is illustrated\nwith two different configurations, namely non-symmetric and symmetric.\nSpecifically, we verify that non-Markovian dephasing assisted transport\nmanifested only in the non-symmetric configuration. This allows us to draw a\nparallel with the conditions in which time-independent Markovian dephasing\nassisted transport manifests.

In this work, we show that this advantage is smaller than expected. In\nfact, we present a causal algorithm that solves the only known specific FPP\nwith $O(n \\log(n))$ queries and a causal algorithm that solves every FPP with\n$O(n\\sqrt{n})$ queries. Besides the interest in such algorithms on their own,\nour results limit the expected advantage of indefinite causal structures for\nthese problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 19:00:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Renner", "Martin J.", ""], ["Brukner", "\u010caslav", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11294", "submitter": "Mike Blake", "authors": "Mike Blake and Hong Liu", "title": "On systems of maximal quantum chaos", "comments": "28 pages, 3 figures, v2: minor clarification added, v3: typos\n  corrected", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "MIT-CTP/5283", "categories": "hep-th cond-mat.str-el nlin.CD nucl-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A remarkable feature of chaos in many-body quantum systems is the existence\nof a bound on the quantum Lyapunov exponent.

As system size increases,\nmultiplexed qubit readout becomes a practical necessity to limit the growth of\nresource overhead. Many contemporary qubit-state discriminators presume\nsingle-qubit operating conditions or require considerable computational effort,\nlimiting their potential extensibility. Here, we present multi-qubit readout\nusing neural networks as state discriminators. We compare our approach to\ncontemporary methods employed on a quantum device with five superconducting\nqubits and frequency-multiplexed readout. We find that fully-connected\nfeedforward neural networks increase the qubit-state-assignment fidelity for\nour system. Relative to contemporary discriminators, the assignment error rate\nis reduced by up to 25% due to the compensation of system-dependent\nnonidealities such as readout crosstalk which is reduced by up to one order of\nmagnitude.

These EPs can possess a number of intriguing properties related to,\ne.g., chiral transport and enhanced sensitivity. Previous proposals to realize\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) with high-order EPs have been mainly based on\neither direct construction of spatial networks of coupled modes or utilization\nof synthetic dimensions, e.g., of mapping spatial lattices to time or\nphoton-number space. Both methods rely on the construction of effective NHHs\ndescribing classical or postselected quantum fields, which neglect the effects\nof quantum jumps, and which, thus, suffer from a scalability problem in the\n{\\it quantum regime}, when the probability of quantum jumps increases with the\nnumber of excitations and dissipation rate.
