We here introduce a novel\nmeasure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This\nis defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and\nthe nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement,\nthis quantity is straightforward to calculate and we find it to be precisely\nequal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al.\nIt is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the\ngroup element encoded into the token and the group element that may be\nextracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to\nwhich the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show,\nthat despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized\nrelative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate\nof interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum\nreference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield a novel\napproach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jan 2009 23:38:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 19:01:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gour", "Gilad", ""], ["Marvian", "Iman", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0944", "submitter": "Matt Visser", "authors": "Petarpa Boonserm (Victoria University of Wellington) and Matt Visser\n  (Victoria University of Wellington)", "title": "Analytic bounds on transmission probabilities", "comments": "19 pages", "journal-ref": "Annals Phys.325:1328-1339,2010", "doi": "10.1016/j.aop.2010.02.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph hep-th math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop some new analytic bounds on transmission probabilities (and the\nrelated reflection probabilities and Bogoliubov coefficients) for generic\none-dimensional scattering problems.

It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid\nby the application of a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary\nconfiguration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution.\nIn this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a\nmacroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during\nthe experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The\nexperiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity\nwaves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,\nwith particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave\nfunction with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and\nthe velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is\ntherefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We\nsuggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i)\nby the action of a force on the surface (wind, blower, pressure, field,\netc...); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground\nprofile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum\nforce is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with\na macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy.

This provides a novel example where equilibration\nemerges as a natural phenomena under quantum dynamics alone, with no necessity\nto bring in any additional statistical postulates. Mixedness of equilibrated\nsubsystems consisting of 1, 2, ....., n<<N clearly indicates that small\nsubsystems are entangled with the rest of the state i.e., the bath. Every\nsingle mode oscillator is found to relax in a mixed density matrix of the\nBoltzmann canonical form. In two oscillator equilibrated subsystems,\nintra-entanglement within the `system' oscillators is found to exist when the\nmagnitude of the squeezing parameter of the bath is comparable in magnitude\nwith that of the coupling strength.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jan 2009 16:00:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2009 21:06:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2009 03:09:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Devi", "A R Usha", ""], ["Rajagopal", "A K", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1456", "submitter": "Albert Schliesser", "authors": "A.

Here we approach for the first time the quantum\nregime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to\nthe bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical\noscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles\nof cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical\ndisplacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced\ndynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the\nmechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65\nK, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state\n(63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is\nwithin a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved.

Up to now, only\nnanoscale mechanical devices achieved operation close to the quantum regime. We\nreport a new micro-optomechanical resonator that is laser cooled to a level of\n30 thermal quanta. This is equivalent to the best nanomechanical devices,\nhowever, with a mass more than four orders of magnitude larger (43 ng versus 1\npg) and at more than two orders of magnitude higher environment temperature (5\nK versus 30 mK). Despite the large laser-added cooling factor of 4,000 and the\ncryogenic environment, our cooling performance is not limited by residual\nabsorption effects. These results pave the way for the preparation of 100-um\nscale objects in the quantum regime.

In the limit of infinitely many copies of the initial\nstate provided, we compute the regularized ineliminable correlations to be\nmeasured by the coherent information, which is thus equipped with a new\noperational interpretation.

The security analysis of\nthese schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of\nbetter proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might\nfurther improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we\nderive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD.

The\nonly assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click\nevents are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only\nsecure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns\nimperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis\nrelies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate\nusers need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of\ntwo-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric\nextension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements\nresults. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon\nimplementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of\nweak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex\noptimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently\nsolved.
