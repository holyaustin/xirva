This article is concerned with the question of finding a\ncomplete set of restrictions on the HTOs that are associated with a given\nquantum operation. An answer to this question has been found only for a subset\nof quantum operations. For erasure operations, these characterizations are\nequivalent to the generalized Landauer erasure principle.

In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key\ncan be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum\nparticles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used\nby Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum\nmechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum\ncryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very\neavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both\npractical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on\noperational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -\nthat information gain about one bservables must cause disturbance to another,\nincompatible one?\n  Here we resolve this problem by using in place of non-locality another\nstriking feature of quantum world - contextuality. It is a strong version of\nincompatibility manifested in the famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial\nconcept is the use of a new class of families of bipartite probability\ndistributions which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox conditions and,\nin addition, exhibit perfect correlations. We show that if two persons share\nsystems described by such a family then they can extract secure key.\n  This is the first operational protocol that directly implements the\nfundamental feature of Nature: the information gain vs. disturbance trade-off.\nAt the same time it provides natural device-independent cryptographic scheme\nwithin quantum mechanics suitable for current technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2010 20:15:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 19:49:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Horodecki", "Karol", ""], ["Horodecki", "Michal", ""], ["Horodecki", "Pawel", ""], ["Horodecki", "Ryszard", ""], ["Pawlowski", "Marcin", ""], ["Bourennane", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2419", "submitter": "Hari Krovi", "authors": "Hari Krovi, Fr\\'ed\\'eric Magniez, Maris Ozols and J\\'er\\'emie Roland", "title": "Quantum walks can find a marked element on any graph", "comments": "50 pages", "journal-ref": "Algorithmica 74(2), pp. 851-907 (2016)", "doi": "10.1007/s00453-015-9979-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect\nbut also find marked vertices in a graph.

For example, applied to the genus-one handlebody using the Z_2\ncategory, this construction yields the well-known toric code.\n  For other categories, such as the Fibonacci category, the construction\nrealizes a non-abelian anyon model over a discrete lattice. By studying braid\ngroup representations acting on equivalence classes of colored ribbon graphs\nembedded in a punctured sphere, we identify the anyons, and give a simple\nrecipe for mapping fusion basis states of the doubled category to ribbon\ngraphs. We explain how suitable initial states can be prepared efficiently, how\nto implement braids, by successively changing the triangulation using a fixed\nfive-qudit local unitary gate, and how to measure the topological charge.\nCombined with known universality results for anyonic systems, this provides a\nlarge family of schemes for quantum computation based on local deformations of\nstabilizer codes. These schemes may serve as a starting point for developing\nfault-tolerance schemes using continuous stabilizer measurements and active\nerror-correction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Feb 2010 18:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Koenig", "Robert", ""], ["Kuperberg", "Greg", ""], ["Reichardt", "Ben W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2819", "submitter": "Masahiro Takeoka", "authors": "Kenji Tsujino, Daiji Fukuda, Go Fujii, Shuichiro Inoue, Mikio\n  Fujiwara, Masahiro Takeoka, and Masahide Sasaki", "title": "Sub-shot-noise-limit discrimination of on-off keyed coherent signals via\n  a quantum receiver with a superconducting transition edge sensor", "comments": "8 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Opt.

Work\ntowards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling\nbetween the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom; however, the form of\nthis coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such\na system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an\noptical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane allow us to realize\nseveral different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity\ndetunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic, or quartic in the\nmembrane's displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent\nof) the membrane's displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single\ndevice with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in\nsitu; in particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three\norders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the\ndevice presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of\nthe membrane's mechanical energy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2010 19:49:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sankey", "Jack C.", ""], ["Yang", "Cheng", ""], ["Zwickl", "Benjamin M.", ""], ["Jayich", "Andrew M.", ""], ["Harris", "Jack G.

This protocol is\nattractive because it is relatively simple and it is well suited for the\nstorage of multiple temporal modes. Furthermore, it offers very long storage\ntimes, greater than the phase relaxation time. Here, we consider the\nthree-pulse photon echo in both two- and three-level systems as a potential\ntechnique for the storage of light at the single-photon level. By explicit\ncalculations, we show that the ratio between the echo signal corresponding to a\nsingle-photon input and the noise is smaller than one.
