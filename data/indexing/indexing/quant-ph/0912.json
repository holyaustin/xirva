Applying\nadiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior\nto those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly\nwe found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we\ncould already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this\ncommunication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier\ntraining. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary\nof candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong\nclassifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a\nsingle global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and\npiecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each\niteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by\nconcatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies\nthat the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also\nprovide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which\ndoes not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization,\nis superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss.

We further study the role of the\nspontaneously generated coherences, and identify two different contributions to\nthe single-particle vacuum-induced couplings. We show that they have a\nnoticeable impact on the total resonance fluorescence spectrum down to small\ninteratomic distances, even though the dipole-dipole couplings constants then\nare much larger in magnitude than the the single-particle coupling constants.\nInterestingly, we find that the interatomic couplings can induce an effect of\nthe intraatomic spontaneously generated coherences on the observed spectra\nwhich is not present in single-atom systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2009 18:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Schmid", "Sandra Isabelle", ""], ["Evers", "Joerg", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.1305", "submitter": "Nicolino Lo Gullo", "authors": "N.

We\ndescribe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles\nfor each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a\nNavier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By\naveraging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which\ncan be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept\nallows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to\ninteracting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental\nsetup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and\nthe residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the\nparticle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two\nsub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or\nleft-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes\nphysically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field. We demonstrate that\nthis orientation-decomposed ''Zitterbewegung'' behaves - in accordance with\nSchroedinger's original idea - as a spin-type angular momentum which appears in\naddition to a possible orbital angular moment of the particle.

Operationally local transformations are parameterized\nonly by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH\ninequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the\nentangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become\ndependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality\nthus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,\nnamely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption.

In this paper we generalize these operationally local\ntransformations for multipartite Bell inequalities (with dichotomic\nobservables) and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for violation\nwithin this scheme. Namely, a violation of a multipartite Bell inequality in\nthis setting is contingent on whether an ancillary system admits any realistic,\nlocal hidden variable model i.e. whether the ancilla violates the given Bell\ninequality. These results indicate that violation of a Bell inequality\nperformed on a system does not necessarily imply that the system is nonlocal.\nIn fact the system under test may be completely classical.

Mathematical objects are defined in terms of the circuit\nunderstood graphically. In particular, we do not think of the circuit as\nsitting in a background time. Circuits can be foliated by hypersurfaces\ncomprised of sets of wires. Systems are defined to be associated with wires.

It is seen that Alice's payoff is heavily\ninfluenced by the depolarizing noise as compared to the amplitude damping\nnoise. Depolarizing channel causes a monotonic decrease in players payoffs as\nwe increase the amount of of quantum noise. In case of amplitude damping\nchannel, the Alice's payoff function reaches its minimum for alpha=0.5 and is\nsymmetrical. This means that larger values of quantum noise influence the game\nweakly. On the other hand, phase damping channel does not influence the game's\npayoff. Furthermore, the game's Nash equilibrium and non-transitive character\nof the game are not affected under the influence of quantum noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2009 10:42:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ramzan", "M.", ""], ["Khan", "Salman", ""], ["Khan", "M.

This work presents a\nperspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing\nthe evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early\ndevelopments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes\nwould be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser\nsources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)\nrealizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via\nmanipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally\nshaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the\ndesired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these\ntheoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial\nconcept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing\nmeasurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of\nfemtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the\ndesired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is\nguided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be\nespecially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found\nnumerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and\nthis paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include\nquantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of\ntheoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum\nfeedback control.
