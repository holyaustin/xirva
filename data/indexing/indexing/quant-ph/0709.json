A detailed study of the model is done for the $2\\times 2$ case: a\ngeometrical analysis of the zeros of the Jost-matrix determinant shows that the\nmodel has 0, 1 or 2 bound states, and 0 or 1 resonance; the potential\nparameters are explicitly expressed in terms of its bound-state energies, of\nits resonance energy and width, or of the open-channel scattering length, which\nsolves schematic inverse problems. As a first physical application,\nexactly-solvable $2\\times 2$ atom-atom interaction potentials are constructed,\nfor cases where a magnetic Feshbach resonance interplays with a bound or\nvirtual state close to threshold, which results in a large background\nscattering length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 07:28:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pupasov", "Andrey M.", ""], ["Samsonov", "Boris F.", ""], ["Sparenberg", "Jean-Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0352", "submitter": "Mandip Singh", "authors": "Mandip Singh", "title": "Macroscopic Entanglement of a Bose Einstein Condensate on a\n  Superconducting Atom Chip", "comments": "4 Pages, Two figures", "journal-ref": "Optics Express, 17, 2600-10 (2009)", "doi": "10.1364/OE.17.002600", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  We propose and analyse a practically implementable scheme to generate\nmacroscopic entanglement of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a micro-magnetic trap\nmagnetically coupled to a superconducting loop.

A O(n^3)-algorithm has been introduced for\nfinding such a causal flow when the numbers of output and input vertices in the\ngraph are equal, otherwise no polynomial time algorithm was known for deciding\nwhether a graph has a causal flow or not. Our main contribution is to introduce\na O(n^2)-algorithm for finding a causal flow, if any, whatever the numbers of\ninput and output vertices are. This answers the open question stated by Danos\nand Kashefi and by de Beaudrap. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm produces\nan optimal flow (flow of minimal depth.)\n  Whereas the existence of a causal flow is a sufficient condition for\ndeterminism, it is not a necessary condition. A weaker version of the causal\nflow, called gflow (generalized flow) has been introduced and has been proved\nto be a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of deterministic\ncomputations. Moreover the depth of the quantum computation is upper bounded by\nthe depth of the gflow. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm\nthat finds a gflow has been stated as an open question.

A key example is the\nmeasurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other\napplications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to\nimportant scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement\nprecision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons)\nthat are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently,\nlead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/sqrt(N) - known as the standard\nquantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured that it should be possible\nto achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,\ndramatically improving the scaling to 1/N. It is commonly thought that\nachieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states,\nsuch as the NOON state. These states are extremely difficult to generate.\nMeasurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N <=\n6, but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit and none have shown\nHeisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a\nHeisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input\nstates with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled\nsingle-photon states. We generalize Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm using\nadaptive measurement theory to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the\nHeisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we\nestimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard\nquantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources\nusing standard interferometry.

In particular,\nthere is no reduction in the fidelity when an ideal detector model is assumed,\nwhile reduced fidelities may be encountered when using realistic detectors with\na finite response time. We obtain similar results in the case of Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterference -- with perfect detectors, a modified version of quantum\ninterference is seen, and the visibility of the interference pattern is reduced\nas the detector time resolution is reduced.

If the initial state of the system does not\nbelong entirely to the subspace in question, the restriction of the state to\nthe otherwise correctable subsystem may not remain invariant after the\napplication of noise and error correction. It is known that in the case of\ndecoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) the condition for perfect\nunitary evolution inside the code imposes more restrictive conditions on the\nnoise process if one allows imperfect initialization. It was believed that\nthese conditions are necessary if DFSs are to be able to protect imperfectly\nencoded states from subsequent errors. By a similar argument, general OQEC\ncodes would also require more restrictive error-correction conditions for the\ncase of imperfect initialization. In this study, we examine this requirement by\nlooking at the errors on the encoded state. In order to quantitatively analyze\nthe errors in an OQEC code, we introduce a measure of the fidelity between the\nencoded information in two states for the case of subsystem encoding. A major\npart of the paper concerns the definition of the measure and the derivation of\nits properties. In contrast to what was previously believed, we obtain that\nmore restrictive conditions are not necessary neither for DFSs nor for general\nOQEC codes.

They can be evaluated efficiently in an algebraic way, and\nexperimentally measurable by local projective measurements of the copies of the\nstate. Non-singlet representations are also shown to be useful to classify\nentanglement. Our method reproduces many well-known measures in a unified way,\nand produces also a lot of new ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:34:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Apr 2008 11:17:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sugita", "Ayumu", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.4642", "submitter": "Yan-Kui Bai Dr", "authors": "Yan-Kui Bai, Z.
