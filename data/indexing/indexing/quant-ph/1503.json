Sharply covariant MUB, if they exist, would be most\nappealing from both theoretical and practical point of view. Since stabilizer\nMUB subsume almost all MUB that have ever been constructed, it is of\nfundamental interest to single out those candidates that are sharply covariant.\nWe show that, quite surprisingly, only two stabilizer MUB are sharply\ncovariant, and the conclusion still holds even if antiunitary transformations\nare taken into account. Our study provides valuable insight on the symmetry of\nstabilizer MUB, which may have implications for a number of research topics in\nquantum information and foundations.

This technique is then applied to experiments on quantum state tomography\non polarization qubits, leading to a 20-fold reduction in the systematic error.\nOur study may find applications in high-precision tasks in polarization optics\nand quantum optics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 12:35:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Zhibo", ""], ["Zhu", "Huangjun", ""], ["Xiang", "Guo-Yong", ""], ["Li", "Chuan-Feng", ""], ["Guo", "Guang-Can", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00264", "submitter": "Zhibo Hou", "authors": "Zhibo Hou, Huangjun Zhu, Guo-Yong Xiang, Chuan-Feng Li and Guang-Can\n  Guo", "title": "Achieving quantum precision limit in adaptive qubit state tomography", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures; titles changed and structure reorganised", "journal-ref": "npj Quantum Information 2, 16001 (2016)", "doi": "10.1038/npjqi.2016.1", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The precision limit in quantum state tomography is of great interest not only\nto practical applications but also to foundational studies.

However, its standard\nformulation is referred to the statistical ensemble of its possible\ntrajectories. The statistical ensemble is introduced in order to establish the\nexact correspondence (the Born's rule) between the probability density on the\nspatial configurations and the quantum distribution, that is the squared\nmodulus of the wave-function. In this work we explore the possibility of using\nthe pilot wave theory at the level of a single Bohm's trajectory. The pilot\nwave theory allows a formally self-consistent representation of quantum systems\nas a single Bohm's trajectory, but in this case there is no room for the Born's\nrule at least in its standard form. We will show that a correspondence exists\nbetween the statistical distribution of configurations along the single Bohm's\ntrajectory and the quantum distribution for a subsystem interacting with the\nenvironment in a multicomponent system. To this aim, we present the numerical\nresults of the single Bohm's trajectory description of the model system of six\nconfined rotors with random interactions. We find a rather close correspondence\nbetween the coordinate distribution of one rotor along its trajectory and the\ntime averaged marginal quantum distribution for the same rotor.

When the modulation\ninterval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath\ncorrelations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS,\ndepending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS\ncoupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine\n(QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the\nmodulation rate.

It shares with\ntechniques from other fields the emphasis on the existence of widely separated\nscales. Given this fact, the question arises whether it is feasible to improve\non the adiabatic approximation, similarly to some of those other approaches. A\nnumber of authors have addressed the issue from the quantum optics/atomic\nphysics perspective, and have run into the issue of non-hermiticity of the\neffective Hamiltonian improved beyond the adiabatic approximation, which poses\nconceptual and practical problems. Here, we first briefly survey methods\npresent in the physics literature. Next, we rewrite the problems addressed by\nthe adiabatic elimination technique to make apparent the fact that they are\nsingular perturbation problems from the point of view of dynamical systems. We\napply the invariant manifold method for singular perturbation problems to this\ncase, and show that this method produces the equation named after Bloch in\nnuclear physics. Given the wide separation of scales, it becomes intuitive that\nthe Bloch equation admits iterative/perturbative solutions.

We take into account atomic relaxation and\ndephasing as well as the cavity loss and derive a coarse grained master\nequation to evaluate the work and efficiency, analytically. Analytical results\nare verified by microscopic numerical examination of the thermalization\ndynamics. We find that efficiency and work scale quadratically with the number\nof quantum coherent levels. Quantum coherence boost to the specific energy\n(work output per unit mass of the resource) is a profound fundamental\ndifference of quantum fuel from classical resources. We consider typical modern\nresonator set ups and conclude that multilevel phaseonium fuel can be utilized\nto overcome the decoherence in available systems. Preparation of the atomic\ncoherences and the associated cost of coherence are analyzed and the engine\noperation within the bounds of the second law is verified. Our results bring\nthe photonic Carnot engines much closer to the capabilities of current\nresonator technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 12:53:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 17:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2015 12:20:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 14:41:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["T\u00fcrkpen\u00e7e", "Deniz", ""], ["M\u00fcstecapl\u0131o\u011flu", "\u00d6zg\u00fcr E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.01633", "submitter": "Raoul Heese", "authors": "Raoul Heese and Matthias Freyberger", "title": "Entropic uncertainty bound for open pointer-based simultaneous\n  measurements of conjugate observables", "comments": "26 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "J.

Denoting the measurement\noutcomes for a property $q_{i}$ in the two pairs it enters by $V_{i}$ and\n$W_{i}$, the pair of measurement outcomes for $(q_{i},q_{j})$ is\n$(V_{i},W_{j})$. Contextuality is defined as follows: one computes the minimal\npossible value $\\Delta_{0}$ for the sum of $\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ (over\n$i=1,...,n$) that is allowed by the individual distributions of $V_{i}$ and\n$W_{i}$; one computes the minimal possible value $\\Delta_{\\min}$ for the sum of\n$\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ across all possible couplings of (i.e., joint\ndistributions imposed on) the entire set of random variables\n$V_{1},W_{1},...,V_{n},W_{n}$ in the system; and the system is considered\ncontextual if $\\Delta_{\\min}>\\Delta_{0}$ (otherwise\n$\\Delta_{\\min}=\\Delta_{0}$). This definition has its justification in the\ngeneral approach dubbed Contextuality-by-Default, and it allows for measurement\nerrors and signaling among the measured properties. The conjecture proved in\nthis paper specifies the value of $\\Delta_{\\min}-\\Delta_{0}$ in terms of the\ndistributions of the measurement outcomes $(V_{i},W_{j})$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Mar 2015 14:47:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2015 12:33:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 06:45:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:50:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kujala", "Janne V.", ""], ["Dzhafarov", "Ehtibar N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02229", "submitter": "Arkady Plotnitsky", "authors": "Arkady Plotnitsky", "title": "A Matter of Principle: The Principles of Quantum Theory, Dirac's\n  Equation, and Quantum Information", "comments": "42 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10701-015-9928-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.hist-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is concerned with the role of fundamental principles in\ntheoretical physics, especially quantum theory.

With the Langevin equations derived we give a full\ndisplay of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$\n, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For\nweak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order\nof the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it\nwill depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic\ncircumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling,\n`hot entanglement' is largely a fiction. In Paper III we will examine the case\n(C2) of \\textit{time-dependent driven coupling } which contains the parametric\npumping type described in [2] wherein entanglement was first shown to sustain\nat high temperatures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 05:03:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hsiang", "Jen-Tsung", ""], ["Hu", "B.

In this paper, we\nfirst review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the\nmost complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we\nrevisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that\nscales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with\nsuperpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the\nShor's states and the subgroup states, are described.

The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved\nin quantum computation is also addressed.

This \"reverse engineering\" of\nsuperradiance not only provides an avenue towards non-linear and quantum\nmechanical phenomena at x-ray energies, but also leads to a unified view on and\na better understanding of superradiance across different physical systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 06:18:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 09:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Longo", "Paolo", ""], ["Keitel", "Christoph H.", ""], ["Evers", "J\u00f6rg", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.04547", "submitter": "CSSudheer Kumar", "authors": "C.

A main point is that two different concepts, number and number\nvalue are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is\nvalid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It\nis not valid when different structures of each number type are being\nconsidered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by\nthemselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a\nnumber structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a\nreal or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as\nscalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are\ndescribed that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M\nlocations and at neighbor scaling levels. Scalar and vector structure valued\nfields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained.\nTwo complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear,\nwith one complex field associated with positions in $M$ and the other with\nposition dependent scaling factors. A derivation of the covariant derivative\nfor scalar and vector valued fields gives the same vector fields. The\nderivation shows that the complex vector field associated with scaling fiber\nlevels is the gradient of a complex scalar field. Use of these results in gauge\ntheory shows that the imaginary part of the vector field associated with M\npositions acts like the electromagnetic field.

This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are\nequivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is\nin direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence\nbetween ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An\nintrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all\nobservables that commute with the number of quantum jumps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 11:30:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kiukas", "Jukka", ""], ["Guta", "Madalin", ""], ["Lesanovsky", "Igor", ""], ["Garrahan", "Juan P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.05722", "submitter": "Alexander Carmele", "authors": "Julia Kabuss, Dmitry O.

We study the consequences of both answers set in a\ndevice (theory) independent framework, based only on observed statistics. We\nstart with taking up post-selection as an assumption and model the same using\nindependent devices governed by Boolean functions. We establish analogy between\nthe post selection functions and the general probabilistic games in a two party\nbinary input-output scenario. As an observation, we categorize all possible\npost-selection functions based on the effect on a uniform input probability\ndistribution. We find that post-selection can transform simple no signaling\nprobability distributions to signaling. Similarly, solving NP complete problems\nis easy independent of classical or quantum computation (in particular we prove\nthat Post RP = NP). Finally, we demonstrate an instance of the violation of the\npigeon hole principle independent of underlying theory. As result of our theory\nindependent modeling we conclude that post-selection as an assumption adds\npower to the underlying theory. In particular, quantum mechanics benefits more\nwith the post-selection assumption, only because it admits a more general set\nof allowed probabilities as compared to the local hidden variable model.\nWithout the assumption we associate a device independent efficiency factor to\nquantify the cost of post selection. Our study shows that in the real world\npost-selection is not efficient enough to be of any advantage. But from an\nadversarial perspective it is still of significance.

Since the structure of\npartial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if\nthe number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an\nultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the\nrich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order\nstructure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps\ntowards this direction.\n  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability\nclassification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A\n86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the\nentanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different\nkinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of\nthe partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this\nstructure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be\nmapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.\n  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that\na given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of\nentanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement\nclasses. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and\npropose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite\ngeneralization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement\nentropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The\nmultipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to\nconsider the measures to be the different manifestations of some \"unified\"\nnotion of entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2015 13:47:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 11:17:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 20:55:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2021 16:34:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Szalay", "Szil\u00e1rd", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.06109", "submitter": "W.

We firstly examine the system\ncoupled to a set of harmonic oscillators and studied the decoherence factor as\nfunction of the environment's ohmicity parameter. Secondly, we propose the\ntwo-level system coupled to a non-equilibrium environment, and show that these\nenvironments display non-Markovian effects for all values of the ohmicity\nparameter. The geometric phase of the two-level system is therefore computed\nunder the presence of both types of environment.

Although the spread of the walk is not substantially\nchanged by the addition of a second particle, we show that the presence of\nmultiple walkers can be beneficial for a procedure to estimate the probability\nof having a broken link.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 17:08:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 17:32:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Rigovacca", "Luca", ""], ["Di Franco", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.07128", "submitter": "Elena R.

Such waveguides are\nrealized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a\ntwo-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable\none-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route\ntoward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices,\nin which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the {\\it non-Hermitian}\nnature of transport.

Non-Hermitian transport in two lattice models\nis considered: a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field\n(Hatano-Nelson model), and a non-Hermitian driven binary lattice. In the former\ncase transport in spite of disorder is ensured by a mobility edge that arises\nbecause of a non-Hermitian delocalization transition.

The decoherence time of a single flux\nqubit is reported to be on the order of nanoseconds, which is much shorter than\nthe time required to carry out a computation on the timescale of seconds. In\nour contribution we investigate a model of four qubits with one qubit coupled\nto a phonon and (optionally) to environmental particles of high density of\nstates, called gravonons. The calculations indicate that when no gravonons are\npresent, the current in the qubit is flipped at some time and adiabatic\nevolution is discontinued. The time dependent wave functional becomes a\nnon-correctable superposition of many excited states. The results demonstrate\nthe possibility of effectively suppressing the current flip and allowing for\ncontinued adiabatic evolution when the entanglement to gravonons is included.\nThis adiabatic evolution is, however, a coherent evolution in high dimensional\nspacetime and cannot be understood as a solution of Schr\\\"odinger's time\ndependent equation in four dimensional spacetime.

The most familiar example is that of a\nplane wave propagating in free space. In the presence of any Hermitian\npotential, a wave's constant intensity is, however, immediately destroyed due\nto scattering. Here we show that this fundamental restriction is conveniently\nlifted when working with non-Hermitian potentials. In particular, we present a\nwhole new class of waves that have constant intensity in the presence of linear\nas well as of nonlinear inhomogeneous media with gain and loss. These solutions\nallow us to study, for the first time, the fundamental phenomenon of modulation\ninstability in an inhomogeneous environment.

Using\nparticle diagrams and the attendant methodology including loop counting it\nbecomes possible to calculate the fourth, sixth and eighth moments of embedded\nensembles in a straightforward way. The method, which will be called the method\nof particle diagrams, proves useful firstly by providing a means of classifying\nthe components of moments into particle paths, or loops, and secondly by giving\na simple algorithm for calculating the magnitude of combinatorial expressions\nprior to calculating them explicitly. By confining calculations to the limit\ncase $m \\ll l\\to\\infty$ this in many cases provides a sufficient excuse not to\ncalculate certain terms at all, since it can be foretold using the method of\nparticle diagrams that they will not survive in this asymptotic regime.\nApplying the method of particle diagrams washes out a great deal of the\ncomplexity intrinsic to the problem, with sufficient mathematical structure\nremaining to yield limiting statistics for the unified phase space of random\nmatrix theories.\n  Finally, since the unified form of random matrix theory is essentially the\nset of all randomised k-body potentials, it should be no surprise that the\nearly statistics calculated for the unified random matrix theories in some\ninstances resemble the statistics currently being discovered for quantum spin\nhypergraphs and other randomised potentials on graphs [HMH05,ES14,KLW14].
