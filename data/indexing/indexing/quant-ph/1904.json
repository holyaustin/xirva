Here, we show that an inelastic Hubbard interaction\nfundamentally alters the magnetism of the Hubbard model due to dissipation in\nspin-exchange processes, leading to sign reversal of magnetic correlations in\ndissipative quantum dynamics. This mechanism is applicable to both fermionic\nand bosonic Mott insulators, and can naturally be realized with ultracold atoms\nundergoing two-body inelastic collisions. The dynamical reversal of magnetic\ncorrelations can be detected by using a double-well optical lattice or\nquantum-gas microscopy, the latter of which facilitates the detection of the\nmagnetic correlations in one-dimensional systems because of spin-charge\nseparation.

As a result of the cooperative nature of these interactions, the\nsystem's dynamics are captured by the behavior of a single mean-field,\ncollective spin. In this mean-field limit, it has recently been shown that the\ninterplay between photon losses and periodic driving of light-matter coupling\ncan lead to time-crystalline-like behavior of the collective spin. In this\nwork, we investigate whether such a Dicke time crystal is stable to\nperturbations that explicitly break the mean-field solvability of the\nconventional Dicke model. In particular, we consider the addition of\nshort-range interactions between atoms, which breaks the collective coupling\nand leads to complex many-body dynamics. In this context, the interplay between\nperiodic driving, dissipation and interactions yields a rich set of dynamical\nresponses including long-lived and metastable Dicke time crystals, where losses\ncan cool down the many-body heating resulting from the continuous pump of\nenergy from the periodic drive. Specifically, when the additional short-range\ninteractions are ferromagnetic, we observe time crystalline behavior at\nnon-perturbative values of the coupling strength, suggesting the possible\nexistence of stable dynamical order in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body\nsystem.

However, this principle can be encoded differently,\ni.e., in different logico-algebraic objects. As a result, the logic of\nexperimental quantum propositions might have various semantics. E.g., it might\nhave either a total semantics, or a partial semantics (in which the valuation\nrelation -- i.e., a mapping from the set of atomic propositions to the set of\ntwo objects, 1 and 0 -- is not total), or a many-valued semantics (in which the\ngap between 1 and 0 is completed with truth degrees). Consequently, closed\nlinear subspaces of the Hilbert space representing experimental quantum\npropositions may be organized differently. For instance, they could be\norganized in the structure of a Hilbert lattice (or its generalizations)\nidentified with the bivalent semantics of quantum logic or in a structure\nidentified with a non-bivalent semantics. On the other hand, one can only\nverify -- at the same time -- propositions represented by the closed linear\nsubspaces corresponding to mutually commuting projection operators. This\nimplies that to decide which semantics is proper -- bivalent or non-bivalent --\nis not possible experimentally. Nevertheless, the latter allows simplification\nof certain no-go theorems in the foundation of quantum mechanics. In the\npresent paper, the Kochen-Specker theorem asserting the impossibility to\ninterpret, within the orthodox quantum formalism, projection operators as\ndefinite {0,1}-valued (pre-existent) properties, is taken as an example.

Kohn-Sham density functional\ntheory (KS-DFT), due to its efficiency and accuracy, has achieved great success\nin describing ground state problems.

In present work, we explore further the same\nmethodology to describe CT excitations.

Applying localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) to\nconventional DFAs, a recently developed method in our group to effectively\nreduce the delocalization error, can improve the results. Overall, the\nperformance of this methodology is better than time dependant DFT (TDDFT) with\nconventional DFAs. In addition, it shows that results from LOSC-DFAs in this\nmethod reach similar accuracy to other methods, such as $\\Delta$SCF, $G_0W_0$\nwith Bethe-Salpeter equations, particle-particle random phase approximation,\nand even high-level wavefunction method like CC2.

This quantum superefficiency is however\nvery fragile to noise or decoherence, and typically disappears with any small\namount of random noise asymptotically at large $N$.

Decoherence is represented by the broad\nclass of noises commuting with the phase rotation, which includes depolarizing,\nphase-flip, and thermal quantum noises. In these general conditions, explicit\nexpressions are derived for the quantum Fisher information quantifying the\nultimate achievable efficiency for estimation.

In our version, a large\nsample of neutral atoms should be localised in an optical lattice overlapping a\ngrid of detection sites, all tailored as the single site in Fortson's work. The\nmethodology is of general applicability, but as an example we estimate the\nachievable signal in an experiment probing a nuclear spin independent parity\nviolation on the line\n$6\\mathrm{s}\\,^2\\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$--$5\\mathrm{d}\\,^2\\mathrm{D}_{3/2}$ in\n$^{133}$Cs. The projected result is based on realistic parameters and\n\\textit{ab initio} calculations of transition amplitudes, using the\nrelativistic coupled-cluster method. The final result is a predicted\nspectroscopic signature, evidencing parity violation, of the order of 1 Hz, for\na sample of $10^8$ atoms.

It is demonstrated that the twisted photon defined by the\nLaguerre-Gauss wave function is luminal. Its apparent subluminality takes place\nbecause the photon energy is contributed by the hidden transversal motion while\nthe average transversal momentum vanishes. Nevertheless, the Laguerre-Gauss\nphoton can be self-consistently modeled by a subluminal centroid with a nonzero\nkinematic (Lorentz-invariant) mass. An applicability of this model is a\nconsequence of independence of centroid parameters from the longitudinal\ncoordinate. All twisted and untwisted Laguerre-Gauss modes are subliminal. The\nLaguerre-Gauss electron has similar properties. The new effect of a\nquantization of the velocity and mass of the Laguerre-Gauss photon and electron\nis predicted.

In some applications,\nthe inputs of interest satisfy the spectral condition and we prove\nsignificantly stronger bounds than the worst case bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Apr 2019 18:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kwok", "Tsz Chiu", ""], ["Lau", "Lap Chi", ""], ["Ramachandran", "Akshay", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.03218", "submitter": "Nengkun Yu", "authors": "Nengkun Yu", "title": "Quantum Closeness Testing: A Streaming Algorithm and Applications", "comments": "Comments are welcome", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the main subjects of this paper is to study quantum property testing\nwith local measurement.

In particular, we examine proposals to\nestimate the result of an external measurement made on an open quantum systems\nduring a period where it is also undergoing continuous monitoring. A full\nanalysis shows that the non-demolition principle is not actually violated, and\nso a well-posed as a statistical inference problem can be formulated. We extend\nthe formalism to consider multiple independent external measurements made on\nthe system over the course of a continual period of monitoring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Apr 2019 18:06:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gough", "John E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06378", "submitter": "Francisco Fern\\'andez Dr.", "authors": "Francisco M.

Here, we use photon pairs\nentangled in orbital angular momentum (OAM) to show that a real object's\nangular rotation can be measured non-locally.

This ubiquitous model is of relevance in a number of physical systems\nwhere, in general, one has neither control over the bosonic modes, nor the\nability to tune distinct interaction mechanisms. Despite this apparent lack of\ncontrol, we present a suitable transformation that approximately maps the\nspin-boson dynamics into that of a tunable multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model\nundergoing dissipation. Interestingly, the latter model describes the coherent\ninteraction between a spin and a single bosonic mode via the simultaneous\nexchange of n bosons per spin excitation.

Such a\nphase transition has been reported in the recent pressure tuned experiments in\nthe Shastry-Sutherland lattice material $\\mathrm{SrCu_2 (BO_3)_2}$. The\nnon-symmorphic lattice structure of the Shastry-Sutherland compound leads to\nextinction points in the scattering, where we predict sharp signatures of a\nDQCP in both the phonon and magnon spectra associated with the spinon\ncontinuum. The effect of weak interlayer couplings present in the three\ndimensional material is also discussed.

Following this trail, the comparison between\nsuperpositions and products of Fock states is performed. It is found an\ninteresting phenomenon that for the superposition and the corresponding product\nof Fock state (non-Gaussian states), their averaged quantum correlations are\nnearly same, whereas the distributions of their quantum correlations might be\ndifferent. Therefore, superpositions may affect the distributions of the\nquantum correlations. In addition, to examine how the Gaussian states affect\nthe quantum correlations, we compare the typical Gaussian states with the\nnon-Gaussian states (superpositions and products of Fock states). It is\ndiscovered that the non-Gaussian-state input could result in the quantum\ncorrelation that is either positive or negative, depending on the number of the\ninput modes and the number of the photons in each mode, whereas the\nGaussian-state input always leads to the non-negative quantum correlation.\nBesides, it is demonstrated that with the increase of the disorder strength,\nthe mean strength of the quantum correlation increases for multi-mode-state\ninputs (except for multi-mode-coherent-state inputs). These results may be\nuseful to control and adjust the quantum properties of scattered modes after\nthe quantized lights propagating through the disordered medium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Apr 2019 08:46:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Dong", ""], ["Yao", "Yao", ""], ["Li", "Mo", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.09777", "submitter": "Naoto Takanashi Mr.", "authors": "Naoto Takanashi, Wataru Inokuchi, Takahiro Serikawa, Akira Furusawa", "title": "Generation and measurement of a squeezed vacuum up to 100 MHz at 1550 nm\n  with a semi-monolithic optical parametric oscillator designed towards direct\n  coupling with waveguide modules", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures; Fig. 7 and descriptions added, typos corrected,\n  journal-ref added", "journal-ref": "Optics Express 27, 18900-18909 (2019)", "doi": "10.1364/OE.27.018900", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report generation and measurement of a squeezed vacuum from a\nsemi-monolithic Fabry-Perot optical parametric oscillator (OPO) up to 100 MHz\nat 1550 nm.

The scale invariance, which appears near the\nquantum critical region in condensed matter physics, is considered to be\nimportant for the fast decay of the OTOC. In this paper, we focus on the\none-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ model, which exhibits quantum criticality in a\ncertain parameter region, and investigate the relationship between scrambling\nand the scale invariance. We quantify scrambling by the averaged OTOC over the\nPauli operator basis, which is related to the operator space entanglement\nentropy (OSEE). Using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)\nmethod, we numerically calculate time dependence of the OSEE in the early time\nregion in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the averaged OTOC decays faster\nin the gapless region than in the gapped region. In the gapless region, the\naveraged OTOC behaves in the same manner regardless of the anisotropy\nparameter. This result is consistent with the fact that the low energy\nexcitations of the gapless region belong to the same universality class as the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the central charge c = 1. Furthermore, we\nestimate c by fitting the numerical data of the OSEE with an analytical result\nof the two-dimensional conformal field theory, and confirmed that c is close to\nunity.

The greater width\nof Davydov solitons stabilizes the soliton upon reflection from such a massive\nbarrier and increases the probability of tunneling through it, whereas the\ngreater isotropy of the exciton-lattice coupling suppresses the tunneling\nefficiency by increasing the interaction time between the Davydov soliton and\nthe barrier, thereby prolonging the tunneling time through the barrier and\nenhancing the probability for reflection from the latter.

We determine lower and\nupper bounds on the quantum rebound capacities in various scenarios of\ninterest, and we also discuss cases in which adaptive schemes provide an\nadvantage over non-adaptive schemes in zero-error quantum rebound protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 14:08:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:08:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Siddhartha", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.10378", "submitter": "Zhenyu Cai", "authors": "Zhenyu Cai, Michael A.

High fidelity\nsingle-qubit gates exceeding the threshold of error correction codes like the\nsurface code have been demonstrated, while two-qubit gates have reached 98\\%\nfidelity and are improving rapidly. However, there are other types of error ---\nsuch as charge leakage and propagation --- that may occur in quantum dot arrays\nand which cannot be corrected by quantum error correction codes, making them\npotentially damaging even when their probability is small. We propose a surface\ncode architecture for silicon quantum dot spin qubits that is robust against\nleakage errors by incorporating multi-electron mediator dots. Charge leakage in\nthe qubit dots is transferred to the mediator dots via charge relaxation\nprocesses and then removed using charge reservoirs attached to the mediators. A\nstabiliser-check cycle, optimised for our hardware, then removes the\ncorrelations between the residual physical errors. Through simulations we\nobtain the surface code threshold for the charge leakage errors and show that\nin our architecture the damage due to charge leakage errors is reduced to a\nsimilar level to that of the usual depolarising gate noise. Spin leakage errors\nin our architecture are constrained to only ancilla qubits and can be removed\nduring quantum error correction via reinitialisations of ancillae, which ensure\nthe robustness of our architecture against spin leakage as well. Our use of an\nelongated mediator dots creates spaces throughout the quantum dot array for\ncharge reservoirs, measuring devices and control gates, providing the\nscalability in the design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:19:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2019 15:45:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2019 12:37:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Zhenyu", ""], ["Fogarty", "Michael A.", ""], ["Schaal", "Simon", ""], ["Patomaki", "Sofia", ""], ["Benjamin", "Simon C.", ""], ["Morton", "John J.

In this article, we\nintroduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called\ntransferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a\nclassical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. We study two subclasses of\nsuch kernels: H\\\"ormander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on\nfinite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing\nchannel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on\n$d$ qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels\nthat randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work\nby Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov\nkernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different\nnon-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article\nis the application of this transference principle to the estimation of various\ncapacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the\nfirst time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking.

For weak\nsystem-bath coupling, the fluctuations around a deterministic base path obey\nGaussian statistics, where we assume that the quantum adiabatic theorem is also\nsatisfied for fluctuating paths. We show that universal non-Abelian geometric\ndephasing (NAGD) contributions are contained in the fluctuation-averaged\nevolution operator. This operator plays a key role in all experimental\nprotocols proposed in this work for the detection of NAGD. In particular, we\nformulate interference measurements providing full access to NAGD. Apart from a\nfactor due to the dynamic phase and its fluctuations, the averaged evolution\noperator contains the averaged Berry matrix. A polar decomposition of this\nnon-unitary matrix into the product of a unitary, $V$, and a positive\nsemi-definite Hermitian matrix, $R$, reveals the physics of the NAGD\ncontributions. Unlike the conventional dynamic dephasing rate, the NAGD\neigenrates encoded by $R$ depend on the loop orientation sense and, in\nparticular, change sign under a reversal of the direction. A negative rate then\nimplies amplification of coherences as compared to the ones when only dynamic\ndephasing is present. The non-Abelian character of geometric dephasing is\nrooted in the non-commutativity of $V$ and $R$ and causes smoking-gun\nsignatures in interference experiments.

The time required for a\nMarkov chain to converge to its stationary distribution is known as the\nclassical mixing time. In this article, we deal with analog quantum algorithms\nfor mixing. First, we provide an analog quantum algorithm that given a Markov\nchain, allows us to sample from its stationary distribution in a time that\nscales as the sum of the square root of the classical mixing time and the\nsquare root of the classical hitting time. Our algorithm makes use of the\nframework of interpolated quantum walks and relies on Hamiltonian evolution in\nconjunction with von Neumann measurements.\n  There also exists a different notion for quantum mixing: the problem of\nsampling from the limiting distribution of quantum walks, defined in a\ntime-averaged sense. In this scenario, the quantum mixing time is defined as\nthe time required to sample from a distribution that is close to this limiting\ndistribution. Recently we provided an upper bound on the quantum mixing time\nfor Erd\\\"os-Renyi random graphs [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 050501 (2020)]. Here, we\nalso extend and expand upon our findings therein.

Next, relativistic many-body effects\nare determined using the matter cluster in a way familiar from the\nnonrelativistic CC. This step can be nontrivial. By allowing the matter cluster\nto deviate from its traditional excitation-only form, vacuum polarization\neffects are generated using the pair part of Coulomb interaction.

Yet, the parton and\nthe rest of the nucleon have to form a colour-singlet state due to colour\nconfinement, and so have to be in strongly correlated quantum states - we thus\nencounter the EPR paradox at the sub-nucleonic scale.
