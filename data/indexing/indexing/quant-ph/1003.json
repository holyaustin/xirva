In Part I we introduce a new formalism\nfor quantum strategies, which specify the actions of one party in any\nmulti-party interaction involving the exchange of multiple quantum messages\namong the parties. This formalism associates with each strategy a single\npositive semidefinite operator acting only upon the tensor product of the input\nand output message spaces for the strategy. We establish three fundamental\nproperties of this new representation for quantum strategies and we list\nseveral applications, including a quantum version of von Neumann's celebrated\n1928 Min-Max Theorem for zero-sum games and an efficient algorithm for\ncomputing the value of such a game.\n  In Part II we establish several properties of a class of quantum operations\nthat can be implemented locally with shared quantum entanglement or classical\nrandomness. In particular, we establish the existence of a ball of local\noperations with shared randomness lying within the space spanned by the\nno-signaling operations and centred at the completely noisy channel. The\nexistence of this ball is employed to prove that the weak membership problem\nfor local operations with shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard. We also\nprovide characterizations of local operations in terms of linear functionals\nthat are positive and \"completely\" positive on a certain cone of Hermitian\noperators, under a natural notion of complete positivity appropriate to that\ncone. We end the thesis with a discussion of the properties of no-signaling\nquantum operations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 23:38:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Mar 2012 16:17:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Gutoski", "Gus", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.0055", "submitter": "Yusuke Ide", "authors": "Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno", "title": "Continuous-time quantum walks on the threshold network model", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": "Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, Vol.20, pp.1079-1090\n  (2010)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is well known that many real world networks have the power-law degree\ndistribution (scale-free property).

It\ndescribes an inseparable connection between quantum systems, and properties\nthereof. In a quantum mechanical description even systems far apart from each\nother can share a common state. This entanglement of the subsystems, although\narising from mathematical principles, is no mere abstract concept, but can be\ntested in experiment, and be utilized in modern quantum information theory\nprocedures, such as quantum teleportation. In particular, entangled states play\na crucial role in testing our understanding of reality, by violating Bell\ninequalities. While the role of entanglement is well studied in the realm of\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics, its significance in a relativistic quantum\ntheory is a relatively new field of interest. In this work the consequences of\na relativistic description of quantum entanglement are discussed. We analyze\nthe representations of the symmetry groups of special relativity, i.e. of the\nLorentz group, and the Poincar\\'e group, on the Hilbert space of states. We\ndescribe how unitary, irreducible representations of the Poincar\\'e group for\nmassive spin 1/2 particles are constructed from representations of Wigner's\nlittle group. We then proceed to investigate the role of the Wigner rotations\nin the transformation of quantum states under a change of inertial reference\nframe. Considering different partitions of the Hilbert space of 2 particles, we\nfind that the entanglement of the quantum states appears different in different\ninertial frames, depending on the form of the states, the chosen inertial\nframes, and the particular choice of partition. It is explained, how, despite\nof this, the maximally possible violation of Bell inequalities is frame\nindependent, when using appropriate spin observables, which are related to the\nPauli-Ljubanski vector, a Casimir operator of the Poincar\\'e group.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2010 14:01:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Friis", "Nicolai", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.1877", "submitter": "Eduardo Zambrano", "authors": "Eduardo Zambrano and Alfredo M.

The new scheme has three advantages: it does not utilize entangled\nstates while it can preserve all merits in the existing schemes; the\nintegrality of the signature can avoid being disavowed by the receiver; and, it\nprovides a higher efficiency in transmission and reduces the complexity of\nimplementation. Furthermore, we present a technique such that the quantum\nmessage can keep secret to the arbitrator in a arbitrated quantum signature\nscheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2010 14:22:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zou", "Xiangfu", ""], ["Qiu", "Daowen", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2344", "submitter": "Pedro Sancho", "authors": "Pedro Sancho", "title": "Identical two-particle interferometry in diffraction gratings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.

This\nbecomes possible by the objective conditional probabilities which represent the\ntransition probabilities between the outcomes of successive quantum\nmeasurements and have been introduced by the author in some recent papers. The\nsecond hypothesis holds as well in the classical case, but a certain\nincompleteness of reality is typical of quantum mechanics and the origin of\nmany quantum phenomena.

I show that the prior information about\nany type of constituent (state, channel, or observable) allows us to\nreformulate the discrimination among finite number of alternatives as the\ndiscrimination among finite number of average constituents. Using this\nframework I solve several unambiguous tasks. I present a solution to optimal\nunambiguous comparison of two ensembles of unknown quantum states. I consider\ntwo cases: 1) The two unknown states are arbitrary pure states of qudits. 2)\nAlternatively, they are coherent states of single-mode optical fields. For this\ncase I propose simple and optimal experimental setup composed of beam-splitters\nand a photodetector. As a second tasks I consider an unambiguous identification\n(UI) of coherent states. In this task identical quantum systems are prepared in\ncoherent states and labeled as unknown and reference states, respectively. The\npromise is that one reference state is the same as the unknown state and the\ntask is to find out unambiguously which one it is. The particular choice of the\nreference states is unknown to us, and only the probability distribution\ndescribing this choice is known. In a general case when multiple copies of\nunknown and reference states are available I propose a scheme consisting of\nbeamsplitters and photodetectors that is optimal within linear optics. UI can\nbe considered as a search in a quantum database, whose elements are the\nreference states and the query is represented by the unknown state. This\nperspective motivated me to show that reference states can be recovered after\nthe measurement and might be used (with reduced success rate) in subsequent UI.\nMoreover, I analyze the influence of noise in preparation of coherent states on\nthe performance of the proposed setup. Another problem I address is the\nunambiguous comparison of a pair of unknown qudit unitary channels. I\ncharacterize all solutions and identify the optimal ones. I prove that in\noptimal experiments for comparison of unitary channels the entanglement is\nnecessary. The last task I studied is the unambiguous comparison of unknown\nnon-degenerate projective measurements. I distinguish between measurement\ndevices with apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases only the\ndifference of the measurements can be concluded unambiguously. For the labeled\ncase I derive the optimal strategy if each unknown measurement is used only\nonce. However, if the apparatuses are not labeled, then each measurement device\nmust be used (at least) twice. In particular, for qubit measurement apparatuses\nwith unlabeled outcomes I derive the optimal test state in the two-shots\nscenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2010 23:51:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sedl\u00e1k", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2450", "submitter": "Usha Devi A.

Using a sophisticated\nmagnetic switching sequence involving four rotations of the hyperfine magnetic\nfield, two correlated coherent decay pulses with different polarizations can be\ngenerated out of one excitation, providing single-photon entanglement in the\nkeV regime.

In particular, the\nvacuum energy for a massless \\phi^{2N} (N=1,2,3,...) quantum field theory was\nstudied. The first two Taylor coefficients in this dimensional expansion were\ncalculated {\\it exactly} and a set of graphical rules were devised that could\nbe used to calculate approximately the higher coefficients in the series. This\napproach is mathematically valid and gives accurate results, but it has not\nbeen actively pursued and investigated. Subsequently, in 1998 Bender and\nBoettcher discovered that PT-symmetric quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians of the\nform H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\\epsilon, where \\epsilon\\geq0, have real spectra. These new\nkinds of complex non-Dirac-Hermitian Hamiltonians define physically acceptable\nquantum-mechanical theories. This result in quantum mechanics suggests that the\ncorresponding non-Dirac-Hermitian D-dimensional \\phi^2(i\\phi)^\\epsilon quantum\nfield theories might also have real spectra. To examine this hypothesis, we\nreturn to the technique devised in 1992 and in this paper we calculate the\nfirst two coefficients in the dimensional expansion of the ground-state energy\nof this complex non-Dirac-Hermitian quantum field theory.

In pure diamonds,\nthe environment consists of hundreds of C-13 nuclear spins randomly spreading\nin several nanometers range forming a spin bath. Controlling and prolonging the\nelectron spin coherence under the influence of spin bath are challenging tasks\nfor the quantum information processing. On the other hand, for a given bath\ndistribution, many of its characters are encoded in the electron spin\ncoherence. So it is natural to ask the question: is it possible to 'decode' the\nelectron spin coherence, and extract the information about the bath structures?\nHere we show that, among hundreds of C-13 bath spins, there exist strong\ncoupling clusters, which give rise to the millisecond oscillations of the\nelectron spin coherence. By analyzing these oscillation features, the key\nproperties of the coherent nuclear spin clusters, such as positions,\norientations, and coupling strengths, could be uniquely identified. This\naddressability of the few-nuclear-spin cluster extends the feasibility of using\nthe nuclear spins in diamond as qubits in quantum computing.

In particular, this rate is strictly\npositive for every non-constant quantum channel, including classical channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Mar 2010 20:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 09:03:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2011 14:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2012 18:17:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hayden", "Patrick", ""], ["Winter", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5005", "submitter": "Bob Coecke", "authors": "Bob Coecke, Bill Edwards and Robert W.

An optical cavity with a mechanically compliant boundary enhances\nthe optomechanical interaction, but also gives rise to qualitatively new\ncoupled dynamics. As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V. Braginsky analyzed\ntheoretically the role of radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement\nprocess, but it has remained experimentally unexplored for many decades. Here,\nwe use whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical microresonators to study these\nradiation pressure phenomena. Optical microresonators simultaneously host\noptical and mechanical modes, which are systematically analyzed and optimized\nto feature ultra-low mechanical dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the\nmechanical oscillation period (i.e. the \"resolved-sideband regime\") and large\noptomechanical coupling. It is demonstrated that dynamical backaction can be\nemployed to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited\nrandom motion. Utilizing this novel technique together with cryogenic\npre-cooling of the mechanical oscillator, the phonon occupation of mechanical\nradial-breathing modes could be reduced to about 60 excitation quanta. The\ncorresponding displacement fluctuations are monitored interferometrically with\na sensitivity at the level of 10^-18 m/Hz^(1/2), which is below the imprecision\nat the standard quantum limit (SQL). It is shown that optical measurement\ntechniques employed here are operating in a near-ideal manner according to the\nprinciples of quantum measurement, displaying a backaction-imprecision product\nclose to the quantum limit.
