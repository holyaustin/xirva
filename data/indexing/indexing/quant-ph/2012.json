Additionally, a DQW can always be converted to\nthe corresponding 4-state QW with identical probability measures. In other\nwords, a class of 4-state QWs can be realized by DQWs with 2 states. In this\nwork, we reveal that there is a 2-state DQW corresponding to the 4-state Grover\nwalk. Then, we derive the weak limit theorem of the class of DQWs corresponding\nto 4-state QWs which can be regarded as the generalized Grover walks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 08:09:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kiumi", "Chusei", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.00350", "submitter": "Mark T.

In particular,\nthe crucial point of the debate is whether it is possible to conclude anything\non the quantum nature of the gravitational field, provided that two quantum\nsystems become entangled due to solely the gravitational interaction.\nTypically, this question has been addressed by assuming an underlying physical\ntheory to describe the gravitational interaction, but no systematic approach to\ncharacterise the set of possible gravitational theories which are compatible\nwith the observation of entanglement has been proposed. Here, we introduce the\nframework of Generalised Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) to the study of the\nnature of the gravitational field. This framework has the advantage that it\nonly relies on the set of operationally accessible states, transformations, and\nmeasurements, without presupposing an underlying theory. Hence, it provides a\nframework to systematically study all theories compatible with the detection of\nentanglement generated via the gravitational interaction between two\nnon-classical systems. Assuming that such entanglement is observed we prove a\nno-go theorem stating that the following statements are incompatible: i) the\ntwo non-classical systems are independent subsystems, ii) the gravitational\nfield is a physical degree of freedom which mediates the interaction and iii)\nthe gravitational field is classical. Moreover we argue that conditions i) and\nii) should be met, and hence that the gravitational field is non-classical.\nNon-classicality does not imply that the gravitational field is quantum, and to\nillustrate this we provide examples of non-classical and non-quantum theories\nwhich are logically consistent with the other conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 16:37:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Galley", "Thomas D.", ""], ["Giacomini", "Flaminia", ""], ["Selby", "John H.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.01450", "submitter": "Alexander Duthie", "authors": "Alexander Duthie, Sthitadhi Roy, and David E.

We also address the one-shot catalytic dynamic entanglement\ncost of a bipartite quantum channel under a larger class of free superchannels\nthat could generate the dynamic entanglement which is asymptotically\nnegligible; it is bounded by the generalized log-robustness of channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 14:42:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Ho-Joon", ""], ["Lee", "Soojoon", ""], ["Lami", "Ludovico", ""], ["Plenio", "Martin B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02658", "submitter": "Ali Motazedifard", "authors": "Ali Motazedifard, Seyed Ahmad Madani, and N.

In case of Rydberg atoms,\nthe proposed protocol is intrinsically different from typical schemes based on\nRydberg blockade or antiblockade. Our study paves a new route to build robust\nmultiqubit gates with Rydberg atoms trapped in optical arrays or with\nsuperconducting circuits.

The role of dimension in\nthe nature of these transitions is an open problem.

The central result is that each infinitesimal time interval one new\n(incoming) mode of the environment gets coupled (entangled) to the open system,\nand one new (outgoing) mode gets irreversibly decoupled (disentangled from\nfuture). Moreover, each moment of time, only a few relevant modes (3 - 4 in the\nconsidered cases) are non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion.\nThese relevant mode change (flow, or renormalize) with time. As a result, the\ntemporal entanglement has the structure of a matrix-product operator. This\nallows us to pose a number of questions and to answer them in this work: what\nis the intrinsic quantum complexity of a real time motion; does this complexity\nsaturate with time, or grows without bounds; how to do the real-time\nrenormalization group in a justified way; how the classical Brownian stochastic\ntrajectories emerge from the quantum evolution; how to construct the few-mode\nrepresentations of non-Markovian environments. We provide illustrative\nsimulations of the spin-boson model for various spectral densities of the\nenvironment: semicircle, subohmic, Ohmic, and superohmic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2020 21:12:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2021 23:54:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2021 09:09:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 May 2021 22:02:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Polyakov", "Evgeny A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.04068", "submitter": "Pavel Panteleev", "authors": "Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev", "title": "Quantum LDPC Codes with Almost Linear Minimum Distance", "comments": "16 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a construction of quantum LDPC codes of dimension $\\Theta(\\log N)$\nand distance $\\Theta(N/\\log N)$ as the code length $N\\to\\infty$.

We give a strong\nnegative answer by showing that the log n overhead is still necessary for some\ntransitive functions even when we allow the quantum communication protocol an\nerror probability that can be arbitrarily close to 1/2.\n  We also give, among other things, a general recipe to construct functions for\nwhich the log n overhead is required in the BCW simulation in the bounded-error\ncommunication model, even if the parties are allowed to share an arbitrary\nprior entangled state for free.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2020 18:58:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Sourav", ""], ["Chattopadhyay", "Arkadev", ""], ["H\u00f8yer", "Peter", ""], ["Mande", "Nikhil S.", ""], ["Paraashar", "Manaswi", ""], ["de Wolf", "Ronald", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.05235", "submitter": "Lukas Homeier", "authors": "Lukas Homeier and Christian Schweizer and Monika Aidelsburger and\n  Arkady Fedorov and Fabian Grusdt", "title": "$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories and Kitaev's toric code: A scheme\n  for analog quantum simulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.str-el hep-lat", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Kitaev's toric code is an exactly solvable model with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological order, which has potential applications in quantum\ncomputation and error correction.

Universally, we observe that the\nperformance of random states for dense coding as well as teleportation\ndecreases with the increase of the rank of states which we have shown to be\nsurmounted by the local pre-processing operations performed on the shared\nstates before starting the protocols, irrespective of the rank of the states.\nThe local pre-processing employed here is based on positive operator valued\nmeasurements along with classical communication and we show that unlike dense\ncoding with two-qubit random states, senders' operations are always helpful to\nprobabilistically enhance the capabilities of implementing dense coding as well\nas teleportation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:22:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Mar 2021 20:50:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Rivu", ""], ["Gupta", "Shashank", ""], ["Mal", "Shiladitya", ""], ["De", "Aditi Sen", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.05885", "submitter": "Sebastian Erne Ph.

Meanwhile, in the case of odd\n$\\mathcal{E}_z$-sine modes, the electric intensity distribution at the\ntwo-fiber center attains a local minimum of exactly zero. We find that the\ndifferences between the results of the coupled mode theory and the exact mode\ntheory are large when the fiber separation distance is small and either the\nfiber radius is small or the light wavelength is large. We show that, in the\ncase where the two nanofibers are not identical, the intensity distribution is\nsymmetric about the radial principal axis and asymmetric about the tangential\nprincipal axis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:54:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:42:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kien", "Fam Le", ""], ["Ruks", "Lewis", ""], ["Chormaic", "Sile Nic", ""], ["Busch", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.06080", "submitter": "Songtao Chen", "authors": "Songtao Chen, Salim Ourari, Mouktik Raha, Christopher M.

While most of interesting cases of\ndisordered hyperuniformity are provided by complex many-body systems like\nliquids or amorphous solids, classical spin chains with certain long-range\ninteractions have been shown to demonstrate the same phenomenon. It is\nwell-known that the transverse field Ising model shows a quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) at zero temperature.

High-precision simulations of these cases are complicated\nbecause of the presence of highly nontrivial long-range interactions. We\nperform extensive analysis of these systems using density matrix\nrenormalization group to study the possibilities of phase transitions and the\nmechanism by which they lose hyperuniformity.

An interesting feature of the phase transitions\nin these disordered hyperuniform spin chains is that, depending on the\nparameter values, the presence of transverse magnetic field may remarkably lead\nto increase in the order of the ground state as measured by the \"$\\tau$ order\nmetric,\" even if hyperuniformity is lost. Therefore, it would be possible to\ndesign materials to target specific novel quantum behaviors in the presence of\na transverse magnetic field.

The solution method is generic in that it\napplies for any values of the couplings. This mapping generalizes both the\nclassic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis solution of the XY model and an exact solution of a\nspin chain recently given by Fendley, dubbed \"free fermions in disguise.\" Like\nFendley's original example, the free-fermion operators that solve the model are\ngenerally highly nonlinear and nonlocal, but can nonetheless be found\nexplicitly using a transfer operator defined in terms of the independent sets\nof $G$. The associated single-particle energies are calculated using the roots\nof the independence polynomial of $G$, which are guaranteed to be real by a\nresult of Chudnovsky and Seymour. Furthermore, recognizing (even-hole,\nclaw)-free graphs can be done in polynomial time, so recognizing when a spin\nmodel is solvable in this way is efficient. We give several example families of\nsolvable models for which no Jordan-Wigner solution exists, and we give a\ndetailed analysis of such a spin chain having 4-body couplings using this\nmethod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Elman", "Samuel J.", ""], ["Chapman", "Adrian", ""], ["Flammia", "Steven T.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.07861", "submitter": "Geoffrey Penington", "authors": "Patrick Hayden and Geoff Penington", "title": "Black hole microstates vs. the additivity conjectures", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We argue that one of the following statements must be true: (a) extensive\nviolations of quantum information theory's additivity conjectures exist or (b)\nthere exists a set of `disentangled' black hole microstates that can account\nfor the entire Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, up to at most a subleading $O(1)$\ncorrection.

This results in a Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic\ndifferential equation (QSDE) whose drift and dispersion terms are affine and\nlinear functions of the system variables. The quasilinearity of the QSDE leads\nto tractable dynamics of mean values and higher-order multi-point moments of\nthe system variables driven by vacuum input fields. This allows for the\nclosed-form computation of the quasi-characteristic function of the invariant\nquantum state of the system and infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rates for a\nclass of cost functionals. The tractability of the moment dynamics is also used\nfor mean square optimal Luenberger observer design in a measurement-based\nfiltering problem for a quasilinear quantum plant, which leads to a Kalman-like\nquantum filter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:01:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Vladimirov", "Igor G.", ""], ["Petersen", "Ian R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.08217", "submitter": "Yiming Pan", "authors": "Bing Wang, Jiaqi Quan, Jianfei Han, Xiaopeng Shen, Hongwei Wu, and\n  Yiming Pan", "title": "Photonic Floquet time crystals", "comments": "39 pages, 5 figures, supplementary materials, 6 suppl. figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.other physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The public and scientists constantly have different perspectives.

Relatively efficient methods have been devised for verifying\nsparse quantum states, but dense quantum states have remained costly to verify.\nHere I present a novel method for estimating the fidelity $F(\\mu,\\tau)$ between\na preparable quantum state $\\mu$ and a classically specified target state\n$\\tau$, using simple quantum circuits and on-the-fly classical calculation (or\nlookup) of selected amplitudes of $\\tau$. Notably, in the targeted regime the\nmethod demonstrates an exponential quantum advantage in sample efficiency over\nany classical method. The simplest version of the method is efficient for\nanticoncentrated quantum states (including many states that are hard to\nsimulate classically), with a sample cost of approximately\n$4\\epsilon^{-2}(1-F)dp_{\\text{coll}}$ where $\\epsilon$ is the desired precision\nof the estimate, $d$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space in which $\\mu$ and\n$\\tau$ reside, and $p_{\\text{coll}}$ is the collision probability of the target\ndistribution. I also present a more sophisticated version of the method, which\nuses any efficiently preparable and well-characterized quantum state as an\nimportance sampler to further reduce the number of copies of $\\mu$ needed.\nThough some challenges remain, this work takes a significant step toward\nscalable verification of complex states produced by quantum processors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2020 18:01:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bennink", "Ryan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.08474", "submitter": "Ir\\'en\\'ee Fr\\'erot", "authors": "Guillem M\\\"uller-Rigat, Albert Aloy, Maciej Lewenstein and Ir\\'en\\'ee\n  Fr\\'erot", "title": "Many-body Bell's inequalities from average two-body correlations", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures.

We show that each of the thermal state probabilities is\nadiabatically mapped onto the respective collective spin-excitation\nconfiguration and thus the temperature estimation is carried out simply by\nperforming a spin-dependent laser fluorescence measurement at the end of the\nadiabatic transition. We characterize the temperature uncertainty in terms of\nthe Fisher information and show that the state projection measurement saturates\nthe fundamental quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound for quantum oscillator at thermal\nequilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2020 12:58:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kirkova", "Aleksandrina V.", ""], ["Li", "Weibin", ""], ["Ivanov", "Peter A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.08927", "submitter": "Kai Sun", "authors": "Kai Sun, Jin-Shi Xu, Xiao-Ye Xu, Yong-Jian Han, Chuan-Feng Li, and\n  Guang-Can Guo", "title": "Optical demonstration of quantum fault-tolerant threshold", "comments": "12 pages, 14 figures, submitted to the journal on 27 July", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A major challenge in practical quantum computation is the ineludible errors\ncaused by the interaction of quantum systems with their environment.\nFault-tolerant schemes, in which logical qubits are encoded by several physical\nqubits, enable correct output of logical qubits under the presence of errors.\nHowever, strict requirements to encode qubits and operators render the\nimplementation of a full fault-tolerant computation challenging even for the\nachievable noisy intermediate-scale quantum technology.

A particularly popular gate set in the literature on quantum\ncomputing consists of arbitrary single-qubit gates and 2-qubit CNOT gates. A\nCNOT gate is however not always the natural multi-qubit interaction that can be\nimplemented on a given physical quantum computer, necessitating a compilation\nstep that transforms these CNOT gates to the native gate set. A particularly\ninteresting case where compilation is necessary is for ion trap quantum\ncomputers, where the natural entangling operation can act on more than 2 qubits\nand can even act globally on all qubits at once.

First, we find\nan efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary circuit consisting of\nClifford gates and arbitrary phase gates into a circuit consisting of\nsingle-qubit gates and a number of global interactions proportional to the\nnumber of non-Clifford phases present in the original circuit. Second, we find\na general strategy to transform a global gate that targets all qubits into one\nthat targets only a subset of the qubits.

For example, the quadratic\nassignment problem (QAP) with linear equality constraints can be solved only up\nto size 12 in the quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, which has 5640 qubits.

This\nchoice of basis significantly reduces the computation time of the full CI\ncalculation by enabling a pre-calculated library of matrix elements to be used\nin evaluating the Coulomb integrals. The resultant many-electron spectra are\nmapped onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian to determine the individual pairwise\nelectronic exchange interaction strengths, $J_{ij}$. The accuracy of the\nmodified LCHO-CI method is further improved by optimizing the choice of\nharmonic orbitals without significantly lengthening the calculation time. The\nmodified LCHO-CI method is used to calculate $J$ for a silicon MOSFET double\nquantum dot occupied by two electrons. Two-dimensional potential landscapes are\ncalculated from a 3D device structure, including both the Si/SiO$_2$\nheterostructure and metal gate electrodes. The computational efficiency of the\nmodified LCHO-CI method enables systematic tuning of the device parameters to\ndetermine their impact on the sensitivity of $J$ to charge noise, including\nplunger gate size, tunnel gate width, SiO$_2$ thickness and dot eccentricity.\nGenerally, we find that geometries with larger dot charging energies, smaller\nplunger gate lever arms, and symmetric dots are less sensitive to noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2020 21:06:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Buonacorsi", "Brandon", ""], ["Korkusinski", "Marek", ""], ["Khromets", "Bohdan", ""], ["Baugh", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.10551", "submitter": "Lat\\'evi Mohamed Lawson", "authors": "Lat\\'evi Mohamed Lawson", "title": "Coherent states of position-dependent mass in strong quantum\n  gravitational background fields", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th cond-mat.other quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  More recently, we have proposed a set of noncommutative space that describes\nthe quantum gravity at the Planck scale (J.

To date, conventional detectors such as photomultipliers, avalanche\nphotodiodes, and superconducting nanowires, all rely at their core on linear\nexcitation of bound electrons with light, posing fundamental restrictions on\nthe detection. In contrast, the interaction of free electrons with light in the\ncontext of quantum optics is highly nonlinear and offers exciting\npossibilities. The first experiments that promoted this direction appeared over\nthe past decade as part of photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy\n(PINEM), wherein free electrons are capable of high-order multi-photon\nabsorption and emission. Here we propose using free electrons for\nquantum-optical detection of the complete quantum state of light. We show how\nthe precise control of the electron before and after its interaction with\nquantum light enables to extract the photon statistics and implement full\nquantum state tomography using PINEM. This technique can reach sub-attosecond\ntime resolutions, measure temporal coherence of any degree (e.g., g(1), g(2)),\nand simultaneously detect large numbers of photons with each electron.\nImportantly, the interaction of the electron with light is non-destructive,\nthereby leaving the photonic state (modified by the interaction) intact, which\nis conceptually different from conventional detectors. By using a pulse of\nmultiple electrons, we envision how PINEM quantum detectors could achieve a\nsingle-shot measurement of the complete state of quantum light, even for\nnon-reproducible emission events.

Such states are sensitive to decoherence\nfrom their environment. Recently, in Ref. [1] we computed the rate of\ndecoherence of a piece of superposed matter that primarily only interacts\ngravitationally, a dark-matter-Schrodinger-cat-state (DMSCS), within the\nnonrelativistic approximation. In this work we improve this to a general\nrelativistic analysis. We firstly derive a single particle relativistic\nSchrodinger equation for a probe particle that passes through the DMSCS; the\ninteraction is provided by the weak field metric of general relativity from the\nsource. For a static DMSCS we find a neat generalization of our previous\nresults. We then turn to the interesting new case of a time dependent DMSCS,\nwhich can be provided by a coherently oscillating axion field leading to\nsuperposed time dependent oscillations in the metric; a truly quantum-general\nrelativistic phenomenon. We use scattering theory to derive the decoherence\nrate in all these cases. When the DMSCS is in a superposition of distinct\ndensity profiles, we find that the decoherence rate can be appreciable. We then\nconsider the novel special case in which the density is not in a superposition,\nbut the phase of its field oscillation is; this is a property that cannot be\ndecohered within the nonrelativistic framework. We find that if the probe\nparticle and/or the DMSCS's velocity dispersion is slow, then the rate of\ndecoherence of the phase is exponentially suppressed. However, if both the\nprobe and the DMSCS's velocity dispersion are relativistic, then the phase can\ndecohere more rapidly.

This characterization theory has essential advantages in two\naspects.

Because of its fundamental status, this principle could be\na very powerful guide in formulating physical laws at regimes where both\ngravitational and quantum effects are relevant. However, its formulation\nimplicitly presupposes that reference frames are abstracted from classical\nsystems (rods and clocks) and that the spacetime background is well defined. It\nis unclear if it continues to hold when quantum systems, which can be in a\nquantum relationship with other physical systems, are taken as reference\nframes, and in a superposition of classical spacetime structures. Here, we\ntackle both questions by introducing a relational formalism to describe quantum\nsystems in a superposition of curved spacetimes. We build a unitary\ntransformation to the quantum reference frame (QRF) of a quantum system in\ncurved spacetime, and in a superposition thereof. In both cases, a QRF can be\nfound such that the metric looks locally minkowskian. Hence, one cannot\ndistinguish, with a local measurement, if the spacetime is flat or curved, or\nin a superposition of such spacetimes. This transformation identifies a Quantum\nLocal Inertial Frame. We also find a spacetime path-integral encoding the\ndynamics of a quantum particle in spacetime and show that the state of a freely\nfalling particle can be expressed as an infinite sum of all possible classical\ngeodesics. We then build the QRF transformation to the Fermi normal coordinates\nof such freely falling quantum particle and show that the metric is locally\nminkowskian. These results extend the Principle of Equivalence to QRFs in a\nsuperposition of gravitational fields.

These results indicate that VB could provide new methods for\npreparing and measuring the diatomic molecular states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 17:08:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2021 00:10:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lao", "Guanming", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15238", "submitter": "Stefan Teufel", "authors": "Joscha Henheik and Stefan Teufel", "title": "Adiabatic theorem in the thermodynamic limit: Systems with a uniform gap", "comments": "V1 -> V2: improved presentation and additional references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that recent results on adiabatic theory for interacting gapped\nmany-body systems on finite lattices remain valid in the thermodynamic limit.\nMore precisely, we prove a generalised super-adiabatic theorem for the\nautomorphism group describing the infinite volume dynamics on the quasi-local\nalgebra of observables.

In conventional thermodynamics conditional\non vanishingly weak system-bath coupling these two conditions are commonly\nregarded as equivalent. In this work we show that for thermodynamics at strong\ncoupling they are inequivalent: namely, two systems can be in equilibrium and\nyet have different effective temperatures. A recent result \\cite{NEqFE} for\nGaussian quantum systems shows that an effective temperature $T^{*}$ can be\ndefined at all times during a system's nonequilibrium evolution, but because of\nthe inclusion of interaction energy, after equilibration the system's $T^*$ is\nslightly higher than the bath temperature $T_{\\textsc{b}}$, with the deviation\ndepending on the coupling. A second object coupled with a different strength\nwith an identical bath at temperature $T_{\\textsc{b}}$ will not have the same\nequilibrated temperature as the first object. Thus $ET \\neq EQ $ for strong\ncoupling thermodynamics. We then investigate the conditions for dynamical\nequilibration for two objects 1 and 2 strongly coupled with a common bath $B$,\neach with a different equilibrated effective temperature. We show this is\npossible, and prove the existence of a generalized fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation under this configuration. This affirms that `in equilibrium' is a\nvalid and perhaps more fundamental notion which the zeroth law for quantum\nthermodynamics at strong coupling should be based on.

Finally, we show how\nthe transformations between classical reference frames described by the\nstandard Galilei group symmetries can be obtained from the group of\ntransformations between quantum reference frames by taking the zero limit of\nthe parameter that governs the additional noncommutativity introduced by the\nquantum nature of inertial transformations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 17:42:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 May 2021 21:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ballesteros", "Angel", ""], ["Giacomini", "Flaminia", ""], ["Gubitosi", "Giulia", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15808", "submitter": "Nicolo Defenu Dr.", "authors": "Nicol\\`o Defenu", "title": "Metastability and discrete spectrum of long-range systems", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The linear dynamics of closed quantum system produces well known difficulties\nin the definition of quantum chaos.

QSSs often emerge after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian\ninternal parameters and present a macroscopic life-time, which increases with\nthe system size. In this work, the spectrum of systems with slow enough\ndecaying couplings is shown to remain discrete up to the thermodynamic limit,\nhindering the application of several traditional results from the continuous\ntheory of many-body quantum systems.

We\nshow that, when initialized with suitable input states, FLO circuits can be\nused to demonstrate quantum computational advantage with strong hardness\nguarantees. Based on this, we propose a quantum advantage scheme which is a\nfermionic analogue of Boson Sampling: Fermion Sampling with magic input states.\n  We consider in parallel two classes of circuits: particle-number conserving\n(passive) FLO and active FLO that preserves only fermionic parity and is\nclosely related to Matchgate circuits introduced by Valiant.

We first show anticoncentration for probabilities in random\nFLO circuits of both kind. Moreover, we prove robust average-case hardness of\ncomputation of probabilities. To achieve this, we adapt the\nworst-to-average-case reduction based on Cayley transform, introduced recently\nby Movassagh, to representations of low-dimensional Lie groups. Taken together,\nthese findings provide hardness guarantees comparable to the paradigm of Random\nCircuit Sampling.\n  Importantly, our scheme has also a potential for experimental realization.\nBoth passive and active FLO circuits are relevant for quantum chemistry and\nmany-body physics and have been already implemented in proof-of-principle\nexperiments with superconducting qubit architectures.
