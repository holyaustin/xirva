Besides the\npossibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy\nallows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the\nmeasured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of\nstates as in CAQC.

The conceptual frame, based on the\nassumption of quantum uncertainty only, has been formerly introduced in two\npapers [S. Tosto, Il Nuovo Cimento B, vol. 111, n.2, 1996 and S. Tosto, Il\nNuovo Cimento D, vol. 18, n.12, 1996]. Instead of attempting to increase the\naccuracy of some existing computational model through a new kind of\napproximation, these papers acknowledge since the beginning the lack of\ndeterministic information about the local properties of the constituent\nparticles, considered random, unknown and unpredictable and thus ignored in\nprinciple. The leading idea is that the physical properties of quantum systems\ncould be inferred merely considering the delocalization ranges of dynamical\nvariables, rather than their local values. In effect, despite the agnostic\ncharacter of the approach proposed, both papers show that the kind of physical\ninformation reachable reproduces exactly in all cases examined that obtained\nsolving the pertinent wave equations. The concept of quantum uncertainty is\nfurther extended in the present paper to both space and time coordinates,\nconsidering thus a unique spacetime delocalization range and still discarding\nsince the beginning the local values of the conjugate dynamical variables. The\npaper shows an unexpected wealth of information obtainable simply extending the\nconcept of space uncertainty to that of spacetime uncertainty: the results are\ninherently consistent with that of the operator formalism of wave mechanics and\nwith the basic postulates of special relativity, both inferred as corollaries.\nMoreover, even the gravity appears to be essentially a quantum phenomenon.

The impossibility of constructing a\nnon-local and realistic theory, unless it entails highly counterintuitive\nfeatures, seems thus to have been experimentally proved. This would bring us\nclose to a definite refutation of realism. Indeed, realism was proved to be\nalso incompatible with locality, according to a series of experiments testing\nBell inequalities. The present paper addresses the said experiments of\nGroeblacher et al. and presents an explicit, contextual and realistic, model\nthat reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics. It thus violates the\nLeggett-type inequality that was established with the aim of ruling out a\nsupposedly broad class of non-local models. We can thus conclude that plausible\ncontextual, realistic, models are still tenable. This restates the possibility\nof a future completion of quantum mechanics by a realistic and contextual\ntheory which is not in a class containing only highly counterintuitive models.\nThe class that was ruled out by the experiments of Groeblacher et al. is thus\nproved to be a limited one, arbitrarily separating models that physically\nbelong in the same class.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2008 16:58:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2008 21:43:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["De Zela", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2418", "submitter": "Sebastien Camalet", "authors": "S.

The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many\ndirections: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering\nodd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by\nincluding other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing\nexternal rotation.

The model we consider is the DQC1 or `power of one qubit'\nmodel. I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical\ninstance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount\nof entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply\nthat the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance\nof the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction\nof the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an\ninterpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state\nquantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent\ninterest. Its role in the phenomenon of entanglement distribution is studied\nthrough an easily comprehensible example.\n  This thesis also contains discussions on the relation between the complexity\nclasses P, BQP and DQC1. Additional material is presented on the connections\nbetween the DQC1 model, Jones polynomials and statistical mechanics.

To achieve the\nhighest possible rate, the transmitted quantum system must initially be\nmaximally entangled with another that is held by the receiver, and the sender\ncan achieve this rate by encoding her messages with unitary operations.

BOMCA is derived using a modification\nof the saddle point technique, in which the path integral is approximated by\nexpanding around a near-classical path, chosen so that up to some predetermined\norder there is no need to add any correction terms to the leading order\napproximation. Both Complex WKB and BOMCA give the same leading order\napproximation; in Complex WKB higher accuracy is achieved by adding correction\nterms, while in BOMCA no additional terms are ever added -higher accuracy is\nachieved by changing the path along which the original approximation is\ncomputed.

On the other hand, it emerges that the methods provide\nefficient schemes for computing the higher order terms in the asymptotic\nevaluation of path integrals.

S. Afshar et al. has been interpreted as\na violation of Bohr's complementarity principle between interference visibility\nand which-path information in a two-path interferometer. We have reproduced\nthis experiment, using true single-photon pulses propagating in a two-path\nwavefront- splitting interferometer realized with a Fresnel's biprism, and\nfollowed by a grating with adjustable transmitting slits. The measured values\nof interference visibility V and which-path information, characterized by the\ndistinguishability parameter D, are found to obey the complementarity relation\nV^2+D^2=<1. This result demonstrates that the experiment can be perfectly\nexplained by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2008 14:32:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 16:40:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jacques", "V.", ""], ["Lai", "N.

We suggest a possible way\nout of this unsatisfactory state of art. Theoretically we suggest that the\ncorrect spectral function entering the Fock-Krylov method to calculate the\nsurvival amplitude is proportional to the density of states of a resonance. The\nlatter is essentially the energy derivative of a phase shift. As a bonus, we\ncan connect the survival probability to scattering data via the phase shift.\nThe method then not only establishes the spectral function, but is per se a\nsemi-empirical method to extract the large time behaviour from scattering data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2008 16:41:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nowakowski", "M.", ""], ["Kelkar", "N.
