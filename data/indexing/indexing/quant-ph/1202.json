For any\nsymmetric code without string logical operator, there exists a complementary\nantisymmetric code with the same property and vice versa. We derive a\nsufficient condition for the absence of string logical operator in terms of the\nalgebraic constraints on the defining parameters of the code.

Moreover, when the transmission\nis non-zero, the structure of a resonant set depends on a regularizing sequence\n$\\Delta'_\\varepsilon(x)$ that tends to $\\delta'(x)$ in the sense of\ndistributions as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. Therefore, from a practical point of\nview, it would be interesting to have an inverse solution, i.e. for a given\n$\\bar{\\lambda} \\in \\R$ to construct such a regularizing sequence\n$\\Delta'_\\varepsilon(x)$ that the $\\delta'$-potential at this value is\ntransparent. If such a procedure is possible, then this value $\\bar{\\lambda}$\nhas to belong to a corresponding resonance set. The present paper is devoted to\nsolving this problem and, as a result, the family of regularizing sequences is\nconstructed by tuning adjustable parameters in the equations that provide a\nresonance transmission across the $\\delta'$-potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Feb 2012 12:39:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Zolotaryuk", "A.

It is shown that the\ninitial state of polariton located in the first cavity is crucial to the\ntransmission fidelity, and the local entanglement depresses the state transfer\nprobability. Exploiting the metastable state, the distance of the quantum state\ntransfer can be much longer than that of Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model. A\nhigher transmission probability and longer distance can be achieved by\nemploying a class of initial encodings and final decodings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 22:49:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Yu-Li", ""], ["Zhu", "Shi-Qun", ""], ["You", "Wen-Long", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2163", "submitter": "Fu-Guo Deng", "authors": "Bao-Cang Ren, Tie-Jun Wang, Ming Hua, Fu-Fu Du, Fu-Guo Deng", "title": "Optimal multipartite entanglement concentration of electron-spin states\n  based on charge detection and projection measurements", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figure", "journal-ref": "Quantum Inf.

Very substantial role is played also by the carrier density $n_s$ that\nnaturally emerges as an integration constant of the GL equation.

In classical\nphysics, this entropy is believed to be the logarithm of the volume of phase\nspace accessible to an isolated system [1]. There is no quantum mechanical\nanalog to this. Instead, Von Neumann's hypothesis for the entropy [2] is most\nwidely used. However this gives zero for systems with a known wave function,\nthat is a pure state. This is because it measures the lack of information about\nthe system rather than the flow of heat as obtained from thermodynamic\nexperiments. Many arguments attempt to sidestep these issues by considering the\nsystem of interest coupled to a large external one, unlike the classical case\nwhere Boltzmann's approach for isolated systems is far more satisfactory. With\nnew experimental techniques, probing the quantum nature of thermalization is\nnow possible [3, 4].

However, protection of qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate poses\na non-trivial problem: in general the decoupling disrupts the inter-qubit\ndynamics, and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly\nsalient for hybrid systems, wherein different types of qubits evolve and\ndecohere at vastly different rates. Here we present the integration of\ndynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a paradigmatic hybrid system, the\nelectron-nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in\nthe coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and\ndecoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates on a two-qubit register\nin diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the\nqubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle\nqubits. We further illustrate the power of our design by executing Grover's\nquantum search algorithm, achieving fidelities above 90% even though the\nexecution time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of\nmagnitude. Our results directly enable decoherence-protected interface gates\nbetween different types of promising solid-state qubits.

Our formalism stems from an exact\nfactorization of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction of the clock plus system\ncomposite, where the clock and system factors play the role of marginal and\nconditional probability amplitudes, respectively. Application of the Variation\nPrinciple leads to a pair of exact coupled pseudoeigenvalue equations for these\namplitudes, whose solution requires an iterative self-consistent procedure. The\nequation for the conditional amplitude constitutes an effective \"equation of\nmotion\" for the quantum state of the system with respect to the clock\nvariables. These coupled equations also provide a convenient framework for\ntreating the back-reaction of the system on the clock at various levels of\napproximation. At the lowest level, when the WKB approximation for the marginal\namplitude is appropriate, in the classical limit of the clock variables the\nTDSE for the system emerges as a matter of course from the conditional\nequation. In this connection, we provide a discussion of the characteristics\nrequired by physical systems to serve as good clocks.

Furthermore, for\ncertain classes of subsystem codes and noise processes, we prove the efficacy\nof the transpose channel as a simple-to-construct recovery map that works\nnearly as well as the optimal recovery channel.

As it is well known, this intriguing, fundamental\nquantum condition is at the core of a famous argument conceived by Erwin\nSchroedinger, back in 1935. The main experimental challenge to the actual\nrealization of this object resides generally on the unavoidable and\nuncontrolled interactions with the environment, i.e. the decoherence leading to\nthe cancellation of any evidence of the quantum features associated with the\nmacroscopic system. The present scheme is based on a nonlinear process, the\n\"quantum injected optical parametric amplification\", that maps by a linearized\ncloning process the quantum coherence of a single - particle state, i.e. a\nMicro - qubit, into a Macro - qubit, consisting in a large number M of photons\nin quantum superposition. Since the adopted scheme was found resilient to\ndecoherence, the MQS\\ demonstration was carried out experimentally at room\ntemperature with $M\\geq $ $10^{4}$. This result elicited an extended study on\nquantum cloning, quantum amplification and quantum decoherence. The related\ntheory is outlined in the article where several experiments are reviewed such\nas the test on the \"no-signaling theorem\" and the dynamical interaction of the\nphoton MQS with a Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, the consideration of\nthe Micro - Macro entanglement regime is extended into the Macro - Macro\ncondition. The MQS interference patterns for large M were revealed in the\nexperiment and the bipartite Micro-Macro entanglement was also demonstrated for\na limited number of generated particles: $M\\precsim 12$.

H. Shapiro, Phys. Rev. A 73, 062305\n(2006); J. Gea-Banacloche, Phys. Rev. A 81, 043823 (2010)]. Using an atomic\nV-system to model an XPM medium, we present a conditional phase gate that, for\nsufficiently small nonzero \\phi, has high fidelity. The gate is made cascadable\nby using using a special measurement, principal mode projection, to exploit the\nquantum Zeno effect and preclude the accumulation of fidelity-degrading\ndepartures from the principal-mode Hilbert space when both control and target\nphotons illuminate the gate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 18:46:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chudzicki", "Christopher", ""], ["Chuang", "Isaac L.", ""], ["Shapiro", "Jeffrey H.", ""]]}]
