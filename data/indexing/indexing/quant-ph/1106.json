Yet, the theory has many puzzling\nfeatures : the occurrence of probabilities, the unclear distinction between the\nmicroscopic and the macroscopic, the unexplained absence of superpositions in\npositions of macroscopic objects, the dependence of the theory on an external\nclassical time, and the experimentally verified but peculiar `influence'\noutside the light-cone in EPR experiments. These puzzles point towards a\nconflict between quantum theory and our present understanding of spacetime\nstructure, and suggest the existence of a deeper theory. In this essay we make\nthe case that in the underlying theory the matter and spacetime degrees of\nfreedom are non-commuting matrices, and yet the dynamics is analog. A digital\nquantum-theory like dynamics for matter as well as spacetime emerges in the\nstatistical thermodynamic approximation to this deeper theory. When most of the\nmatter clumps into macroscopic structures, it is shown to behave classically,\nand it induces classical dynamics on spacetime; this is the eventual analog\nlimit, our macroscopic world. In between the digital layer and the uppermost\nanalog layer is the realm of standard quantum theory - microscopic objects and\ntheir interaction with measuring apparatuses on a classical spacetime\nbackground : the semi-digital approximation. Such a multi-layered description\nof dynamics can explain the puzzling features of quantum theory, and is\ntestable by ongoing laboratory experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Jun 2011 16:39:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "T.

As such, the discarded weight is a clear indicator of the accuracy\nof a specific NRG calculation. In particular, it indicates in a site-specific\nmanner whether sufficiently many states have been kept within a single NRG run.\nThe largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices, on the other hand,\nlend themselves to a straightforward analysis in terms of entanglement spectra,\nwhich can be combined into entanglement flow diagrams.

We\npresent a theoretical analysis of two problems, which involve the interaction\nof quantized electromagnetic fields (called signal and idler) with the atomic\nensemble (i) cascade two-photon emission in an atomic ladder configuration, and\n(ii) photon frequency conversion in an atomic diamond configuration. The\nmotivation of these studies comes from potential applications in long-distance\nquantum communication where it is desirable to generate quantum correlations\nbetween telecommunication wavelength light fields and ground level atomic\ncoherences. We develop a theory of correlated signal-idler pair correlation.\nThe analysis is complicated by the possible generation of multiple excitations\nin the atomic ensemble. An analytical treatment is given in the limit of a\nsingle excitation assuming adiabatic laser excitations. The analysis predicts\nsuperradiant timescales in the idler emission in agreement with experimental\nobservation. To relax the restriction of a single excitation, we develop a\ndifferent theory of cascade emission, which is solved by numerical simulation\nof classical stochastic differential equation using the theory of open quantum\nsystems. The simulations are in good qualitative agreement with the analytical\ntheory of superradiant timescales. We provide a quantum theory of near-infrared\nto telecom wavelength conversion in the diamond configuration. The system\nprovides a crucial part of a quantum-repeater memory element, which enables a\n\"stored\" near-infrared photon to be converted to a telecom wavelength for\ntransmission without the destruction of light-atom quantum correlation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jun 2011 14:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Jen", "Hsiang-Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2102", "submitter": "Nikolaj Thomas Zinner", "authors": "J.

It also provides a\npotential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers\nthrough the concept of XML driven compilers.

An algorithmic example is also\npresented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and\nrunning the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial\neffort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the\narchitecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a\nwidely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and\nquantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and\nfacilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts.

In the Markovian\ncase, the connections between the various types of methods are fairly\nwell-understood while for non-Markovian case there has so far been only a few\nstudies. We focus here on two jumplike unravelings of non-Markovian dynamics,\nthe non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) method and the property state method by\nGambetta, Askerud, and Wiseman (GAW).

In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift (or universality of clock rates).\nConsidering the atom as a clock operating at the Compton frequency associated\nwith the rest mass, they claimed that the interferometer measures the\ngravitational redshift between the atom-clocks in the two paths of the\ninterferometer at different values of gravitational potentials.

Sharir, Pnueli and Hart [SIAM J.\nComput. 13(1984)292-314] presented a general method for proving properties of\nprobabilistic programs, in which a probabilistic program is modeled by a Markov\nchain and an assertion on the output distribution is extended into an invariant\nassertion on all intermediate distributions. Their method is essentially a\nprobabilistic generalization of the classical Floyd inductive assertion method.\nIn this paper, we consider quantum programs modeled by quantum Markov chains\nwhich are defined by super-operators. It is shown that the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart\nmethod can be elegantly generalized to quantum programs by exploiting the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Heisenberg duality between quantum states and observables. In\nparticular, a completeness theorem for the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart verification\nmethod of quantum programs is established. 2. As indicated by the completeness\ntheorem, the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method is in principle effective for verifying\nall properties of quantum programs that can be expressed in terms of Hermitian\noperators (observables). But it is not feasible for many practical applications\nbecause of the complicated calculation involved in the verification. For the\ncase of finite-dimensional state spaces, we find a method for verification of\nquantum programs much simpler than the Sharir-Pnueli-Hart method by employing\nthe matrix representation of super-operators and Jordan decomposition of\nmatrices.

We extend here to a much broader class of states when\nthe second party is of arbitrary dimension d, so long as the first, measured,\nparty is a qubit. We present two formulae to calculate quantum discord, the\nfirst relating to the original entropic definition and the second to a recently\nproposed geometric distance measure which leads to an analytical formulation.\nThe tracing over the qubit in the entropic calculation is reduced to a very\nsimple prescription. And, when the d-dimensional system is a so-called X state,\nthe density matrix having non-zero elements only along the diagonal and\nanti-diagonal so as to appear visually like the letter X, the entropic\ncalculation can be carried out analytically. Such states of the full bipartite\nqubit-qudit system may be named \"extended X states\", whose density matrix is\nbuilt of four block matrices, each visually appearing as an X. The optimization\ninvolved in the entropic calculation is generally over two parameters, reducing\nto one for many cases, and avoided altogether for an overwhelmingly large set\nof density matrices as our numerical investigations demonstrate. Our results\nalso apply to states of a N-qubit system, where \"extended X states\" consist of\n(2^(N+2) - 1) states, larger in number than the (2^(N+1) - 1) of X states of N\nqubits.

As an application, we discuss regimes of\nintegrability in models of dynamical tunneling and parametric resonance, and in\nthe dynamics of two-level systems under generic classical fields. A\ncorresponding quantum algebraic structure is shown to exist which satisfies\nanalog conditions of Liouville integrability and reproduces the classical\ndynamics in an appropriate limit within the Weyl-Wigner formalism.

In addition,\nfor the initial state $|\\Psi_1(0) > = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|01 > + |10 >)$, all\nthe correlations except the CC, exhibit a damping oscillation to a stable value\nlarger than zero following the time, while for the initial state $|\\Psi_2(0) >\n= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|00 > + |11 >)$, all the correlations monotonously\ndecrease, but CC still remains maximum. Moreover, there is not a definite\nordering of these quantities in thermal equilibrium, whereas there is a\ndescending order of the CC, C, GMD and QD under the intrinsic decoherence with\na nonnull B when the initial state is $|\\Psi_2(0) >$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 15:01:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Jiang-Tao", ""], ["Abliz", "Ahmad", ""], ["Li", "Shu-Shen", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6275", "submitter": "Michael Mayle", "authors": "Bernd Hezel, Michael Mayle, Peter Schmelcher", "title": "Interaction-induced stabilization of circular Rydberg atoms", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The most prominent computational\ntasks of infrastructures are the computation of the circumference of the\ninfrastructure and the generalized discrete logarithms. Both these problems are\nnot known to have efficient classical algorithms for an arbitrary\ninfrastructure. Our main contributions are polynomial time quantum algorithms\nfor one-dimensional infrastructures that satisfy certain conditions. For\ninstance, these conditions are always fulfilled for infrastructures obtained\nfrom number fields and function fields, both of unit rank one. Since quadratic\nnumber fields give rise to such infrastructures, this algorithm can be used to\nsolve Pell's equation and the principal ideal problem. In this sense we\ngeneralize Hallgren's quantum algorithms for quadratic number fields, while\nalso providing a polynomial speedup over them. Our more general approach shows\nthat these quantum algorithms can also be applied to infrastructures obtained\nfrom complex cubic and totally complex quartic number fields. Our improved way\nof analyzing the performance makes it possible to show that these algorithms\nsucceed with constant probability independent of the problem size. In contrast,\nthe lower bound on the success probability due to Hallgren decreases as the\nfourth power of the logarithm of the circumference. Our analysis also shows\nthat fewer qubits are required. We also contribute to the study of\ninfrastructures, and show how to compute efficiently within infrastructures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 19:31:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 18:20:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Sarvepalli", "Pradeep", ""], ["Wocjan", "Pawel", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6351", "submitter": "Ion Cosma Fulga", "authors": "I.
