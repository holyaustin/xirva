Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion\ndriven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy\nmeasurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are\nreputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the\nindeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is\nabout to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by\nexperimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state\nof a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a\npredictable \"flight,\" by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level\ncoupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump\nevolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic.\nFurthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and\nfeedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus\ndeterministically preventing its completion.

The\nseminal work of Ben-Or et al. (STOC 1988) shows that zero knowledge can be\nachieved unconditionally for any language in NEXP, as long as one is willing to\nmake a suitable physical assumption: if the provers are spatially isolated,\nthen they can be assumed to be playing independent strategies. Quantum\nmechanics, however, tells us that this assumption is unrealistic, because\nspatially-isolated provers could share a quantum entangled state and realize a\nnon-local correlated strategy. The MIP* model captures this setting. In this\nwork we study the following question: does spatial isolation still suffice to\nunconditionally achieve zero knowledge even in the presence of quantum\nentanglement? We answer this question in the affirmative: we prove that every\nlanguage in NEXP has a 2-prover zero knowledge interactive proof that is sound\nagainst entangled provers; that is, NEXP \\subseteq ZK-MIP*. Our proof consists\nof constructing a zero knowledge interactive PCP with a strong algebraic\nstructure, and then lifting it to the MIP* model. This lifting relies on a new\nframework that builds on recent advances in low-degree testing against\nentangled strategies, and clearly separates classical and quantum tools.

Extending swap test to a more general\nform that is suitable to deal with quantum data in parallel, which will have\nfurther applications in other matrix operations. (2). Generalizing SVE\ntechnique such that it applies to any matrix (not just Hermitian) directly only\nwith quantum data. (3).

One aspect of this problem is the conspicuous\nabsence of time in the Wheeler-Dewitt equation, which is the analogue of the\nSchrodinger equation for the Universal wavefunction. Page and Wootters famously\naddressed this problem by providing a mechanism for effectively introducing\ntime evolution into this timeless cosmological picture. Their method, which is\nsometimes called the conditional probability interpretation (CPI), requires the\nidentification of an internal clock system that is meant to keep time for the\nremainder of the Universe. Most investigations into this idea employ the\nidealized limit of a non-interacting clock system, the so-called ideal clock.\nHowever, by allowing for interactions, we have found the counter-intuitive\nresult that a non-interacting clock is not necessarily the optimal choice, even\nif it is `ideal'. In particular, the uncertainty that is associated with the\nphysical measurement of an atomic clock is found to decrease monotonically as\nthe interactions grow stronger. This observation, which is reinforced by a\nprevious study using a semi-classical clock, paves the way to an independent\nargument that is based on the energy conservation of any isolated system. Our\nconclusion is that ideal clocks must be prohibited from the CPI when recovering\ncosmological time evolution.

We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal\nquantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum\ncircuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden\nnodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the\ncircuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained\nwith different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no\ngeneral and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted\ndescription of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a\nstep-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to\nRestricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this\nprojection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible\nto approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on\nstochastic methods such as Variational Monte Carlo, which are computationally\nexpensive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2018 11:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Freitas", "Nahuel", ""], ["Morigi", "Giovanna", ""], ["Dunjko", "Vedran", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.02148", "submitter": "Xiao-Qiang Shao Dr", "authors": "Dong-Xiao Li, Xiao-Qiang Shao, Jin-Hui Wu, and X.

Our approach can be solved numerically very efficiently.\nThe presented framework leads to a shift in paradigm by highlighting how\nelectronically excited states arise as a modification of the photon field and\nthat experimentally observed effects are always due to a complex interplay\nbetween light and matter. At the same time the findings provide a new route to\nanalyze as well as propose experiments at the interface between quantum\nchemistry, nanoplasmonics and quantum optics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 04:19:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:03:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Flick", "Johannes", ""], ["Welakuh", "Davis M.", ""], ["Ruggenthaler", "Michael", ""], ["Appel", "Heiko", ""], ["Rubio", "Angel", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.02545", "submitter": "Kenneth R.

The latter bound of\nlocalizable entanglement is computed by restricting the local projection\nmeasurements over the qubits outside the subsystem of interest to a suitably\nchosen basis. We discuss the behaviour of both lower bounds against local\nphysical noise on the qubits, and discuss their dependence on noise strength\nand system size.

Magnetoplasmons (MPs), as high-frequency density\nexcitations of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a perpendicular magnetic\nfield, embody a prototype of band topology for bosons. The\ntime-reversal-breaking magnetic field opens a topological gap for bulk MPs up\nto the cyclotron frequency; topologically-protected edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs)\nbridge the bulk gap and propagate unidirectionally along system's boundaries.\nHowever, all the EMPs known to date adhere to physical edges where the electron\ndensity terminates abruptly. This restriction has made device application\nextremely difficult. Here we demonstrate a new class of topological edge\nplasmons -- domain-boundary magnetoplasmons (DBMPs), within a uniform edgeless\n2DEG. Such DBMPs arise at the domain boundaries of an engineered sign-changing\nmagnetic field and are protected by the difference of gap Chern numbers (+/-1)\nacross the magnetic domains. They propagate unidirectionally along the domain\nboundaries and are immune to domain defects. Moreover, they exhibit wide\ntunability in the microwave frequency range under an applied magnetic field or\ngate voltage. Our study opens a new direction to realize high-speed\nreconfigurable topological devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 23:28:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Dafei", ""], ["Xia", "Yang", ""], ["Christensen", "Thomas", ""], ["Wang", "Siqi", ""], ["Fong", "King Yan", ""], ["Freeman", "Matthew", ""], ["Gardner", "Geoffrey C.", ""], ["Fallahi", "Saeed", ""], ["Hu", "Qing", ""], ["Wang", "Yuan", ""], ["Engel", "Lloyd", ""], ["Manfra", "Michael J.", ""], ["Fang", "Nicolas X.", ""], ["Zhang", "Xiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.02945", "submitter": "Francesco Buscemi", "authors": "Francesco Buscemi", "title": "Comparison of Noisy Channels and Reverse Data-Processing Theorems", "comments": "5 two-column pages, 3 figures; presented at 2017 IEEE Information\n  Theory Workshop, Kaohsiung", "journal-ref": "2017 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW), pp. 489-493", "doi": "10.1109/ITW.2017.8278038", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST quant-ph stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the comparison of noisy channels from the viewpoint of\nstatistical decision theory.

We\npropose a scheme to synthesize a family of RVB states using a cavity QED setup\nwith two-level atoms (with states $\\vert 0 \\rangle$ and $\\vert 1 \\rangle$)\ncoupled to a common photon mode. In the lossy cavity limit, starting with an\ninitial state of $M$ atoms excited and $N$ atoms in the ground state, we show\nthat this setup can be configured as a Stern Gerlach experiment. A measurement\nof photon emission collapses the wavefunction of atoms onto an RVB state\ncomposed of resonating long-ranged singlets of the form\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\vert 0 1 \\rangle - \\vert 1 0 \\rangle]$. Each emitted\nphoton reduces the number of singlets by unity, replacing it with a pair of\nlone spins or `spinons'. As spinons are formed coherently in pairs, they are\nanalogous to Cooper pairs in a superconductor. To simulate pair fluctuations,\nwe propose a protocol in which photons are allowed to escape the cavity\nundetected. This leads to a mixed quantum state with a fluctuating number of\nspinon pairs -- an inchoate superconductor.

A particular difficulty is how to fairly\ncapture the notion of \"predicting an unqueried value\" when the adversary can\nquery in quantum superposition. In this work, we uncover serious shortcomings\nin existing approaches, and propose a new definition. We then support its\nviability by a number of constructions and characterizations. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate a function which is secure according to the existing definition by\nBoneh and Zhandry, but is clearly vulnerable to a quantum forgery attack,\nwhereby a query supported only on inputs that start with 0 divulges the value\nof the function on an input that starts with 1. We then propose a new\ndefinition, which we call \"blind-unforgeability\" (or BU.) This notion matches\n\"intuitive unpredictability\" in all examples studied thus far. It defines a\nfunction to be predictable if there exists an adversary which can use\n\"partially blinded\" oracle access to predict values in the blinded region. Our\ndefinition (BU) coincides with standard unpredictability (EUF-CMA) in the\nclassical-query setting. We show that quantum-secure pseudorandom functions are\nBU-secure MACs. In addition, we show that BU satisfies a composition property\n(Hash-and-MAC) using \"Bernoulli-preserving\" hash functions, a new notion which\nmay be of independent interest. Finally, we show that BU is amenable to\nsecurity reductions by giving a precise bound on the extent to which quantum\nalgorithms can deviate from their usual behavior due to the blinding in the BU\nsecurity experiment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Mar 2018 05:31:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Nov 2018 21:24:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2020 07:03:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Alagic", "Gorjan", ""], ["Majenz", "Christian", ""], ["Russell", "Alexander", ""], ["Song", "Fang", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03815", "submitter": "Kashif Ammar Yasir", "authors": "Kashif Ammar Yasir, Lin Zhuang, and Wu-Ming Liu", "title": "Topological Nonlinear Optics with Spin-Orbit coupled Bose-Einstein\n  Condensate in Cavity", "comments": "10 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics cond-mat.quant-gas physics.atom-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report topological nonlinear optics with spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate in a cavity.

The closedness of the superalgebra $Q_C, \\widehat{O}_a,\n\\sigma^i_C$ guarantees that the final gauge-invariant LF is compatible with\noff-shell constraints $\\widehat{O}_a$ imposed on field and gauge parameter\nvectors of Hilbert space not depending from the ghosts and conversion auxiliary\noscillators related to $\\widehat{O}_a$, in comparison with vectors for\nunconstrained BRST-BFV LF.

On the other hand, adaptability is an essential aspect\nto perform any task efficiently in a changing environment, and it is\nfundamental for many purposes, such as natural selection. Here, we propose an\nalgorithm based on successive measurements to adapt one quantum state to a\nreference unknown state, in the sense of achieving maximum overlap. The\nprotocol naturally provides many identical copies of the reference state, such\nthat in each measurement iteration more information about it is obtained. In\nour protocol, we consider a system composed of three parts, the \"environment\"\nsystem, which provides the reference state copies; the register, which is an\nauxiliary subsystem that interacts with the environment to acquire information\nfrom it; and the agent, which corresponds to the quantum state that is adapted\nby digital feedback with input corresponding to the outcome of the measurements\non the register. With this proposal we can achieve an average fidelity between\nthe environment and the agent of more than $90\\% $ with less than $30$\niterations of the protocol. In addition, we extend the formalism to $ d\n$-dimensional states, reaching an average fidelity of around $80\\% $ in less\nthan $400$ iterations for $d=$ 11, for a variety of genuinely quantum and\nsemiclassical states.

The originality of this work resides in that this new notion\nof hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of\noperator spaces theory.

Building on the first implication,\nour second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do\nnot hold for non-trivially primitive QMS.

We say that the macroscopic systems are extensive\nand so it is also the entropy. For a mesoscopic system, by definition, the size\nand the contacts with other systems influence its thermodynamic properties and\ntherefore, if we define an entropy, this cannot be a homogeneous of order one\nfunction in the extensive variables. So, mesoscopic systems and their entropies\nare non-extensive.

We propose\nhere a general definition of the entropy in the equilibrium state, which is\napplicable to both, macroscopic and mesoscopic systems. This definition still\nleaves an apparent ambiguity in the definition of the entropy of a mesoscopic\nsystem, but this we recognize as the signature of the anthropomorphic character\nof the entropy (see Jaynes, Am.

A key challenge with random number generators is that it is hard to\nensure that their outputs are unpredictable. For a random number generator\nbased on a physical process, such as a noisy classical system or an elementary\nquantum measurement, a detailed model describing the underlying physics is\nrequired to assert unpredictability.

The said\nlattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a\nseparable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H.\nQuantum states are $\\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean\nlattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert space is separable with\ndimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states are\none-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace,\ntrace-class operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert\nspaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard\npart of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is\nmathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of\ntrace in quaternionic Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory\nof trace-class operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces different from the\nstandard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue also affects\nVaradarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation. This paper is\nmainly devoted to present Gleason-Varadarajan's theorem into a technically\ncorrect form valid for the three types of Hilbert spaces. After having develped\npart of the general mathematical technology of trace-class operators in\n(generally non-separable) quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we prove that only the\n{\\em real part} of the trace enters the formalism of quantum theories (also\ndealing with unbounded observables and symmetries) and it can be safely used to\nformulate and prove a common statement of Gleason's theorem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 12:03:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 09:33:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Moretti", "Valter", "", "Trento U. and TIFPA-INFN"], ["Oppio", "Marco", "", "Regensburg"]]}, {"id": "1803.06884", "submitter": "Nicolai Friis", "authors": "Giuseppe Vitagliano, Claude Kl\\\"ockl, Marcus Huber, Nicolai Friis", "title": "Trade-off Between Work and Correlations in Quantum Thermodynamics", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure;", "journal-ref": "in: Thermodynamics in the Quantum Regime, Chapter 30, F.

This allows us to\napproach the nonequilibrium dark state transition and identify similarities and\nclear differences to common, equilibrium phase transitions, and to establish\nthe phenomenology for a first order dark state phase transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:00:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-02", "authors_parsed": [["Roscher", "Dietrich", ""], ["Diehl", "Sebastian", ""], ["Buchhold", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.08519", "submitter": "Ramis Movassagh", "authors": "Oles Shtanko and Ramis Movassagh", "title": "Stability of Periodically Driven Topological Phases against Disorder", "comments": "5 pages + 9 pages supplementary material. 4 Figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The key to understanding the performance of such\nengines is a proper division of the energy supplied by the bath to the system\ninto heat and work, depending on the associated change in the system entropy\nand ergotropy. Due to their hybrid character, the efficiency bound for quantum\nengines powered by a non-thermal bath does not solely follow from the laws of\nthermodynamics. Hence, the thermodynamic Carnot bound is inapplicable to such\nhybrid engines. Yet, they do not violate the principles of thermodynamics.\n  An alternative means of boosting machine performance is the concept of\nheat-to-work conversion catalysis by quantum non-linear (squeezed) pumping of\nthe piston mode. This enhancement is due to the increased ability of the\nsqueezed piston to store ergotropy. Since the catalyzed machine is fueled by\nthermal baths, it adheres to the Carnot bound.\n  We conclude by arguing that it is not quantumness per se that improves the\nmachine performance, but rather the properties of the baths, the working fluid\nand the piston that boost the ergotropy and minimize the wasted heat in both\nthe input and the output.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:57:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 12:14:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 11 Nov 2018 12:41:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Arnab", ""], ["Niedenzu", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Victor", ""], ["Kurizki", "Gershon", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.10062", "submitter": "George Knee", "authors": "George C.

This recent result is in strong contrast with\nthe approximation of fixed atoms, which assumes that atoms are fixed to their\nequilibrium positions when light propagates in a medium and which is deeply\nrooted in the conventional electrodynamics of continuous media. In many\nphotonic materials, the atoms carry the majority of the total momentum of light\nand their motion also gives rise to net transfer of medium mass with a light\npulse. In this work, we use optoelastic continuum dynamics combining the\noptical force field, elasticity theory, and Newtonian mechanics to analyze the\nangular momentum carried by the MDW. We show that accounting for the MDW in the\nanalysis of the angular momentum gives for the field's share of the total\nangular momentum of light a quantized value that is generally a fraction of\n$\\hbar$. In contrast, the total angular momentum of the mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle, which is a coupled state of the field and the MDW, and also the\nelementary quantum of light in a medium, is an integer multiple of $\\hbar$. The\nsame coupling is found for orbital and spin angular momentum components.

It modifies the geometrical\nstructure of manifold and relaxes the notion of affine connection being\nsymmetric. The theory is also called $U_4$ theory of gravitation; where the\nunderlying manifold is not Riemannian. The non-Riemannian part of the\nspace-time is sourced by the spin density of matter. Here mass and spin both\nplay the dynamical role. We consider the minimal coupling of Dirac field with\nEC theory; thereby calling the full theory as Einstein-Cartan-Dirac (ECD)\ntheory. In the recent works by T.P Singh titled \"A new length scale in quantum\ngravity\", the idea of new unified; mass dependent length scale $L_{cs}$ in\nquantum gravity has been proposed. We discuss this idea and formulate ECD\ntheory in both - standard length scales as well as this new length scale. We\nfound the non-relativistic limit of ECD theory using WKB-like expansion in\n$\\sqrt{\\hbar}/c$ of the ECD field equations with both the length scales. At\nleading order, ECD equations with standard length scales give\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-Newton equation. With $L_{cs}$, in the low mass limit, it gives\nsource-free Poisson equation and for higher mass limit, it reduces to Poisson\nequation with delta function source. Based on this, a falsifiable test of the\nidea of $L_{cs}$ has been proposed. Next, we formulate ECD theory with both the\nlength scales (especially the Dirac equation (Hehl-Datta equation) and\nContorsion spin coefficients) in Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. The idea of\n$L_{cs}$ suggests a symmetry between small and large masses. Formulating ECD\ntheory with $L_{cs}$ in NP formalism is desirable because NP formalism happens\nto be the common vocabulary for the description of low masses (Dirac theory)\nand high masses (gravity theories).

We examine this possibility here. We\nargue that a genuinely Poincar\\'e invariant model requires a probability\ndistribution on sprinklable sets -- Poincar\\'e orbits of sprinklings -- rather\nthan individual sprinklings. The corresponding $\\sigma$-algebra contains only\nsets of measure zero or one. This makes testing the hypothesis of discrete\nPoincar\\'e invariance problematic, since any local violation of Poincar\\'e\ninvariance, however gross and large scale, is possible, and cannot be said to\nbe improbable. We also note that the Bombelli-Henson-Sorkin argument, which\nrules out constructions of preferred timelike directions for typical\nsprinklings, is not sufficient to establish full Lorentz invariance. For\nexample, once a pair of timelike separated points is fixed, a preferred\nspacelike direction {\\it can} be defined for a typical sprinkling, breaking the\nremaining rotational invariance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2018 14:19:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 17:25:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2018 23:07:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2018 20:19:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 18 Aug 2018 11:24:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kent", "Adrian", "", "Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations, DAMTP,\n  University of Cambridge, Perimeter Institute"]]}, {"id": "1803.11495", "submitter": "Camille Lombard Latune", "authors": "Camille L.
