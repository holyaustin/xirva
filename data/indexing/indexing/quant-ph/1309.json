Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum\ncomputation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or\nnot quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently\nunable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first\nexperimental verification of quantum computations.

The ansatz of the wave function\nand its variational flexibility are crucial points for both the accurate\ndescription of molecular properties and the capabilities of the method to\ntackle large systems. In this paper, we extensively analyze, using different\nvariational ansatzes, several properties of the water molecule, namely: the\ntotal energy, the dipole and quadrupole momenta, the ionization and atomization\nenergies, the equilibrium configuration, and the harmonic and fundamental\nfrequencies of vibration. The investigation mainly focuses on variational Monte\nCarlo calculations, although several lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo\ncalculations are also reported. Through a systematic study, we provide a useful\nguide to the choice of the wave function, the pseudo potential, and the basis\nset for QMC calculations. We also introduce a new strategy for the definition\nof the atomic orbitals involved in the Jastrow - Antisymmetrised Geminal power\nwave function, in order to drastically reduce the number of variational\nparameters.

In the quantum formalism, indistinguishability is\nexpressed via the symmetrization postulate, which restricts a system of\nidentical particles to the set of symmetric states (`bosons') or the set of\nantisymmetric states (`fermions'). However, the physical basis and range of\nvalidity of the symmetrization postulate has not been established. A well-known\ntopological derivation of the postulate implies that its validity depends on\nthe dimensionality of the space in which the particles move. However, this\nderivation relies on the labeling of indistinguishable particles, a notion that\ncannot be justified on an informational basis. Here we show that the\nsymmetrization postulate can be derived by strictly adhering to the\ninformational requirement that particles which cannot be experimentally\ndistinguished from one another are not labeled. Our key novel postulate is the\noperational indistinguishability postulate, which posits that the amplitude of\na process involving several indistinguishable particles is determined by the\namplitudes of all possible transitions of these particles when treated as\ndistinguishable. The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency\nwith the rest of the quantum formalism. The derivation implies that the\nsymmetrization postulate admits no natural variants.

Finally,\nwe show significant enhancement of entanglement can be produced by applying\nlocalized dissipation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 19:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 20:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Pudlik", "Tadeusz", ""], ["Hennig", "Holger", ""], ["Witthaut", "D.", ""], ["Campbell", "David K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0791", "submitter": "Lin Chen", "authors": "Lin Chen, Dragomir Z.

The novel properties obtained, with details of\nderivations provided here, hopefully would call for experiments on\npolarizations correlations which would monitor speeds of colliding particles,\nand, would, in turn, lead to new tests of the fundamental interactions of QFT\nsuch as of QED and of the Electroweak Theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 07:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Yongram", "N.", ""], ["Manoukian", "E.

We have studied theoretically the\ndynamics of a BEC after release from a toroidal trap potential by solving the\n3D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The trap and condensate characteristics\nmatched those of a recent experiment. The circulation, experimentally imparted\nto the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a\nlinear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical\nTOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon\nrelease the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct\nphases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial\nhole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation.\nIn the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum\nafter which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a\nseries of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and\noutgoing matter waves from the inner radius. The results of the GP equation\npredict that the hole area is a quadratic function of the initial circulation\nwhen the condensate is released directly from the trap in which it was stirred\nand is a linear function of the circulation if the trap is relaxed before\nrelease. These scalings matched the data. Thus, hole size after TOF can be used\nas a reliable probe of initial condensate circulation. This connection between\ncirculation and hole size after TOF will facilitate future studies of\natomtronic systems that are implemented in ultracold quantum gases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 18:46:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Murray", "Noel", ""], ["Krygier", "Michael", ""], ["Edwards", "Mark", ""], ["Wright", "K.

Indeed, properties of\nLorenz's fractal invariant set relate space-time calculus to deep areas of\nmathematics such as G\\\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem. These properties,\ncombined with some recent developments in theoretical and observational\ncosmology, motivate what is referred to as the `cosmological invariant set\npostulate': that the universe $U$ can be considered a deterministic dynamical\nsystem evolving on a causal measure-zero fractal invariant set $I_U$ in its\nstate space. Symbolic representations of $I_U$ are constructed explicitly based\non permutation representations of quaternions. The resulting `invariant set\ntheory' provides some new perspectives on determinism and causality in\nfundamental physics. For example, whilst the cosmological invariant set appears\nto have a rich enough structure to allow a description of quantum probability,\nits measure-zero character ensures it is sparse enough to prevent invariant set\ntheory being constrained by the Bell inequality (consistent with a partial\nviolation of the so-called measurement independence postulate). The primacy of\ngeometry as embodied in the proposed theory extends the principles underpinning\ngeneral relativity. As a result, the physical basis for contemporary programmes\nwhich apply standard field quantisation to some putative gravitational\nlagrangian is questioned.

This is particularly challenging since all QED\ntextbooks state that such an splitting cannot be done for a photon (and a\nfortiori for a gluon) in a gauge-invariant way, yet experimentalists around the\nworld are engaged in measuring what they believe is the gluon spin!

Since these parameters are fully under experimental\ncontrol, this is also the case for the number of ejected particles and their\nemission spectrum. The process of tunneling to open space can hence be used,\nfor example, for the quantum simulation of complicated tunneling ionization\nprocesses and atom lasers. To understand the many-body tunneling process, a\ngeneralization of the model introduced in [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It is demonstrated\nthat the model is applicable for general interparticle interaction strengths,\nparticle numbers and threshold values. The model constructs the many-body\nprocess from single-particle emission processes. The rates and emission momenta\nof the single-particle processes are determined by the chemical potentials and\nenergy differences to the threshold value of the potential for systems with\ndifferent particle numbers. The chemical potentials and these energy\ndifferences depend on the interparticle interaction. Both the number of\nconfined particles and their rate of emission thus allow for a control by the\nmanipulation of the interparticle interaction and the threshold.

A scheme for the\ninverse process, namely \"quantum state splitting\", has also been theoretically\nproposed. Both processes can be iterated in a cascaded layout, to obtain the\njoining and/or splitting of more than two qubits, thus leading to a general\nscheme for varying the number of photons in the system while preserving its\ntotal quantum state, or quantum information content. Here, we revisit these\nprocesses from a theoretical point of view. After casting the theory of the\njoining and splitting processes in the more general photon occupation number\nnotation, we introduce some modified schemes that are in principle unitary (not\nconsidering the implementation of the CNOT gates) and do not require projection\nand feed-forward steps. This can be particularly important in the quantum state\nsplitting case, to obtain a scheme that does not rely on postselection.\nMoreover, we formally prove that the quantum joining of two photon states with\nlinear optics requires the use of at least one ancilla photon. This is somewhat\nunexpected, given that the demonstrated joining scheme involves the sequential\napplication of two CNOT quantum gates, for which a linear optical scheme with\njust two photons and postselection is known to exist.

We obtain the evolution equation for the\nWigner function of a long-wavelength subsystem that describes its decoherence,\nisotropization, and approach to thermal equilibrium induced by interaction with\nshort-wavelength modes.

It draws from many well established physical theories such as\nquantum field theory in curved spacetimes, quantum optics and Gaussian state\nquantum information. The results are split between three chapters. For the\nfirst results, we set-up the basic framework for working with quantum fields\nconfined to cavities. By considering the real Klein-Gordon field, we describe\nhow to model the non-uniform motion of a rigid cavity through spacetime. We\nemploy the use of Bogoliubov transformations to describe the effects of\nchanging acceleration. The second set of results investigate how the Dirac\nfield can be confined to a cavity for quantum information purposes. By again\nconsidering Bogoliubov transformations, we thoroughly investigate how the\nentanglement shared between two cavities is affected by non-uniform motion. It\nis shown that different types of Dirac field states are more robust against\nmotion than others. The final results look at using our second notion of\nlocalisation, Unruh- DeWitt detectors. We investigate how allowing for a\n\"non-point-like\" spatial profile of the Unruh-DeWitt detector affects how it\ninteracts with a quantum field around it. By engineering suitable\ndetector-field interactions, we use techniques from symplectic geometry to\ncompute the dynamics of a quantum state beyond commonly used perturbation\ntheory.

When scaling up\nthe quantum registers in such devices, several challenges arise: individual\naddressing of qubits in a dense spectrum while suppressing crosstalk, creation\nof entanglement between distant nodes, and decoupling from unwanted\ninteractions. The experimental implementation of optimal control is a\nprerequisite to meeting these challenges. Using engineered microwave pulses, we\nexperimentally demonstrate optimal control of a prototype solid state spin\nqubit system comprising thirty six energy levels. The spin qubits are\nassociated with proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We\ndemonstrate precise single-electron spin qubit operations with an unprecedented\nfidelity F \\approx 0.99 in combination with high-efficiency storage of electron\nspin states in a nuclear spin quantum memory. Matching single-electron spin\noperations with spin-echo techniques, we further realize high-quality entangled\nstates (F > 0.82) between two electron spins on demand. After exploiting\noptimal control, the fidelity is mostly limited by the coherence time and\nimperfect initialization. Errors from crosstalk in a crowded spectrum of 8\nlines as well as detrimental effects from active dipolar couplings have been\nsimultaneously eliminated to unprecedented extent. Finally, by entanglement\nswapping to nuclear spins, nuclear spin entanglement over a length scale of 25\nnm is demonstrated.

As a consequence, there is a prima facie argument exploiting\nentanglement that CTC interactions would enable superluminal and, indeed,\neffectively instantaneous signaling. In cases of spacelike separation between\nthe sender of a signal and the receiver, whether a receiver measures the local\npart of an entangled state or a disentangled state to access the signal can\ndepend on the reference frame. We propose a consistency condition that gives\npriority to either an entangled perspective or a disentangled perspective in\nspacelike separated scenarios. For D-CTC interactions, the consistency\ncondition gives priority to frames of reference in which the state is\ndisentangled, while for P-CTC interactions the condition selects the entangled\nstate. Using the consistency condition, we show that there is a procedure that\nallows Alice to signal to Bob in the past via relayed superluminal\ncommunications between spacelike separated Alice and Clio, and spacelike\nseparated Clio and Bob. This opens the door to time travel paradoxes in the\nclassical domain.

The phase increment of the semiclassical Weyl\npropagator, as a caustic is crossed, is derived from the facts that the\ncorresponding family of tangent operators belong to the metaplectic group and\nthat the products of the tangent propagators are obtained from Gaussian\nintegrals. The Weyl representation of the metaplectic group is here presented,\nwith the correct phases determined within an intrinsic ambiguity for the\noverall sign. The elements that fully determine the phase increment across a\nparticular caustic are then analysed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2013 18:28:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["de Almeida", "Alfredo M.

We find that continuous monitoring taken as the limit of a\nsequence of ideal measurements will only inhibit decay in special cases, such\nas in well-controlled experiments. Uncontrolled monitoring of an unstable\nsystem, however, can cause exponentially decreasing non-decay probability at\nall times. Furthermore, calculating the decay rate for a general sequence of\nobservations leads to a straightforward derivation of Fermi's Golden Rule, that\navoids many of the conceptual difficulties normally encountered. When multiple\ndecay channels are available, the derivation reveals how the total decay rate\nnaturally partitions into a sum of the decay rates for the various channels, in\nagreement with observations. Continuous and unavoidable monitoring of an\nexcited system by an uncontrolled environment may therefore be a mechanism by\nwhich to explain the exponential decay law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2013 19:08:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Oct 2014 18:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bryant", "P.

This paper studies how best to take advantage of these latest\nideas to construct desirable quantum error-correcting codes of very high\ninformation rate. Our methods exploit structured high-rate low-density\nparity-check codes available in the classical domain and provide quantum\nanalogues that inherit their characteristic low decoding complexity and high\nerror correction performance even at moderate code lengths. Our approach to\ndesigning high-rate quantum error-correcting codes also allows for making\ndirect use of other major syndrome decoding methods for linear codes, making it\npossible to deal with a situation where promising quantum analogues of\nlow-density parity-check codes are difficult to find.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Sep 2013 10:24:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 10:21:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fujiwara", "Yuichiro", ""], ["Gruner", "Alexander", ""], ["Vandendriessche", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.5591", "submitter": "Gregory Furman", "authors": "G.

Our main insight is that quantum\nstates may be thermodynamic resources and can provide a powerful handle, or\ncontrol, on the efficiency of the heat machine. In particular, a piston\ninitialized in a coherent state can cause the engine to produce work at an\nefficiency above the Carnot bound in the linear amplification regime.

We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein\nthermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a\nparticular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and\ntransformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at\nsome fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the\nresources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have\ntrivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In\nthis case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or\nimplement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states\nof informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the\nmaximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's\nnonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed,\nfor instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state\nconversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and\nnoncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a\ngeometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also\nreview the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular\nthrough the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in\nthis resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical\ncounterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features\narising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard\nformulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion\nfor deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Sep 2013 17:35:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2015 19:21:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gour", "Gilad", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Markus P.", ""], ["Narasimhachar", "Varun", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""], ["Halpern", "Nicole Yunger", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6620", "submitter": "Joshua Combes", "authors": "Joshua Combes, Christopher Ferrie, Zhang Jiang, and Carlton M.

Recent\nexperiments in a range of technical platforms have demonstrated the basic\nfunctionality of quantum simulation applied to quantum magnetism, quantum phase\ntransitions, and relativistic quantum mechanics. In all cases, the underlying\nhardware platforms restrict the achievable inter-particle interaction, forming\na serious constraint on the ability to realize a versatile, programmable\nquantum simulator. In this work, we address this problem by developing novel\nsequences of unitary operations that engineer desired effective Hamiltonians in\nthe time-domain. The result is a hybrid programmable analog simulator\npermitting a broad class of interacting spin-lattice models to be generated\nstarting only with an arbitrary long-range native inter-particle interaction\nand single-qubit addressing. Specifically, our approach permits the generation\nof all symmetrically coupled translation-invariant two-body Hamiltonians with\nhomogeneous on-site terms, a class which includes all spin-1/2 XYZ chains, but\ngeneralized to include long-range couplings. Building on previous work proving\nthat universal simulation is possible using both entangling gates and\nsingle-qubit unitaries, we show that determining the \"program\" of unitary\npulses to implement an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian can be formulated as a linear\nprogram that runs in polynomial time and scales efficiently in hardware\nresources.

Separability range in one parameter family of W\nand GHZ states with 3 and 4 qubits is explored here and it is shown that the\nresults inferred from negative Tsallis conditional entropy matches with that\nobtained through Peres partial transpose criteria for one-parameter family of W\nstates, in one of its partitions. The criteria is shown to be non-spectral\nthrough its usefulness in identifying entanglement in isospectral density\nmatrices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 15:44:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 13:53:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Rajagopal", "A.

Namely, we prove that there exists\nan exponential gap between quantum (even probabilistic) communication\ncomplexity and classical deterministic communication complexity of some\nspecific versions of the disjointness problem.\n  Klauck [Kla00] proved, for any language, that the state complexity of exact\nquantum/classical finite automata, which is a general model of one-way quantum\nfinite automata, is not less than the state complexity of an equivalent one-way\ndeterministic finite automata (1DFA). In this paper we show, using a\ncommunication complexity result, that situation may be different for some\npromise problems. Namely, we show for certain promise problem that the gap\nbetween the state complexity of exact one-way quantum finite automata and 1DFA\ncan be exponential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 07:10:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gruska", "Jozef", ""], ["Qiu", "Daowen", ""], ["Zheng", "Shenggen", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.7740", "submitter": "Evgenii D.

We then provide\nexplicit examples of PPT states which are nearly as far from separable ones as\npossible. To obtain a distance of 2-{\\epsilon} from the separable states, we\nneed a dimension of 2^{poly(\\log(1/\\epsilon))}, as opposed to\n2^{poly(1/\\epsilon)} given by the construction of Beigi and Shor. We do so by\nexploiting the so called {\\it private states}, introduced earlier in the\ncontext of quantum cryptography. We also provide a lower bound for the distance\nbetween private states and PPT states and investigate the distance between pure\nstates and the set of PPT states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:55:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 10:29:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Badziag", "Piotr", ""], ["Horodecki", "Karol", ""], ["Horodecki", "Michal", ""], ["Jenkinson", "Justin", ""], ["Szarek", "Stanislaw J.", ""]]}]
