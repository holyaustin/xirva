As an\nillustration of the potential applicability of the method in quantum\ncommunication protocols, we use it to prove security of an entanglement based\nquantum key distribution scheme with an untrusted source without the need of a\nsquash model and by solely using this extra idea. In this sense, this detector\ndecoy method can be seen as a different conceptual approach to adapt a single\nphoton security proof to its physical, full optical implementation.

A formulation is employed in which the binary\nclassifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of\nweak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning\nprocess that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of\nweak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring\nit into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing\n(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be\nrepresented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training\nexamples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively\nformulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it\nwith heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting\nclassifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a\nvariety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact\nthat bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error\nrates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1\nloss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's\nimplementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results\nbetter than those obtained with boosting approaches.

In this essay, the geometry of a Clifford group G is expressed as a\nBN-pair, i.e. a pair of subgroups B and N that generate G, is such that\nintersection H = B \\cap N is normal in G, the group W = N/H is a Coxeter group\nand two extra axioms are satisfied by the double cosets acting on B. The\nBN-pair used in this decomposition relies on the swap and match gates already\nintroduced for classically simulating quantum circuits (R Jozsa and A Miyake,\nPreprint arXiv:0804.4050 [quant-ph]). The two- and three-qubit steps are\nrelated to the configuration with 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Nov 2008 16:41:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 20:35:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Planat", "Michel", "", "FEMTO-ST"], ["Sol\u00e9", "Patrick", "", "I3S"]]}, {"id": "0811.2113", "submitter": "J\\\"urgen Koslowski", "authors": "Chris Heunen", "title": "Compactly accessible categories and quantum key distribution", "comments": "26 pages in Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 4, Issue 4\n  (November 17, 2008) lmcs:1129", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 4, Issue 4 (November\n  17, 2008) lmcs:1129", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-4(4:9)2008", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PL quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Compact categories have lately seen renewed interest via applications to\nquantum physics.

First, basing on the\nfact that any positive map $\\Lambda:M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})\\to M_{d}(\\mathbb{C})$ can\nbe written as the difference between two completely positive maps\n$\\Lambda=\\Lambda_{1}-\\Lambda_{2}$, we propose a possible way to generalize the\nNielsen--Kempe majorization criterion. Then we present two methods of\nderivation of some general classes of entropic inequalities useful for the\ndetection of entanglement. While the first one follows from the aforementioned\ngeneralized majorization relation and the concept of the Schur--concave\ndecreasing functions, the second is based on some functional inequalities. What\nis important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and\nentropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states\nwith positive partial transposition when using indecomposable positive maps. We\nalso point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is\ndetected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\\Lambda$, then\nthere exist entropic inequalities derived from $\\Lambda$ (by both procedures)\nthat also detect this state. In this sense, they are equivalent to the\nnecessary criterion $[I\\ot\\Lambda](\\varrho_{AB})\\geq 0$. Moreover, our\ninequalities provide a way of constructing multi--copy entanglement witnesses\nand therefore are promising from the experimental point of view.

To explore the effect of dissipation and coherent drive on\ntunnel coupled interacting bosonic systems, we propose a device that is the\nquantum optical analog of a Josephson interferometer. It consists of two\ncoherently driven linear optical cavities connected via a central cavity with a\nsingle-photon nonlinearity. The Josephson-like oscillations in the light\nemitted from the central cavity as a function of the phase difference between\ntwo pumping fields can be suppressed by increasing the strength of the\nnonlinear coupling. Remarkably, we find that in the limit of ultra-strong\ninteractions in the center-cavity, the coupled system maps on to an effective\nJaynes-Cummings system with a nonlinearity determined by the tunnel coupling\nstrength. In the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear\nwaveguides, the degree of photon antibunching from the nonlinear cavity\nprovides an excellent measure of the transition to the nonlinear regime where\nJosephson oscillations are suppressed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Nov 2008 17:38:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gerace", "Dario", ""], ["Tureci", "Hakan E.", ""], ["Imamoglu", "A.", ""], ["Giovannetti", "Vittorio", ""], ["Fazio", "Rosario", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3771", "submitter": "Greg Ver Steeg", "authors": "Greg Ver Steeg and Stephanie Wehner", "title": "Relaxed uncertainty relations and information processing", "comments": "33 pages, 1 figure. v2: improved notation, to appear in QIC", "journal-ref": "Quantum Information and Computation, 9 (9&10), 0801-0832, 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a range of \"theories\" that violate the uncertainty relation for\nanti-commuting observables derived in [JMP, 49, 062105 (2008)].

A\ncomplete and abrupt loss of the entanglement, called the entanglement sudden\ndeath, can be found to occur for the spin correlated states, but the\nentanglement evolves without any discontinuity or decays asymptotically for the\nspin anti-correlated states. We consider the evolution of an initial\nentanglement encoded in the spin anti-correlated states and demonstrate that\nthe asymptotic behavior predicted before occurs only in the weak coupling limit\nor equivalently when the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the\ninteraction Hamiltonian of the qubits with the field. If we do not restrict\nourselves to the RWA, we find that the entanglement undergoes a discontinuity,\nthe sudden death phenomenon. We illustrate this behavior by employing an\nefficient scheme for entanglement evolution between two cold-trapped atoms\nlocated inside a single-mode cavity. Although only a single excitation is\ninitially present in the system, we find that the two-photon excited state,\nwhich plays the key role for the discontinuity in the behavior of the\nentanglement, gains a population over a short time of the evolution. When the\nRWA is made on the interaction, the two-photon excited state remains\nunpopulated for all times and the discontinuity is absent. We attribute this\nphenomenon to the principle of complementarity between the evolution time and\nenergy, and the presence of the counter-rotating terms in the interaction\nHamiltonian.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Nov 2008 00:24:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2009 03:46:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jing", "Jun", ""], ["Lu", "Zhi-Guo", ""], ["Ficek", "Zbigniew", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.4662", "submitter": "Mihai L.
