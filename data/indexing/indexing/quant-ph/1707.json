Long-distance teleportation has been\nrecognized as a fundamental element in protocols such as large-scale quantum\nnetworks and distributed quantum computation. However, the previous\nteleportation experiments between distant locations were limited to a distance\non the order of 100 kilometers, due to photon loss in optical fibres or\nterrestrial free-space channels. An outstanding open challenge for a\nglobal-scale \"quantum internet\" is to significantly extend the range for\nteleportation. A promising solution to this problem is exploiting satellite\nplatform and space-based link, which can conveniently connect two remote points\non the Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most of the photons'\npropagation path is in empty space. Here, we report the first quantum\nteleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to\na low Earth orbit satellite - through an up-link channel - with a distance up\nto 1400 km.

Our results suggest that the no-restriction hypothesis may play a\nfundamental role in singling out the set of quantum correlations among other\nnon-signalling ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Jul 2017 18:43:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2018 19:18:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2018 14:57:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sainz", "Ana Bel\u00e9n", ""], ["Guryanova", "Yelena", ""], ["Ac\u00edn", "Antonio", ""], ["Navascu\u00e9s", "Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.02621", "submitter": "Matteo Michele Wauters", "authors": "Matteo M.

By regularizing the\nnear-origin behavior of the potential by a finite square well with variable\nwidth $b$ and depth $g$, it is shown how these two scale-invariant theories\noccupy fixed points in the resulting $(b,g)$-space of Hamiltonians. A\nrenormalization group flow exists in this space and scaling variables are shown\nto exist in a neighborhood of the fixed points. Consequently, the propagator of\nthe regulated theory enjoys homogeneous scaling laws close to the fixed points.\nUsing renormalization group arguments it is possible to discern the functional\nform of the propagator for long distances and long imaginary times, thus\ndemonstrating the extent to which fixed points control the behavior of the\ncut-off theory.\n  By keeping the width fixed and varying only the well depth, we show how the\nmean position of a bound state diverges as $g$ approaches a critical value.

Quantum simulation of spin systems is being explored with trapped\nions, neutral atoms and superconducting devices.

It is\nbased on laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms. Their long intrinsic lifetimes\ncombined with the inhibition of their microwave spontaneous emission and their\nlow sensitivity to collisions and photoionization make trapping lifetimes in\nthe minute range realistic with state-of-the-art techniques. Ultra-cold\ndefect-free circular atom chains can be prepared by a variant of the\nevaporative cooling method. This method also leads to the individual detection\nof arbitrary spin observables. The proposed simulator realizes an XXZ spin-1/2\nHamiltonian with nearest-neighbor couplings ranging from a few to tens of kHz.\nAll the model parameters can be tuned at will, making a large range of\nsimulations accessible.

Intuitively, the definitions of coherence and decoherence\nshould be the two sides of the same coin. Therefore, a natural question is\nraised: how can the conventional decoherence processes, such as the von\nNeumann-L\\\"{u}ders (projective) measurement postulation or partially dephasing\nchannels, fit into the bigger picture of the recently established theoretic\nframework? Here we show that the state collapse rules of the von Neumann or\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurements, as special cases of genuinely incoherent\noperations (GIO), are consistent with the resource theories of quantum\ncoherence. New hierarchical measures of coherence are proposed for the\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurement and their relationship with measurement-dependent\ndiscord is addressed. Moreover, utilizing the fixed point theory for\n$C^\\ast$-algebra, we prove that GIO indeed represent a particular type of\npartially dephasing (phase-damping) channels which have a matrix representation\nbased on the Schur product.

Their\npredictions are extremely hard to test in practice. Quantum effects in the\ngravitational field are exceptionally small, unlike those in the\nelectromagnetic field. The fundamental reason is that the gravitational\ncoupling constant is about 43 orders of magnitude smaller than the fine\nstructure constant, which governs light-matter interactions. For example, the\ndetection of gravitons -- the hypothetical quanta of energy of the\ngravitational field predicted by certain quantum-gravity proposals -- is deemed\nto be practically impossible. In this letter we adopt a radically different,\nquantum-information-theoretic approach which circumvents the problem that\nquantum gravity is hard to test. We propose an experiment to witness\nquantum-like features in the gravitational field, by probing it with two masses\neach in a superposition of two locations. First, we prove the fact that any\nsystem (e.g. a field) capable of mediating entanglement between two quantum\nsystems must itself be quantum. This argument is general and does not rely on\nany specific dynamics. Then, we propose an experiment to detect the\nentanglement generated between two masses via gravitational interaction. By our\nargument, the degree of entanglement between the masses is an indirect witness\nof the quantisation of the field mediating the interaction. Remarkably, this\nexperiment does not require any quantum control over gravity itself. It is also\ncloser to realisation than other proposals, such as detecting gravitons or\ndetecting quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:03:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Dec 2017 05:30:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Marletto", "Chiara", ""], ["Vedral", "Vlatko", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.06039", "submitter": "Daoyi Dong", "authors": "Yuanlong Wang, Qi Yin, Daoyi Dong, Bo Qi, Ian R.

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR\nsteering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing\nand extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We\nfurther consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose\nexpectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for\nall two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion,\nthese observables are found to be always less sensitive than Gaussian\nobservables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous variable\nWerner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find\nthat pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to\nreveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of\nnon-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian\nand non-Gaussian states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 16:35:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Xiang", "Yu", ""], ["Xu", "Buqing", ""], ["Mi\u0161ta", "Ladislav", "Jr."], ["Tufarelli", "Tommaso", ""], ["He", "Qiongyi", ""], ["Adesso", "Gerardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.07205", "submitter": "Jonathan King", "authors": "Keunhong Jeong, Anna J.

The promise is that\nMA-QKD would require less demanding quantum memories than the ones needed for\nprobabilistic quantum repeaters. Nevertheless, early investigations suggest\nthat, in order to beat the conventional no-memory QKD schemes, the quantum\nmemories used in the MA-QKD protocols must have high bandwidth-storage products\nand short interaction times. Among different types of quantum memories,\nensemble-based memories offer some of the required specifications, but they\ntypically suffer from multiple excitation effects. To avoid the latter issue,\nin this paper, we propose two new variants of MA-QKD both relying on\nsingle-photon sources (SPSs) for entangling purposes.

The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions.

The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary.

We also\nexplore its zero-temperature-singularity behavior and find a transition from a\nnon-singular to a singular region, at a point that is different from the one\nseparating non-local and local ordering.} The disordered Heisenberg chain can\nbe treated only numerically: by means of MPS-based simulations, we are able to\nlocate the existence of a transition between antiferromagnetic and\nstring-ordered phase, through the study of order parameters.

We present results which show how one can\neffectively reduce the error rate associated with a noisy quantum channel, by\ncounteracting its detrimental effects with another form of noise. In\nparticular, we consider the effect of adding on top of a purely Markovian\n(Lindblad) dynamics, a more general form of dissipation, which we refer to as\ngeneralized-Markovian noise. This noise has an associated memory kernel and the\nresulting dynamics is described by an integro-differential equation. The\noverall dynamics are characterized by decay rates which depend not only on the\noriginal dissipative time-scales, but also on the new integral kernel. We find\nthat one can engineer this kernel such that the overall rate of decay is\nlowered by the addition of this noise term. We illustrate this technique for\nthe case where the bare noise is described by a dephasing Pauli channel. We\nanalytically solve this model, and show that one can effectively double (or\neven triple) the length of the channel, whilst achieving the same fidelity,\nentanglement, and error threshold. We numerically verify this scheme can also\nbe used to protect against thermal Markovian noise (at non-zero temperature),\nwhich models spontaneous emission and excitation processes. A physical\ninterpretation of this scheme is discussed, whereby the added\ngeneralized-Markovian noise causes the system to become periodically decoupled\nfrom the background Markovian noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 16:19:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:53:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Marshall", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Venuti", "Lorenzo Campos", ""], ["Zanardi", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09318", "submitter": "Alfredo Luis", "authors": "Alfredo Luis and Laura Monroy", "title": "Nonclassicality of coherent states: Entanglement of joint statistics", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

First, we give\na general discussion and show that for a quantum coherent process, work\nstatistics is very different from that of the two-point measurement scheme,\nspecifically the average work is increased or decreased and the work\nfluctuation can be decreased by quantum coherence, which strongly depends on\nthe relative phase, the energy level structure and the external protocol. Then,\nwe concretely consider a quenched 1-D transverse Ising model, and show that\nquantum coherence has a more significant influence on work statistics in the\nferromagnetism regime compared with that in the paramagnetism regime, so that\ndue to the presence of quantum coherence the work statistics can exhibit the\ncritical phenonmenon even at high temperature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Jul 2017 07:49:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 27 May 2018 13:31:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Bao-Ming", ""], ["Zou", "Jian", ""], ["Guo", "Li-Sha", ""], ["Kong", "Xiang-Mu", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09617", "submitter": "Ming-Liang Hu", "authors": "Ming-Liang Hu, Shu-Qian Shen, Heng Fan", "title": "Maximum coherence in the optimal basis", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

As an\napplication, we make use of a `polar decomposition' for quantum processes to\ndiscuss the repeatable use of quantum resources and to provide a novel\nperspective in terms of the coordinates induced on the orbit of a local process\nunder a symmetry action.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 12:55:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2018 13:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cirstoiu", "Cristina", ""], ["Jennings", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09832", "submitter": "Vito Giovanni Lucivero", "authors": "V.
