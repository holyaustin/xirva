Recently it has been shown that quantum coherence can, in\nprinciple, enhance the efficiency of a solar cell, working like a quantum heat\nengine (QHE). Here, we propose a biological quantum heat engine (BQHE)\nmotivated by Photosystem {\\rm II} reaction center (PS{\\rm II} RC) to describe\nthe charge separation. Our model mainly considers two charge-separation\npathways more than that in the published literature. The two pathways can\ninterfere via cross-couplings and work together to enhance the\ncharge-separation yields. We explore how these cross-couplings increase the\ncurrent and voltage of the charge separation and discuss the advantages of\nmultiple pathways in terms of current and power. The robustness of the BQHE\nagainst the charge recombination in natural PS{\\rm II} RC and dephasing induced\nby environments is also explored, and extension from two pathways to multiple\npathways is made. These results suggest that nature-mimicking architectures\nwith engineered multiple pathways for charge separations might be better for\nartificial solar energy devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 21:54:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Qin", "M.", ""], ["Shen", "H.

In particular, we compute the natural occupation numbers for\nthe ground state of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential.\nIntriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are strongly quasipinned,\neven up to medium interaction strengths.

For any decision problem, there\nexists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query\ncomplexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging.\n  We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We\nshow how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide\n\"property testing\" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span\nprogram witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example,\nusing our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an\noptimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal\nalgorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming\nweight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that\none of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate\nthe Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the\nrequirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which\ncould make design of span programs easier.\n  We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the\nunderstanding of this important model. One implication is alternative\nalgorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain\nunitary can be lower bounded.

The first part is an introduction to classical and\nquantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are\nintroduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical\nset, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT\nare then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo\ntheorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second\npart, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are\ndiscussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon\nof the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state,\nafter its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is\nshown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of\nan isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics\nand violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial\ninformation content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general\nrelativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The\nrenormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic\ndescription of a physical system from its microscopic description. This passage\nfrom microscopic to macroscopic can be described in terms of several steps from\none scale to another, and is therefore formalized as the action of a group. The\nc-theorem proves the existence, under certain conditions, of a function which\nis monotonically decreasing along the group transformations. This result\nsuggests an interpretation of this function as entropy, and its use to study\nthe information flow along the RG transformations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2015 15:53:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 20:37:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Grazioso", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.00963", "submitter": "Atanu Rajak", "authors": "Atanu Rajak and Uma Divakaran", "title": "Effect of double local quenches on Loschmidt echo and entanglement\n  entropy of a one-dimensional quantum system", "comments": "11 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "JSTAT 043107 (2016)", "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2016/04/043107", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.other quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the effect of two simultaneous local quenches on the evolution of\nLoschmidt echo and entanglement entropy of a one dimensional transverse Ising\nmodel.

We prove the continuity\nproperty for the QFI in the sense that two close states with close first\nderivatives have close QFIs. This property is completely general and\nirrespective of dynamics or how states acquire their parameter dependence and\nalso the form of parameter dependence---indeed this continuity is basically a\nfeature of the classical Fisher information that in the case of the QFI\nnaturally carries over from the manifold of probability distributions onto the\nmanifold of density matrices. We demonstrate that in the special case where the\ndependence of the states on the unknown parameter comes from one dynamical map\n(quantum channel), the continuity holds in its reduced form with respect to the\ninitial states. In addition, we show that when one initial state evolves\nthrough two different quantum channels, the continuity relation applies in its\ngeneral form. A situation in which such scenario can occur is an open-system\nmetrology where one of the maps represents the ideal dynamics whereas the other\nmap represents the real (noisy) dynamics. In the making of our main result, we\nalso introduce a regularized representation for the symmetric logarithmic\nderivative which works for general states even with incomplete rank, and its\nfeatures continuity similarly to the QFI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 10:19:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Jun 2018 19:29:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2019 08:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rezakhani", "A.

Although this model is valid in simple situations, such as the\npresence of a beam splitter, it is not necessarily valid when a system with\nmany degrees of freedom is involved. In order to address this issue, we\nconsider in this paper various atomic transitions corresponding to\namplification or attenuation using the master-equation- (ME-) based approach to\nmodel the QN and to compare the results with the SC-CM. For a four-level system\nthat consists of a transition producing a broad gain peak and a transition\nproducing an absorption dip, which results in perfect transparency at the\ncenter, we observe a catastrophic breakdown of the SC-CM. We also show that for\na general two-level atomic system, the SC-CM does not apply, except in the\nlimiting case when only either amplification or attenuation exists. A special\ncase where the two models predict the same result is a {\\Lambda}-type\nthree-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system in which the\nQN at zero detuning vanishes while the system is in the dark state. We also\nstudy an optically pumped five-level gain EIT system which has a perfect\ntransparency dip superimposed on a gain profile, and yields the negative\ndispersion suitable for use in enhancing the sensitivity-bandwidth product of\nan interferometric gravitational wave detector. In this case, we find that, for\nsome set of parameters, the QN is vanishingly small at the center of the dip,\nand the SC-CM agrees closely with the ME model. However, we also find that for\nsome other set of parameters, the SC-SM model disagrees strongly with the ME\nmodel. All these cases illustrate a wide range of variations in the degree of\ndisagreement between the predictions of the SC-CM and the ME approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 18:41:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2015 15:32:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 22:09:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 15:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 19:34:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 21:59:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Minchuan", ""], ["Zhou", "Zifan", ""], ["Shahriar", "Selim M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.02267", "submitter": "Fernando Iemini", "authors": "Fernando Iemini, Leonardo da Silva Souza, Tiago Debarba, Andre T.\n  Ces\\'ario, Thiago O.

To overcome constraints imposed by restricted connectivity between\nqubits, a larger set of interactions can be approximated using minor embedding\ntechniques whereby several physical qubits are used to represent a single\nlogical qubit. However, minor embedding introduces new types of errors due to\nits approximate nature. We introduce and study quantum annealing correction\nschemes designed to improve the performance of quantum annealers in conjunction\nwith minor embedding, thus leading to a hybrid scheme defined over an encoded\ngraph. We argue that this scheme can be efficiently decoded using an energy\nminimization technique provided the density of errors does not exceed the\nper-site percolation threshold of the encoded graph. We test the hybrid scheme\nusing a D-Wave Two processor on problems for which the encoded graph is a\n2-level grid and the Ising model is known to be NP-hard. The problems we\nconsider are frustrated Ising model problem instances with \"planted\" (a priori\nknown) solutions. Applied in conjunction with optimized energy penalties and\ndecoding techniques, we find that this approach enables the quantum annealer to\nsolve minor embedded instances with significantly higher success probability\nthan it would without error correction.

We compare pulsed fast gate schemes, defined by a timescale faster\nthan the trap period, and find that our proposed scheme has less stringent\nrequirements on laser repetition rate for achieving arbitrary gate time targets\nand infidelities well below $10^{-4}$. By extending gate schemes to ion\ncrystals, we explore the effect of ion number on gate fidelity for coupling\nneighbouring pairs of ions in large crystals. Inter-ion distance determines the\ngate time, and a factor of five increase in repetition rate, or correspondingly\nthe laser power, reduces the infidelity by almost two orders of magnitude. We\nalso apply our fast gate scheme to entangle the first and last ions in a\ncrystal. As the number of ions in the crystal increases, significant increases\nin the laser power are required to provide the short gate times corresponding\nto fidelity above 0.99.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 05:58:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 23:16:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bentley", "C.

The basic concepts and\nterms that are needed for consistent treatment of intransitivity in various\napplications are presented and analysed in a unified manner. The analysis\npoints out conditions that necessitate appearance of intransitivity, such as\nmultiplicity of preference criteria and imperfect (i.e. approximate)\ndiscrimination of different cases.

The example of competitive simulations for the\nrisk/benefit dilemma demonstrates the significance of intransitivity in cyclic\nbehaviour and abrupt changes in the system.

J. Phys. $\\bf{80}$\n780-14), quantum and classical uncertainties for dimensionless variables of\nposition and momentum were evaluated in three potentials: infinite well,\nbouncing ball, and harmonic oscillator. While original quantum uncertainty\nproducts depend on ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$ and the number of states ($n$), a\ndimensionless approach makes the comparison between quantum uncertainty and\nclassical dispersion possible by excluding ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$. But the question is\nwhether the uncertainty still remains dependent on quantum number $n$. In the\nabove-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the\ndimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical\ndispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\\to \\infty\n$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar\nevaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to\ntheir classical counterparts independent of $n$. This equality may hide the\nquantum feature of low energy levels. In the current study, we change the\npotential intervals in order to make them symmetric for the linear potential\nand non-symmetric for the quadratic potential. As a result, it is shown in this\npaper that the dimensionless quantum uncertainty of these potentials in the new\npotential intervals is expressed in terms of quantum number $n$. In other\nwords, the uncertainty requires the correspondence principle in order to\napproach the classical limit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\ndimensionless analysis, as a useful pedagogical method, does not take away the\nquantum feature of the n-dependence of quantum uncertainty in general.\nMoreover, our numerical calculations include the higher powers of the position\nfor the potentials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:41:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 09:42:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Aug 2016 06:36:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kheiri", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.04148", "submitter": "Martina Esposito", "authors": "Martina Esposito, Kelvin Titimbo, Klaus Zimmermann, Francesca Giusti,\n  Francesco Randi, Davide Boschetto, Fulvio Parmigiani, Roberto Floreanini,\n  Fabio Benatti, and Daniele Fausti", "title": "Photon number statistics uncover the fluctuations in non-equilibrium\n  lattice dynamics", "comments": "7 pages (main text), 5 figures, 11 pages (supplementary information)", "journal-ref": "Nature Communication, 6, 10249 (2015)", "doi": "10.1038/ncomms10249", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fluctuations of the atomic positions are at the core of a large class of\nunusual material properties ranging from quantum para-electricity to high\ntemperature superconductivity.

In any\nrealistic implementation, however, physical errors are present, which corrupt\nthe output of the transformation. We investigate the dominant sources of error\nin this architecture --- loss and mode-mismatch --- and consider how it affects\nthe BosonSampling protocol, a key application for passive linear optics. For\nour loss analysis we consider two major components that contribute to loss ---\nfiber and switches --- and calculate how this affects the success probability\nand fidelity of the device. Interestingly, we find that errors due to loss are\nnot uniform (unique to time-bin encoding), which asymmetrically biases the\nimplemented unitary.

A hallmark\nof these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative\nedge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the\nsystem. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in\nnon-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\\it imaginary} gauge field. As\ncompared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological\ninsulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\\it\nlower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport\nproperties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge\nfield are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying\nrobust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden\nbecause reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the\nspectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into\nthe one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field,\n{\\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the\ngauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the\npresence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred\nto as {\\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be\nalso realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems,\nin which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous\nHermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric\n(non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian\ntransparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring\nresonators, is suggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 05:54:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 05:04:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Longhi", "Stefano", ""], ["Gatti", "Davide", ""], ["Della Valle", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07666", "submitter": "M.

The origin of\nall these difficulties is the attempt to construct a phase space within a\nquantum theory that does not allow well-defined (i.e. simultaneous) values of\nthe position and momentum of an electron. In contrast, within the (de\nBroglie-Bohm) Bohmian theory of quantum mechanics, an electron has well-defined\nposition and momentum. Therefore, such theory provides a natural definition of\nthe phase space probability distribution and by construction, it is\npositive-defined and it exactly reproduces the charge and current densities.\nThe Bohmian distribution function has many potentialities for quantum problems,\nin general, and for quantum transport, in particular, that remains unexplored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 16:08:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 09:23:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Colom\u00e9s", "E.", ""], ["Zhan", "Z.", ""], ["Oriols", "X.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07840", "submitter": "Matteo G.

DPTs occur when the quantum\ndynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically\nconnected states, as a function of some external control parameter.

As proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n94, 173602 (2005)], by measuring the output-state entanglement for a balanced\nlossless beam splitter, one can quantify the input-state nonclassicality. These\nmeasures of nonclassicality (referred to as entanglement potentials) can be\nbased, in principle, on various entanglement measures, leading to the\nnegativity (NP) and concurrence (CP) potentials, and the potential for the\nrelative entropy of entanglement (REEP). We search for the maximal\nnonclassicality, which can be achieved by comparing two entanglement measures\nfor arbitrary two-qubit states and those which can be generated from a\nphoton-number qubit via a balanced lossless beam-splitter, where the qubit\nbasis states are the vacuum and single-photon states. Surprisingly, we find\nthat the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the REEP for a given value of the\nNP, can be increased (if NP<0.527) by using either a tunable beam splitter or\nby amplitude damping of the output state of the balanced beam splitter. We also\nshow that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the NP for a given value of\nthe REEP, can be increased by dephasing. The entanglement itself is not\nincreased by these local losses, but the possible ratios of different measures\nare affected. Moreover, we show that partially-mixed states can be more\nnonclassical than both pure states and completely-mixed states, by comparing\nthe NP for a given value of the REEP. This implies that not all entanglement\nmeasures can be used as entanglement potentials.

To demonstrate this\napplication, we use our formalism to solve a toy model for a fractional quantum\nspin Hall edge with different types of impurities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 18:07:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 20:02:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ganeshan", "Sriram", ""], ["Levin", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08969", "submitter": "Matthew Hastings", "authors": "D.

Such quantum state preparation\ncan be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to\nminimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem\nHamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum\nstates motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and\ndetermine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to\n12 sites (24 spin-orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz\nconverges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled\nclusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for\nquantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach\nto the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and\npotentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another\napplication of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to\nprepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state\npreparation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 18:23:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 18:30:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wecker", "D.", ""], ["Hastings", "M.

We show that the\ndegeneracy in the flat band is completely lifted due to the non-Hermitian\nperturbation in general, but it is partially maintained with the\nhalf-gain-half-loss perturbation and its ``V\" variant that we consider. With\nthese perturbations, we show that both randomly positioned states and pinned\nstates at the symmetry plane in the flat band can undergo thresholdless $\\cal\nPT$ breaking.

Using diffraction-limited\nlaser light, we guide the NV center's spin along loops on the Bloch sphere to\nenclose arbitrary Berry phase and characterize these trajectories through\ntime-resolved state tomography. We investigate the limits of this control due\nto loss of adiabiaticity and decoherence, as well as its robustness to noise\nintentionally introduced into the experimental control parameters, finding its\nresilience to be independent of the amount of Berry phase enclosed.
