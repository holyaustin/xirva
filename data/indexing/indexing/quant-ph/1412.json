More recently however, the total correlation or multipartite\ninformation measure has been helpful in accomplishing this goal, especially\nwith the multipartite symmetric quantum (MSQ) discord [Piani et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 100, 090502, 2008] and the conditional entanglement of multipartite\ninformation (CEMI) [Yang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140501, 2008]. Here we\napply a recent and significant improvement of strong subadditivity of quantum\nentropy [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] in order to develop these\nquantities further. In particular, we prove that the MSQ discord is nearly\nequal to zero if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated\nis approximately locally recoverable after performing measurements on each of\nits systems. Furthermore, we prove that the CEMI is a faithful entanglement\nmeasure, i.e., it vanishes if and only if the multipartite state for which it\nis evaluated is a fully separable state. Along the way we provide an\noperational interpretation of the MSQ discord in terms of the partial state\ndistribution protocol, which in turn, as a special case, gives an\ninterpretation for the original discord quantity. Finally, we prove an\ninequality that could potentially improve upon the Fawzi-Renner inequality in\nthe multipartite context, but it remains an open question to determine whether\nthis is so.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 02:43:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 15:31:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 17:19:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.0335", "submitter": "Nathan Poulin", "authors": "Nathan D.

Finally,we use the examples of the proof-of-concept\nSagnac speed meter currently under construction in Glasgow and a potential\nimplementation of a Sagnac speed meter in the Einstein Telescope (ET) to\nillustrate how our findings affect Sagnac speed meters with meter- and\nkilometre-long baselines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 14:28:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 17:06:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Danilishin", "S.

Our results show that many body effects enhance\nanti-ferromagnetic fluctuations but are not related to the formation of an\ninverted fourth bond. We identify two inverted bonds in the $\\text{C}_2$\nmolecule and establish their correspondence to the bonds in the $\\text{Be}_2$\nmolecule.

Is the quantum state a physical element of\nreality as originally interpreted by Schrodinger? Or is it an abstract\nmathematical object containing statistical information about the outcome of\nmeasurements as interpreted by Born? Although these questions sound\nphilosophical and pointless, they can be made precise in the framework of what\nwe call classical theories of quantum processes, which are a reword of quantum\nphenomena in the language of classical probability theory. In 2012, Pusey,\nBarrett and Rudolph (PBR) proved, under an assumption of preparation\nindependence, a theorem supporting the original interpretation of Schrodinger\nin the classical framework. Recently, we showed that these questions are\nrelated to a practical problem in quantum communication complexity, namely,\nquantifying the minimal amount of classical communication required in the\nclassical simulation of a two-party quantum communication process. In\nparticular, we argued that the statement of the PBR theorem can be proved if\nthe classical communication cost of simulating the communication of n qubits\ngrows more than exponentially in 'n'. Our argument is based on an assumption\nthat we call probability equipartition property. This property is somehow\nweaker than the preparation independence property used in the PBR theorem, as\nthe former can be justified by the latter and the asymptotic equipartition\nproperty of independent stochastic sources. The equipartition property is a\ngeneral and natural hypothesis that can be assumed even if the preparation\nindependence hypothesis is dropped.

It is found that the imaginary part\nof the saddle-point actions, as functions of scalar field deformation, are\ngenerally bounded in the bulk, but can diverge to -infty on the boundary. This\ncan probably be a source of the scalar field-related non-normalizability of the\nboundary Hartle-Hawking wave functions. For Kerr-dS_3 cosmology, some\nsaddle-point actions have imaginary parts diverging to -infty both in the bulk\nand on the boundary, when the boundary T^2 is stretched to infinitely long.\nThis can be an origin of non-normalizability of the boundary Hartle-Hawking\nwave functions related to temperature divergence. Finally the holographic\nrenormalization is extended to scalar-deformed dS_{d+1} (d>= 3) cosmologies for\nthe imaginary part of the saddle-point actions. The result is tested on a 5d\nexample, and saddle points leading to divergent contribution to the boundary\nHartle-Hawking wave function are shown to exist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 20:59:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 17:36:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Lihui", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.1821", "submitter": "Richard Forbes", "authors": "Richard G.

It also shows how the ISQ formula relates to the Gurney and Condon\n\"attempt frequency\" form for tunnelling rate-constants, and an ISQ formula is\ngiven for the motive energy in the related JWKB integral. The ISQ derivation\nuses a motive-energy transformation analogous to a transformation used by LL.\nThe need for this transformation in ESFI theory raises questions as to the\ncorrectness of theoretical treatments of field electron emission from\nnon-planar emitters, which do not make this transformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 23:28:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 10:21:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 19:49:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 10:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Forbes", "Richard G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.1863", "submitter": "Michael Hush", "authors": "Michael R.

To remove noise, we prepare a pair of ions in a\ndecoherence-free subspace, thereby rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common\nto both ions\\cite{Roos2006}.

Their\nfundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the\nmost challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete\nquantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge\nfields, and gravity (together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary\ntrinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. We then\nargue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework of\nunifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter\nentanglement and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's\narrow. The trinary fields are characterized by dual entanglement and dual\ndynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical predictions\nof the theory and allows us to give a quantum information definition of dark\nenergy. We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states\nand their physical consequences. One of them\\ is consistent with the\nvariational holographic relation and another results in an universal relation\nbetween entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume). This latter\nrelation allows us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical\nEinstein equation and implies that our Universe is not strictly holographic due\nto dark energy (related to an universal negative pressure). We predict the\ninterior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally\ninformation-complete.

In this\nprotocol, so-called \"stimulated-emission tomography\" (SET), a seed field is\ninjected along with the pump pulse, and the resulting stimulated emission is\nmeasured. Since the intensity of the stimulated field can be several orders of\nmagnitude larger than the intensity of the corresponding spontaneous emission,\nmeasurements can be made with simple classical detectors.

Owing to the mixing of\ndifferent partial wave channels, scattering with SOC is in general a coupled\nmultichannel problem. A systematic method is introduced to analytically solve a\nclass of coupled differential equations by recasting the coupled channel\nproblem as a simple eigenvalue problem. The exact Green's matrix in the\npresence of SOC is found, which readily gives the scattering solutions for any\ntwo identical particles in any total angular momentum subspace having\nnegligible center of mass momentum. Application of this formalism to two spin-1\nbosons shows the ubiquitous low energy threshold behavior for systems with\nisotropic SOC. A modified threshold behavior shows up, which does not occur for\nthe spin-orbit coupled spin-1/2 system.

For four\nqubits, we apply this novel method to experimental realizations of the\naforementioned states and prove genuine four-partite entanglement with two\nmeasurement settings only.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 15:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 21:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 14:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Knips", "Lukas", ""], ["Schwemmer", "Christian", ""], ["Klein", "Nico", ""], ["Wie\u015bniak", "Marcin", ""], ["Weinfurter", "Harald", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5882", "submitter": "Sudhakar Yarlagadda", "authors": "A.

Here, we study decay of excited-state\npopulation and decoherence in two models for HCBs, namely: an infinite-range\nHCB model governed by Markovian dynamics and a two-site HCB model with\nsite-dependent strong potentials and subject to non-Markovian dynamics. Both\nmodels are investigated in the regimes of antiadiabaticity and strong\nHCB-phonon coupling with each site providing a different local optical phonon\nenvironment; furthermore, the HCB systems in both models are taken to be\ninitially uncorrelated with the environment in the polaronic frame of\nreference. For the infinite-range model, we derive an effective many-body\nHamiltonian that commutes with the long-range system Hamiltonian and thus has\nthe same set of eigenstates; consequently, a quantum-master-equation approach\nshows that the quantum states of the system do not decohere. In the case of the\ntwo-site HCB model, we show clearly that the degree of decoherence and decay of\nexcited state are enhanced by the proximity of the site-energy difference to\nthe eigenenergy of phonons and are most pronounced when the site-energy\ndifference is at resonance with twice the polaronic energy; additionally, the\ndecoherence and the decay effects are reduced when the strength of HCB-phonon\ncoupling is increased.

Despite recent interest\nin the inequality, controversy remains regarding what would be shown by its\nviolation. Here we resolve this controversy, which arises due to an\ninsufficiently general and model-independent approach to the question so far.\nWe argue that LG's initial characterisation of MR does not pick out a\nparticularly natural realist position, so we articulate an operationally\nwell-defined and well-motivated position in its place.

We articulate three distinct species\nof MR-ist position, and argue that it is only the first of these which can be\nrefuted by LG inequality violation. This first position is an attractive one,\nso ruling it out remains of interest, however. A crucial role is played in LG's\nargument by the assumption of noninvasive measurability. We show that this\nnotion is ambiguous between the weaker notion of disturbance at the operational\nlevel, and the stronger notion of invasiveness at the ontic level of properties\nof the system. Ontic noninvasiveness would be required to rule out MR per se\nbut this property is not entailed by MR, and its presence cannot be established\nin a model-independent way.

Using these rotationally\ninvariant conditions it is established that every state of a LI mixed state\nensemble can be resolved to a pure state decomposition so that the\ncorresponding pure state ensemble (corresponding to pure states of all mixed\nstates together) has as its optimal POVM a pure state decomposition of the\noptimal POVM of mixed state ensemble.

The\nsecond is the fairly familiar inhomogeneous nonlinear complex Ginzburg--Landau\n(CGL) equation. The two-level model is exactly solvable for the nonlinear\nglobal mode and its stability, while for the spatially-extended CGL equation,\nperturbative solutions for the global mode and its stability are presented,\nvalid for inhomogeneities with arbitrary scales of spatial variation and global\nmodes of small amplitude, corresponding to a scenario near criticality. For\nother scenarios, a numerical iterative nonlinear eigenvalue technique is\npreferred. Two global modes of different amplitudes are revealed in the\nnumerical approach. For both the two-level system and the nonlinear CGL\nequation, the analytical calculations are supplemented with direct numerical\nsimulation, thus showing the fate of unstable global modes. For the two-level\nmodel this results in unbounded growth of the full nonlinear equations. For the\nspatially-extended CGL model in the subcritical regime, the global mode of\nlarger amplitude exhibits a `one-sided' instability leading to a chaotic\ndynamics, while the global mode of smaller amplitude is always unstable (theory\nconfirms this).

I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show\nthat SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to\nquantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any\nnonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this\nfact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the\npower of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are\nuniversal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically\nsimulable on a cycle. I also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction.\n  Free bosons give rise to a model known as BosonSampling. BosonSampling\nconsists of (i) preparing a Fock state of n photons, (ii) interfering these\nphotons in an m-mode linear interferometer, and (iii) measuring the output in\nthe Fock basis. Sampling approximately from the resulting distribution should\nbe classically hard, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Here I show that\nexact BosonSampling remains hard even if the linear-optical circuit has\nconstant depth. I also report several experiments where three-photon\ninterference was observed in integrated interferometers of various sizes,\nproviding some of the first implementations of BosonSampling in this regime.\nThe experiments also focus on the bosonic bunching behavior and on validation\nof BosonSampling devices.

This algorithm, and the accompanying software tool, advances\nstate-of-the-art in quantum CAD methodologies and methods while considering key\ncharacteristics and constraints of the ion-trap quantum circuit fabric.\nExperimental results show that the presented tool improves results of the\nprevious tool by about 41%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 00:03:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Dousti", "Mohammad Javad", ""], ["Pedram", "Massoud", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8004", "submitter": "Mohammad Javad Dousti", "authors": "Mohammad Javad Dousti, Alireza Shafaei, and Massoud Pedram", "title": "Squash: A Scalable Quantum Mapper Considering Ancilla Sharing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2591513.2591523", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum algorithms for solving problems of interesting size often result in\ncircuits with a very large number of qubits and quantum gates. Fortunately,\nthese algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used\nquantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such\nquantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the\ncorresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type\nof quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results\nin a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits\namong quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall\ncircuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the\nquantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum\nprocessor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to\nmapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable\nquantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum\ncircuit into a number of quantum kernels- each kernel comprises k parts such\nthat each part will run on exactly one of k available cores. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Squash can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while\nproviding an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 00:15:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Dousti", "Mohammad Javad", ""], ["Shafaei", "Alireza", ""], ["Pedram", "Massoud", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8032", "submitter": "Shihan Sajeed", "authors": "Shihan Sajeed, Igor Radchenko, Sarah Kaiser, Jean-Philippe Bourgoin,\n  Anna Pappa, Laurent Monat, Matthieu Legre, Vadim Makarov", "title": "Attacks exploiting deviation of mean photon number in quantum key\n  distribution and coin tossing", "comments": "15 pages, 13 figures, Improved Introduction and Conclusion, Published\n  in Physical Review A, Accepted at QCrypt 2014, 4th international conference\n  on quantum cryptography, September 1-5, 2014 in Paris, France\n  http://2014.qcrypt.net/program/", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This\napproach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how\nthe ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's\nquestions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how\nentanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally,\nhow the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The\nrules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying\nO's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two\nsolutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball\nand disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with\ntheir symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily\nmany qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an\nadditional rule eliminates the rebit case. This approach is inspired by (but\ndoes not rely on) the relational interpretation and yields a novel formulation\nof quantum theory in terms of questions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 12:46:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 20:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 12:17:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 16:52:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 17:54:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 15:35:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 18:53:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:39:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:28:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hoehn", "Philipp A", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8325", "submitter": "Yu Guo", "authors": "Yu Guo", "title": "Non-commutativity measure of quantum discord", "comments": "9 pages, 3 figures.

Our explanation is based on an analogy of\nquantum wave-particle duality with bouncing droplets in an oscillating medium,\nthe latter being identified as the vacuum's zero-point field. A hydrodynamic\nanalogy of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et\nal., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the\ngoverning equations related to the force on the particle are evidently\ndifferent for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively.\nHowever, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said\nanalogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in\nour model. If the latter are taken into account, one can show that the forces\non the particles are identical in both the dBB and our model. In particular,\nthis identity results from an exact matching of our emergent velocity field\nwith the Bohmian \"guiding equation\". One thus arrives at an explanation\ninvolving a deeper, i.e. subquantum, level of the dBB version of quantum\nmechanics. We show in particular how the classically-local approach of the\nusual hydrodynamical modeling can be overcome and how, as a consequence, the\nconfiguration-space version of dBB theory for $N$ particles can be completely\nsubstituted by a \"superclassical\" emergent dynamics of $N$ particles in real\n3-dimensional space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 14:18:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Groessing", "Gerhard", ""], ["Fussy", "Siegfried", ""], ["Pascasio", "Johannes Mesa", ""], ["Schwabl", "Herbert", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8374", "submitter": "Changhyoup Lee", "authors": "Changhyoup Lee, Changsuk Noh, Nikolaos Schetakis, and Dimitris G.\n  Angelakis", "title": "Few-photon transport in many-body photonic systems: A scattering\n  approach", "comments": "15 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

A first\nstep involves dualising a criterion for the reality of the wavefunction\nproposed by Harrigan & Spekkens, which was central to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph\ntheorem. The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the\navoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.\nBy considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable\nproperties of any ontological physical theory a new characterisation of\nnon-locality and contextuality is found. Secondly, a careful analysis of\npreparation independence, one of the key assumptions of the PBR theorem, leads\nto a precise analogy with the kind of locality prohibited by Bell's theorem.\nMotivated by this, we propose a weakening of the assumption to something\nanalogous to no-signalling. This amounts to allowing global or non-local\ncorrelations in the joint ontic state, which nevertheless do not allow for\nsuperluminal signalling. This is, at least, consistent with the Bell and\nKochen-Specker theorems.

At present, the best upper bound known for the power of quantum\ncomputation is that BQP is in AWPP. This work investigates limits on\ncomputational power that are imposed by physical principles. To this end, we\ndefine a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined\ntheories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of\nphysical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that\ngiven only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite\nstates can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are\ncontained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic\nnotion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for\noutcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we\nextend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement\noutcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is\nequal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion\nin PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories. Thus in a\nworld with post-selection, quantum theory is optimal for computation in the\nspace of all general theories. We then consider if relativised complexity\nresults can be obtained for general theories. It is not clear how to define a\nsensible notion of an oracle in the general framework that reduces to the\nstandard notion in the quantum case.

Specifically, in a coupling configuration between\nN_{\\mathrm{A}}$ acceptors and $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ donors, the theory correctly\npredicts an enhancement of the energy transfer rate dependent on the total\nnumber of donor-acceptor pairs. As an example, the theory, applied to the\ntransfer rate in LH~II, gives results in excellent agreement with experiment.\nFinally, it is explicitly shown that as long as linear response theory holds,\nthe classical multichromophoric theory formally coincides with the quantum\nformulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 19:44:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 18:44:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Duque", "Sebastian", ""], ["Brumer", "Paul", ""], ["Pachon", "Leonardo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8745", "submitter": "Wieslaw Laskowski", "authors": "Wieslaw Laskowski, Tamas Vertesi, Marcin Wiesniak", "title": "Highly noise resistant multipartite quantum correlations", "comments": "12 pages, journal version", "journal-ref": "J.

Here, we formally define and give schemes for quantum\nhomomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such\nthat quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our\nschemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for\ncircuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion\nof the circuit (we use the \"$\\pi/8$\" non-Clifford group gate, which is also\nknown as the $T$-gate).\n  More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a\ndecryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of\n$T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with\nthe total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of\nlength given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate\ndepth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant\n$T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption\nscheme.\n  A further contribution of ours is to formally define the security of\nencryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability\nunder chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In\nthis context, we show the equivalence of several definitions.\n  Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern\ncryptographic definitions, and can be seen as a quantum analogue of classical\nresults establishing homomorphic encryption for circuits with a limited number\nof multiplication gates.
