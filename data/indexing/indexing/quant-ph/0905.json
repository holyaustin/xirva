This approach can serve as a basis\nfor efficient numerical calculations, or can be combined with analytically\ntractable approximations of the phase matching function. We introduce here a\ncosine-gaussian approximation of the phase matching function which works for a\nbroader range of parameters than the gaussian model used previously.

Many different and incompatible attempts to define\na coherent Everettian quantum theory have been made over the past fifty years.\nHowever, no known version of the theory (unadorned by extra ad hoc postulates)\ncan account for the appearance of probabilities and explain why the theory it\nwas meant to replace, Copenhagen quantum theory, appears to be confirmed, or\nmore generally why our evolutionary history appears to be Born-rule typical.\nThis article reviews some ingenious and interesting recent attempts in this\ndirection by Wallace, Greaves, Myrvold and others, and explains why they don't\nwork. An account of one-world randomness, which appears scientifically\nsatisfactory, and has no many-worlds analogue, is proposed. A fundamental\nobstacle to confirming many-worlds theories is illustrated by considering some\ntoy many-worlds models. These models show that branch weights can exist without\nhaving any role in either rational decision-making or theory confirmation, and\nalso that the latter two roles are logically separate. Wallace's proposed\ndecision theoretic axioms for rational agents in a multiverse and claimed\nderivation of the Born rule are examined. It is argued that Wallace's strategy\nof axiomatizing a mathematically precise decision theory within a fuzzy\nEverettian quasiclassical ontology is incoherent. Moreover, Wallace's axioms\nare not constitutive of rationality either in Everettian quantum theory or in\ntheories in which branchings and branch weights are precisely defined.

Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density\nmatrix $\\rho_{\\rm i}$ into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation\nvalue of the observable $\\Theta$. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for\nthe relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of\nthe optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the\nsystem $N$, the initial state $\\rho_{\\rm i}$, and the target observable\n$\\Theta$. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in $\\rho_{\\rm\ni}$ remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant\ndependence on $N$. If $\\rho_{\\rm i}$ has no zero eigenvalues, then the\ncomputational complexity and the required search effort rise with $N$. The\ndimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes\nthe objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search\nefficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control\nmodelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value\nof the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps.

In this\nwork we examine the properties of spin 1 Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) and\nlook for the physical meaning of the corresponding operators. We show that if\nthe computational basis is chosen to be the eigenbasis of the spin projection\noperator onto some direction z, the states of the other MUBs have to be\nsqueezed. Then, we introduce the analogs of momentum and position operators and\ninterpret what information about the spin vector the observer gains while\nmeasuring them. Finally, we study the generation and the measurement of MUBs\nstates by introducing the Fourier like transform through spin squeezing. The\nhigher spin numbers are also considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 May 2009 21:41:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kurzynski", "Pawel", ""], ["Kaszub", "Wawrzyniec", ""], ["Czechlewski", "Mikolaj", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.1743", "submitter": "W.

We show that a possible\nresolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if\ninstead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be\nfamilies of projections indexed by a partially ordered set C(A) of appropriate\ncommutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and\nease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart\nC*-algebra and that C(A) consists of all unital commutative Rickart\nC*-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a\nnatural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic:\ndistributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle.\n  Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n-by-n matrices, we\nprove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the\ninternal Gelfand spectrum (in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey) of the\n\"Bohrification\" of A, which is a commutative Rickart C*-algebra in the topos of\nfunctors from C(A) to the category of sets.

For\nexample, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not\nallow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be\nstronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be\ntransmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do\nnot single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share\nsuch traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum\ncorrelations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It\nstates that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown\nto him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be\ncorrelated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is\nbounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if\nAlice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains\nto her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to\nthe standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is\nrespected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all\nthe no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum\ncorrelations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob\naccess to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit\nis sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the\nvalue of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them).

By\nmeasuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system\nperforms the desired logical operations.\n  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary\nand stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to\nstandardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the\nbeginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used\nfor ADQC.

For the Kerr\nsystem we derive exact solutions of the Moyal equations for a complete set of\nobservables formed from the photon creation and annihilation operators. These\nMoyal solutions incorporate the asymptotics of the classical limit in a simple\nexplicit form. An unusual feature of these solutions is that they exhibit\nperiodic singularities in the time variable.
