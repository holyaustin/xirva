Using the X-cube model as our motivating example, we give a\nconjecture, with partial proof, of the conditions for a boundary to be gapped.\nIn order to state our conjecture, we use a precise definition of fracton\nbraiding and show that bulk braiding of fractons has several features that make\nit \\textit{insufficient} to classify gapped boundaries. Most notable among\nthese is that bulk braiding is sensitive to geometry and is \"nonreciprocal,\"\nthat is, braiding an excitation $a$ around $b$ need not yield the same phase as\nbraiding $b$ around $a$. Instead, we define fractonic \"boundary braiding,\"\nwhich resolves these difficulties in the presence of a boundary. We then\nconjecture that a boundary of an Abelian fracton system is gapped if and only\nif a \"boundary Lagrangian subgroup\" of excitations is condensed at the\nboundary, this is a generalization of the condition for a gapped boundary in\ntwo spatial dimensions, but it relies on boundary braiding instead of bulk\nbraiding.

We show how one can optimize the tracking of errors in repeated noisy\nerror correction for the GKP code. We do this by examining the\nmaximum-likelihood problem for this setting and its mapping onto a 1D Euclidean\npath-integral modeling a particle in a random cosine potential. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of a minimum-energy decoding strategy as a proxy for the path\nintegral evaluation. In the second part of this paper, we analyze and\nnumerically assess the concatenation of the GKP code with the toric code. When\ntoric code measurements and GKP error correction measurements are perfect, we\nfind that by using GKP error information the toric code threshold improves from\n$10\\%$ to $14\\%$. When only the GKP error correction measurements are perfect\nwe observe a threshold at $6\\%$. In the more realistic setting when all error\ninformation is noisy, we show how to represent the maximum likelihood decoding\nproblem for the toric-GKP code as a 3D compact QED model in the presence of a\nquenched random gauge field, an extension of the random-plaquette gauge model\nfor the toric code. We present a new decoder for this problem which shows the\nexistence of a noise threshold at shift-error standard deviation $\\sigma_0\n\\approx 0.243$ for toric code measurements, data errors and GKP ancilla errors.\nIf the errors only come from having imperfect GKP states, this corresponds to\nstates with just 4 photons or more. Our last result is a no-go result for\nlinear oscillator codes, encoding oscillators into oscillators.

Specifically, we explore a\ndriven Bose-Einstein condensate in three distinct dynamical regimes - Rabi\noscillations, chaos, and self-trapping regime, and for each of them we\ncalculate the correlation dimension. For the ground state of the ratchet formed\nby a system of field-free non-interacting particles, we find four distinct\npockets of chaotic dynamics throughout these regimes. We show that a\nmeasurement of a local density in each of the dynamical regimes, has an\nattractor characterized with a higher fractal dimension, $D_{R}=2.59\\pm0.01$,\n$D_{C}=3.93\\pm0.04$, and $D_{S}=3.05\\pm0.05$, as compared to the global measure\nof current, $D_{R}=2.07\\pm0.02$, $D_{C}=2.96\\pm0.05$, and $D_{S}=2.30\\pm0.02$.\nWe find that the many-body case converges to mean-field limit with strong\nsub-unity power laws in particle number $N$, namely $N^{\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha_{R}={0.28\\pm0.01}$, $\\alpha_{C}={0.34\\pm0.067}$ and\n$\\alpha_{S}={0.90\\pm0.24}$ for each of the dynamical regimes mentioned above.\nThe deviation between local and global measurement of the attractor's dimension\ncorresponds to an increase towards high condensate depletion which remains\nconstant for long time scales in both Rabi and chaotic regimes.

To combat this,\nwe introduce a simple technique for suppressing systematic coherent errors in\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) stabilizer codes, which we call stabilizer\nslicing. The essential idea is to slice low-weight stabilizers into two\nequally-weighted Pauli operators and then apply them by rotating in opposite\ndirections, causing their overrotations to interfere destructively on the\nlogical subspace.\n  With access to native gates generated by 3-body Hamiltonians, we can\ncompletely eliminate purely coherent overrotation errors, and for overrotation\nnoise of 0.99 unitarity we achieve a 135-fold improvement in the logical error\nrate of Surface-17.

In this paper we\nfirst propose a QHE scheme for a type of circuits of polynomial depth, based on\nthe rebit quantum computation formalism. The scheme keeps the restricted type\nof data perfectly secure. We then propose a QHE scheme for a larger class of\npolynomial-depth quantum circuits, which has partial data privacy. Both schemes\nhave good circuit privacy. We also propose an interactive QHE scheme with\nasymptotic data privacy, however, the circuit privacy is not good, in the sense\nthat the party who provides the data could cheat and learn about the circuit.\nWe show that such cheating would generally affect the correctness of the\nevaluation or cause deviation from the protocol.

In this tutorial article, we present a\nthorough study of phase matching in $\\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystals for\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion and thereby also investigate the\ngeneration of entangled photons in such crystals. First, we present a\ntheoretical derivation of two-photon wavefunction produced by SPDC in the\nfrequency and transverse momentum bases. We then discuss in detail the effects\ndue to various crystal and pump parameters including the length of the crystal,\nthe angle between the optic axis and the pump propagation direction, the pump\nincidence angle on the crystal surface, the refraction at the crystal surfaces,\nand the pump propagation direction inside the crystal. These effects are\nextremely relevant in experimental situations. We then present our numerical\nand experimental results in order to illustrate how various experimental\nparameters affect the phase matching and thus the generation of entangled\nphotons. Finally, using the two-photon wavefunction in the transverse\nwave-vector basis, we show how to derive the two-photon wavefunction in the OAM\nbasis and thereby calculate the two-photon angular Schmidt spectrum.

A quantum analogue of the IBM has recently been defined, and an\nattempt at providing an operational interpretation of the so-called quantum IB\nfunction as an optimal rate of an information-theoretic task, has recently been\nmade by Salek et al. However, the interpretation given in that paper has a\ncouple of drawbacks; firstly its proof is based on a conjecture that the\nquantum IB function is convex, and secondly, the expression for the rate\nfunction involves certain entropic quantities which occur explicitly in the\nvery definition of the underlying information-theoretic task, thus making the\nlatter somewhat contrived. We overcome both of these drawbacks by first proving\nthe convexity of the quantum IB function, and then giving an alternative\noperational interpretation of it as the optimal rate of a bona fide\ninformation-theoretic task, namely that of quantum source coding with quantum\nside information at the decoder, and relate the quantum IB function to the rate\nregion of this task. We similarly show that the related privacy funnel function\nis convex (both in the classical and quantum case). However, we comment that it\nis unlikely that the quantum privacy funnel function can characterize the\noptimal asymptotic rate of an information theoretic task, since even its\nclassical version lacks a certain additivity property which turns out to be\nessential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2018 18:13:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:43:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2019 16:12:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Datta", "Nilanjana", ""], ["Hirche", "Christoph", ""], ["Winter", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.03651", "submitter": "Jan Czajkowski", "authors": "Jan Czajkowski, Krzysztof Paw{\\l}owski, and Rafa{\\l}\n  Demkowicz-Dobrza\\'nski", "title": "Many-body effects in quantum metrology", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "2019 New J.

A naturally\narising question is how to describe time evolution relative to quantum clocks\nand, specifically, how the dynamics relative to different quantum clocks are\nrelated. This is a pressing issue in view of the multiple choice problem of\ntime in quantum gravity, which posits that there is no distinguished choice of\ninternal clock in generic general relativistic systems and that different\nchoices lead to inequivalent quantum theories. Exploiting a recent approach to\nswitching quantum reference systems (arXiv:1809.00556, arXiv:1809:05093), we\nexhibit a systematic method for switching between different clock choices in\nthe quantum theory. We illustrate it by means of the parametrized particle,\nwhich, like gravity, features a Hamiltonian constraint. We explicitly switch\nbetween the quantum evolution relative to the non-relativistic time variable\nand that relative to the particle's position, which requires carefully\nregularizing the zero-modes in the so-called time-of-arrival observable. While\nthis toy model is simple, our approach is general and directly amenable to\nquantum cosmology. It proceeds by systematically linking the reduced quantum\ntheories relative to different clock choices via the clock-choice-neutral Dirac\nquantized theory, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. This method\nsuggests a new perspective on the multiple choice problem, indicating that it\nis rather a multiple choice feature of a complete relational quantum theory,\ntaken as the conjunction of Dirac quantized and quantum deparametrized\ntheories. Precisely this conjunction permits one to consistently switch between\ndifferent temporal reference systems which is a prerequisite for a quantum\nnotion of general covariance. Finally, we show that quantum uncertainties lead\nto discontinuity in the relational dynamics when switching clocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 17:48:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:23:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2021 15:43:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hoehn", "Philipp A", ""], ["Vanrietvelde", "Augustin", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.04157", "submitter": "Siddhardh Morampudi", "authors": "Siddhardh C.

In\nparticular, we compare a power-driven three-level continuous quantum\nrefrigerator with a four-level combined cycle, partly driven by power and\npartly by heat. We focus on the weak driving regime and find the four-level\nmodel to be superior since it can operate in parameter regimes in which the\nthree-level model cannot, it may exhibit a larger cooling rate, and,\nsimultaneously, a better coefficient of performance. Furthermore, we find that\nthe improvement in the cooling rate matches the increase in the stationary\nquantum coherences exactly. Crucially, though, we also show that the\nthermodynamic variables for both models follow from a classical representation\nbased on graph theory. This implies that we can build incoherent\nstochastic-thermodynamic models with the same steady-state operation or,\nequivalently, that both coherent refrigerators can be emulated classically.\nMore generally, we prove this for any N-level weakly driven device with a\n`cyclic' pattern of transitions.

(Science 2018), who\nintroduced a relational problem that can be solved by a constant-depth quantum\ncircuit, but provably cannot be solved by any classical circuit of\nsub-logarithmic depth. We develop the discovery of Bravyi et al. into a\nframework for robust randomness expansion. Our proposal does not rest on any\ncomplexity-theoretic conjectures, but relies on the physical assumption that\nthe adversarial device being tested implements a circuit of sub-logarithmic\ndepth. Success on our task can be easily verified in classical linear time.\nFinally, our task is more noise-tolerant than most other existing proposals\nthat can only tolerate multiplicative error, or require additional conjectures\nfrom complexity theory; in contrast, we are able to allow a small constant\nadditive error in total variation distance between the sampled and ideal\ndistributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 20:18:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 15:55:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Coudron", "Matthew", ""], ["Stark", "Jalex", ""], ["Vidick", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.04258", "submitter": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Holweck", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Holweck", "title": "Geometric constructions over $\\mathbb{C}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_2$ for Quantum\n  Information", "comments": "32 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables.

Only system $A$ is accessible through time\ndependent controls, while system B is not accessible. The objective is to find\ncontrols that implement a desired unitary transformation on $A$, regardless of\nthe evolution on $B$, at a sufficiently large final time. The freedom in the\nevolution on $B$ is used to define an \\emph{extended control landscape} on\nwhich the critical points are investigated in terms of kinematic and dynamic\ngradients. A spectral decomposition of the corresponding extended unitary\nsystem simplifies the landscape analysis which provides: (i) a sufficient\ncondition on the rank of the dynamic gradient of the extended landscape that\nguarantees a trap free search for the final time unitary matrix of system $A$,\nand (ii) a detailed decomposition of the components of the overall dynamic\ngradient matrix. Consequently, if the rank condition is satisfied, a gradient\nalgorithm will find the controls that implements the target unitary on system\n$A$. It is shown that even if the dynamic gradient with respect to the controls\nalone is not full rank, the additional flexibility due to the parameters that\ndefine the extended landscape still can allow for the rank condition of the\nextended landscape to hold. Moreover, satisfaction of the latter rank condition\nsubsumes any assumptions about controllability, reachability and control\nresources.

We believe\nthat our model puts quantum computing into a wider context and inspires the\nhope to build a soft quantum computer much earlier than the standard one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:51:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Zeng-Bing", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.05039", "submitter": "Danko Georgiev", "authors": "Danko Georgiev, Eliahu Cohen", "title": "Analysis of single-particle nonlocality through the prism of weak\n  measurements", "comments": "30 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Quantum Information 2020; 18(1): 1941024", "doi": "10.1142/S0219749919410247", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although regarded today as an important resource in quantum information,\nnonlocality has yielded over the years many conceptual conundrums. Among the\nlatter are nonlocal aspects of single particles which have been of major\ninterest. In this paper, the nonlocality of single quanta is studied in a\nsquare nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spatially separated detectors\nusing a delayed choice modification of quantum measurement outcomes that depend\non the complex-valued weak values. We show that if spacelike separated Bob and\nAlice are allowed to freely control their quantum devices, the geometry of the\nsetup constrains the local hidden variables models. In particular, hidden\nsignaling and a list of contextual instructions are required to split a quantum\nstate characterized by a positive Wigner function into two quantum states with\nnon-positive Wigner functions. This implies that local hidden variables models\ncould rely neither on only two hidden variables for position and momentum, nor\non simultaneous factorizability of both the hidden probability densities and\nweights of splitting to reproduce the correct quantum distributions. While our\nanalysis does not fully exclude the existence of nonfactorizable local hidden\nvariables models, it demonstrates that the recently proposed weak values of\nquantum histories necessitate contextual splitting of prior commitments to\nmeasurement outcomes, due to functional dependence on the total Feynman sum\nthat yields the complex-valued quantum probability amplitude for the studied\nquantum transition. This analysis also highlights the quantum nature of weak\nmeasurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:13:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 19:05:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:06:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2020 06:45:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Georgiev", "Danko", ""], ["Cohen", "Eliahu", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.05076", "submitter": "Oliver Morsch", "authors": "O.

Light-pulse atom\ninterferometry with elements employed in optical atomic clocks is a promising\ncandidate for that purpose, but suffers from major challenges including its\ninsensitivity to the gravitational redshift in a uniform field. All these\ndifficulties can be overcome with a novel scheme presented here which is based\non initializing the clock when the spatially separate superposition has already\nbeen generated and performing a doubly differential measurement where the\ndifferential phase shift between the two internal states is compared for\ndifferent initialization times. This can be exploited to test the universality\nof the gravitational redshift with delocalized coherent superpositions of\nquantum clocks and it is argued that its experimental implementation should be\nfeasible with a new generation of 10-meter atomic fountains that will soon\nbecome available. Interestingly, the approach also offers significant\nadvantages for more compact set-ups based on guided interferometry or hybrid\nconfigurations. Furthermore, in order to provide a solid foundation for the\nanalysis of the various interferometry schemes and the effects that can be\nmeasured with them, a general formalism for a relativistic description of atom\ninterferometry in curved spacetime is developed.

It also shed new light in the observed competing weak localization\nand antilocalization in spin-dependent quantum transport measurements. In\nparticular, a novel mechanism of localization and delocalization, as well as\nthe new mechanism leading to the onset of superconductivity in bilayer systems\nseems to emerge naturally from torque entanglements in nonequilibrium quantum\ntransport equations of spin and pseudospins. Moreover, the general results may\nserve as a foundation for engineering approximations of the quantum transport\nsimulations of spintronic devices based on graphene and other 2-D materials\nsuch as the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), as well as based on\ntopological materials exhibiting quantum spin Hall effects.

Topological quantum phases, originally discovered and\ninvestigated in condensed matter physics, have recently been explored in a\nrange of different systems, which produced both fascinating physics findings\nand exciting opportunities for applications. Among the physical systems that\nhave been considered to realize and probe these intriguing phases, ultracold\natoms become promising platforms due to their high flexibility and\ncontrollability. Quantum simulation of topological phases with cold atomic\ngases is a rapidly evolving field, and recent theoretical and experimental\ndevelopments reveal that some toy models originally proposed in condensed\nmatter physics have been realized with this artificial quantum system. The\npurpose of this article is to introduce these developments. The article begins\nwith a tutorial review of topological invariants and the methods to control\nparameters in the Hamiltonians of neutral atoms. Next, topological quantum\nphases in optical lattices are introduced in some detail, especially several\ncelebrated models, such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the\nHofstadter-Harper model, the Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model. The\ntheoretical proposals and experimental implementations of these models are\ndiscussed. Notably, many of these models cannot be directly realized in\nconventional solid-state experiments.

One such design consists of vertically\nstacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM) and using the\nspin-mixing properties of \"molecule-like\" coupled hole states for all-optical\nqubit manipulation. In this article, the first of two papers, we introduce the\nincorporation of dilute GaBiAs alloys in the barrier region between the two\ndots. GaBiAs is expected to increase the spin-mixing of the molecular states\nneeded for qubit operations by raising the barrier valence band edge and\nspin-orbit splitting. Using an atomistic tight-binding model, we compute the\nproperties of GaBiAs and the modification of hole states that arise when the\nalloy is used in the barrier of an InAs QDM. An atomistic treatment is\nnecessary to correctly capture non-traditional alloy effects such as the\nband-anticrossing valence band. It also allows for the study of configurational\nvariances and clustering effects of the alloy. We find that in InAs QDMs with a\nGaBiAs interdot barrier, electron states are not strongly affected by the\ninclusion of Bi. However, hole states are much more sensitive to the presence\nand configuration of Bi in the barriers. By independently studying the\nalloy-induced strain and electronic scattering off Bi and As orbitals, we\nconclude that an initial increase in QDM hole state energy at low Bi\nconcentration is caused by the alloy-induced strain. We further find that the\ndecrease in QDM hole energy at higher Bi concentrations can only be explained\nwhen both alloy strain and orbital effects are considered. In our second\narticle, we use the understanding developed here to discuss how the alloyed\nbarriers contribute to enhancement in hole spin-mixing and the implications for\nQDM qubit architectures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:10:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:28:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Arthur", ""], ["Doty", "Matthew F.", ""], ["Bryant", "Garnett W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.09484", "submitter": "Niklas Rohling", "authors": "Violeta N.

We also show the possibility to coherently control\nthe molecular internal state by using Raman-assisted transfer to swap the\nnuclear spin of one of the atoms forming the molecule, thus demonstrating a\npowerful manipulation and detection tool of these molecular bound states.\nFinally, by exploiting this peculiar detection technique we provide first\ninformation on the lifetime of the molecular states in a many-body setting,\npaving the way towards future investigations of strongly interacting Fermi\ngases in a still unexplored regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:22:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cappellini", "G.", ""], ["Livi", "L.

A long-standing open question is, whether there\nare quantum analogues of unconstrained non-Shannon type inequalities. Here, a\nnew constrained non-von-Neumann type inequality is proven, a step towards a\nconjectured unconstrained inequality by Linden and Winter. *IID quantum state\nmerging can be optimally achieved using the decoupling technique. The one-shot\nresults by Berta et al. and Anshu at al., however, had to bring in additional\nmathematical machinery. We introduce a natural generalized decoupling paradigm,\ncatalytic decoupling, that can reproduce the aforementioned results when used\nanalogously to the application of standard decoupling in the asymptotic case.\n*Port based teleportation, a variant of standard quantum teleportation\nprotocol, cannot be implemented perfectly. We prove several lower bounds on the\nnecessary number of output ports N to achieve port based teleportation for\ngiven error and input dimension, showing that N diverges uniformly in the\ndimension of the teleported quantum system, for vanishing error. As a\nbyproduct, a new lower bound for the size of the program register for an\napproximate universal programmable quantum processor is derived. *In the last\npart, we give a new definition for information-theoretic quantum\nnon-malleability, strengthening the previous definition by Ambainis et al. We\nshow that quantum non-malleability implies secrecy, analogous to quantum\nauthentication.

Furthermore, they play a role in quantum thermodynamics. In this\nthesis the set of quantum entropies of multipartite quantum systems is studied.\nThe problem of its characterization is not new -- however, progress has been\nsparse, indicating that the problem might be hard and that new methods might be\nneeded.

It is known that the von Neumann entropy\nregion -- just like its classical counterpart -- forms a convex cone. I\ndescribe the symmetries of this cone and highlight geometric similarities and\ndifferences to the classical entropy cone.\n  In a different approach, I utilize the local geometric properties of extremal\nrays of a cone. I show that quantum states whose entropy lies on such an\nextremal ray of the quantum entropy cone have a very simple structure.\n  As the set of all quantum states is very complicated, I look at a simple\nsubset called stabilizer states.

However, it has proved\ndifficult to reconcile these assertions with the fact that identical particles\nare routinely assumed to be reidentifiable in particular circumstances.\n  Moreover, neither of these assertions accounts for the mathematical form of\nthe symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the\nquantum framework, leaving open theoretical possibilities other than bosonic\nand fermionic behavior, such as paraparticles, which do not appear to be\nrealized in nature. Here we propose the novel idea that both persistence and\nnonpersistence models must be employed in order to fully account for the\nbehaviour of identical particles. Thus, identical particles are neither\npersistent nor nonpersistent. We prove the viability of this viewpoint by\nshowing how Feynman's and Dirac's symmetrization procedures arise through a\nsynthesis of a quantum treatment of these models, and by showing how\nreidentifiability emerges in a context-dependent manner. We further show that\nthe persistence and nonpersistence models satisfy the key characteristics of\nBohr's concept of complementarity, and thereby propose that the behavior of\nidentical particles is a manifestation of a persistence-nonpersistence\ncomplementarity, analogous to Bohr's wave-particle complementarity for\nindividual particles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2018 12:51:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Goyal", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.13286", "submitter": "Sylvain de L\\'es\\'eleuc", "authors": "Sylvain de L\\'es\\'eleuc, Vincent Lienhard, Pascal Scholl, Daniel\n  Barredo, Sebastian Weber, Nicolai Lang, Hans Peter B\\\"uchler, Thierry Lahaye\n  and Antoine Browaeys", "title": "Experimental realization of a symmetry protected topological phase of\n  interacting bosons with Rydberg atoms", "comments": "20 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "Science 365, 775 (2019)", "doi": "10.1126/science.aav9105", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The concept of topological phases is a powerful framework to characterize\nground states of quantum many-body systems that goes beyond the paradigm of\nsymmetry breaking.
