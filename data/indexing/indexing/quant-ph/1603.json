The two main pre-detection\nfactors affecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing\nparameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental\nresults on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon\nmodes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton coupling\nefficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We\nattribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of\ndown-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the\nellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam.\nWe also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry\nwith the pump focusing parameter.

The peripheral rings display coherent features: their\neigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant\nstates. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of\ndisorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,\nwhile the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site\ndisorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,\ncreating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal\ntransfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder\nstrength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level\nsystem. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial\ncondition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an\nexcitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of\nthe order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the\ninitial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the\nsuperradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the\nsuperradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC\nenergy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an\noptimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the\nsuperradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap.

However, so far, most of the attention has been on\nmoving nodes; little is known about the possibility of chaos in the case of\nstationary nodes. We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.\nThat is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial\nvariations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.\nAnother aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which\nquantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent. We investigate possible correlations with quantities such as the\nparticipation ratio and different measures of entanglement, for different\nsystems and different families of stationary wave functions. We find that these\nquantities often tend to correlate to the amount of chaos.

After calculating\nsingle-electron Green functions, the two-electron space-spin density matrix,\nwhich has X-state form, is obtained. The dependence of quantum correlation to\nthe relative distance of electrons spins of Cooper pair and energy gap is\ninvestigated. One of the results is, for d-wave case, concurrence (as a measure\nof entanglement), quantum discord and tripartite are sensitive to the change of\nmagnitude of gap. Another result is both concurrence and discord oscillate.\nThen, we consider three-dimensional rectangular nano-superconducting grain in\nthe weak coupling frame. The nano-size effect is entered via gap fluctuation.\nThe dependence of quantum correlation to length of superconductor and lower\nbound of robustness of tripartite entanglement are determined. Moreover, we\nshow that quantum correlation of d-wave nano-size superconducting grain\nstrongly depends on length of grain (in contrast to s-wave case). In general,\nit is found that the length of grain lower, the effect of nano-size on quantum\ncorrelation higher. Quantum tripartite for nano-scale d-wave superconductor is\nbetter than for bulk d-wave superconductor. However, we find out both bulk and\nnano-size s-wave superconductors have the same tripartite. Furthermore,\nentanglement length and quantum correlation length are investigated and it is\nshown that there is a length of superconductor in which discord becomes zero.\nAlso, for a given fixed length of superconductor, both a peak in discord and a\npeak in concurrence occur simultaneously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 22:12:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Afzali", "Reza", ""], ["Ebrahimian", "Neda", ""], ["Eghbalifar", "Bashir", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.01701", "submitter": "Ying-Dan Wang", "authors": "Ying-Dan Wang, Xiao-Bo Yan, Stefano Chesi", "title": "Optimization of STIRAP-based state transfer under dissipation", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/aa7f5d", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using a perturbative treatment, we quantify the influence of non-adiabatic\nleakage and system dissipation on the transfer fidelity of a stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) process.

By assuming Einstein's Equivalence Principle to be\nvalid, we demonstrate, first in a Lorentz frame with accelerating detectors,\nand then directly in the Lab frame with uniform gravity, that the dephasing\nbetween the different internal states arise not from gravity but rather from\ndifferences in their rest mass, and the mass dependence of the de Broglie\nwave's dispersion relation. We provide an alternative view to the situation\nconsidered by Ref. [1], where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role in\nthe loss of fringe visibility by giving the detector a transverse velocity\nrelative to the particle beam; visibility can be easily recovered by giving the\nscreen an appropriate uniform velocity.

In that scheme, one bit of information\nis phase encoded in the prepared state in a $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space in\nthe form $(|i\\rangle\\pm|j\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ with $n\\ge 2$. For each qudit\nprepared and measured in the same two-dimensional Hilbert subspace, one bit of\nraw secret key is obtained in the absence of transmission error. Here we show\nthat by modifying the basis announcement procedure, the same experimental setup\ncan generate $n$ bits of raw key for each qudit prepared and measured in the\nsame basis in the noiseless situation. The reason is that in addition to the\nphase information, each qudit also carries information on the Hilbert subspace\nused. The additional $(n-1)$ bits of raw key comes from a clever utilization of\nthis extra piece of information. We prove the unconditional security of this\nmodified protocol and compare its performance with other existing provably\nsecure qubit- and qudit-based protocols on market in the one-way classical\ncommunication setting. Interestingly, we find that for the case of $n=2$, the\nsecret key rate of this modified protocol using non-degenerate random quantum\ncode to perform one-way entanglement distillation is equal to that of the\nsix-state scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 03:31:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 03:30:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chau", "H.

To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical\nmodels, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak\nabout, e.g., \"quantum cognition\"). These novel applications generate a number\nof foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -\nfoundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was\nmainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the\nprobabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive\npsychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical\nprobability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by\nthe formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another\nquestion attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,\nthere are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover\ncompletely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability\nmodels have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in\nfoundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check\nSorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note\nwe present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of\nthis test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum\nprobability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional\nquantum model.

Although the duality between particles and\nwaves has been well tested since de Broglie introduced the matter-wave analog\nof the optical wavelength in 1924, manipulating atoms with a level of coherence\nthat enables one to use these properties for precision measurements has only\nbecome possible with our ability to produce atomic samples exhibiting\ntemperatures of only a few millionths of a degree above absolute zero. Since\nthe initial experiments a few decades ago, the field of atom optics has\ndeveloped in many ways, with both fundamental and applied significance. The\nexquisite control of matter waves offers the prospect of a new generation of\nforce sensors exhibiting unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy, for\napplications from navigation and geophysics to tests of general relativity.\nThanks to the latest developments in this field, the first commercial products\nusing this quantum technology are now available. In the future, our ability to\ncreate large coherent ensembles of atoms will allow us an even more precise\ncontrol of the matter-wave and the ability to create highly entangled states\nfor non-classical atom interferometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 12:58:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Barrett", "B.", ""], ["Bertoldi", "A.", ""], ["Bouyer", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.03262", "submitter": "Vladimir P.

Any\nadditional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,\ni.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter \"freedom\",\n\"free will\", or \"free choice\", is redundant in relation to the predictive\nsuccess of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views\nas redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a\nnegative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a\nnecessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts,\nfor example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will\ntheorem by Conway and Kochen.

In conclusion, the standard\ninterpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer\nin order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of\nwhether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to\nfree-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents\nin quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 20:09:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 16:12:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Walleczek", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.03499", "submitter": "Oscar Rosas-Ortiz", "authors": "Oscar Rosas-Ortiz, Sara Cruz y Cruz, Marco Enriquez", "title": "SU(1,1) and SU(2) Approaches to the Radial Oscillator: Generalized\n  Coherent States and Squeezing of Variances", "comments": "Abridged version, includes new references", "journal-ref": "Ann.

Quantum linear systems\nare a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of\nquantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic\ndifferential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of\nquantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described\nor approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities,\nbeam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical\nsqueezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum\ntechnology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new\nchallenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such\nquantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error\ncorrection, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom\nlasers, and superconducting quantum circuits.\n  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear\nsystems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear\nsystem. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent\nquantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum\ninformation, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This\npaper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal\ncontrollers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An\nimportant issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems\nand in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of\nphysical realizability.

For the\nwaveguide photons, here, we propose an approach to stop them with a\ncontrollable atomic cavity generated by a pair of atomic mirrors; one of them\nreflects the photon completely and an- other one with the adjustable\nreflected/transmitted probability of the photons. Based on the full quantum\nmechanical theory in real space, we show that the reflected/transmitted\nprobability of the waveguide photon with a fixed frequency can be controlled by\nadjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e.,\natomic mirrors).

In this dissertation we introduce two different\nmodels to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based\non the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The\nfirst model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation,\nintroduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing.

In the\nsecond model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show\nhow we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this\ntask can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.\nThese two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum\ngates.

In the case of\nmixed states, intermediate levels of correlations must be introduced, coined by\nthe name inseparability. In this work, we revisit in more detail such a concept\nin the context of continuous-variable quantum optics. We consider a six-partite\nquantum state that we have effectively generated by the parametric\ndownconversion of a femtosecond frequency comb, the full 12 x 12 covariance\nmatrix of which has been experimentally determined. We show that, though this\nstate does not exhibit \"genuine entanglement\", it is undoubtedly\nmultipartite-entangled. The consideration of not only the entanglement of\nindividual mode-decompositions but also of combinations of those solves the\npuzzle and exemplifies the importance of studying different categories of\nmultipartite entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2016 09:35:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gerke", "S.", ""], ["Sperling", "J.", ""], ["Vogel", "W.", ""], ["Cai", "Y.", ""], ["Roslund", "J.", ""], ["Treps", "N.", ""], ["Fabre", "C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.05807", "submitter": "Zhang-qi Yin Dr", "authors": "Yue Ma, Zhang-qi Yin, Pu Huang, W.

Advancements in the theoretical\nunderstanding of these systems are presented in complementary formalisms and\ncompared to experimental results. The experimental achievements are summarized\nalongside a description of the quantum optical effects and quantum devices\nemerging from them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 20:00:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:38:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Dibyendu", ""], ["Wilson", "C.

Enhanced accuracy and precision\nare attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to a curve simulated\nusing measured source spectra.

A prominent example for such a\nscenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge\ntheir parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While\nquantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply\nthat no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.\nWe also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and\nshow that the bound is tight for all pure states.

It is further shown that this design is robust to non-linear\neffects in the coupling loops as well as mismatches in some of the circuit\nparameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 10:49:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 13:05:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:57:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 14:18:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 13:07:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chancellor", "Nicholas", ""], ["Zohren", "Stefan", ""], ["Warburton", "Paul A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09555", "submitter": "Fabian Krumm", "authors": "F.
