The consistent\nhistories formalism is a tool for describing sequences of events taking place\nin an evolving closed quantum system. A set of histories is consistent when one\ncan reason about them using Boolean logic, i.e., when probabilities of\nsequences of events that define histories are additive. However, the vast\nmajority of the sets of histories that are merely consistent are flagrantly\nnon-classical in other respects. This embarras de richesses (known as the set\nselection problem) suggests that one must go beyond consistency to identify how\nthe classical past arises in our quantum Universe. The key intuition we follow\nis that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are\ninscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and\nare accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories\nthat are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace\ncondition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and\ndecoherence. The existence of redundant records is a sufficient condition for\nredundant consistency. It selects, from the multitude of the alternative sets\nof consistent histories, a small subset endowed with redundant records\ncharacteristic of the objective classical past. The information about an\nobjective history of the past is then simultaneously within reach of many, who\ncan independently reconstruct it and arrive at compatible conclusions in the\npresent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 05:02:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 22:17:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 19:48:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 14 Apr 2016 03:47:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Riedel", "C.

This observation spurred numerous\ninvestigations over the past two decades attempting to identify necessary and\nsufficient conditions for complete positivity. Here we describe a complete and\nconsistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete\npositivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This\nformalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to\ncontain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas, PRL (1994). The key\nobservation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on\nthe system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath\nstates with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the\ninduced dynamical maps on the system are well-defined. Once this consistency\ncondition is imposed, related concepts like the assignment map and the\ndynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be\napplied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately\ndefined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem\ngives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.\nUsing this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide\nconditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum\ndata-processing inequality. The problem remains open, and may require fresh\nperspectives and new mathematical tools.

Carlton Caves famously answered\nthis question with \"They do.\" With this understanding came ideas how to avoid\nthis limitation by giving up complete knowledge of the detector's motion. In\nthese back-action evading (BAE) or quantum non-demolition (QND) schemes, one\nmanipulates the required quantum measurement back-action by placing it into a\ncomponent of the motion which is unobserved and dynamically isolated. Using a\nsuperconducting, electro-mechanical device, we realize a sensitive measurement\nof a single motional quadrature with imprecision below the zero-point\nfluctuations of motion, detect both the classical and quantum measurement\nback-action, and demonstrate BAE avoiding the quantum back-action from the\nmicrowave photons by 9 dB. Further improvements of these techniques are\nexpected to provide a practical route to manipulate and prepare a squeezed\nstate of motion with mechanical fluctuations below the quantum zero-point\nlevel, which is of interest both fundamentally and for the detection of very\nweak forces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Dec 2013 20:32:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Suh", "J.", ""], ["Weinstein", "A.

Bunching of bosons is opposed to\nanti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of\nbipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and\ndistinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale\ndefined by the coherence length of the interfering particles.\n  As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via\nthe two-particle paradigm fails: In contrast to two-particle bunching and\nanti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and\nfermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The\nsimulation of many-boson interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a\nqualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The\nhierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite\nentanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions.\nFinally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and\nmany distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures.

First, it is\nproved that the class of two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum\npublic coins, denoted qq-QAM in this paper, does not change by adding a\nconstant number of turns of classical interactions prior to the communications\nof the qq-QAM proof systems.

To prove this collapse\ntheorem, this paper provides a natural complete problem for qq-QAM: deciding\nwhether the output of a given quantum circuit is close to a totally mixed\nstate. This complete problem is on the very line of the previous studies\ninvestigating the hardness of checking the properties related to quantum\ncircuits, and is of independent interest. It is further proved that the class\nqq-QAM_1 of two-turn quantum-public-coin quantum Arthur-Merlin proof systems\nwith perfect completeness gives new bounds for standard well-studied classes of\ntwo-turn interactive proof systems.

This restriction is generally called monogamy. However the\nformal quantification of such restriction is only known for some measures of\nentanglement and for two-level systems. The first and broadly known monogamy\nrelation was established by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters for the square of the\nconcurrence. Since then, it is usually said that the entanglement of formation\nis not monogamous, as it does not obey the same relation. We show here that\ndespite that, the entanglement of formation cannot be freely shared and\ntherefore should be said to be monogamous.

Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible\ncombinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular\nincludes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen\nindependently.

Conversely, a single photon in the cavity causes a shift\nin the mechanical resonator position on the order of its zero point motion. As\na result, the cavity-Cooper pair transistor (cCPT) coupled to a mechanical\nresonator will be able to access a regime in which single photons can affect\nsingle phonons and vice versa.

The method, using NE distribution and\nspectral functions, presents several advantages, and is equivalent to\nconventional steady-state NE Green's functions (NEGF) calculations when the\nsame level of approximation for the MB interaction is used. The advantages of\nour method resides in the fact that the NE distribution and spectral functions\nhave better analytic behaviour for numerical calculations. Furthermore our\napproach offer the possibility of introducing further approximations, not only\nat the level of the MB interaction as in NEGF, but also at the level of the\nfunctional form used for the NE distributions. For the single level model with\nelectron-phonon coupling we have considered, such approximations provide a good\nrepresentation of the exact results, for either the NE distributions themselves\nor the transport properties.

Harnessing the benefits of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level\nwould revolutionize fields ranging from telecommunication to biology, the\nlatter focused on here for reasons discussed. Contrary to misconceptions, there\nare no known physical laws that prevent the development of MQS. Instead, they\nare generally believed universally lost in complex systems from environmental\nentanglements (decoherence).

This paper advances the MQS field by a\ncomplex systems approach to decoherence. First, why complex system decoherence\napproaches (top-down) are needed is discussed. Specifically, complex adaptive\nsystems (CAS) are not amenable to reductionist models (and their master\nequations) because of emergent behavior, approximation failures, not accounting\nfor quantum compensator mechanisms, ignoring path integrals, and the subentity\nproblem. In addition, since MQS must exist within the context of the classical\nworld, rapid decoherence and prolonged coherence are both needed. Nature has\nalready demonstrated this for quantum subsystems such as photosynthesis and\nmagnetoreception. Second, we perform a preliminary study that illustrates a\ntop-down approach to potential MQS. In summary, reductionist arguments against\nMQS are not justifiable. It is more likely they are not easily detectable in\nlarge intact classical systems or has been destroyed by reductionist\nexperimental set-ups.
