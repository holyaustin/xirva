The creation of games is a way to ease the transition for beginners.\nWe present a game similar to the Poker variant Texas hold 'em with the\nintention to serve as an engaging pedagogical tool to learn the basics rules of\nquantum computing. The concepts of quantum states, quantum operations and\nmeasurement can be learned in a playful manner. The difference to the classical\nvariant is that the community cards are replaced by a quantum register that is\n\"randomly\" initialized, and the cards for each player are replaced by quantum\ngates, randomly drawn from a set of available gates. Each player can create a\nquantum circuit with their cards, with the aim to maximize the number of $1$'s\nthat are measured in the computational basis. The basic concepts of\nsuperposition, entanglement and quantum gates are employed. We provide a\nproof-of-concept implementation using Qiskit. A comparison of the results for\nthe created circuits using a simulator and IBM machines is conducted, showing\nthat error rates on contemporary quantum computers are still very high. For the\nsuccess of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers, improvements on\nthe error rates and error mitigation techniques are necessary, even for simple\ncircuits. We show that quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques can be used to\nimprove expectation values of observables on real quantum devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 18:41:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Jan 2020 09:10:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 09:17:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 14:52:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Fuchs", "Franz G.", ""], ["Falch", "Vemund", ""], ["Johnsen", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.00108", "submitter": "Rafa{\\l} O{\\l}dziejewski", "authors": "Rafa{\\l} O{\\l}dziejewski, Wojciech G\\'orecki, Krzysztof Paw{\\l}owski,\n  Kazimierz Rz\\k{a}\\.zewski", "title": "Strongly correlated quantum droplets in quasi-1D dipolar Bose gas", "comments": "6+6 pages, 4+2 figures, comments welcome, version accepted in\n  Physical Review Letters", "journal-ref": "Phys.

On the other\nhand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity but is valid only in\nthe ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing,\nwhich makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving. Here\nwe show that a recently derived Markovian coarse-grained master equation\n(CGME), already known to be completely positive, has a much expanded range of\napplicability compared to the Davies equation, and moreover, is locally\ngenerated and can be generalized to accommodate arbitrarily fast driving. This\ngeneralization, which we refer to as the time-dependent CGME, is thus suitable\nfor the analysis of fast operations in gate-model quantum computing, such as\nquantum error correction and dynamical decoupling. Our derivation proceeds\ndirectly from the Redfield equation and allows us to place rigorous error\nbounds on all three equations: Redfield, Davies, and coarse-grained. Our main\nresult is thus a completely positive Markovian master equation that is a\ncontrolled approximation to the true evolution for any time-dependence of the\nsystem Hamiltonian, and works for systems with arbitrarily small level spacing.\nWe illustrate this with an analysis showing that dynamical decoupling can\nextend coherence times even in a strictly Markovian setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Aug 2019 00:28:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 22:28:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mozgunov", "Evgeny", ""], ["Lidar", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.01096", "submitter": "Marcelo Aparecido Marchiolli Dr.", "authors": "Marcelo A.

Specifically, we consider an ion confined in a\ntime-dependent radio-frequency Paul trap with linear geometry, while the atom\nis constrained to move into a quasi-one-dimensional optical waveguide within\nthe ion trap. We evaluate the impact of the ion intrinsic micromotion on the\nresonance position. Thus, we solve the atom-ion dynamics semiclassically,\nnamely the atom dynamics is governed by the three-dimensional time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, whereas the ion motion is described by the classical\nHamilton equations. We find that the energy of the ion provided by the\noscillating radiofrequency fields can affect the resonance position\nsubstantially. Notwithstanding, the peculiar phenomenology of those resonances\nregarding perfect transmission and reflection is still observable. These\nfindings indicate that the intrinsic micromotion of the ion is not detrimental\nfor the occurrence of the resonance and that its position can be controlled by\nthe radiofrequency fields. This provides an additional mean for tuning atom-ion\ninteractions in low spatial dimensions.

While short-distance fibre-based QKD has already been\navailable for real-life implementation, the bottleneck of practical QKD lies on\nthe limited transmission distance.

In the\nfield of superconducting qubits, standard readout techniques are not only\nlimited by the signal-to-noise ratio, but also by state relaxation during the\nmeasurement.

Employing this technique, we show that we can directly\nresolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part in $10^3.$ Extending this\nidea, we apply the same principles to the measurement of a logical qubit\nencoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla, implementing a\nproposal by Hann et al.

Our language and type system, built around a lightweight\nimplementation of sized types, supports subtyping over register sizes and is\nmoreover type-safe. In particular, we prove that our system is strongly\nnormalizing, and as such any well-typed metaQASM program can be statically\nunrolled into a finite circuit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Aug 2019 14:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Amy", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.02656", "submitter": "Farzan Jazaeri", "authors": "Farzan Jazaeri, Arnout Beckers, Armin Tajalli, and Jean-Michel Sallese", "title": "A Review on Quantum Computing: Qubits, Cryogenic Electronics and\n  Cryogenic MOSFET Physics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.app-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computing (QC) has already entered the industrial landscape and\nseveral multinational corporations have initiated their own research efforts.\nSo far, many of these efforts have been focusing on superconducting qubits,\nwhose industrial progress is currently way ahead of all other qubit\nimplementations.

The\nsecurity definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based,\nand not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable,\ncomputational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new\ndefinitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational:\na scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into\nan ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to\nblock messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By\nmodifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one\ngets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations\nare composable, resulting in composable security.\n  Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the\nasymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite\nreduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from\nthe ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite\ninstance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to\nmake security claims about concrete implementations.\n  We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the\nliterature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the\nrelations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones.

Szilard engines are in general\noperated by a Maxwell's Demon where Landauer's principle resolves the apparent\nparadoxes. Here we propose a Szilard engine setup without featuring an explicit\nMaxwell's demon. In a demonless Szilard engine, the acquisition of which-side\ninformation is not required, but erasure and the related heat dissipation still\ntake place implicitly by the very nature of the work extraction process. We see\nthat the insertion of the partition in a quantum Szilard engine does not\nlocalize the particle to one side, instead it creates a superposition state of\nthe particle being in both sides. To be able to extract work from the system,\nparticle has to be localized at one side. The localization occurs as a result\nof quantum measurement on the particle, which shows the importance of the\nmeasurement process regardless of whether one uses the acquired information or\nnot. In accordance with the Landauer's principle, localization by quantum\nmeasurement corresponds to a logically irreversible operation and for this\nreason it has to be accompanied by the corresponding heat dissipation. This\nshows the validity of the Landauer's principle even in quantum Szilard engines\nwithout Maxwell's demon. Furthermore, we take quantum confinement effects fully\ninto account to analyze the Szilard cycle in the quantum regime thoroughly and\nobtain highly accurate analytical expressions for work and heat exchanges.

In this paper we review and extend the ED framework in several\ndirections. A new version of ED is introduced in which particles follow smooth\ndifferentiable Brownian trajectories (as opposed to non-differentiable Brownian\npaths). To construct the ED we make use of the fact that the space of\nprobabilities and phases has a natural symplectic structure (i.e., it is a\nphase space with Hamiltonian flows and Poisson brackets). Then, using an\nargument based on information geometry, a metric structure is introduced. It is\nshown that the ED that preserves the symplectic and metric structures -- which\nis a Hamilton-Killing flow in phase space -- is the linear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. These developments allow us to discuss why wave functions are complex\nand the connections between the superposition principle, the single-valuedness\nof wave functions, and the quantization of electric charges.

Harnessing many-body interactions, we show that the maximum possible\nvalues of the thermoelectric figure of merit and the power factor can be\nenhanced by orders of magnitudes for generic single-electron levels. This\nallows for simple and flexible design of realizing the asymptotic Carnot\nefficiency with subextensive, but still nonzero and stable power.

On the one hand we demonstrate that every\nentangled state is useful for teleportation if a generalization of the average\nfidelity of teleportation is considered which concerns teleporting quantum\ncorrelations. On the other hand, we show the strength of a particular entangled\nstate and entangled measurement for teleportation -- as quantified by the\nrobustness of teleportation -- precisely characterizes their ability to offer\nan advantage in the task of subchannel discrimination with side information.\nThis connection allows us to prove that every entangled state outperforms all\nseparable states when acting as a quantum memory in this discrimination task.\nFinally, within the context of a resource theory of teleportation, we show that\nthe two operational tasks considered provide complete sets of monotones for two\npartial orders based upon the notion of teleportation simulation, one\nclassical, and one quantum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:08:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:05:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lipka-Bartosik", "Patryk", ""], ["Skrzypczyk", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.05139", "submitter": "Cecilia Chiaracane", "authors": "Cecilia Chiaracane, Mark T.

The enhancement scales\nexponentially with the photon number; larger states benefit more strongly.\nMultiplexed photon entanglement and interference will find diverse applications\nin quantum photonics, allowing for practical realisations of multi-photon\nprotocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2019 19:29:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Meyer-Scott", "Evan", ""], ["Prasannan", "Nidhin", ""], ["Dhand", "Ish", ""], ["Eigner", "Christof", ""], ["Quiring", "Viktor", ""], ["Barkhofen", "Sonja", ""], ["Brecht", "Benjamin", ""], ["Plenio", "Martin B.", ""], ["Silberhorn", "Christine", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.05740", "submitter": "Yiming Pan", "authors": "Jing Zhou, Ido Kaminer, Yiming Pan", "title": "Quantum Emergence of Linear Particle Accelerator and Anomalous\n  Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy in a Strong Coupling Regime", "comments": "17 pages, 4+3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.acc-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) is a currently\ndeveloping spectral approach that characterizes quantum electron-light\ninteractions in electron energy gain/loss spectrum, with symmetrically\ndiscretized gains or losses of light quanta ($\\hbar \\omega$), coupled with a\nlaser induced optical near-field.

In particular, we focus on the\nvacuum state and examine the amount of quantum entanglement perceived by the\nobservers. The framework is developed for three cases: the quantum scalar field\nin 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions and the Dirac spinor field in 1+1 dimensions. We find\nthat in general more entanglement is seen when the accelerations of the\nobservers increase and when the size of the modes of the observers and their\ncentral frequencies decrease.

Detailed maps of amounts of tripartite and bipartite entanglement\nextracted by the detectors, are produced and compared between two types of\nboundary conditions.

It is often impossible\nto obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring\nin a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator into a\nweighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of\nmany measurements. An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli\noperators together before measuring all operators within a collection\nsimultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors.\nFirstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of\nPaulis in collections. In our work, we propose two natural metrics for\nquantifying this, operating under the assumption that measurements are\ndistributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite\nsampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we\nintroduce SORTED INSERTION, a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting\nof each Pauli operator in the overall sum.

The unrestricted $M_S=\\pm 1$ T$_1$ CIS states better\napproximate the physical dissociation limit, but their degeneracy is broken\nbeyond the CF point for most single bond dissociations. On the other hand, the\n$M_S=\\pm 1$ T$_1$ TDHF states reach the asymptote too soon, by merging with the\nground state from the CF point onwards. Use of local exchange-correlation\nfunctionals causes $M_S=\\pm 1$ T$_1$ TDDFT states to resemble their unphysical\n$M_S= 0$ counterpart. The 2 orbital, 2-electron model system of minimal basis\nH$_2$ is analytically treated to understand the origin of these issues,\nrevealing that the lack of double excitations is at the root of these\nremarkable observations. The behavior of excited state surfaces is also\nnumerically examined for species like H$_2$, NH$_3$, C$_2$H$_6$ and LiH in\nextended basis sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2019 21:44:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hait", "Diptarka", ""], ["Rettig", "Adam", ""], ["Head-Gordon", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.07083", "submitter": "Dana Faiez", "authors": "Dana Faiez, Dominik \\v{S}afr\\'anek, J.

We show that\nthe braiding of these twists results in either (tensor products of) the S gate\nor (tensor products of) the CZ gate. We also show that for any number of copies\nof the 2d surface code the application of H gates within a copy and CNOT gates\nbetween copies is sufficient to generate all possible twists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2019 13:57:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 11:48:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2020 16:29:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Scruby", "T.

In this paper, we propose an\nanalytically solvable model to investigate the energy transfer between a\nbosonic bath and a fermionic chain which are nonlinearly-coupled to each other.\nThe bosonic bath consists of an infinite collection of non-interacting bosonic\nmodes, while the fermionic chain is represented by a chain of interacting\nfermions with nearest-neighbor interactions. We compare behaviors of the\ntemperature-dependent energy current $J_{T}$ and temperature-independent energy\ncurrent $J_{TI}$ for different bath configurations. With respect to the bath\nspectrum, $J_{T}$ decays exponentially for Lorentz-Drude type bath, which is\nthe same as the conventional approximations. On the other hand, the decay rate\nis $1/t^{3}$ for Ohmic type and $1/t$ for white noise, which doesn't have\nconventional counterparts. For the temperature-independent current $J_{TI}$,\nthe decay rate is divergent for the Lorentz-Drude type bath, $1/t^{4}$ for the\nOhmic bath, and $1/t$ for the white noise. When further considering the\ndynamics of the fermionic chain, the current will be modulated based on the\nenvelope from the bath. As an example, for a bosonic bath with Ohmic spectrum,\nwhen the fermionic chain is uniformly-coupled, we have $J_{T}\\propto1/t^{6}$\nand $J_{TI}\\propto1/t^{3}$. Remarkably, for perfect state transfer (PST)\ncouplings, there always exists an oscillating quantum energy current $J_{TI}$.\nMoreover, it is interesting that $J_{T}$ is proportional to $(N-1)^{1/2}$ at\ncertain times for PST couplings under Lorentz-Drude or Ohmic bath.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Aug 2019 08:18:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Apr 2020 07:22:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhao-Ming", ""], ["Luo", "Da-Wei", ""], ["Li", "Baowen", ""], ["Wu", "Lian-Ao", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.07766", "submitter": "Levan Chotorlishvili L", "authors": "L.

These behaviors are composed of\nsimple collective motions of particles which move with the same frequency and\nphase, thus encapsulating many-body effects into simple dynamic motions. In\nregimes such as the unitary regime for ultracold Fermi gases, a single\ncollective mode can dominate, leading to simple behavior as seen in\nsuperfluidity. I investigate the evolution of collective motion as a function\nof N for five types of normal modes obtained from an L=0 group theoretic\nsolution of a general Hamiltonian for confined, identical particles. I show\nusing simple analytic forms that the collective behavior of few-body systems,\nwith the well known motions of molecular equivalents such as ammonia and\nmethane, evolves smoothly to the collective motions expected for large N\nensembles. The transition occurs at quite low values of N. I study a\nHamiltonian known to support collective behavior, the Hamiltonian for Fermi\ngases in the unitary regime. I analyze the evolution of both frequencies and\nthe coefficients that mix the radial and angular coordinates which both depend\non interparticle interactions. This analysis reveals two phenomena that could\ncontribute to the viability of collective behavior. First the mixing\ncoefficients go to zero or unity, i.e. no mixing, as N becomes large resulting\nin solutions that do not depend on the details of the interparticle potential\nas expected for this unitary regime, and that manifest the symmetry of an\nunderlying approximate Hamiltonian. Second, the five normal mode frequencies\nwhich are all close for low values of N, separate as N increases, creating\nlarge gaps that can, in principle, offer stability to collective behavior if\nmechanisms to prevent the transfer of energy to other modes exist (such as low\ntemperature) or can be constructed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Aug 2019 20:05:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Watson", "D.

The (apparent) wave-function collapse and the\ncorresponding randomness result from tracing out this environment; it is thus\nthe ultimate responsible for the emergence of definite outcomes.

The chosen testbeds are a continuous-space double-well problem, the\nferromagnetic quantum Ising chain, and the recently introduced shamrock model.\nAs guiding wave function, we consider an approximate Boltzmann-type ansatz, the\nnumerically-exact ground state of the double-well model, and a neural-network\nwave function based on a Boltzmann machine. Remarkably, for each ansatz we find\nthe same asymptotic linear scaling of the tunneling rate that was previously\nfound in the PQMC simulations performed without a guiding wave function. We\nalso provide a semiclassical theory for the double-well with exact guiding wave\nfunction that explains the observed linear scaling.

True MBL is known to occur only\nunder certain stringent conditions for perfectly isolated one-dimensional\nsystems, with Hamiltonians that have strictly short-range interactions and lack\nany continuous non-Abelian symmetries. However, in practice, even systems that\nare not strictly MBL can be nearly MBL, with equilibration rates that are far\nslower than their other intrinsic timescales; thus, anomalously slow relaxation\noccurs in a much broader class of systems than strict MBL. In this review we\naddress transport and dynamics in such nearly-MBL systems from a unified\nperspective. Our discussion covers various classes of such systems: (i)\ndisordered and quasiperiodic systems on the thermal side of the MBL-thermal\ntransition; (ii) systems that are strongly disordered, but obstructed from\nlocalizing because of symmetry, interaction range, or dimensionality; (iii)\nmultiple-component systems, in which some components would in isolation be MBL\nbut others are not; and finally (iv) driven systems whose dynamics lead to\nexponentially slow rates of heating to infinite temperature. A theme common to\nmany of these problems is that they can be understood in terms of approximately\nlocalized degrees of freedom coupled to a heat bath (or baths) consisting of\nthermal degrees of freedom; however, this putative bath is itself nontrivial,\nbeing either small or very slowly relaxing.

In this work, we experimentally study the\ncontribution of instrumentation noise to flux instability and the resulting\nerror rate of parametrically activated two-qubit gates. Specifically, we\nmeasure the qubit coherence time under flux modulation while injecting\nbroadband noise through the flux control channel. We model the noise's effect\nusing a dephasing rate model that matches well to the measured rates, and use\nit to prescribe a noise floor required to achieve a desired two-qubit gate\ninfidelity. Finally, we demonstrate that low-pass filtering the AC signal used\nto drive two-qubit gates between the first and second harmonic frequencies can\nreduce qubit sensitivity to flux noise at the AC sweet spot (ACSS), confirming\nan earlier theoretical prediction.

This leads to a scaling law for equilibrium fluctuations that differs\nfrom that expected by the ETH. Further, we analytically compute the\ntime-dependence of the decay to equilibrium, showing that it is proportional to\nthe survival probability of the initial state. We further discuss (the lack of)\nscrambling of quantum information in this regime, and calculate the long-time\nlimit of the out-of-time-ordered correlator. Relating our results to previous\nnumerical observations of initial state dependent scrambling, we uncover the\nmechanism behind this feature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 15:01:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nation", "Charlie", ""], ["Porras", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.11827", "submitter": "Rei Sato", "authors": "Rei Sato, Tetsuro Nikuni, and Shohei Watabe", "title": "Scaling Hypothesis of Spatial Search on Fractal Lattice Using Quantum\n  Walk", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
