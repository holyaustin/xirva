In the past, this property has been\nassociated with the so-called badlands region of the potential, where the\nsemiclassical description of the scattering fails due to a rapid spatial\nvariation of the deBroglie wavelength. This badlands region occurs far from the\nstrong interaction region of the potential and has therefore been used to\n\"explain\" the quantum reflection phenomenon. In this paper, we show that the\nbadlands region of the interaction potential is immaterial. The extremely long\nwavelength of the scattered particle at threshold is much longer than the\nspatial extension of the badlands region which therefore does not affect the\nscattering. For this purpose, we review the general proof for the existence of\nquantum threshold reflection to stress that it is only a consequence of\ncontinuity and boundary conditions. The nonlocal character of the scattering\nimplies that the whole interaction potential is involved in the phenomenon. We\nthen provide a detailed numerical study of the threshold scattering of a\nparticle by a Morse potential especially in the time domain.

Specifically, we\nconsider thermal states of the quantum system in the presence of an additional\nstatic force which, however, become nonequilibrium states when this static\nforce is eventually removed. While for weak forces the relaxation dynamics is\nwell captured by LRT, much less is known in the case of strong forces, i.e.,\ninitial states far away from equilibrium. Summarizing our main results, we\nunveil that, for high temperatures, the nonequilibrium dynamics of so-called\nbinary operators is always generated by an equilibrium correlation function. In\nparticular, this statement holds true for states in the far-from-equilibrium\nlimit, i.e., outside the linear response regime. In addition, we confirm our\nanalytical results by numerically studying the dynamics of local fermionic\noccupation numbers and local energy densities in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain.\nRemarkably, these simulations also provide evidence that our results\nqualitatively apply in a more general setting, e.g., in the anisotropic XXZ\nmodel where the local energy is a non-binary operator, as well as for a wider\nrange of temperature.

This is because in a\ngeneric experimental situation with sufficiently many subsystems involved, the\nproduction of so-called genuine multipartite entanglement remains a formidable\nchallenge. Consequently, focusing exclusively on the identification of this\nstrongest type of entanglement may result in an all or nothing situation where\nsome inherently quantum aspects of the resource are overlooked. On the\ncontrary, even if the system is not genuinely multipartite entangled, there may\nstill be many-body entanglement present in the system. An identification of the\nentanglement structure may thus provide us with a hint about where\nimperfections in the setup may occur, as well as where we can identify groups\nof subsystems that can still exhibit strong quantum-information-processing\ncapabilities. However, there is no known efficient methods to identify the\nunderlying entanglement structure. Here, we propose two complementary families\nof witnesses for the identification of such structures. They are based on the\ndetection of entanglement intactness and entanglement depth, each requires only\nthe implementation of solely two local measurements. Our method is also robust\nagainst noises and other imperfections, as reflected by our experimental\nimplementation of these tools to verify the entanglement structure of five\ndifferent eight-photon entangled states.

To this end, we\ndevelop a time-dependent renormalization group approach which allows\ncalculations of all dynamical properties of the system and takes into account\nthe effects of quantum fluctuations in the polaron cloud.

To fully exploit these functionalities,\nmultiple degrees of freedom are highly desirable: in this respect, nanoscale\nsystems that coherently couple to light and possess spins, allow for storage of\nphotonic qubits or light-matter entanglement together with processing\ncapabilities. In addition, all-optical control of spins can be possible for\nfaster gate operations and higher spatial selectivity compared to direct RF\nexcitation. Such systems are therefore of high interest for quantum\ncommunications and processing.

Indeed, interactions with surfaces related perturbations strongly\nincrease as sizes decrease, although the smallest objects present the highest\nflexibility for integration with other systems.

When a critical point of an upper\nbound of Bell's inequality occurs in our quantum states, one of the quantum\nstate is a ground state of the toric code model on a disk manifold. Our result\nalso implies that the maximally entangled states does not suggest local maximum\nquantum entanglement in our quantum states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 04:18:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chu", "Su-Kuan", ""], ["Ma", "Chen-Te", ""], ["Miao", "Rong-Xin", ""], ["Wu", "Chih-Hung", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04424", "submitter": "Michael K\\\"ohl", "authors": "Thorsten F.

Key to\nthe DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an\nAnderson impurity model, the ground state of which is computed using an\nimpurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited by the complexity of\nthe impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems\ngenerally requires many correlated sites. By adapting the recently proposed\nadaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) method as an impurity\nsolver, we enable much more efficient zero temperature DMFT simulations. The\nkey feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant\nHilbert space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state. This reduces the\nnumerical complexity of the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future\nDMFT simulations with more correlated impurity sites than in previous works.\nHere we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the\none-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient\nconvergence and timing properties.

These algorithms explore trees of\nunknown structure, and in certain cases exponentially outperform classical\nprocedures (such as DPLL). Some of the previous work focused on obtaining a\nquantum advantage for trees in which a unique marked vertex is promised to\nexist. We remove this restriction and re-characterise the problem in terms of\nthe effective resistance of the search space. To this end, we present a\ngeneralisation of one of Montanaro's algorithms to trees containing $k \\geq 1$\nmarked vertices, where $k$ is not necessarily known \\textit{a priori}.\n  Our approach involves using amplitude estimation to determine a near-optimal\nweighting of a diffusion operator, which can then be applied to prepare a\nsuperposition state that has support only on marked vertices and ancestors\nthereof. By repeatedly sampling this state and updating the input vertex, a\nmarked vertex is reached in a logarithmic number of steps. The algorithm\nthereby achieves the conjectured bound of\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{TR_{\\mathrm{max}}})$ for finding a single marked\nvertex and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(k\\sqrt{T R_{\\mathrm{max}}}\\right)$ for\nfinding all $k$ marked vertices, where $T$ is an upper bound on the tree size\nand $R_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum effective resistance encountered by the\nalgorithm. This constitutes a speedup over Montanaro's original procedure in\nboth the case of finding one and finding multiple marked vertices in an\narbitrary tree.

Our\neffective equations are derived by eliminating resonator degrees of freedom\nwhile encoding their effect in the Green's function of the electromagnetic\nbackground. We account for the openness of the resonator exactly by employing a\nspectral representation for the Green's function in terms of a set of\nnon-Hermitian modes. A well-behaved time domain perturbation theory is derived\nto systematically account for the nonlinearity of weakly nonlinear qubits like\ntransmon. We apply this method to the problem of spontaneous emission,\ncapturing accurately the non-Markovian features of the qubit dynamics, valid\nfor any qubit-resonator coupling strength. Any discrete-level quantum system\ncoupled to the electromagnetic continuum is subject to radiative decay and\nrenormalization of its energy levels. When inside a cavity, these quantities\ncan be strongly modified with respect to vacuum. Generally, this modification\ncan be captured by including only the closest resonant cavity mode. In\ncircuit-QED architecture, with substantial coupling strengths, it is however\nfound that such rates are strongly influenced by far off-resonant modes. A\nmultimode calculation over the infinite set of cavity modes leads to\ndivergences unless an artificial cutoff is imposed.

For instance, strain can be used to enhance the electron mobility\nof a semiconductor, enabling more efficient solar cells and smaller, faster\ntransistors. In the context of nanomechanics, the pursuit of resonators with\nultra-high coherence has led to intense study of a complementary strain\nengineering technique, \"dissipation dilution\", whereby the stiffness of a\nmaterial is effectively increased without added loss. Dissipation dilution is\nknown to underlie the anomalously high Q factor of Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomechanical\nresonators, including recently-developed \"soft-clamped\" resonators; however,\nthe paradigm has to date relied on weak strain produced during material\nsynthesis.

Magnetic molecules are among the list of promising\nbuilding blocks, due to (i) their intrinsic monodispersity, (ii) discrete\nenergy levels (iii) the possibility of chemical quantum state engineering, and\n(iv) their multilevel characteristics, leading to the so called Qudits (d > 2),\namongst others. Herein we review how a molecular multilevel nuclear spin qubit\n(or qudit, where d = 4), known as TbPc2, gathers all the necessary requirements\nto perform as a molecular hardware platform with a first generation of\nmolecular devices enabling even quantum algorithm operations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Nov 2017 09:28:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Moreno-Pineda", "Eufemio", ""], ["Godfrin", "Cl\u00e9ment", ""], ["Balestro", "Franck", ""], ["Wernsdorfer", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Ruben", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.07285", "submitter": "Srinivasan Arunachalam", "authors": "Srinivasan Arunachalam, Jop Bri\\\"et, Carlos Palazuelos", "title": "Quantum Query Algorithms are Completely Bounded Forms", "comments": "24 pages, 3 figures. v2: 27 pages, minor changes in response to\n  referee comments", "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Computing, Vol. 48, 903-925, 2019", "doi": "10.1137/18M117563X", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC math.FA math.OA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove a characterization of $t$-query quantum algorithms in terms of the\nunit ball of a space of degree-$2t$ polynomials.

It is noted that there are three\ngenerators for the rotation group defining the spin of a particle at rest. The\nclosed set of commutation relations is a direct consequence of Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relations. The rotation group can be generated by three two-by-two\nPauli matrices for spin-half particles. This group of two-by-two matrices is\ncalled SU(2), with two-component spinors. The direct product of two spinors\nleads to four states leading to one spin-0 state and one spin-1 state with\nthree sub-states. The SU(2) group can be expanded to another group of\ntwo-by-two matrices called SL(2,c), which serves as the covering group for the\ngroup of Lorentz transformations. In this Lorentz-covariant regime, it is\npossible to Lorentz-boost the particle at rest to its infinite-momentum or\nmassless state. Also in this SL(2,c) regime, there are four spin states for\neach particle, as in the case of the Dirac equation. The direct product of two\nSL(2,c) spinors thus leads sixteen states. Among them, four of them can be used\nfor the electromagnetic four-potential, and six for the Maxwell tensor. The\ngauge degree of freedom is shown to be a Lorentz-boosted rotation. The\npolarization of massless neutrinos is interpreted as a consequence of the gauge\ninvariance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Nov 2017 07:54:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Baskal", "Sibel", ""], ["Kim", "Young S.", ""], ["Noz", "Marilyn E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.09222", "submitter": "Z Yan", "authors": "Zhenya Yan", "title": "A novel hierarchy of two-family-parameter equations: Local, nonlocal,\n  and mixed-local-nonlocal vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.SI math-ph math.AP math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use two families of parameters $\\{(\\epsilon_{x_j},\n\\epsilon_{t_j})\\,|\\,\\epsilon_{x_j,t_j}=\\pm1,\\, j=1,2,...,n\\}$ to first\nintroduce a unified novel two-family-parameter system (simply called ${\\mathcal\nQ}^{(n)}_{\\epsilon_{x_{\\vec{n}}},\\epsilon_{t_{\\vec{n}}}}$ system), connecting\nintegrable local, nonlocal, novel mixed-local-nonlocal, and other nonlocal\nvector nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (VNLS) equations.

The robust half-quantized conductance plateaus, due to CMEMs at\nquasienergies zero or half the driving frequency, are both fascinating and\nsubtle because they only emerge after a summation over contributions from all\nFloquet sidebands. Such a distinctive transport signature can thus serve as a\nhallmark of photoinduced CMEMs in topological insulator-superconductor\njunctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Nov 2017 05:16:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yap", "Han Hoe", ""], ["Zhou", "Longwen", ""], ["Lee", "Ching Hua", ""], ["Gong", "Jiangbin", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.09546", "submitter": "Changpeng Shao", "authors": "Changpeng Shao", "title": "Quantum speedup to some types of polynomial equations", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.gen-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider three types of polynomial equations in quantum\ncomputer: linear divisibility equation, which belongs to a special type of\nbinary-quadratic Diophantine equation; quadratic congruence equation with\nrestriction in the solution and exponential congruence equation in finite\nfield.

These results provide a benchmark for the use of\ntensor networks as powerful non-perturbative non-equilibrium methods for\nrelativistic quantum field theory, providing a promising technique for the\nfuture study of high energy physics and cosmology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 18:33:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Dec 2017 14:17:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:34:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gillman", "Edward", ""], ["Rajantie", "Arttu", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.10454", "submitter": "Mark Stockman", "authors": "S.

In\nthe construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide\nnumerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained\nwith superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this\ntraining suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately.\nWhen arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit\nproperties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian\nrule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted\ninputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional)\nneural network dynamics implies that the vast body of literature and results on\nneural networks becomes directly relevant in the context of quantum machine\nlearning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 05:38:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Yudong", ""], ["Guerreschi", "Gian Giacomo", ""], ["Aspuru-Guzik", "Al\u00e1n", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.11242", "submitter": "Raphael Florentino Ribeiro", "authors": "Raphael F.
