Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD\nsystem to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\ntype, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear\ncode of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical\nerror correcting code and our proposed hash function.

In this propose, the two lowest levels of\neach system represent the two logical states of a qubit while the two\nhigher-energy intermediate levels are used for the gate implementation. The\nmethod presented here operates essentially by creating a single photon through\nthe control qubit, which then induces a phase shift to the state of each target\nqubit. The phase shifts on each target qubit can be adjusted by changing the\nRabi frequencies of the pulses applied to the target qubit systems. The\noperation time for the gate implementation is independent of the number of\nqubits, and neither adjustment of the qubit level spacings nor adjustment of\nthe cavity mode frequency during the gate operation is required by this\nproposal. It is also noted that this approach can be applied to implement\ncertain types of significant multiqubit phase gates, e.g., the multiqubit phase\ngate consisting of $n$ two-qubit CP gates which are key elements in quantum\nFourier transforms.

Knowledge of such resonances is\nimportant in the study of the underlying physical system. Often the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in\nfollowing the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the\nparameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where\nthe resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel\ncoupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous\nwork it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the\nstudy of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following\nthe resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems\nwithout energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined\nthat eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the\norigin due to symmetries. Following the zeros of this regularized function then\ntraces the resonance path. In this work we show that this approach can be\nextended to channels with energy separation, albeit limited to two channels.\nThe issue here is that the energy separation introduces branch cuts in the\ncomplex energy domain that need to be eliminated with a so-called\nuniformization. We demonstrate that the resulting approach is suitable for\ninvestigating resonances in two-channel systems and provide an extensive\nexample.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jan 2011 10:17:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Mar 2011 14:20:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["K\u0142osiewicz", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["Vanroose", "Wim", ""], ["Broeckhove", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0712", "submitter": "Cecile Robilliard", "authors": "Bruno Pelle (LCAR), Hugo Bitard (LCAR), Gilles Bailly (LCAR), C\\'ecile\n  Robilliard (LCAR)", "title": "Observation of magneto-electric non-reciprocity in molecular nitrogen\n  gas", "comments": "4 pages, accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters", "journal-ref": "Physical Review Letters 106, 19 (2011) 193003 (4 pages)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.193003", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report the direct observation of the non-reciprocity of the velocity of\nlight, induced in a gas by electric and magnetic fields.

We investigate the\nreversibility by reconstructing the initial state from the output correlations,\nand the results are slightly beyond the cloning limit. Furthermore, full\ncharacterization of the amplifier and cloner is given by using coherent states\nwith several different mean values as inputs. Our amplifier is based on linear\noptics, offline preparation of nonclassical ancillas, and homodyne measurements\nfollowed by feedforward. Squeezed states are used as the ancillas, and\nnonlinear optical effects are exploited only for their generation. The ancillas\nintroduce nonclassicality into the amplifying operation, making entanglement at\nthe output.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jan 2011 04:51:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yoshikawa", "Jun-ichi", ""], ["Miwa", "Yoshichika", ""], ["Filip", "Radim", ""], ["Furusawa", "Akira", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1140", "submitter": "Kyle Arnold", "authors": "K.

In recent years, great progress has been made in cooling\nmicromechanical resonators towards their quantum mechanical ground state. This\nwork is an important step towards the creation of Schr\\\"odinger cats in the\nlaboratory, and the study of their destruction by decoherence.

The first way is to describe the\naction of one, two and three- qubit quantum gates as a set of small ($2 \\times\n2, 4\\times 4$ or $8\\times 8$) matrices acting on the $2^{n_q}$ amplitudes for a\nsystem of $n_q$ qubits.

The advantage is that smaller storage\ndemands are made, without loss of speed, and that the procedure can take\nadvantage of message passing interface (MPI) techniques, which will hopefully\nbe generally available in future Mathematica versions.\n  Another extension of QDENSITY provided here is a multiverse approach, as\ndescribed in our QCMPI paper. This multiverse approach involves using the\npresent slave-master parallel processing capabilities of Mathematica 7.0/8.0 to\nsimulate errors and error correction. The basic idea is that parallel versions\nof QCWAVE run simultaneously with random errors introduced on some of the\nprocessors, with an ensemble average used to represent the real world\nsituation.

A number of theoretical and numerical studies\naccumulate evidence that under specific conditions quantum many-body models can\nrelax to a situation that locally or with respect to certain observables\nappears as if the entire system had relaxed to a maximum entropy state. In this\nwork, we report the experimental observation of the non-equilibrium dynamics of\na density wave of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice in the regime\nof strong correlations. Using an optical superlattice, we are able to prepare\nthe system in a well-known initial state with high fidelity.

Numerical studies based on the time-dependent density-matrix\nrenormalization group method are in an excellent quantitative agreement with\nthe experimental data. For very long times, all three local observables show a\nfast relaxation to equilibrium values compatible with those expected for a\nglobal maximum entropy state.

This superposition is generally not fully coherent und must be\ndescribed in terms of a density matrix. A recent experiment [E. Goulielmakis et\nal., Nature 466, 739 (2010)] employed attosecond transient absorption\nspectroscopy to determine the density matrix of strong-field-generated Kr+\nions. The experimentally observed degree of coherence of the\nstrong-field-generated Kr+ ions is well reproduced by a recently developed\nmultichannel strong-field-ionization theory. But there is significant\ndisagreement between experiment and theory with respect to the degree of\nalignment of the Kr+ ions. In the present paper, the theory underlying\nattosecond transient absorption spectroscopy of strong-field-generated ions is\ndeveloped. The theory is formulated in such a way that the nonperturbative\nnature of the strong-field-ionization process is systematically taken into\naccount. The impact of attosecond pulse propagation effects on the\ninterpretation of experimental data is investigated both analytically and\nnumerically. It is shown that attosecond pulse propagation effects cannot\nexplain why the experimentally determined degree of alignment of\nstrong-field-generated Kr+ ions is much smaller than predicted by existing\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 10:38:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Santra", "Robin", ""], ["Yakovlev", "Vladislav S.", ""], ["Pfeifer", "Thomas", ""], ["Loh", "Zhi-Heng", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.3183", "submitter": "Aniruddha Chakraborty", "authors": "Aniruddha Chakraborty", "title": "Curve Crossing Problem with Arbitrary Coupling: Analytically Solvable\n  Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mol.

Our second result is to relate this programming model to relational\nprogramming, e.g., a pure version of Prolog over finite relations. Surprisingly\ndiscrete quantum computing is identical to conventional logic programming\nexcept for a small twist that is responsible for all the ``quantum-ness.'' The\ntwist occurs when merging sets of answers computed by several alternatives: the\nanswers are combined using an \"exclusive\" version of logical disjunction. In\nother words, the two branches of a choice junction exhibit an \"interference\"\neffect: an answer is produced from the junction if it occurs in one or the\nother branch but not both.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Jan 2011 20:06:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["James", "Roshan P.", ""], ["Ortiz", "Gerardo", ""], ["Sabry", "Amr", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.3766", "submitter": "Chin-wen Chou", "authors": "C.

In this work, we propose a\nmethodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to\ndetect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The\nmethodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed\nas 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible\nlogic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the\noriginal inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits\ncan be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in\nreversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology\nresults in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder\nthat can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is\nillustrated as the application of the proposed scheme.

Decoherence of a quantum superposition state arises from the\ninteraction between the constituent system and the uncontrolled degrees of\nfreedom in its environment. Within the standard Bloch-Redfield picture of\ntwo-level system dynamics, qubit decoherence is characterized by two rates: a\nlongitudinal relaxation rate Gamma1 due to the exchange of energy with the\nenvironment, and a transverse relaxation rate Gamma2 = Gamma1/2 + Gamma_phi\nwhich contains the pure dephasing rate Gamma_phi. Irreversible energy\nrelaxation can only be mitigated by reducing the amount of environmental noise,\nreducing the qubit's internal sensitivity to that noise, or through multi-qubit\nencoding and error correction protocols (which already presume ultra-low error\nrates). In contrast, dephasing is in principle reversible and can be refocused\ndynamically through the application of coherent control pulse methods. In this\nwork we demonstrate how dynamical-decoupling techniques can moderate the\ndephasing effects of low-frequency noise on a superconducting qubit with\nenergy-relaxation time T1 = 1/Gamma1 = 12 us.

The idea is to replace a\nHamiltonian $H$ for which analytical solutions are not known by another one\n$\\tilde H$, including one or more auxiliary fields. For instance, a potential\n$V(r)$ not solvable is replaced by another one $P(r)$ more familiar, or a\nsemirelativistic kinetic part is replaced by an equivalent nonrelativistic one.\nThe approximation comes from the replacement of the auxiliary fields by pure\nreal constants. The approximant solutions for $H$, eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions, are then obtained by the solutions of $\\tilde H$ in which the\nauxiliary parameters are eliminated by an extremization procedure for the\neigenenergies. If $H=T(\\bm p)+V(r)$ and if $P(r)$ is a power law, the\napproximate eigenvalues can be written $T(p_0)+V(r_0)$, where the mean\nimpulsion $p_0$ is a function of the mean distance $r_0$ and where $r_0$ is\ndetermined by an equation which is linked to the generalized virial theorem.\nThe general properties of the method are studied and the connections with the\nenvelope theory presented. This method is first applied to nonrelativistic and\nsemirelativistic two-body systems, with a great variety of potentials. Closed\nformulae are produced for energies, eigenstates, various observables and\ncritical constants, with sometimes a very good accuracy.

For such cases, analytical solutions can\nonly be obtained for systems of identical particles, but several systems of\ninterest for atomic and hadronic physics are studied.

Quantum light pulses feature an inherent, rich spectral\nbroadband-mode structure. In recent years, exploring the use of integrated\noptics as well as source-engineering has led to a deep understanding of the\npulse-mode structure of guided quantum states of light. In addition, several\ngroups have started to investigate the manipulation of quantum states by means\nof single-photon frequency conversion. In this paper we explore new routes\ntowards complete control of the inherent pulse-modes of ultrafast pulsed\nquantum states by employing specifically designed nonlinear waveguides with\nadapted dispersion properties. Starting from our recently proposed quantum\npulse gate (QPG) we further generalize the concept of spatio-spectral\nengineering for arbitrary $\\chitwo$-based quantum processes. We analyse the\nsum-frequency generation based QPG and introduce the difference-frequency\ngeneration based quantum pulse shaper (QPS). Together, these versatile and\nrobust integrated optics devices allow for arbitrary manipulations of the\npulse-mode structure of ultrafast pulsed quantum states. The QPG can be\nutilized to select an arbitrary pulse mode from a multimode input state,\nwhereas the QPS enables the generation of specific pulse modes from an input\nwavepacket with Gaussian-shaped spectrum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jan 2011 19:55:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 09:24:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Brecht", "Benjamin", ""], ["Eckstein", "Andreas", ""], ["Christ", "Andreas", ""], ["Suche", "Hubertus", ""], ["Silberhorn", "Christine", ""]]}]
