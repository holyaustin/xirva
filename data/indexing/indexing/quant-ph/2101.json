Additionally, we show that\nFaraday's and Ampere's law may be derived from the time rate of change of the\nAharanov-Bohm phase and the DAB phase respectively, independent of the\nelectromagnetic gauge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2020 01:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2021 23:24:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:22:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Tobar", "Michael E.", ""], ["Chiao", "Raymond Y.", ""], ["Goryachev", "Maxim", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00952", "submitter": "Juan Sebastian Ardenghi", "authors": "Villarreal Julian, Escudero Federico, Ardenghi Juan Sebastian and\n  Jasen Paula", "title": "Effect of an external electric field on local magnetic moments in\n  silicene", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, 524, 167598 (2021)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmmm.2020.167598", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we analyze the effects of the application of an external\nelectric field in the formation of a local magnetic moment in silicene.

However, there is\nno general ready-made approach to the design of efficient control strategies.\nHere, we propose a framework for the automated design of control schemes based\non differentiable programming ($\\partial \\mathrm{P}$). We apply this approach\nto the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit subjected to homodyne\ndetection. To this end, we formulate the control task as an optimization\nproblem where the loss function quantifies the distance from the target state,\nand we employ neural networks (NNs) as controllers. The system's time evolution\nis governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient\ntraining, we backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function\nthrough the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example,\nwe feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods of\nobtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the homodyne\ndetection signal to the controller. The instantaneous value of the homodyne\ncurrent contains only very limited information on the actual state of the\nsystem, masked by unavoidable photon-number fluctuations. Despite the resulting\npoor signal-to-noise ratio, we can train our controller to prepare and\nstabilize the qubit to a target state with a mean fidelity of around 85%. We\nalso compare the solutions found by the NN to a hand-crafted control strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2021 19:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Apr 2021 16:23:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00e4fer", "Frank", ""], ["Sekatski", "Pavel", ""], ["Koppenh\u00f6fer", "Martin", ""], ["Bruder", "Christoph", ""], ["Kloc", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.01223", "submitter": "Lat\\'evi Mohamed Lawson", "authors": "Lat\\'evi Mohamed Lawson, Ibrahim Nonkan\\'e and Komi Sodoga", "title": "The damped harmonic oscillator at the classical limit of the Snyder-de\n  Sitter space", "comments": "10", "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematics Research 13, 2 (2021)", "doi": "10.5539/jmr.v13n2p1", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Valtancoli in his paper entitled [P.

A diamagnetic effect, a force that does not cancel between mass-on and\nmass-off measurement, is challenging balance maker's assumptions of symmetry at\nlevels that are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the reported\nuncertainties. The diamagnetic effect, if it exists, shows up in weighing mode\nwithout a readily apparent reciprocal effect in the velocity mode, begging\nquestions about systematic errors at the very foundation of the new measurement\nsystem. The hypothetical force is caused by the coil current changing the\nmagnetic field, producing an unaccounted force that is systematically modulated\nwith the weighing current. Here we show that this diamagnetic force exists, but\nthe additional force does not change the equivalence between weighing and\nvelocity measurements. We reveal the unexpected way that symmetry is preserved\nand show that for typical materials and geometries the total relative effect on\nthe measurement is $\\approx 1\\times10^{-9}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2021 14:55:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Shisong", ""], ["Schlamminger", "Stephan", ""], ["Marangoni", "Rafael", ""], ["Wang", "Qing", ""], ["Haddad", "Darine", ""], ["Seifert", "Frank", ""], ["Chao", "Leon", ""], ["Newell", "David", ""], ["Zhao", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.02109", "submitter": "Konstantinos Georgopoulos", "authors": "Konstantinos Georgopoulos, Clive Emary, Paolo Zuliani", "title": "Modelling and Simulating the Noisy Behaviour of Near-term Quantum\n  Computers", "comments": "13 pages; 5 figures; changes for journal submission", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Noise dominates every aspect of near-term quantum computers, rendering it\nexceedingly difficult to carry out even small computations.

Characterization of the\nmodel is done efficiently using Diagonal Detector Overlapping Tomography -- a\ngeneralization of the recently introduced Quantum Overlapping Tomography to the\nproblem of reconstruction of readout noise with restricted locality. The\nprocedure allows to characterize $k$-local measurement cross-talk on $N$-qubit\ndevice using $O(k2^klog(N))$ circuits containing random combinations of X and\nidentity gates. We perform experiments on 15 (23) qubits using IBM's\n(Rigetti's) devices to test both the noise model and the error-mitigation\nscheme, and obtain an average reduction of errors by a factor $>22$ ($>5.5$)\ncompared to no mitigation. Interestingly, we find that correlations in the\nmeasurement noise do not correspond to the physical layout of the device.\nFurthermore, we study numerically the effects of readout noise on the\nperformance of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We\nobserve in simulations that for numerous objective Hamiltonians, including\nrandom MAX-2-SAT instances and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the\nnoise-mitigation improves the quality of the optimization. Finally, we provide\narguments why in the course of QAOA optimization the estimates of the local\nenergy (or cost) terms often behave like uncorrelated variables, which greatly\nreduces sampling complexity of the energy estimation compared to the\npessimistic error analysis. We also show that similar effects are expected for\nHaar-random quantum states and states generated by shallow-depth random\ncircuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 02:19:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Feb 2021 16:22:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 17:58:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Maciejewski", "Filip B.", ""], ["Baccari", "Flavio", ""], ["Zimbor\u00e1s", "Zolt\u00e1n", ""], ["Oszmaniec", "Micha\u0142", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.02360", "submitter": "Touheed Anwar Atif", "authors": "Touheed Anwar Atif and S.

IPA implements the power\niteration method in quantics tensor train (QTT) representations. Analogous to\nthe imaginary time propagation method with infinite mass, IPA starts with an\ninitial probability distribution and iteratively applies the recurrence\nrelation $\\rho_{k+1}({\\bf x})=U({\\bf x})\\rho_k({\\bf x})/\\|U\\rho_k\\|_{L^1}$,\nwhere $U({\\bf x})=e^{-V({\\bf x})}$ is defined in terms of the potential energy\nsurface (PES) $V({\\bf x})$. Upon convergence, the probability distribution\nbecomes a delta function, so the global minimum can be obtained as the position\nexpectation value. QTT representations are generated by fast adaptive\ninterpolation of multidimensional arrays to bypass the curse of dimensionality\nand the need to evaluate $V({\\bf x})$ for all possible ${\\bf x}$. We illustrate\nthe capabilities of IPA for global search optimization of two multidimensional\nPESs, including a differentiable model PES of a DNA chain and a discrete\nnon-differentiable PES, $V(p)=\\text{mod}(N,p)$, that resolves the prime factors\nof an integer $N$, with $p$ in the space of prime numbers folded as a\n$d$-dimensional $2_1 \\times 2_2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2_d$ tensor.

It introduces the notion of a logic of the mind, where\nneurophysiological data are encoded as logical expressions representing mental\nactivity. Effective logical expressions are likely to be extensive, involving\ndozens of variables. Large expressions require considerable computational power\nto be processed. This is problematic for BCI applications because they require\nfast reaction times to execute sequences of commands. Quantum computers hold\nmuch promise in terms of processing speed for some problems, including those\ninvolving logical expressions. Hence, we propose to use quantum computers to\nprocess the logic of the mind. The chapter begins with an introduction to BCI\nand the electroencephalogram, which is the neurophysiological signal that is\nnormally used in BCI. Then, it briefly discusses how the EEG corresponds to\nmental states, followed by an introduction to the logic of the mind. After\nthat, there is an overview of quantum computing, focusing on the basics deemed\nnecessary to understand how it processes logical expressions. An example of a\nBCI system is presented. In a nutshell, the system reads the EEG and builds\nlogical expressions, which are sent to a quantum computer to solve them. In\nturn, the system converts the results into sounds by means of a bespoke\nsynthesiser. Essentially, the BCI here is a musical instrument controlled by\nthe mind of the player. Our BCI is a proof-of-concept aimed at demonstrating\nhow quantum computing may support the development of sophisticated BCI systems.\nThe remaining of the chapter is devoted to technical and practical\nconsiderations on the limitations of current quantum computing hardware\ntechnology and scalability of the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:36:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Jan 2021 17:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Miranda", "Eduardo Reck", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03922", "submitter": "Rahul Ghosh", "authors": "Bijan Bagchi and Rahul Ghosh", "title": "Dirac Hamiltonian in a supersymmetric framework", "comments": "To be published in J.

Although there is quite a persuasive\nbody of evidence for this conjecture, there are some gaps: there exists a set\nof exceptional subfactors with no known counterpart CFT. Hence, it is necessary\nto develop new techniques for building a CFT from a subfactor. Here, it is\nuseful to study the underlying mathematical structure in more detail: The even\nparts of every subfactor give rise to two Unitary Fusion Categories (UFCs), and\nit is a promising direction to study quantum spin systems constructed from\nthese categories to find a connection to CFTs. The simplest example that\nrequires new techniques for building a CFT is the Haagerup subfactor, since it\nis the smallest subfactor with index larger than 4. In this thesis, we\ninvestigate the question whether there is a CFT corresponding to the Haagerup\nsubfactor via lattice models in one and two dimensions.

While their creation in light has become a standard\ntechnique, the production of squeezed states of the collective excitations in\ngases of ultracold atoms, the phonons of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), is a\ncomparably recent problem. This task is continuously gaining relevance with a\ngrowing number of proposals for BEC-based quantum metrological devices and the\npossibility to apply them in the detection of gravitational waves. The\nobjective of this thesis is to find whether the recently described effect of an\noscillating external potential on a uniform BEC can be exploited to generate\ntwo-mode squeezed phonon states, given present day technology. This question\nbrings together elements of a range of fields beyond cold atoms, such as\ngeneral relativity and Efimov physics. To answer it, the full transformation\ncaused by the oscillating potential on an initially thermal phononic state is\nconsidered, allowing to find an upper bound for the magnitude of this\nperturbation as well as to quantify the quality of the final state with respect\nto its use in metrology. These findings are then applied to existing\nexperiments to judge the feasibility of the squeezing scheme and while the\nresults indicate that they are not well suited for it, a setup is proposed that\nallows for its efficient implementation and seems within experimental reach. In\nview of the vast parameter space leaving room for optimization, the considered\nmechanism could find applications not only in the gravitational wave detector\nthat originally motivated this work, but more generally in the field of quantum\nmetrology based on ultracold atoms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2021 13:01:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Juschitz", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.05089", "submitter": "Andrij Kuzmak", "authors": "A.R.

These quantum\nphenomena, in turn, have the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate,\ncompute and probe the nanoscale world. Here, we review developments in key\nareas of quantum research in light of the nanotechnologies that enable them,\nwith a view to what the future holds. Materials and devices with nanoscale\nfeatures are used for quantum metrology and sensing, as building blocks for\nquantum computing, and as sources and detectors for quantum communication. They\nenable explorations of quantum behaviour and unconventional states in nano- and\nopto-mechanical systems, low-dimensional systems, molecular devices,\nnano-plasmonics, quantum electrodynamics, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and\nmore. This rapidly expanding intersection of nanotechnology and quantum\nscience/technology is mutually beneficial to both fields, laying claim to some\nof the most exciting scientific leaps of the last decade, with more on the\nhorizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 22:27:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Laucht", "Arne", ""], ["Hohls", "Frank", ""], ["Ubbelohde", "Niels", ""], ["Gonzalez-Zalba", "M Fernando", ""], ["Reilly", "David J", ""], ["Stobbe", "S\u00f8ren", ""], ["Schr\u00f6der", "Tim", ""], ["Scarlino", "Pasquale", ""], ["Koski", "Jonne V", ""], ["Dzurak", "Andrew", ""], ["Yang", "Chih-Hwan", ""], ["Yoneda", "Jun", ""], ["Kuemmeth", "Ferdinand", ""], ["Bluhm", "Hendrik", ""], ["Pla", "Jarryd", ""], ["Hill", "Charles", ""], ["Salfi", "Joe", ""], ["Oiwa", "Akira", ""], ["Muhonen", "Juha T", ""], ["Verhagen", "Ewold", ""], ["LaHaye", "Matthew D", ""], ["Kim", "Hyun Ho", ""], ["Tsen", "Adam W", ""], ["Culcer", "Dimitrie", ""], ["Geresdi", "Attila", ""], ["Mol", "Jan A", ""], ["Mohan", "Varun", ""], ["Jain", "Prashant K", ""], ["Baugh", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.07887", "submitter": "Yunseong Nam", "authors": "Reinhold Bl\\\"umel, Nikodem Grzesiak, Nhung H.

First, using\nthe positive frequency Wightman function from the Minkowski modes with a\nRindler transformation we provide the transition probabilities for the\ntransitions from maximally entangled symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states\nto the collective excited state in $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensions. We observe a\npossible case of \\emph{anti-Unruh-like} event in these transition\nprobabilities, though the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensional results are not\ncompletely equivalent. We infer that thermal bath plays a major role in the\noccurrence of the anti-Unruh-like effect, as it is also present in the\ntransition probabilities corresponding to a single detector in this case.\nSecond, we have considered the Green's functions in terms of the Rindler modes\nwith the vacuum of Unruh modes for estimating the same. Here the anti-Unruh\neffect appears only for the transition from the anti-symmetric state to the\ncollective excited state. It is noticed that here the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$\ndimensional results are equivalent, and for a single detector, we do not\nobserve any anti-Unruh effect. This suggests that the entanglement between the\nstates of the atoms is the main cause for the observed anti-Unruh effect in\nthis case.

In any concrete scenario,\nreference frames are associated to physical systems, which are ultimately\nquantum in nature. A relativistic description of the laws of physics hence\nneeds to take into account such quantum reference frames (QRFs), through which\nspacetime can be given an operational meaning. Here, we introduce the notion of\na spacetime QRF, associated to a quantum particle in spacetime. Such\nformulation has the advantage of treating space and time on equal footing, and\nof describing the dynamical evolution of a set of quantum systems from the\nperspective of another quantum system, where the evolution parameter coincides\nwith the proper time of the particle taken as the QRF. Crucially, the proper\ntimes in two different QRFs are not related by a standard transformation, but\nthey might be in a quantum superposition. Concretely, we consider N\nrelativistic quantum particles in a weak gravitational field and introduce a\ntimeless formulation in which the global state of the N particles appears\n\"frozen\", but the dynamical evolution is recovered in terms of relational\nquantities.

Such transitions take the system out of\nits ground state and stabilize a higher-energy stationary state, rendering it\nthe sole attractor of the dissipative dynamics. In this work, we present a\nunifying methodology, which we use to characterize this ubiquitous\nphenomenology and its implications for the open system dynamics. Specifically,\nwe analyze the closed system's phase diagram, including symmetry-broken phases,\nand explore their corresponding excitations' spectra. Opening the system, the\nenvironment can overwhelm the system's symmetry-breaking tendencies, and\nchanges its order parameter. As a result, isolated distinct phases of similar\norder become connected, and new phase-costability regions appear.\nInterestingly, the excitations differ in the newly-connected regions through a\nchange in their symplectic norm, which is robust to the introduction of\ndissipation. As a result, by tuning the system from one phase to the other\nacross the dissipation-stabilized region, the open system fluctuations exhibit\nan exceptional point-like scenario, where the fluctuations become overdamped,\nonly to reappear with an opposite sign in the dynamical response function of\nthe system. The overdamped region is also associated with squeezing of the\nfluctuations. We demonstrate the pervasive nature of such dissipation-induced\nphenomena in two prominent examples, namely in parametric resonators and in\nlight-matter systems.

The valley degree of freedom originates from the bulk\nbandstructure of silicon, which has six degenerate electronic minima. The\ndegeneracy can be lifted in silicon quantum wells due to strain and electronic\nconfinement, but the \"valley splitting\" of the two lowest lying valleys is\nknown to be sensitive to atomic-scale disorder. Large valley splittings are\ndesirable to have a well-defined spin qubit.

Here we use microwave spectroscopy to probe spatial\nvariations in the valley splitting, and the intra- and inter-valley tunnel\ncouplings ($t_{ij}$ and $t'_{ij}$) that couple dots $i$ and $j$ in a triple\nquantum dot (TQD). We uncover large spatial variations in the ratio of\ninter-valley to intra-valley tunnel couplings $t_{12}'/t_{12}=0.90$ and\n$t_{23}'/t_{23}=0.56$. By tuning the interdot tunnel barrier we also show that\n$t'_{ij}$ scales linearly with $t_{ij}$, as expected from theory.
