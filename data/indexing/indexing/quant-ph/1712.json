Doing so assigns a conditional\nstate to the rest of the Universe $|\\psi_S(t)\\rangle$, referred to as the\nsystem.

Given that the\nobservers are stationary and space-like separated, each observer is privy to\ndifferent information along their shared equi-temporal lines due to\npermutations in the order they observe events. Therefore, each observer is\ninclined to assign different probability distributions to the same set of\npropositions due to these informational differences.

Here, we address this dichotomy\nfrom a Newtonian perspective of the dynamics of the center of mass of a\nmany-body system, which was found to impose constraints on the time evolution.\nWe demonstrate that despite the time symmetric behavior of the microscopic\nconstituents of the system, in many typical cases the external conditions lead\nnaturally to the unidirectional macroscopic time evolution, independent of the\ninternal interactions and how far the system is from equilibrium.

However, here I\nargue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in\nsome contexts. Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around\nphysics that can arguably be addressed in a substantially more consistent and\nrigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person perspective\nis ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These\nare questions like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future\nexperiences if she is told that she will be simulated on a computer? How should\nwe think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and what can we learn from the\nfact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal\npreexisting properties? Why are there simple computable laws of physics in the\nfirst place? This note summarizes a longer companion paper which constructs a\nmathematically rigorous theory along those lines, suggesting a simple and\nunified framework (rooted in algorithmic information theory) to address\nquestions like those above. It is not meant as a \"theory of everything\" (in\nfact, it predicts its own limitations), but it shows how a notion of objective\nexternal world, looking very much like our own, can provably emerge from a\nstarting point in which the first-person perspective is primary, without\napriori assumptions on the existence of \"laws\" or a \"physical world\".

Moreover, we show that two connected graphs $X$ and $Y$ are quantum\nisomorphic if and only if there exists $x \\in V(X)$ and $y \\in V(Y)$ that are\nin the same orbit of the quantum automorphism group of the disjoint union of\n$X$ and $Y$.

In particular, we show that asymptotically almost surely all\ngraphs have trivial quantum automorphism group. Furthermore, we use examples of\nquantum isomorphic graphs from previous work to construct an infinite family of\ngraphs which are quantum vertex transitive but fail to be vertex transitive,\nanswering a question from the quantum group literature.\n  Our main tool for proving these results is the introduction of orbits and\norbitals (orbits on ordered pairs) of quantum permutation groups.

Furthermore, as argued below, several\nother conceptual puzzles in the foundations of physics and related fields point\nto limitations of our current perspective and motivate the exploration of an\nalternative: to start with the first-person (the observer) rather than the\nthird-person perspective (the world).

In contrast to the\nstandard view, objective reality is not assumed on this approach but rather\nprovably emerges as an asymptotic statistical phenomenon.

We study a single hole described by the t-Jz\nmodel with Ising interactions between the spins in 2D. This situation can be\nexperimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes.

An important challenge is the physical\nlimitation imposed by the photonic bath, constraining the types of local\nHamiltonians that decompose the available physical models and restricting the\nspatial dimensions to that of the dielectric media.

Here, we formulate a quantum optics\ntoolbox for constructing a universal quantum matter with individual atoms in\nthe vicinity of 1D photonic crystal waveguides. The enabling platform\nsynthesizes analog quantum materials of universal $2$-local Hamiltonian graphs\nmediated by phononic superfluids of the trapped atoms.

Such processes form the basis of the study of\ncausal modelling across the sciences, including in the quantum domain. To date,\nthese frameworks have lacked a conceptual underpinning similar to that provided\nby Kolmogorov's theorem for classical stochastic processes.

A key exchange protocol is proposed where\nsymmetric private keys are granted to hosts while satisfying the scalability\nneeds of an enterprise population of users. The key management service operates\nwithin a layered architectural style that is able to interoperate with various\nunderlying QKD implementations. Variable levels of security for the host\npopulation are enforced through a policy engine. A network layer provides key\ngeneration across a network of nodes connected by quantum links.

The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input\nbits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing\ncounterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay\nare reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR\ngate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based\non the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode\nand correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and\ncorrection, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is\nalways converted using a binary to BCD converter.

In contrast, some exactly solvable models\nshowcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small\nnon-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean\nthat a part may contain more information about the global temperature than the\nwhole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove\nthat local quantum thermometry at low $T$ is exponentially inefficient in\nnon-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we\nshow through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a\nharmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by\nmeans of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like\nbehavior as $T \\rightarrow 0$. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the\nfact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature\nmeasurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped\ntranslationally invariant chain (for which low--$T$ thermometry is indeed\nexponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the\nlow-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a\ngapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample\ninteraction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In\nthis way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in\ntypical dissipative models stems from the fact that these are gapless and, as\nsuch, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped\ncounterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the\nultimate limitations of low--$T$ thermometry, is thus whether or not their\nenergy spectrum is gapped.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Dec 2017 14:32:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jan 2018 16:47:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:39:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hovhannisyan", "Karen V.", ""], ["Correa", "Luis A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03117", "submitter": "Pieter W.

Here, the Hamiltonian\n$H^{\\epsilon}_{\\text{Rabi}}$ of the AQRM is defined by adding the fluctuation\nterm $\\epsilon \\sigma_x$, with $\\sigma_x$ being the Pauli matrix, to the\nHamiltonian of the quantum Rabi model, breaking its $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry.\nThe spectrum of $H^{\\epsilon}_{\\text{Rabi}}$ contains a set of exceptional\neigenvalues, considered to be remains of the eigenvalues of the uncoupled\nbosonic mode, which are further classified in two types: Juddian, associated\nwith polynomial eigensolutions, and non-Juddian exceptional. We explicitly\ndescribe the constraint relations for allowing the model to have exceptional\neigenvalues. By studying these relations we obtain the proof of the conjecture\non constraint polynomials previously proposed by the third author. In fact, we\nprove that the spectrum of the AQRM possesses degeneracies if and only if the\nparameter $\\epsilon$ is a half-integer.

Instead here, we quantify the accuracy of the AIA via the trace\nnorm distance with respect to the exact evolved state. As expected, we find\nthat for short times/fast protocols, the AIA outperforms the simple adiabatic\napproximation. However, for large times/slow protocols, the situation is\nactually reversed and the AIA provides a worse approximation. Nevertheless, we\nfound a variation of the AIA that can perform better than the adiabatic one.\nThis counter-intuitive modification consists in crossing twice the region of\nsmall gap. Our findings are illustrated by several examples of driven closed\nand open quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 19:57:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tomka", "Michael", ""], ["Venuti", "Lorenzo Campos", ""], ["Zanardi", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04511", "submitter": "Kevin Slagle", "authors": "Kevin Slagle, Yong Baek Kim", "title": "X-Cube Fracton Model on Generic Lattices: Phases and Geometric Order", "comments": "9+3 pages, 11+2 figures; published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In\nthis paper, we present a generic lattice construction (in three dimensions) for\na generalized X-cube model of fracton order, where the mobility restrictions of\nthe subdimensional particles inherit the geometry of the lattice. This helps\nexplain a previous result that lattice curvature can produce a robust GSD, even\non a manifold with trivial topology. We provide explicit examples to show that\nthe (zero temperature) phase of matter is sensitive to the lattice geometry. In\none example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small\nloops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting\nphase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code. However, the phase is\nsensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different lattices without\ncurvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different\nphases of matter, which are separated by phase transitions. Unintuitively\nhowever, according to a previous definition of phase [Chen, Gu, Wen 2010], even\njust a rotated or rescaled cubic lattice results in different phases of matter,\nwhich motivates us to propose a new and coarser definition of phase for gapped\nground states and fracton order. The new equivalence relation between ground\nstates is given by the composition of a local unitary transformation and a\nquasi-isometry (which can rotate and rescale the lattice); equivalently, ground\nstates are in the same phase if they can be adiabatically connected by varying\nboth the Hamiltonian and the positions of the degrees of freedom (via a\nquasi-isometry). In light of the importance of geometry, we further propose\nthat fracton orders should be regarded as a geometric order.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 20:55:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Jan 2018 17:33:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 16:18:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Slagle", "Kevin", ""], ["Kim", "Yong Baek", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04521", "submitter": "Nicholas Rivera", "authors": "Rumen Dangovski, Nicholas Rivera, Marin Soljacic, Ido Kaminer", "title": "Shaping Long-lived Electron Wavepackets for Customizable Optical Spectra", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electrons in atoms and molecules are versatile physical systems covering a\nvast range of light-matter interactions, enabling the physics of Rydberg\nstates, photon-photon bound states, simulation of condensed matter\nHamiltonians, and quantum sources of light.

IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as\nevidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide\naccess to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct\nquantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit\nquantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions\nof these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5,\nrespectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the\ndesired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has\nto be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied\n- a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently\nconduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which\naddresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a\nrealization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at\nthe same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum\ngates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured\nfor similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK.\nExperimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms\nIBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed\napproach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while\nIBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in\nseveral cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped\ncircuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required).

By\nreplacing all gates in these circuits with \"virtual\" dynamically corrected\ngates (DCGs), we demonstrate that even in the presence of strongly correlated\nnoise the signatures of error correlations between sequential gates appear\nsimilar to standard gates exposed to uncorrelated noise. A theoretical model\napplied to our experiments reveals that common DCGs suppress the correlated\nerror component by over $270\\times$ with $95\\%$ confidence. Using\nblock-correlated noise, we explore the scaling of the effective error\ncorrelation length at the virtual level, and show that DCGs exhibit error\ncorrelations indistinguishable from those arising from uncorrelated noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Edmunds", "C.

We\nalso show up to what depth the sampling, or estimation of observables, is\ntrivially parallelizable. The algorithm is related to the \"Feynmann path\"\nmethod to simulate quantum circuits. For low-depth circuits, the algorithm\nscales exponentially in the depth times the smaller lateral dimension, or the\ntreewidth, as explained in Boixo et. al., and therefore confirms the bounds in\nthat paper. In particular, circuits with $7 \\times 7$ qubits and depth 40\nremain currently out of reach. Follow up work on a supercomputer environment\nwill tighten this bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Dec 2017 18:35:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Jan 2018 19:53:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Boixo", "Sergio", ""], ["Isakov", "Sergei V.", ""], ["Smelyanskiy", "Vadim N.", ""], ["Neven", "Hartmut", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.05398", "submitter": "Francesco Romeo", "authors": "F.

Although a significant\nnumber of $5d6s$ electrons, some several eV below the Fermi level, are excited\nout of the Fermi sea, there is no change in the $4f$ states, a clear\nmanifestation of intra-atomic exchange coupling.

We investigate two different states of motion for the atoms, namely\nstatic atoms and also stationary atoms with zero angular momentum. The purpose\nof this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming\nfrom the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the\nHawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the\nscenario of rotating black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is\nsignificantly modified due to the phenomenon of superradiance in comparison\nwith the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In the perspective of a\nzero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), one is allowed to probe entanglement\ndynamics inside the ergosphere, since static observers cannot exist within such\na region. On the other hand, the presence of superradiant modes could be a\nsource for violation of complete positivity. This is verified when the quantum\nfield is prepared in the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state. In this exceptional\nsituation, we raise the possibility that the loss of complete positivity is due\nto the breakdown of the Markovian approximation, which means that any arbitrary\nphysically admissible initial state of the two atoms would not be capable to\nhold, with time evolution, its interpretation as a physical state inasmuch as\nnegative probabilities are generated by the dynamical map.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:08:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2018 02:46:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Menezes", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.07178", "submitter": "Dmitry Savin", "authors": "D.

We here present a quantum secret sharing protocol\non an $N$-qubit state close to a pure $N$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\nstate. In our protocol, $N$ players use an inequality derived from the Mermin\ninequality to check secure correlation of classical key bits for secret\nsharing.

A natural\nquestion is what is the source of this excess spin polarization because\nrelaxation mechanisms can flip a up spin to a down spin and vice-versa. The\nanswer lies in the density of states. When a molecule with spin down flips to\nspin up it loses energy. This energy goes into increasing the kinetic energy of\nthe molecule in the gas/solution phase. At this increased kinetic energy, there\nare more rotational-translational states accessible to the molecule than at\nlower energy. This increases the probability the molecule will spend in spin up\nstate (higher kinetic energy state). This is the source of excess polarization.\nIn this paper, we use an argument based on equipartition of energy to\nexplicitly count the excess states that become accessible to the molecule when\nits spin is flipped from down to up.

At its heart\nis the statement that the space of operators that commute with the tensor\npowers of all unitaries is spanned by the permutations of the tensor factors.\nIn this work, we describe a similar duality theory for tensor powers of\nClifford unitaries. The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of\nquantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The\nduality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite\ngeometries.

We provide corresponding de Finetti theorems, showing that the\nreductions of arbitrary states with this symmetry are well-approximated by\nmixtures of stabilizer tensor powers (in some cases, exponentially well).\n  (3) We show that the distance of a pure state to the set of stabilizers can\nbe lower-bounded in terms of the sum-negativity of its Wigner function.

Here, we introduce incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures on\nbipartite systems, which can characterize the correlations between systems.\nAccording to the IQ coherence measures on bipartite systems, we find the\ndistribution of coherence of formation and assistance in bipartite systems: the\ntotal coherence of formation is lower bounded by the sum of coherence of\nformation in each subsystem and the entanglement of formation between the\nsubsystems, while the total coherence of assistance is upper bounded by the sum\nof coherence of assistance in each subsystem and the entanglement of assistance\nbetween subsystems. Besides, we also obtain the tradeoff relation between the\ncoherence cost and entanglement cost, distillable coherence and distillable\nentanglement in bipartite systems. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced\nhere truly capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems and reveal the\ndistribution of coherence in bipartite systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Dec 2017 03:15:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bu", "Kaifeng", ""], ["Li", "Lu", ""], ["Fei", "Shao-Ming", ""], ["Wu", "Junde", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.09174", "submitter": "Alonso Botero", "authors": "Alonso Botero and Jos\\'e Mej\\'ia", "title": "Universal and distorsion-free entanglement concentration of multiqubit\n  quantum states in the W class", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures.

This is in contrast to, e.g., results on self-testing of\nhigh dimensional entanglement, which are only relevant when the noise rate goes\nto zero with the system's size $n$. As a corollary of our result, we supply a\nlower-bound on the entanglement cost of any state achieving a quantum advantage\nin a bipartite non-local game.

Realistic sources are inherently noisy, cannot\nrun for an infinitely long time, and do not necessarily behave in an\nindependent and identically distributed manner. An important question then\narises -- how can one test, or certify, that a realistic source produces high\namounts of entanglement? Crucially, a meaningful and operational solution\nshould allow us to certify the entanglement which is available for further\napplications after performing the test itself (in contrast to assuming the\navailability of an additional source which can produce more entangled states,\nidentical to those which were tested). To answer the above question and lower\nbound the amount of entanglement produced by an uncharacterised source, we\npresent a protocol that can be run by interacting classically with\nuncharacterised (but not entangled to one another) measurement devices used to\nmeasure the states produced by the source. A successful run of the protocol\nimplies that the remaining quantum state has high amounts of one-shot\ndistillable entanglement. That is, one can distill many maximally entangled\nstates out of the single remaining state.

Firstly, we consider\nan ideal channel and observe that our protocol enables decoding of a secret\n2-bit information with unit probability. This is accomplished by one of the\nsenders by the use of a globally operated \\textit{quantum teleportation\noperator}. Secondly, we implement the same protocol in a realistic scenario\nunder energy dissipation by the use of a parameterized \\textit{amplitude\ndamping channel} with variable noise. This noise is associated with energy\ndissipation and hence, loss of probability to distinguish and decode the\ninformation at the receiving end. Finally, we make this task possible through\nan optimization algorithm. Various channel \\textit{quality measures} are also\nquantitatively ascertained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 13:24:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Siddhant", ""], ["Srivastava", "Shivang", ""], ["Panigrahi", "Prasanta K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.10227", "submitter": "Shiladitya Mal", "authors": "Souradeep Sasmal, Debarshi Das, Shiladitya Mal, A.
