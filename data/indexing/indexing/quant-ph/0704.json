Our criterion applies to\n{\\it arbitrary} $N$-partite quantum states in\n$\\mathcal{H}=\\mathcal{H}^{d_1}\\otimes \\mathcal{H}^{d_2} \\otimes ... \\otimes\n\\mathcal{H}^{d_N}.$ The criterion can test whether a $N$-partite state is\nentangled and can be applied to different partitions of the $N$-partite system.\nWe provide examples that show the ability of this criterion to detect\nentanglement. We show that this criterion can detect bound entangled states. We\nprove a sufficiency condition for separability of a 3-partite state,\nstraightforwardly generalizable to the case $N > 3,$ under certain condition.\nWe also give a necessary and sufficient condition for separability of a class\nof $N$-qubit states which includes $N$-qubit PPT states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2007 13:59:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2007 15:44:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2007 10:14:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2007 10:44:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 13 Apr 2008 13:17:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "Ali Saif M.", ""], ["Joag", "Pramod S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3959", "submitter": "Eric Charron", "authors": "Naceur Gaaloul (PPM, LSAMA), Amine Jaouadi (PPM, LSAMA), Mourad\n  Telmini (LSAMA), Laurence Pruvost (LAC), Eric Charron (PPM)", "title": "Optical Devices for Cold Atoms and Bose-Einstein Condensates", "comments": "Proceedings of the International Spectroscopy Conference ISC-2007,\n  Sousse, Tunisia", "journal-ref": "AIP Conference Proceedings 935 (2007) 10", "doi": "10.1063/1.2795399", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  The manipulation of cold atoms with optical fields is a very promising\ntechnique for a variety of applications ranging from laser cooling and trapping\nto coherent atom transport and matter wave interferometry.

By this we mean that the initial configuration and the\nlocal transition rule of any one-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the\ninitial configuration of the universal QCA. Several steps of the universal QCA\nwill then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA. The simulation preserves\nthe topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a\ngroup of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. The encoding is linear and hence\ndoes not carry any of the cost of the computation. We do this in two flavours:\na weak one which requires an infinite but periodic initial configuration and a\nstrong one which needs only a finite initial configuration.
