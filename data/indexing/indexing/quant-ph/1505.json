This opens the door to novel many-body physics\nwith light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition\nobserved with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent\ntheoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic\ngauge fields and spin-orbit couplings have been successfully implemented with\nultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet\nperturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice\nsystems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose-Hubbard\nmodels in ladder and two-dimensional geometries. The Bose-Hubbard model is\nrelated to the Jaynes-Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit\nbetween light and matter. In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show\nthat Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 12:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 10:57:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hur", "Karyn Le", ""], ["Henriet", "Lo\u00efc", ""], ["Petrescu", "Alexandru", ""], ["Plekhanov", "Kirill", ""], ["Roux", "Guillaume", ""], ["Schir\u00f3", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.00173", "submitter": "Biswanath Rath", "authors": "Biswanath Rath", "title": "New approach on Supersymmetric Quantum Systems: Real and Complex\n  Hamiltonians", "comments": "No change - Title , previous theory,References,Introduction.: Minor\n  change -(i) four words only in abstract (ii) Four equations in shape\n  invariant potentials reflecting wave functions (iii)Major addition- A new\n  approach added o generate twins and quadruplets .

The latest proof\nof the SQL is analyzed to revleal an unsupported assumption on quantum\nmeasurements. Quantum measurement theory is introduced to give a general\ncriterion for physically realizable measurements in quantum mechanics. A theory\nof approximate position measurements is developed to obtain a rigorous\ncondition for the SQL and also to show that a precise position measurement can\nleave the object in an arbitrary family of states independent of the input\nstate. This concludes that Yuen's proposal of breaking the SQL by a contractive\nstate measurement, a measurement of the position leaving the free mass in a\nstate with the position uncertainty decreasing in time, is physically\nrealizable in principle. To enforce this conclusion, a model for error-free\nposition measurement that leaves the object in a contractive state is\nconstructed with a solvable Hamiltonian for measuring interaction.

We\nexperimentally show how this enhanced method can manifest quantum\nnon-Gaussianity of a state by simply choosing phase-space points appropriately,\nwhich is essentially equivalent to implementing a squeezing operation on a\ngiven state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2015 19:29:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2015 19:13:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Jiyong", ""], ["Zhang", "Junhua", ""], ["Lee", "Jaehak", ""], ["Ji", "Se-Wan", ""], ["Um", "Mark", ""], ["Lv", "Dingshun", ""], ["Kim", "Kihwan", ""], ["Nha", "Hyunchul", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.01480", "submitter": "Isaac Kim", "authors": "Isaac H.

We argue that\nthis worry can be straightforwardly avoided in the Many-Worlds (Everett)\napproach to quantum mechanics, as long as the underlying Hilbert space is\ninfinite-dimensional. In that case, de Sitter settles into a truly stationary\nquantum vacuum state. While there would be a nonzero probability for observing\nBoltzmann-Brain-like fluctuations in such a state, \"observation\" refers to a\nspecific kind of dynamical process that does not occur in the vacuum (which is,\nafter all, time-independent). Observers are necessarily out-of-equilibrium\nphysical systems, which are absent in the vacuum. Hence, the fact that\nprojection operators corresponding to states with observers in them do not\nannihilate the vacuum does not imply that such observers actually come into\nexistence.

The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum\ncryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol\nis secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these\nassumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may\nbreak the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent\non which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an\nimplementation of the protocol.\n  This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection\nbetween the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their\nexperimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key\ndistribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties.\nWe provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics\nusing the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key\ndistribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline\nseveral mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or\nsimplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in\nquantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in\nimplementations.\n  Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes\nquantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes.\nProtocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which\nkinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions\nare justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an\neavesdropper.

Many attempts to solve (or to dissolve) it have been made\nsince the inception of quantum mechanics. The form of these attempts depends on\nthe philosophical position that their authors endorse. I will review some of\nthem and analyze their relevance. The phenomenon of decoherence is often\npresented as a solution lying inside the pure quantum formalism and not\ndemanding any particular philosophical assumption. Nevertheless, a widely\ndebated question is to decide between two different interpretations. The first\none is to consider that the decoherence process has the effect to actually\nproject a superposed state into one of its classically interpretable component,\nhence doing the same job as the reduction postulate. For the second one,\ndecoherence is only a way to show why no macroscopic superposed state can be\nobserved, so explaining the classical appearance of the macroscopic world,\nwhile the quantum entanglement between the system, the apparatus and the\nenvironment never disappears. In this case, explaining why only one single\ndefinite outcome is observed remains to do. In this paper, I examine the\narguments that have been given for and against both interpretations and defend\na new position, the \"Convivial Solipsism\" , according to which the outcome that\nis observed is relative to the observer, different but in close parallel to the\nEverett's interpretation and sharing also some similarities with Rovelli's\nrelational interpretation and quantum bayesianism.

By varying the\nlevel splittings of individual qubits, $J_a$ and $J_b$, and the interqubit\ncoupling time $t$, we can find an infinite number of triples $(J_a, J_b, t)$\nfor which the two-qubit entanglement, in combination with appropriate\nsingle-qubit rotations, can produce an exact CNOT gate.

Such estimation\ntherefore tends to overrate the amount of leaked information in practice, leads\nto a fundamental threshold of the bit error rate. The threshold becomes a\nbottleneck of the development of practical QKD systems. In classical\ncommunication, according to Shannon's communication theory, information can\ntransform through a noisy channel even if the background noise is very strong\ncompare to the signal and hence the threshold of the bit error rate tends to\n50%. One might wonder whether a QKD scheme can also tolerate error rate as high\nas 50%. The question is answered affirmatively with the recent work of\nround-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol, which breaks through the\nfundamental threshold of the bit error rate and indicates another potential\ndirection in the field of quantum cryptography. The key challenge to realize\nthe RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a\nvariable-delay interferometer. The delay needs to be chosen from a set of\npredetermined values randomly. Such measurement can be realized by switching\nbetween many interferometers with different delays at a high speed in\naccordance with the system repetition rate. The more delay values can be chosen\nfrom, the higher error rate can be tolerated. By designing an optical system\nwith multiple switches and employing an active phase stabilization technology,\nwe successfully construct a variable-delay interferometer with 128 actively\nselectable delays. With this measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the\nRRDPS QKD protocol and obtain a final key rate of 15.54 bps via a total loss of\n18 dB and 8.9% error rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 18:48:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Yu-Huai", ""], ["Cao", "Yuan", ""], ["Dai", "Hui", ""], ["Lin", "Jin", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhen", ""], ["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Xu", "Yu", ""], ["Guan", "Jian-Yu", ""], ["Liao", "Sheng-Kai", ""], ["Yin", "Juan", ""], ["Zhang", "Qiang", ""], ["Ma", "Xiongfeng", ""], ["Peng", "Cheng-Zhi", ""], ["Pan", "Jian-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.08150", "submitter": "Spyros Sotiriadis", "authors": "Spyros Sotiriadis, Gabriele Martelloni", "title": "Equilibration and GGE in interacting-to-free Quantum Quenches in\n  dimensions d>1", "comments": "22 pages, published version with some additional results", "journal-ref": "J.

The argument hinges upon the fundamental physical\nprinciple of cluster decomposition, which is valid for the ground state of a\ngeneral QFT. An analogous result was already known to be valid in the case of\nd=1 spatial dimensions, where it is a special case of the so-called Generalised\nGibbs Ensemble (GGE) hypothesis, and we now generalise it to higher dimensions.\nMoreover in the case of massless free evolution, despite the fact that the\nevolution may not lead to equilibration but unbounded increase of correlations\nwith time instead, the GGE gives correctly the leading order asymptotic\nbehaviour of correlation functions in the thermodynamic and large time limit.\nThe demonstration is performed in the context of bosonic relativistic QFT, but\nthe arguments apply more generally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 19:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 16:46:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 14:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Sotiriadis", "Spyros", ""], ["Martelloni", "Gabriele", ""]]}]
