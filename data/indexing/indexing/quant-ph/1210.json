The Colella- Overhauser-Werner (COW) type of neutron\ninterferometer and the Kasevich-Chu (K-C) atom interferometer, are the\nprototype of such devices and the issue of whether they are sensitive to\nrelativistic effects has recently aroused much controversy. We examine the\nquestion of to what extent the gravitational red shift, and the related twin\nparadox effect can be seen in both of these atom and neutron interferometers.\nWe point out an asymmetry between the two types of devices. Because of this,\nthe non-vanishing, non-relativistic residue of both effects can be seen in the\nneutron interferometer, while in the K-C interferometer the effects cancel out,\nleaving no residue, although they could be present in other types of atom\ninterferometers. Also, the necessary shifting of the laser frequency (chirping)\nin the atom interferometer effectively changes the laboratory into a free-fall\nsystem, which could be exploited for other experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 18:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Greenberger", "Daniel M.", ""], ["Schleich", "Wolfgang P.", ""], ["Rasel", "Ernst M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.0013", "submitter": "Ferdinand Brennecke Dr.", "authors": "Helmut Ritsch, Peter Domokos, Ferdinand Brennecke and Tilman Esslinger", "title": "Cold atoms in cavity-generated dynamical optical potentials", "comments": "55 page review paper", "journal-ref": "Rev.

The optical dipole force on the atoms together with the\nback-action of atomic motion onto the light field gives rise to a complex\nnonlinear coupled dynamics. As the resonator constitutes an open driven and\ndamped system, the dynamics is non-conservative and in general enables cooling\nand confining the motion of polarizable particles. In addition, the emitted\ncavity field allows for real-time monitoring of the particle's position with\nminimal perturbation up to sub-wavelength accuracy. For many-body systems, the\nresonator field mediates controllable long-range atom-atom interactions, which\nset the stage for collective phenomena. Besides correlated motion of distant\nparticles, one finds critical behavior and non-equilibrium phase transitions\nbetween states of different atomic order in conjunction with superradiant light\nscattering. Quantum degenerate gases inside optical resonators can be used to\nemulate opto-mechanics as well as novel quantum phases like supersolids and\nspin glasses. Non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as predicted by e.g.\nthe Dicke Hamiltonian, can be controlled and explored in real-time via\nmonitoring the cavity field.

In college, we learned that there are much more than\nfour states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed\nby the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the\nphenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so\nrich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the\nsymmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress\nin last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more\ninteresting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss\nnew \"topological\" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the\nexistence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like\nzero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new \"topological\" phenomena\ndefine the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order,\ntopological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion\ncategory and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at\nmicroscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum\nentanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair\ncondensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent\nphenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian\nstatistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum\nentanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more\ngenerally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields)\nare fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are\ndefects of long-range entanglements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Oct 2012 02:56:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Oct 2012 00:59:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Wen", "Xiao-Gang", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.1282", "submitter": "Xiaosong Ma", "authors": "Xiao-Song Ma, Sebastian Kropatschek, William Naylor, Thomas Scheidl,\n  Johannes Kofler, Thomas Herbst, Anton Zeilinger, and Rupert Ursin", "title": "Experimental quantum teleportation over a high-loss free-space channel", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Optics Express, Vol. 20, Issue 21, pp. 23126-23137 (2012)", "doi": "10.1364/OE.20.023126", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a high-fidelity quantum teleportation experiment over a high-loss\nfree-space channel between two laboratories.

The\nkey point in our proof consists in exploiting a specific functional equation\nsatisfied by the generating function in conjunction with Cauchy's integral\nformula for the derivatives of a holomorphic function. Special or limiting\ncases of Gegenbauer polynomials include the Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials.\nThe series of Hermite polynomials is treated in a straightforward way, as well\nas an asymptotic case of either the Gegenbauer or the Laguerre series. Further,\nwe have succeeded in evaluating the sum of a similar power series which is a\nhigher-order derivative of Mehler's generating function. As a prerequisite, we\nhave used a convenient factorization of the latter that enabled us to employ a\nparticular Laguerre expansion. Mehler's summation formula is then applied in\nquantum mechanics in order to retrieve the propagator of a linear harmonic\noscillator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2012 09:03:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Marian", "Paulina", ""], ["Marian", "Tudor A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.1943", "submitter": "Dami\\'an Pital\\'ua-Garc\\'ia", "authors": "Dami\\'an Pital\\'ua-Garc\\'ia", "title": "Quantum information causality", "comments": "4 pages, plus 5 of supplemental material.

This theory is based on a symbolic representation of a\nfractal state-space geometry which is invariant under the action of\ndeterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is\nconstructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using\nnumber-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties\nof the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent\nwith the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not\nconstrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled\nqubits. These number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the\ninvariant set in state space, and relate to the metaphysical notion of\ncounterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability, the complex\nHilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation\ninto the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex\nHilbert Space should merely be considered a computational convenience in the\nlight of the algorithmic intractability of the invariant set geometry, and\nconsequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental aspect\nof physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic\ngravity; for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves\nlabel gravitationally distinct cosmological space-times. This implies that the\nvery notion of a `quantum theory of gravity' may be profoundly misguided -\nerroneously putting the quantum cart before the gravitational horse.

The transfer of single and double excitation states is\ndiscussed for two different coupling configurations between the qubits. In the\nfirst, the coupling is mediated by the atoms that simultaneously couple to the\ncavity modes. In the second configuration, each atom resides inside one of the\ncavities and the coupling between the cavities is mediated by the overlapping\nfield modes. A proper choice of basis states allows to identify states that\ncould be completely transferred between themselves. Simple expressions are\nderived for the conditions for the complete transfer of quantum states and\nentanglement. These conditions impose severe constraints on the evolution of\nthe system in the form of constants of motion.

We use a 7-qubit system to prepare a 6-qubit pseudopure\nstate to implement the ground state preparation and realize anyonic\nmanipulations, including creation, braiding and anyon fusion. A $\\pi/2\\times 2$\nphase difference between the states with and without anyon braiding, which is\nequivalent to two successive particle exchanges, is observed. This is different\nfrom the $\\pi\\times 2$ and $2\\pi \\times 2$ phases for Fermions and Bosons after\ntwo successive particle exchanges, and is consistent with the fractional\nstatistics of anyons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Oct 2012 15:06:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Guanru", ""], ["Long", "Guilu", ""], ["Laflamme", "Raymond", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.4772", "submitter": "Jan Chwedenczuk", "authors": "J.

We\nilluminate our proposal by examining a proper mapping from a time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger-like equation of motion for PTQM to the familiar time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation in conventional quantum mechanics. The rich structure of\nthe proper mapping hints that time-dependent PTQM can be a fruitful extension\nof conventional quantum mechanics. Under our proposed framework, we further\nstudy in detail the Berry phase generation in a class of\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric two-level systems. It is found that a closed path in\nthe parameter space of PTQM is often associated with an open path in a properly\nmapped problem in conventional quantum mechanics. In one interesting case we\nfurther interpret the Berry phase as the flux of a continuously tunable\nfictitious magnetic monopole, thus highlighting the difference between PTQM and\nconventional quantum mechanics despite the existence of a proper mapping\nbetween them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 08:45:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 05:49:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Jiangbin", ""], ["Wang", "Qing-hai", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.5359", "submitter": "Pasquale Calabrese", "authors": "Pasquale Calabrese, John Cardy, and Erik Tonni", "title": "Entanglement negativity in extended systems: A field theoretical\n  approach", "comments": "46 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

The logarithmic negativity\nE= log||rho_A^{T_2}|| is then the continuation to n->1 of the traces of the\neven powers. For pure states, this procedure reproduces the known results. We\nthen apply this method to conformally invariant field theories in several\ndifferent physical situations for infinite and finite systems and without or\nwith boundaries. In particular, in the case of two adjacent intervals of\nlengths L1, L2 in an infinite system, we derive the result E\\sim(c/4) ln(L1\nL2/(L1+L2)), where c is the central charge.

Firstly, we make a detail study on\nthe (non-relativistic) Schr\\\"odinger field theory, obtaining the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation as a field equation, after field quantization, the Heisenberg\nequations for the momentum and position operators of the particles excited from\nthe (Schr\\\"odinger) field and the Feynman path integral formula of QM are also\nobtained. We then give the probability concepts of quantum mechanics in terms\nof a statistical ensemble, realizing the ensemble(or statistical)\ninterpretation. With these, we make a series of conceptual modifications to the\nstandard quantum mechanics, especially propose a new assumption about the\nquantum measurement theory which can solve the EPR paradox from the view of the\nQFT. Besides, a field theoretical description to the double-slit interference\nexperiment is developed, obtaining the required particle number distribution.\nIn the end, we extend all the above concepts to the relativistic case so that\nthe ensemble interpretation is still proper.\n  Two extra topics are added, in the first one, an operable experiment is\nproposed to distinguish the Copenhagen interpretation from the ensemble one via\nvery different experimental results. While the second topic concerns with the\nextensions of the concept of coherent state to both the Bosonic and Fermionic\nfield cases, to obtain the corresponding classical fields. And in the\nconcluding section, we make some general comparisons between the standard QM\nand the one derived from the QFT, from which we claim that the QFT is the\nfundamental theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2012 01:23:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Oct 2012 07:10:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2012 07:26:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 01:41:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Yulei", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6463", "submitter": "Saleh Rahimi-Keshari", "authors": "Saleh Rahimi-Keshari, Matthew A.

Classical theory, being\nfully deterministic, completely excludes fundamental randomness.

The question then\nremains whether one can certify randomness independent of the physical\nframework used. While standard Bell tests approach this question from this\nperspective, they require prior perfect randomness, which renders the approach\ncircular. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to certify full\nrandomness using almost perfect random bits.

Thus we\nare left with a strict dichotomic choice: either our world is fully\ndeterministic or there exist in nature events that are fully random.

We resolve an outstanding conjecture raised in the context of the black\nhole information paradox with respect to the depth at which a typical quantum\ncircuit generates an entanglement assisted encoding against the erasure\nchannel. In addition, we prove that typical quantum circuits of poly(log n)\ndepth satisfy a stronger notion of scrambling and can be used to encode alpha n\nqubits into n qubits so that up to beta n errors can be corrected, for some\nconstants alpha, beta > 0.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2012 19:53:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jul 2013 19:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "Winton", ""], ["Fawzi", "Omar", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6646", "submitter": "Hector J.

Direct observation of quantum coherent interactions entails\nprobing the electronic wavefunction which requires that the electronic state of\nthe matter does not de-phase during the measurement, a condition that can be\nsatisfied by lengthening the coherence time or by shortening the observation\ntime. The short de-phasing time in semiconductors has dictated that all\ncoherent effects reported to date have been recorded directly only at cryogenic\ntemperatures. Here we report on the first direct electronic wavefunction\nprobing in a room-temperature semiconductor. Employing an ultrafast\ncharacterization scheme we have demonstrated Rabi oscillations and self-induced\ntransparency in an electrically driven, room-temperature semiconductor laser\namplifier, revealing the most intimate details of the light-matter interactions\nseen to date. The ability to employ quantum effects in solid-state media, which\noperate at elevated temperatures, will finally bring true quantum mechanical\nconcepts into the realm of practical devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 11:53:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Capua", "Amir", ""], ["Karni", "Ouri", ""], ["Eisenstein", "Gadi", ""], ["Reithmaier", "Johann Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6813", "submitter": "Johann Lussange", "authors": "Johann Lussange, Romain Gu\\'erout, Astrid Lambrecht", "title": "The Casimir energy between nanostructured gratings of arbitrary periodic\n  profile", "comments": "8 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
