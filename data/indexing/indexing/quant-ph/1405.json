The\nsystem is either at statistical equilibrium or general non-equilibrium, and may\nobey either classical or quantum physics. L. Hardy's mathematical axioms\nprovide a basis for the physics obeyed by any such system. One axiom is that\nthe number N of distinguishable states a in the system obeys N=max. This\nassumes that N is known as deterministic prior knowledge. However, most\nobserved systems suffer statistical fluctuations, for which N is therefore only\nknown approximately. Then what happens if the scope of the axiom N=max is\nextended to include such observed systems? It is found that the state a of the\nsystem must obey a principle of maximum Fisher information, I=I_{max}. This is\nimportant because many physical laws have been derived, assuming as a working\nhypothesis that I=I_{max}. These derivations include uses of the principle of\nExtreme physical information (EPI). Examples of such derivations were of the De\nBroglie wave hypothesis, quantum wave equations, Maxwell's equations, new laws\nof biology (e.g. of Coulomb force-directed cell development, and of in situ\ncancer growth), and new laws of economic fluctuation and investment. That the\nprinciple I=I_{max} itself derives, from suitably extended Hardy axioms,\nthereby eliminates its need to be assumed in these derivations. Thus, uses of\nI=I_{max} and EPI express physics at its most fundamental level -- its\naxiomatic basis in math.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:41:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Frieden", "B.

In this state\nthe only broken symmetry is the $U(1)$ condensate phase. (2) A \"biased ladder\nphase\" (BLP), where the density is higher on one leg than the other. The fluid\nvelocity is higher on the lower density leg, so the net current is zero. In\naddition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a broken $Z_2$ reflection\nsymmetry.

As for (non-chiral)\ntopological PEPS, the non-trivial topological properties can be traced down to\nthe existence of a symmetry in the virtual modes that are used to build the\nstate. Based on that symmetry, we construct string-like operators acting on the\nvirtual modes that can be continuously deformed without changing the state. On\nthe torus, the symmetry implies that the ground state space of the local parent\nHamiltonian is two-fold degenerate. By adding a string wrapping around the\ntorus one can change one of the ground states into the other. We use the\nspecial properties of PEPS to build the boundary theory and show how the\nsymmetry results in the appearance of chiral modes, and a universal correction\nto the area law for the zero R\\'{e}nyi entropy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2014 16:34:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 20:02:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wahl", "Thorsten B.", ""], ["Ha\u00dfler", "Stefan T.", ""], ["Tu", "Hong-Hao", ""], ["Cirac", "J.

For quantum\nresource with nonzero LS, quantum operation must be introduced to prepare it,\nand for quantum resource with nonzero NLS, nonlocal quantum operation must be\nintroduced to prepare it. We prove that LS vanishes if and only if the state is\nclassical and NLS vanishes if and only if the state is separable. From this\nsuperposition aspect, quantum resources are categorized as superpositions\nexisting in different parts. These results are helpful to study quantum\nresources from a unified frame.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2014 00:43:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 12:27:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Chengjun", ""], ["Li", "Junhui", ""], ["Luo", "Bin", ""], ["Guo", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.1123", "submitter": "Qiang  Zheng", "authors": "Qiang Zheng, Yao Yao, Xun-Wei Xu and Yong Li", "title": "Renormalized quantum Fisher information manifestation of\n  Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition for spin-1/2 XXZ chain", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Combining the ideas of quantum Fisher information and quantum renormalization\ngroup method, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition of\nspin- 1/2 XXZ chain is investigated.

As was shown before, the\nappearance of such a term (perturbing classical FTP) plays the important role\nin cognitive psychology, e.g., recognition of ambiguous figures and the\ndisjunction effect.

It\nis generally believed that in the low-frequency limit ($\\omega \\rightarrow 0$)\nDL can be achieved for an infinitesimally small value of the force $F_0$, i.e.\nat finite values of $\\Gamma$. Such a normal behavior is found in homogeneous\nlattices as well as in inhomogeneous lattices of Glauber-Fock type. Here we\nintroduce a tight-binding lattice model with inhomogeneous hopping rates,\nreferred to as pseudo Glauber-Fock lattice, which shows DL but fails to\nreproduce the normal low-frequency behavior of homogeneous and Glauber-Fock\nlattices. In pseudo Glauber-Fock lattices, DL can be exactly realized, however\nat the DL condition the force amplitude $F_0$ remains finite as $\\omega\n\\rightarrow 0$. Such an anomalous behavior is explained in terms of a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition of an associated two-level\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian that effectively describes the dynamics of the\nHermitian lattice model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 16:47:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Longhi", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2572", "submitter": "Matthew F.

Inspired by this connection, we generalise the formalism of\nclassical Bayesian networks in order to investigate non-classical correlations\nin arbitrary causal structures. Our framework of `generalised Bayesian\nnetworks' replaces latent variables with the resources of any generalised\nprobabilistic theory, most importantly quantum theory, but also, for example,\nPopescu-Rohrlich boxes. We obtain three main sets of results. Firstly, we prove\nthat all of the observable conditional independences required by the classical\ntheory also hold in our generalisation; to obtain this, we extend the classical\n$d$-separation theorem to our setting. Secondly, we find that the\ntheory-independent constraints on probabilities can go beyond these conditional\nindependences. For example we find that no probabilistic theory predicts\nperfect correlation between three parties using only bipartite common causes.\nFinally, we begin a classification of those causal structures, such as the Bell\nscenario, that may yield a separation between classical, quantum and\ngeneral-probabilistic correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 19:20:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 00:51:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Henson", "Joe", ""], ["Lal", "Raymond", ""], ["Pusey", "Matthew F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2604", "submitter": "Kazuyuki Fujii", "authors": "Kazuyuki Fujii (YCU)", "title": "Exact Solution of a Master Equation Applied to the Two Level System of\n  an Atom", "comments": "Latex, 23 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap\n  with arXiv:1304.1591", "journal-ref": "Int.

This term is manipulated to have Kinetic Entropy in parallel to its\ncounterpart in the classical Boltzmann kinetic equation for the classical\ndistribution function. This proved to be problematic in that unlike in the\nclassical Boltzmann kinetic equation, the contribution from the kinetic entropy\nterm was non-positive; (3) Kadanoff surmised that this situation could perhaps\nbe related to quantum entanglement that may not have been included in his\ntheory. It is shown that GWD is not positive everywhere (indicating dynamical\nquantumness) just like the commonly recognized property of the Wigner function\n(negative property indicating quantumness of the state). The issue of\nnon-positive feature appearing in approximate evaluation of patently positive\nentities in many particle systems is here pointed to an early discussion of\nthis issue (Phys. Rev. A10, 1852 (1974)) in terms of a theorem on truncation of\ncumulant expansion of a probability distribution function due to Marcinkeiwicz.\nThe last issue of presence or absence of entanglement in an approximate\nevaluation of a many particle correlation poses a new problem; it is considered\nhere in terms of fermionic entanglement theory in the light of density matrix\nand Green function theory of many-fermion systems.

We will endeavour to\npresent these problems independently from the underlying physics as much of\nthis work can be effectively solved by non-experts in quantum information or\nquantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 03:40:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Devitt", "Simon J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.4956", "submitter": "Olga Manko Vladimirovna", "authors": "V.

Recently, it's been\nshown that there are actually many second laws, and that it is only for large\nmacroscopic systems that they all become equivalent to the ordinary one. These\nadditional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often\nmore relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities\nof energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how\nthe coherences between energy levels can evolve. Coherences can only go down,\nand we provide a set of restrictions which limit the extent to which they can\nbe maintained. We find that coherences over energy levels must decay at rates\nthat are suitably adapted to the transition rates between energy levels.

To\nfind out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a\nweighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such\nthat each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a\nparticular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part\nof the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times. In the dual\npost-selection picture the weight is simply the probability for the 'periodic\nbit' to satisfy the constraint, plus a small noise part, often assumed\nconstant, representing the error rate of the time machine's channel. The\nemerging bit is one of a Bell pair, its partner kept in reserve to test that\nthe bit entering the time machine later matches the one which emerged. This is\ndone by interfering the incoming bit with the reserve member of the pair and\nkeeping the experimental runs that interfere constructively.
