The limit can also be studied for much simpler model systems, including\nnon-interacting fermions in a one-dimensional well, where the WKB approximation\napplies for individual eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Summation techniques\nlead to energies and densities that are functionals of the potential. We\nconsider several examples in one dimension (fermions in a box, in a harmonic\nwell, in a linear half-well, and in the P\\\"oschl-Teller well. The effects of\nhigher dimension are also illustrated with the three-dimensional harmonic well\nand the Bohr atom, non-interacting fermions in a Coulomb well. Modern density\nfunctional calculations use the Kohn-Sham scheme almost exclusively.

This practical aspect emerges\nprecisely when the pragmatic application of the formalism prevails over any\nother interpretational question, still a matter of debate and controversy. In\nthis regard, the purpose here is to show and discuss how Bohmian mechanics\nemphasizes in a natural manner a series of dynamical features difficult to find\nout through other quantum approaches. This arises from the fact that Bohmian\nmechanics allows us to establish a direct link between the dynamics exhibited\nby quantum systems and the local variations of the quantum phase associated\nwith their state. To illustrate these facts, simple models of two physically\ninsightful quantum phenomena have been chosen, namely, the dispersion of a free\nGaussian wave packet and Young-type two-slit interference. As it is shown, the\noutcomes from their analysis render a novel, alternative understanding of the\ndynamics displayed by these quantum phenomena in terms of the underlying local\nvelocity field that connects the probability density with the quantum flux.\nThis field, nothing but the so-called guidance condition in standard Bohmian\nmechanics, thus acquires a prominent role to understand quantum dynamics, as\nthe mechanism responsible for such dynamics.

We begin by\nconsidering a toy model consisting of many interacting particles, resulting in\nthe familiar Schrodinger equation for non-relativistic particles. Using a\nsimilar methodology, we construct a theory of quantum scalar fields in flat\nspace-time that is relativistic, but not manifestly so. Here we also discuss a\nnovel way in which the ED of quantum scalar fields appears to evade the\nso-called Wallstrom objection. To go further towards constructing a manifestly\ncovariant quantum ED of fields on a curved space-time, both fixed and\ndynamical, we borrow from the \"many-time\" approaches of P. Weiss, P. Dirac, K.\nKuchar, and C. Teitelboim. For a fixed background the result is a manifestly\ncovariant ED of scalar fields that is in the spirit of the covariant quantum\ntheories proposed by S.

Despite their disparate character, we show that both assumptions are\nequally costly. Namely, the resources required to explain the experimental\nstatistics (measured by the frequency of causal interventions of either sort)\nare exactly the same. Furthermore, we compute such defined measures of locality\nand free choice for any nonsignaling statistics in a Bell experiment with\nbinary settings, showing that it is directly related to the amount of violation\nof the so-called Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequalities. This result is theory\nindependent as it refers directly to the experimental statistics. Additionally,\nwe show how the local fraction results for quantum-mechanical frameworks with\ninfinite number of settings translate into analogous statements for the measure\nof free choice we introduce. Thus, concerning statistics, causal explanations\nresorting to either locality or free choice violations are fully\ninterchangeable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2021 10:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Blasiak", "Pawel", ""], ["Pothos", "Emmanuel M.", ""], ["Yearsley", "James M.", ""], ["Gallus", "Christoph", ""], ["Borsuk", "Ewa", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.09089", "submitter": "Korbinian Kottmann", "authors": "Korbinian Kottmann, Philippe Corboz, Maciej Lewenstein, Antonio Ac\\'in", "title": "Unsupervised mapping of phase diagrams of 2D systems from infinite\n  projected entangled-pair states via deep anomaly detection", "comments": "Submission to SciPost; code and data available at\n  https://github.com/Qottmann/anomaly-detection-PEPS", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate how to map out the phase diagram of a two dimensional quantum\nmany body system with no prior physical knowledge by applying deep\n\\textit{anomaly detection} to ground states from infinite projected entangled\npair state simulations.

While these ingredients have so far precluded its realization in\nsolid state systems and other quantum simulation architectures, in a companion\nmanuscript [1901.08597] we predict that Hopf insulators can in fact arise\nnaturally in dipolar interacting systems. Here, we investigate a specific such\narchitecture in lattices of polar molecules, where the effective `spin' is\nformed from sublattice degrees of freedom. We introduce two techniques that\nallow one to optimize dipolar Hopf insulators with large band gaps, and which\nshould also be readily applicable to the simulation of other exotic\nbandstructures. First, we describe the use of Floquet engineering to control\nthe range and functional form of dipolar hoppings and second, we demonstrate\nthat molecular AC polarizabilities (under circularly polarized light) can be\nused to precisely tune the resonance condition between different rotational\nstates. To verify that this latter technique is amenable to current generation\nexperiments, we calculate from first principles the AC polarizability for\n$\\sigma^+$ light for ${}^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb. Finally, we show that experiments are\ncapable of detecting the unconventional topology of the Hopf insulator by\nvarying the termination of the lattice at its edges, which gives rise to three\ndistinct classes of edge mode spectra.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 May 2021 18:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Schuster", "Thomas", ""], ["Flicker", "Felix", ""], ["Li", "Ming", ""], ["Kotochigova", "Svetlana", ""], ["Moore", "Joel E.", ""], ["Ye", "Jun", ""], ["Yao", "Norman Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.10510", "submitter": "Kentaro Komori", "authors": "Kentaro Komori, Takuya Kawasaki, Sotatsu Otabe, Yutaro Enomoto, Yuta\n  Michimura, Masaki Ando", "title": "Improving force sensitivity by amplitude measurement of light reflected\n  from a detuned optomechanical cavity", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph gr-qc physics.ins-det", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The measurement of weak continuous forces exerted on a mechanical oscillator\nis a fundamental problem in various physical experiments.

It is based on the repeated\napplication of the same interaction pulse in two manners: with the same phase\nof each subsequent pulse, and with an alternating phase shift of $\\pi$ (i.e. a\nminus sign) from pulse to pulse. Two specific types of pulses are considered: a\nresonant $\\pi$ pulse and an adiabatic chirped pulse, both of which produce\ncomplete population inversion with high fidelity. In the presence of a weak\nambient external electric or magnetic field, the ensuing Stark or Zeeman shift\nleads to an energy level shift and hence a static detuning. In both the\nresonant and adiabatic approaches, a small level shift does not alter the\ntransition probability very much; however, it can significantly change the\ndynamical phases in the propagator. The repeated application of the same pulse\ngreatly amplifies the changes in the dynamical phases and maps them onto the\npopulations. Hence the effect of the level shift can be measured with good\naccuracy. It is found that sequences of pulses with alternating phases deliver\nmuch greater error amplification and much steeper excitation profiles around\nresonance, thereby providing much higher sensitivity to small energy level\nshifts. Explicit analytic estimates of the sensitivity are derived using the\nwell-known non-crossing Rosen-Zener and Rabi models and the level-crossing\nDemkov-Kunike model.

Bell's severe criticism of\nNeumann's proof and the explicit (counter) example of a hidden variable model\nfor the measurement of a quantum spin are considered by most researchers,\nthough not all, as the definitive demonstration that Neumann's proof is\ninadequate. Despite being an argument of mathematical physics, an ambiguity of\ndecision remains to this day. I show that Neumann's assumption of the linear\nadditivity of the expectation values, even for incompatible (noncommuting)\nobservables, is a necessary constraint related to the nature of observable\nphysical variables and to the conservation laws. Therefore, any theory should\nnecessarily obey it to qualify as a physically valid theory. Then, obviously,\nthe hidden variable theories with dispersion-free ensembles that violate this\nassumption are ruled out. I show that it is Bell's counter-example that is\nfundamentally flawed, being inconsistent with the factual mechanics. Further,\nit is shown that the local hidden variable theories, for which the Bell's\ninequalities were derived, are grossly incompatible with the fundamental\nconservation laws. I identify the intrinsic uncertainty in the action as the\nreason for the irreducible dispersion, which implies that there are no\ndispersion-free ensembles at any scale of mechanics. With the unconditional\nvalidity of its central assumption shown, Neumann's proof is fully resurrected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 13:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Unnikrishnan", "C.

The similar statement is claimed for $k$ uses of PBT, when the error\naccumulates at most linearly in $k$. Here, considering original setup for the\nrecycling protocol, we disprove these claims.

Since a unitary transformation may require significantly different\ngate sequences, depending on the base considered, such a problem is of great\ncomplexity and does not admit an efficient approximating algorithm. Therefore,\ntraditional approaches are time-consuming tasks, unsuitable to be employed\nduring quantum computation. We exploit the deep reinforcement learning method\nas an alternative strategy, which has a significantly different trade-off\nbetween search time and exploitation time. Deep reinforcement learning allows\ncreating single-qubit operations in real time, after an arbitrary long training\nperiod during which a strategy for creating sequences to approximate unitary\noperators is built. The deep reinforcement learning based compiling method\nallows for fast computation times, which could in principle be exploited for\nreal-time quantum compiling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 15:32:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Moro", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Paris", "Matteo G.

In this driving\nregime, the plateau in frequency spectra typical for radiation from strongly\ndriven systems, has noticeable modulation in amplitude due to interference\nbetween waves of a same frequency and emitted at different time instants.\nSpecifically, there is a characteristic `dips' structure at a set of\nfrequencies in the radiation spectra, where the corresponding amplitudes are\nsuppressed by several orders of magnitude.
