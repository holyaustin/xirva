For a Levy-Lieb type functional $Q(\\rho,j^p)$, it\nis demonstrated that (i) it is a proper extension of the universal\nHohenberg-Kohn functional, $F_{HK}(\\rho,j^p)$, to $N$-representable densities,\n(ii) there exists a wavefunction $\\psi_0$ such that\n$Q(\\rho,j^p)=(\\psi_0,H_0\\psi_0)_{L^2}$, where $H_0$ is the Hamiltonian without\nexternal potential terms, and (iii) it is not convex. Furthermore, a convex and\nuniversal functional $F(\\rho,j^p)$ is studied and proven to be equal the convex\nenvelope of $Q(\\rho,j^p)$. For both $Q$ and $F$, we give upper and lower\nbounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2014 10:10:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Laestadius", "Andre", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0828", "submitter": "Abolfazl Bayat", "authors": "Abolfazl Bayat, Henrik Johannesson, Sougato Bose, Pasquale Sodano", "title": "An order parameter for impurity systems at quantum criticality", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Nature Communications 5, 3784 (2014)", "doi": "10.1038/ncomms4784", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A quantum phase transition may occur in the ground state of a system at zero\ntemperature when a controlling field or interaction is varied.

So\nit is clear that the birth of the early universe completely depends on the\nquantum nature of the theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Apr 2014 10:09:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Dongshan", ""], ["Gao", "Dongfeng", ""], ["Cai", "Qing-yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.1210", "submitter": "Arijit Chakraborty", "authors": "Arijit Chakraborty and Satya Ram Mishra", "title": "Anisotropic two-dimensional RF-dressed potentials for ultracold atoms", "comments": "21 Pages and 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3938/jkps.65.1324", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, the RF-dressed potentials generated using a static magnetic\nfield of a quadrupole trap and various radio frequency (RF) fields, have been\ntheoretically investigated for trapping and manipulations of cold atoms in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) geometry.

One of the simplest approaches to\nincorporate such fluctuations in energy transfer dynamics is the well known\nHaken-Strobl-Reineker model, in which the energy-gap fluctuation is\napproximated as a white noise. Recently, several groups have employed molecular\ndynamics simulations and excited-state calculations in conjunction to take the\nthermal fluctuation of excitation energies into account. Here, we discuss a\nrigorous connection between the stochastic and the atomistic bath models. If\nthe phonon bath is treated classically, time evolution of the exciton-phonon\nsystem can be described by Ehrenfest dynamics. To establish the relationship\nbetween the stochastic and atomistic bath models, we employ a projection\noperator technique to derive the generalized Langevin equations for the\nenergy-gap fluctuations. The stochastic bath model can be obtained as an\napproximation of the atomistic Ehrenfest equations via the generalized Langevin\napproach. Based on the connection, we propose a novel scheme to correct\nreorganization effects within the framework of stochastic models. The proposed\nscheme provides a better description of the population dynamics especially in\nthe regime of strong exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we discuss the effect of\nthe bath reorganization in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of ideal\nJ-aggregates in terms of the Stokes shifts. For this purpose, we introduce a\nsimple relationship that relates the reorganization contribution to the Stokes\nshifts - the reorganization shift - to three parameters: the monomer\nreorganization energy, the relaxation time of the optical gap, and the exciton\ndelocalization length.

Results: A\npreviously unrecognized region of the parameter space of the interacting boson\nmodel that has both O(6) PDS (purity) and SU(3) QDS (coherence) in the ground\nband is established. Many rare-earth nuclei approximately satisfying both\nsymmetry requirements are identified. Conclusions: PDS are more abundant than\npreviously recognized and can lead to a QDS of an incompatible symmetry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 06:52:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kremer", "C.", ""], ["Beller", "J.", ""], ["Leviatan", "A.", ""], ["Pietralla", "N.", ""], ["Rainovski", "G.", ""], ["Trippel", "R.", ""], ["Van Isacker", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.3829", "submitter": "Salvador Miret-Artes", "authors": "Antonio B.

In the present work, we demonstrate that such a limitation can be\nlifted o? when the path interference from two quantum emitters to a plasmonic\nresonator (second harmonic converter) is considered. Enhancement factors much\nlarger than 7 orders of magnitude are possible using such an interference\nscheme. Therefore, a single hybridized system of 3 particles (manufactured\ncarefully) can account for almost all of the second harmonic generated\nradiation emitted from a sample of plasmonic particle clusters decorated with\nquantum emitters (e.g. a spaser).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 13:20:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Tasgin", "Mehmet Emre", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.3912", "submitter": "Andrea Alberti", "authors": "Carsten Robens, Wolfgang Alt, Dieter Meschede, Clive Emary and Andrea\n  Alberti", "title": "Ideal negative measurements in quantum walks disprove theories based on\n  classical trajectories", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

H is derived from the action of a massless Dirac\nfermion living in a domain of Rindler spacetime, in 1+1 dimensions, that has a\nboundary given by the world line of a uniformly accelerated observer.\n  The action contains a sum of delta function potentials that can be viewed as\npartially reflecting moving mirrors. An appropriate choice of the accelerations\nof the mirrors, provide primitive periodic orbits associated to the prime\nnumbers $p$, whose periods, measured by the observer's clock, are log p. Acting\non the chiral components of the fermion, H becomes the Berry-Keating\nHamiltonian (x p + p x)/2, where x is identified with the Rindler spatial\ncoordinate and p with the conjugate momentum.\n  The delta function potentials give the matching conditions of the fermion\nwave functions on both sides of the mirrors.

The\neigenvalue problem is solved by transfer matrix methods in the limit where the\nreflection amplitudes become infinitesimally small. We find that for generic\nvalues of the phase shift the spectrum is a continuum, where the Riemann zeros\nare missing, as in the adelic Connes model.

In particular, we show that for the noiseless channel,\nif multipartite quantum correlations of an arbitrary multipartite state of\narbitrary number of qubits is the same as that of the corresponding generalized\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, then the multipartite dense coding\ncapability of former is the same or better than that of the generalized\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Interestingly, in a noisy channel scenario,\nwhere we consider both uncorrelated and correlated noise models, the relative\nabilities of the quantum channels to transfer classical information can get\ninverted by administering a sufficient amount of noise. When the shared state\nis an arbitrary multipartite mixed state, we also establish a link between the\nclassical capacity for the noiseless case and multipartite quantum correlation\nmeasures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 15:37:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Tamoghna", ""], ["Prabhu", "R.", ""], ["De", "Aditi Sen", ""], ["Sen", "Ujjwal", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4593", "submitter": "Ahmed Jellal", "authors": "Abdeldjalil Merdaci, Ahmed Jellal, Lyazid Chetouani", "title": "Path Integral Confined Dirac Fermions in a Constant Magnetic Field", "comments": "19 pages, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Int.

Here, by strongly coupling a photon to a single atom trapped\nin the near field of a nanoscale photonic crystal cavity, we realize a system\nwhere a single atom switches the phase of a photon, and a single photon\nmodifies the atom's phase. We experimentally demonstrate an atom-induced\noptical phase shift that is nonlinear at the two-photon level, a photon number\nrouter that separates individual photons and photon pairs into different output\nmodes, and a single-photon switch where a single \"gate\" photon controls the\npropagation of a subsequent probe field.

When applied\nto spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized spins, which enhance the\nsignal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). According to this cooling\napproach, spin-half nuclei in a constant magnetic field are considered as bits,\nor more precisely, quantum bits, in a known probability distribution.\nAlgorithmic steps on these bits are then translated into specially designed NMR\npulse sequences using common NMR quantum computation tools. The $algorithmic$\ncooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible,\nentropy-preserving manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms)\nwith $selective$ $reset$, the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the\nenvironment. In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently large spin\nsystems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to conservation of\nShannon entropy.\n  Here, only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call this\nprocess \"heat-bath\" cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally\nimplement here two consecutive steps of selective reset that transfer entropy\nfrom two selected spins to the environment. We performed such cooling\nexperiments with commercially-available labeled molecules, on standard\nliquid-state NMR spectrometers.

In\ncomputability theory, the complexity of a problem is determined by how long it\ntakes an effective algorithm to solve it. This complexity may be compared to\nthe difficulty for a hypothetical oracle machine, the output of which may be\nverified by a computable function but cannot be simulated on a physical\nmachine. We define a quantum oracle machine for measurements as one that can\ndetermine the state by examining a single copy. The complexity of measurement\nfor a realizable machine will then be respect to the number of copies of the\nstate that needs to be examined. A quantum oracle cannot perform simultaneous\nexact measurement of conjugate variables, although approximate measurement may\nbe performed as circumscribed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. When\nconsidering the measurement of a variable, there might be residual uncertainty\nif the number of copies of the variable is limited. Specifically, we examine\nthe quantum measurement complexity of linear polarization of photons that is\nused in several quantum cryptography schemes and we present a relation using\ninformation theoretic arguments.

In the case\nof photonic states, this process is probabilistic due to the impossibility of\nperforming a two-particle complete Bell state analysis with linear optics. In\norder to achieve a deterministic teleportation scheme, harnessing other degrees\nof freedom of a single particle, rather than a third particle, has been\nproposed. Indeed, this leads to a novel type of deterministic teleportation\nscheme, the so-called hybrid teleportation. Here we report the first\nrealization of photonic hybrid quantum teleportation from spin-to-orbital\nangular momentum degrees of freedom. In our scheme, the polarization state of\nphoton A is transferred to orbital angular momentum of photon B. The teleported\nstates are visualized in real-time by means of an intensified CCD camera. The\nquality of teleported states is verified by performing quantum state\ntomography, which confirms an average fidelity higher than 99.4%.

We also demonstrate that for large number of levels in\nthe acceptor band, the efficiency of ET can be close to 100%, for both downhill\nand uphill transitions and for sharp and at redox potentials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Apr 2014 03:36:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 18:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Gurvitz", "Shmuel", ""], ["Nesterov", "Alexander I.", ""], ["Berman", "Gennady P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7822", "submitter": "Bela Bauer", "authors": "Bela Bauer and Claire Levaillant and Michael Freedman", "title": "Universality of single quantum gates", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure; added references to previous proofs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.GR quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We supply a rigorous proof that an open dense set of all possible 2-qubit\ngates G has the property that if the quantum circuit model is restricted to\nonly permit swap of qubits lines and the application of G to pairs of lines,\nthen the model is still computationally universal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:24:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2014 05:21:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 00:06:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Bela", ""], ["Levaillant", "Claire", ""], ["Freedman", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7830", "submitter": "Abhishek Shukla", "authors": "Abhishek Shukla and T.

The corresponding outputs are then characterized by quantum\nstate tomography (QST), which itself requires the measurement of non-commuting\nobservables realized by independent experiments on identically prepared system\nstates. Thus QPT procedure demands a number of independent measurements, and\nmoreover, this number increases rapidly with the size of the system. However,\nthe total number of independent measurements can be greatly reduced with the\navailability of ancilla qubits. Ancilla assisted process tomography (AAPT) has\nearlier been shown to require a single QST of system-ancilla space. Ancilla\nassisted quantum state tomography (AAQST) has also been shown to perform QST in\na single measurement. Here we combine AAPT with AAQST to realize a `single-shot\nQPT' (SSPT), a procedure to characterize a general quantum process in a single\ncollective measurement of a set of commuting observables. We demonstrate\nexperimental SSPT by characterizing several single-qubit processes using a\nthree-qubit NMR quantum register. Furthermore, using the SSPT procedure we\nexperimentally characterize the twirling process and compare the results with\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 18:59:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 15:21:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Shukla", "Abhishek", ""], ["Mahesh", "T.

In\nthis respect, the state transfer of a single qubit by means of spin chains has\nbeen widely discussed, and many protocols aiming at performing this task have\nbeen proposed. Nevertheless, the state transfer of more than one qubit has not\nbeen properly addressed so far. In this paper, we present a modified version of\na recently proposed quantum state transfer protocol [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062309\n(2013)] to obtain a quantum channel for the transfer of two qubits. This goal\nis achieved by exploiting Rabi-like oscillations due to excitations induced by\nmeans of strong and localized magnetic fields. We derive exact analytical\nformulae for the fidelity of the quantum state transfer, and obtain a\nhigh-quality transfer for general quantum states as well as for specific\nclasses of states relevant for quantum information processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:15:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Apollaro", "T.

Focusing on the low-lying modes of\nthe finite lattice we observe the emergence of density-wave tunneling,\nbreathing and cradle-like processes. In particular, the tunneling induced by\nthe quench leads to a \"global\" density-wave oscillation. The resulting\nbreathing and cradle modes are inherent to the local intrawell dynamics and\nconnected to excited-band states. Moreover, the interaction quenches couple the\ndensity-wave and the cradle modes allowing for resonance phenomena. These are\nassociated with an avoided-crossing in the respective frequency spectrum and\nlead to a beating dynamics for the cradle.
