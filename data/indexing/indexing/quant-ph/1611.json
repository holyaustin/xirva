The effects of bath correlation and temperature, together with\nthe combined effects of these factors are also discussed in details. The\nresults show a variety of dynamical behaviours.

The\neffects of system-bath coupling and bath correlation are incorporated in the\neffective system-bath coupling strength determining whether noise-assisted\ntransport effect or dynamical localization dominates the dynamics and\ntemperature modulates the balance of the two mechanisms.

At the\nstatistical level, this by itself does not represent a paradox, but apparently\nviolates the second law of thermodynamics, which may lead to some confusing\nconclusions for macroscopic systems. However, this statement does not take\ngravity into account. If two particles with a given center of mass energy come\nat the distance shorter than the Schwarzschild diameter apart, according to\nclassical gravity they will form a black hole. In the classical case, a black\nhole once formed will always grow and effectively quench the Poincare\nrecurrence. We derive the condition under which the classical black hole\nproduction rate is higher than the classical Poincare recurrence rate. In the\nquantum case, if the temperature of the black hole is lower than the\ntemperature of the surrounding gas, such a black hole cannot disappear via\nHawking evaporation. We derive the condition which gives us a critical\ntemperature above which the black hole production is faster than quantum\nPoincare recurrence time. However, in quantum case, the quantum Poincare\nrecurrence theorem can be applied to the black hole states too.

Here we review recent experiments in which\ntemperature quenches have been performed across the Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) phase transition in an annular geometry and in homogeneous 3D and\nquasi-2D gases. Combined, these experiments give a comprehensive picture of the\nKibble-Zurek (KZ) scenario through complementary measurements of correlation\nfunctions and topological defects density. They also allow the measurement of\nKZ scaling laws, the direct confirmation of the \"freeze-out\" hypothesis that\nunderlies the KZ theory, and the extraction of critical exponents of the\nBose-Einstein condensation transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 19:49:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Beugnon", "J.", ""], ["Navon", "N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.01150", "submitter": "Bassano Vacchini", "authors": "Bassano Vacchini", "title": "Generalized master equations leading to completely positive dynamics", "comments": "8 pages, to appear on PRL", "journal-ref": "Phys.

While the minimum case is trivial, it is\nnot so intuitive to verify in which basis the quantum coherence is maximal.\nBased on the coherence measure of relative entropy, we indicate the particular\nbasis in which the quantum coherence is maximal for a given state, where the\nFourier matrix (or more generally, \\textit{complex Hadamard matrices}) plays a\ncritical role in determining the basis. Intriguingly, though we can prove that\nthe basis associated with the Fourier matrix is a stationary point for\noptimizing the $l_1$ norm of coherence, numerical simulation shows that it is\nnot a global optimal choice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 08:07:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 01:27:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yao", "Yao", ""], ["Dong", "G.

Here we extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum\nfield theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a\nnon-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive,\nghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal\ngravity. Since our approach allows for complex energies and decays, our work\njustifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the\nlifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other.

The use of\nphotonic crystal enhances evanescent field thus allows coupling between\nnext-nearest-neighbor waveguides in such a planar waveguide array, without\nbreaking the weak coupling condition of the coupled mode equation.\nParticularly, similarities between the model and coherent light propagation\ncould reach 0.99 in numerical simulations and 0.89 in experiment. Localization\neffect induced by second-order coupling and coupling strengthening with\nincreasing wavelengths were also revealed in both numerical simulations and\nexperiments. The platform proposed here is compatible with mature complementary\nmetal oxide semiconductor technology thus possesses the potential for\nlarger-scale problems and photonic crystals further allows simulations of\nspecific target Hamiltonians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 14:04:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Qi", "F.", ""], ["Wang", "Y.

If the wave function is not ontic,\nthen what, if any, is the underlying state of reality? If the wave function is\nindeed ontic, then exactly what physical state does it represent? In this book,\nI aim to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and find the\nontological content of the theory. The book can be divided into three parts.\nThe first part addresses the question of the nature of the wave function\n(Chapters 1-5). After giving a comprehensive and critical review of the\ncompeting views of the wave function, I present a new argument for the ontic\nview in terms of protective measurements. In addition, I also analyze the\norigin of the wave function by deriving the free Schroedinger equation. The\nsecond part analyzes the ontological meaning of the wave function (Chapters 6,\n7). I propose a new ontological interpretation of the wave function in terms of\nrandom discontinuous motion of particles, and give two main arguments\nsupporting this interpretation. The third part investigates whether the\nsuggested quantum ontology is complete in accounting for our definite\nexperience and whether it needs to be revised in the relativistic domain\n(Chapters 8, 9).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 11:34:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Shan", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02759", "submitter": "S\\\"oren Petrat", "authors": "Maximilian Jeblick, David Mitrouskas, S\\\"oren Petrat, Peter Pickl", "title": "Free time evolution of a tracer particle coupled to a Fermi gas in the\n  high-density limit", "comments": "46 pages, 1 figure, LaTex; v2: minor improvements", "journal-ref": "Commun.

When applied to quantum physical\nexperiments that exhibit inconsistent connectedness (due to context-dependent\nerrors and/or signaling), the CbD computations reveal quantum contextuality in\nspite of this. When applied to a large body of published behavioral\nexperiments, the CbD computations reveal no quantum contextuality: all\ncontext-dependence in these experiments is described by inconsistent\nconnectedness alone. Until recently, however, experimental analysis of\ncontextuality was confined to so-called cyclic systems of binary random\nvariables. Here, we present the results of a psychophysical double-detection\nexperiment that do not form a cyclic system: their analysis requires that we\nuse a recent modification of CbD, one that makes the class of noncontextual\nsystems more restricted. Nevertheless our results once again indicate that when\ninconsistent connectedness is taken into account, the system exhibits no\ncontextuality.

While\nsimilar to simulated annealing, QA relies on quantum, rather than thermal,\neffects to explore complex search spaces. For many classes of problems, QA is\nknown to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we\nreport on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully\nvisible Boltzmann machines. We characterize the sampling distribution of QA\nhardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ\nsignificantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this\ndifference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using\nstandard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use\nof QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence\n(CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). Using $k=50$ Gibbs steps, we\nshow that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds\ncan improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard\nproblems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster\nlearning.

We directly compare the local noise\namplitude to the level of bare vacuum fluctuations. This nonlinear approach\noperates off resonance without absorption or amplification of the field that is\ninvestigated. Subcycle intervals with noise level significantly below the pure\nquantum vacuum are found. Enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time segments\nmanifest generation of highly correlated quantum radiation as a consequence of\nthe uncertainty principle. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this work\nopens a window to the elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an\nenergy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:09:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Riek", "Claudius", ""], ["Sulzer", "Philipp", ""], ["Seeger", "Maximilian", ""], ["Moskalenko", "Andrey S.", ""], ["Burkard", "Guido", ""], ["Seletskiy", "Denis V.", ""], ["Leitenstorfer", "Alfred", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.06780", "submitter": "Charis Anastopoulos", "authors": "Charis Anastopoulos and Ntina Savvidou", "title": "Path of a tunneling particle", "comments": "21 pages, 2 figures.

We also given an example of an SU(2) representation\nof the three-strand braid group that models the Jones polynomial for closures\nof three-strand braids. This invariant is a quantum model for the Jones\npolynomial restricted to three strand braids, and it does not involve quantum\nentanglement. These relationships between topological braiding and quantum\nentanglement can be used as a framework for future work in understanding the\nproperties of entangling gates in topological quantum computing.The paper ends\nwith a discussion of the Aravind hypothesis about the direct relationship of\nknots and quantum entanglement, and the ER = EPR hypothesis about the\nrelationship of quantum entanglement with the connectivity of space. We\ndescribe how, given a background space and a quantum tensor network, to\nconstruct a new topological space, that welds the network and the background\nspace together. This construction embodies the principle that quantum\nentanglement and topological connectivity are intimately related.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 01:33:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 08:38:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 05:17:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 27 May 2017 05:12:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 4 Aug 2017 04:51:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 07:52:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kauffman", "Louis H.", ""], ["Mehrotra", "Eshan", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.08048", "submitter": "Christian Kurtsiefer", "authors": "Yue-Sum Chin, Matthias Steiner, Christian Kurtsiefer", "title": "Quantifying the role of thermal motion in free-space light-atom\n  interaction", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The main goal is to further refine\ncharacterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state\nredistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via\nsecond order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The\ndissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In\nthe mathematical part, we focus on the $\\alpha$-sandwiched R\\'enyi divergence\n($\\alpha$-SRD). We first investigate the limit $\\alpha\\to 0$ to determine\nwhether this recovers the well-known $0$-R\\'enyi relative divergence. We then\nprove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the\n$\\alpha$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the\nfidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and\nsufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality\n(viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the $\\alpha$-SRD, and give\napplications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first\nderive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a\nmixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source\ncodes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a\ncorollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum\nsource coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse\ntheorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement\ncompression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these\ntheorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on R\\'enyi entropic quantities\nderived from the $\\alpha$-SRD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 07:51:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Leditzky", "Felix", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.08831", "submitter": "Navin Khaneja", "authors": "Navin Khaneja, Ashutosh Kumar", "title": "Broadband excitation by method of double sweep", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper describes the design of broadband excitation pulses in high\nresolution NMR by method of double sweep.

In this thesis we introduce new models of quantum\ncomputation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer\nalgorithms.\n  Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named\nnormalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit\nClifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and $\\pi/4$-phase gates): a normalizer circuit\nconsists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic\nphase gates associated to a set $G$, which is either an abelian group or\nabelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically\nsimulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated\nfactoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup\nProblems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under\nwhich scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we\ndevise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results\noffer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic\nproblems.\n  Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic)\nframework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating\nquantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism\n(PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer\ngroups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit\nsystems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable\nsystems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems. These results enlarge the known\nfamilies of quantum processes that can be efficiently classically simulated.\n  This thesis also establishes a precise connection between Shor's quantum\nalgorithm and the stabilizer formalism, revealing a common mathematical\nstructure in several quantum speed-ups and error-correcting codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 18:30:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bermejo-Vega", "Juan", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09286", "submitter": "Zaheen Sadeq", "authors": "Z.S.

Specifically, the adsorption of an atom on a vibrating membrane can be\nviewed as the counterpart to QED radiative electron capture. A calculation of\nthe adsorption rate to lowest-order in the atom-phonon coupling is finite;\nhowever, higher-order contributions suffer from an infrared problem mimicking\nthe case of radiative capture in QED. Terms in the perturbation series for the\nadsorption rate diverge as a result of massless particles in the model\n(flexural phonons of the membrane in QAD and photons in QED). We treat this\ninfrared problem in QAD explicitly to obtain finite results by regularizing\nwith a low-frequency cutoff that corresponds to the inverse size of the\nmembrane. Using a coherent state basis for the soft phonon final state, we then\nsum the dominant contributions to derive a new formula for the multiphonon\nadsorption rate of atoms on the membrane that gives results that are finite,\nnonperturbative in the atom-phonon coupling, and consistent with the KLN\ntheorem.
