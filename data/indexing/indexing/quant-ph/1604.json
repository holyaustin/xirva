From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an\nentanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised\nmeasurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that\nlies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement.\nMoreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum\ninformation protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted.\nBecause of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an\noverview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite\nprogramming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to\naddress a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and\napplications.

There is a\nprogression from the usual Boolean logic of subsets to the \"quantum logic\" of\nsubspaces of a general vector space--which is then specialized to the closed\nsubspaces of a Hilbert space. But there is a \"dual\" progression. The notion of\na partition (or quotient set or equivalence relation) is dual (in a\ncategory-theoretic sense) to the notion of a subset. Hence the Boolean logic of\nsubsets has a dual logic of partitions. Then the dual progression is from that\nlogic of partitions to the quantum logic of direct-sum decompositions (i.e.,\nthe vector space version of a set partition) of a general vector space--which\ncan then be specialized to the direct-sum decompositions of a Hilbert space.\nThis allows the logic to express measurement by any self-adjoint operators\nrather than just the projection operators associated with subspaces. In this\nintroductory paper, the focus is on the quantum logic of direct-sum\ndecompositions of a finite-dimensional vector space (including such a Hilbert\nspace).

They are inspired, in part, by a\ndecoherent histories analysis of the two-time histories of Q although the\nprotocols are ultimately expressed in macrorealistic form independent of\nquantum theory. The first type involves an ancilla coupled to the system with\ntwo sequential CNOT gates, and the two-time histories of the system are\ndetermined in a single final time measurement of the ancilla. It is\nnon-invasive for special choices of initial system states and partially\ninvasive for more general choices. Modified Leggett-Garg type inequalities\nwhich accommodate the partial invasiveness are discussed. The quantum picture\nof the protocol shows that for certain choices of primary system initial state\nthe protocol is undetectable with respect to final system state measurements,\nalthough it is still invasive at intermediate times. This invasiveness can be\nreduced with different choices of ancilla states and the protocol is then\nsimilar in flavour to a weak measurement. The second type of protocol is based\non the fact that the behaviour of Q over a time interval can be determined from\nknowledge of the dynamics together with a measurement of certain initial (or\nfinal) data. Its quantum version corresponds to the known fact that when sets\nof histories are decoherent, their probabilities may be expressed in terms of a\nrecord projector, hence the two-time histories in which Q has the same or\ndifferent sign can be determined by a single projective measurement.

Finally, the input-output\nformalism has allowed us to prove that Kirchhoff's law, describing thermal\nemission properties, applies to our system in all the light-matter coupling\nregimes considered in this work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 15:49:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 May 2016 17:10:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Huppert", "Simon", ""], ["Vasanelli", "Angela", ""], ["Pegolotti", "Giulia", ""], ["Todorov", "Yanko", ""], ["Sirtori", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.01677", "submitter": "Ashok Ajoy", "authors": "A.

The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation\noperators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables\nto represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill\nand Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in\nquantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion\ncoherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.\n  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on\ndistribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve\nGrassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,\ncreation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper\nfor fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator\nis replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space\nvariables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This\nfurther development of the theory is important for the situation when large\nnumbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat\nseparately. Here Grassmann fields, distribution functionals, functional\nFokker-Planck equations and Ito stochastic field equations are involved.\nTypical applications to a trapped Fermi gas of interacting spin 1/2 fermionic\natoms and to multi-component Fermi gases with non-zero range interactions are\npresented, showing that the Ito stochastic field equations are local in these\ncases. Solutions for spin 1/2 fermions either free or in lattices are found.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 12:38:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 06:07:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Dalton", "Bryan J", ""], ["Jeffers", "John", ""], ["Barnett", "Stephen M", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03378", "submitter": "Steve Campbell", "authors": "Miguel \\'Angel Garc\\'ia-March, Thom\\'as Fogarty, Steve Campbell,\n  Thomas Busch, Mauro Paternostro", "title": "Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Harmonically Trapped Bosons", "comments": "Short supplementary section available in source files.

Since\nthen, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the\noutcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of\nintegrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review\ndiscusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization\nin integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which\nobservables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of\nthe bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are\nthe differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems\nand in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the\nGGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a\nlot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have\nbeen given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field\nIsing model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show\nthat the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This\nmakes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real\nspace for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a\nspectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed\nthat generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core\nbosons).

The notion of an element of a subset has as its dual\nthe notion of a distinction of a partition (a pair of elements in different\nblocks). Boole developed finite logical probability as the normalized counting\nmeasure on elements of subsets so there is a dual concept of logical entropy\nwhich is the normalized counting measure on distinctions of partitions. Thus\nthe logical notion of information is a measure of distinctions. Classical\nlogical entropy also extends naturally to the notion of quantum logical entropy\nwhich provides a more natural and informative alternative to the usual Von\nNeumann entropy in quantum information theory. The quantum logical entropy of a\npost-measurement density matrix has the simple interpretation as the\nprobability that two independent measurements of the same state using the same\nobservable will have different results. The main result of the paper is that\nthis increase in quantum logical entropy due to a projective measurement of a\npure state is the sum of the absolute squares of the off-diagonal entries\n(`coherences') of the pure state density matrix that are zeroed (decohered) by\nthe measurement, i.e., the measure of the distinctions (`decoherences') created\nby the measurement. The Von Neumann entropy provides no such analysis of\nmeasurement. That result is also classically modelled using ordinary partitions\nand density matrices for such partitions in the pedagogical model of QM/Sets\nwith point probabilities--which for a fixed basis is just sampling a real r.v.\nin classical finite probability theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2016 04:54:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 13:46:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2018 23:00:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ellerman", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.04995", "submitter": "Hamidreza Mohammadi", "authors": "Azam Kheirollahi, Hamidreza Mohammadi and Seyed Javad Akhtarshenasc", "title": "Two-qubit universal and state-dependent quantum cloning machine and\n  quantum correlation broadcasting", "comments": "17 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,\nour study for $d\\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above\nwhich concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number\nof independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the\nlocal difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians\ngoverning the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by\nthe concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is\ncharacterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The\nconcurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with\nthe most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the\nconcurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one\nof the intermediate DCs.

This occurs by the\ncombination of experimental ingenuity and ever simpler theoretical schemes.\nThis thesis comes from the latter perspective, aiming to find new, simpler ways\nin which components of a quantum computer could be built. We first search for\nways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum\ncomputer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on\nqubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body\ninteractions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the\neffect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then\npresent novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single\nstep using linear arrays of qubits, including an assessment of how well these\ngates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using\nstate-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very\ndifferent model from the normal circuit model, combining ideas from\nmeasurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation,\nshowing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \\emph{gflow} can be\nconverted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of\nMBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we\ninvestigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between\ndistant parties, using minimally engineered spin chains. The viability of using\n1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using\nideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking\neffects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 17:23:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Antonio", "Bobby", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05659", "submitter": "Mahboobeh Houshmand", "authors": "Eesa Nikahd, Mahboobeh Houshmand, Morteza Saheb Zamani, Mehdi Sedighi", "title": "One-Way Quantum Computer Simulation", "comments": "27 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Microprocessors and Microsystems,\n  Elsevier, Vol. 39, No. 3, pp. 210-222, May 2015", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations\nare performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled\nstate.

The problem is that the plasma model, although leaving\nout dissipation in the material, apparently gives the best agreement with\nrecent experiments. We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric\nhalf-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following\ncategories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by\nH{\\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is\nreplaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic\npotentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the\nDrude prediction.

(2) Then turning to the field theoretical description implying use of\nthe reflection coefficients, we derive results in agreement with the forgoing\nwhen first setting the frequency equal to zero, before letting the permittivity\nbecoming large. With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero\nfrequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the\nsurfaces and lies between 0 and 1. This contradicts basic electrostatic theory.\n(3) Turning to high permeability magnetic materials the TE zero frequency mode\ndescribes the static magnetic field in the same way as the TM zero frequency\nmodes describe the static electric fields in electrostatics. With the plasma\nmodel magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals.\ni.e.~metals effectively become superconductors.

This result is surprising, because it may take place in\nsystems with long-range interactions, where the dynamics is usually expected to\nbe very fast. A timely example is the one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with\ninfinite-range Ising interaction studied in experiments with ion traps. Its\nHamiltonian has a U(2) algebraic structure. More generally, the slow dynamics\ndescribed here occurs in two-level bosonic or fermionic models with pairing\ninteractions and a U(v+1) Hamiltonian exhibiting a QPT between its limiting\nU(v) and SO(v+1) dynamical symmetries. In this work, we compare the results for\nv=1, 2, and 3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Apr 2016 02:25:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Aug 2016 03:17:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["P\u00e9rez-Bernal", "Francisco", ""], ["Santos", "Lea F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06856", "submitter": "Kevin Lyons", "authors": "Kevin Lyons, Shengshi Pang, Paul G.

The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the\nsmallest $d\\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we\ninitiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the\ncpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank\nof a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is\nphysically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a\nquantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior.\n  In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the\ncompletely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix,\nno general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we\nshow that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically,\nfor any $n\\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz\ncone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the\nconnection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a\nknown lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum\ncorrelations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional\nelliptope.\n  Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every\ndoubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a\ngraph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a\nsubgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 10:57:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Prakash", "Anupam", ""], ["Sikora", "Jamie", ""], ["Varvitsiotis", "Antonios", ""], ["Wei", "Zhaohui", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07210", "submitter": "Vid Stojevic", "authors": "Vid Stojevic, Philip Crowley, Tanja {\\DJ}uri\\'c, Callum Grey, Andrew\n  Green", "title": "Time Evolution and Deterministic Optimisation of Correlator Product\n  States", "comments": "19 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we\ncall photon-added Gaussian channels, which are experimentally viable with\ncurrent quantum-optical technologies. A strong motivation for considering these\nchannels is the fact that it is compulsory to go beyond the Gaussian domain for\nnumerous tasks in continuous-variable quantum information processing such as\nentanglement distillation from Gaussian states and universal quantum\ncomputation. The single-mode photon-added channels we consider are obtained by\nusing two-mode beam splitters and squeezing operators with photon addition\napplied to the ancilla ports giving rise to families of non-Gaussian channels.\nFor each such channel, we derive its operator-sum representation, indispensable\nin the present context. We observe that these channels are Fock preserving\n(coherence nongenerating).

Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be\nincoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create\nlarge amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework\nof genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and\nstudy other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in\nany experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure\nof this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations\nunder these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely\nlimited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does\nnot have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all\nother states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the\nother hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what\ncomes to stochastic manipulation of states.
