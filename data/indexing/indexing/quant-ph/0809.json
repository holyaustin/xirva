It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle\nexternal visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy\nand complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to\ninvestigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a\ndifferent set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there\nis quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material\nsubstrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective\nwavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated\nthat owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in\nneurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for\ncognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle\nway which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and\ndespite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain\nto be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum\nstates of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for\ncollapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility\nfor the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if\nwe accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them\ncan provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 20:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 18:00:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 23:51:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 15:25:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Salari", "V.", ""], ["Rahnama", "M.", ""], ["Tuszynski", "J.

In this paper, we consider a new\nscheme of discrimination of quantum gates, called ancilla-assisted\ndiscrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a $d-$dimensional system are\nperfectly discriminated with assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla system.\nThe main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of\nquantum gates that can be discriminated in this scheme is evaluated. We prove\nthat any $rd+1$ quantum gates cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance\nfrom the ancilla, and there exist $rd$ quantum gates which can be perfectly\ndiscriminated with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the\nminimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant\npositive number $c$ such that for any $k\\leq cr$ quantum gates, if they are\n$d$-assisted discriminable, then they are also $r$-assisted discriminable, and\nthere are $c^{\\prime}r\\textrm{}(c^{\\prime}>c)$ different quantum gates which\ncan be discriminated with a $d-$dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be\ndiscriminated if the ancilla is reduced to an $r-$dimensional system. Thus, the\norder $O(r)$ of the number of quantum gates that can be discriminated with\nassistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in\nthis paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla\nsystem plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit\nof superdense coding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2008 04:49:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jianxin", ""], ["Ying", "Mingsheng", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.0340", "submitter": "Carsten Klempt", "authors": "C.

The electron spin in\na quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted\nrelaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, and a\n(non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum\ndot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction.

The\natoms of the condensate are trapped in a periodic potential generated by a\ncavity mode. The condensate is continuously pumped by a laser and spontaneously\nemits a pair of photons of different frequencies in two distinct cavity modes.\nIn this way, the condensate mediates entanglement between two cavity modes\nwhich leak out and can be separated and exhibit continuous variable\nentanglement. The scheme exploits the experimentally demonstrated strong,\nsteady and collective coupling of condensate atoms to a cavity field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 15:13:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ng", "H.

It is demonstrated that\nin some temperature (separation) region the Casimir-Polder entropy takes\nnegative values and goes to zero when the temperature vanishes. This result is\nobtained both for an ideal metal wall and for real metal walls. Simple\nanalytical representations for the Casimir-Polder free energy and force are\nalso obtained. These results are used to make a comparison between the\nphenomenological potential used in the theoretical description of quantum\nreflection and exact atom-wall interaction energy, as given by the Lifshitz\ntheory. Computations are performed for the atom of metastable He${}^{\\ast}$\ninteracting with metal (Au) and dielectric (Si) walls. It is shown that the\nrelative differences between the exact and phenomenological interaction\nenergies are smaller in the case of a metallic wall. This is explained by the\neffect of negative entropy which occurs only for a metal wall. More accurate\natom-wall interaction energies computed here can be used for the interpretation\nof measurement data in the experiments on quantum reflection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 17:46:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bezerra", "V.
