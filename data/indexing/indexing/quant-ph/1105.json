We prove\nin this paper that the contextual risk approach can be applied to the Ellsberg\nparadox, and elaborate a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement\nformalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual landscape that is\nresponsible of the disagreement between actual human decisions and the\npredictions of expected utility theory, which generates the paradox. This\nresult points to the presence of a 'quantum conceptual layer' in human thought\nwhich is superposed to the usually assumed 'classical logical layer'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 22:39:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1816", "submitter": "Iman Marvian", "authors": "Iman Marvian, Robert W.

A prominent example is the predicted ability for a single\natom to produce quadrature-squeezed light, with sub-shot-noise amplitude or\nphase fluctuations. It has long been foreseen, though, that such squeezing\nwould be \"at least an order of magnitude more difficult\" to observe than the\nemission of single photons. Squeezed beams have been generated using\nmacroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms, but despite\nexperimental efforts, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation.\nHere we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical\nresonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a\ngenuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity, several orders of magnitude larger\nthan for usual macroscopic media. This produces observable quadrature squeezing\nwith an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system\nlifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons, the squeezed\nlight stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system.\nThe ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between\npropagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with\nsingle emitters\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2011 17:55:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:21:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ourjoumtsev", "Alexei", ""], ["Kubanek", "Alexander", ""], ["Koch", "Markus", ""], ["Sames", "Christian", ""], ["Pinkse", "Pepijn W.

The demand that nature be rational, in\nthe sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,\nconflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely\nthe notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is\ndetermined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at\nall. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental\nplace in reason-based Western science. It is argued here, on the basis of the\nother basic principles of quantum physics, that in a world that conforms to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will\nnaturally emerge at the pragmatic level, in cases where the reason behind\nnature's choice of response is unknown, but that the usual statistics can\nbecome biased in an empirically manifest way when the reason for the choice is\nempirically identifiable.

With\nred-sideband optical pumping, the relations are shown to resemble those of a\nbeam splitter for the traveling fields, so that in the ideal case of zero\nparasitic loss and critical coupling, microwave photons can be coherently\nup-converted to \"flying\" optical photons with unit efficiency, and vice versa.\nWith blue-sideband pumping, the modulator acts as a nondegenerate parametric\namplifier, which can generate two-mode squeezing and hybrid entangled photon\npairs at optical and microwave frequencies. These fundamental operations\nprovide a potential bridge between circuit quantum electrodynamics and quantum\noptics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2011 23:17:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 00:45:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tsang", "Mankei", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2342", "submitter": "Mark Srednicki", "authors": "Mark Srednicki", "title": "Nonclassical Degrees of Freedom in the Riemann Hamiltonian", "comments": "4 pages, no figures; v3-6 have minor corrections to v2, v2 has a more\n  complete solution of the sign problem than v1", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary\nquantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the\nother hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum\nsystem is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical\ncomputation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of\nthe unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the\nsymmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are\nmainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general\nefficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum\ndynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the\nunitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the\nsymmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the\nmathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum\nsystem. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of\ncomputational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the\nsymmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new\nquantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for\nexponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum\nalgorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum\nalgorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and\nconventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the\nsymmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on\nthese quantum algorithms.

These\nresults suggest that the overall quality of Josephson junctions in these qubits\nwill allow error rates of a few $10^{-4}$, approaching the error correction\nthreshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 May 2011 22:41:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 19:36:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2011 01:16:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 01:30:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Paik", "Hanhee", ""], ["Schuster", "D.

Quantum mechanics provides us with a new resource, called quantum\nentanglement, which can be exploited to achieve novel tasks such as\nteleportation and superdense coding. Current technologies allow the\ntransmission of entangled photon pairs across distances up to roughly 100\nkilometers. For longer distances, noise arising from various sources degrade\nthe transmission of entanglement to the point that it becomes impossible to use\nthe entanglement as a resource for future tasks. A strategy for dealing with\nthis difficulty is to employ quantum repeaters, stations intermediate between\nthe sender and receiver which participate in the process of entanglement\ndistillation, thereby improving on what the sender and receiver could do on\ntheir own. In this work, we study entanglement distillation between two\nrecipients sharing a mixed state and with the help of repeater stations. We\nextend the notion of entanglement of assistance to arbitrary states and give a\nprotocol for extracting pure entanglement. We also study quantum communication\nprotocols in a more general context. We give a new protocol for the task of\nmultiparty state merging. The previous multiparty state merging protocol\nrequired the use of time-sharing. Our protocol does not require time-sharing\nfor distributed compression of two senders. In the one-shot regime, we achieve\nmultiparty state merging with entanglement costs not restricted to corner\npoints of the entanglement cost region. Our analysis of the entanglement cost\nis performed using (smooth) min- and max-entropies. We illustrate the benefits\nof our approach by looking at different examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 May 2011 23:56:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Dutil", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.4668", "submitter": "Shao-Ming Fei", "authors": "Ming-Jing Zhao, Teng Ma, Shao-Ming Fei, Zhi-Xi Wang", "title": "Inequalities Detecting Quantum Entanglement for $2\\otimes d$ Systems", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.
