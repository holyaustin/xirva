Instead, after the\ninteraction that transfers the population from the initial state to the target\nstate, a second interaction is applied which brings the system back to the\ninitial state, the population of which is easy to measure and normalize. If the\ntransition probability is $p$ in the forward process, then classical intuition\nsuggests that the probability to return to the initial state after the backward\nprocess should be $p^2$. However, this classical expectation is generally\nmisleading because it neglects interference effects. This paper presents a\nrigorous theoretical analysis based on the SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries of the\npropagators describing the evolution of quantum systems with two and three\nstates, resulting in explicit analytic formulas that link the two-step\nprobabilities to the single-step ones. Explicit examples are given with the\npopular techniques of rapid adiabatic passage and stimulated Raman adiabatic\npassage. The present results suggest that quantum-mechanical probabilities\ndegrade faster in repeated processes than classical probabilities.

Unlike the\nordinary purification postulate, symmetric purification applies equally well to\nclassical theory as well as quantum theory. Therefore we first reconstruct the\nfull process theoretic description of quantum theory, consisting of composite\nclassical-quantum systems and their interactions, before restricting ourselves\nto just the `fully quantum' systems as the final step. We propose two novel\nalternative manners of doing so, `no-leaking' (roughly that information gain\ncauses disturbance) and `purity of cups' (roughly the existence of entangled\nstates). Interestingly, these turn out to be equivalent in any process theory\nwith cups & caps. Additionally, we show how the standard purification postulate\ncan be seen as an immediate consequence of the symmetric purification postulate\nand purity of cups.\n  Other tangential results concern the specific frameworks of generalised\nprobabilistic theories (GPTs) and process theories (a.k.a.

Current efforts aim to explore the\ncoherent dynamics of emitters coupled to several electromagnetic modes (EM).\nfreedom. Recently, ultrastrong coupling to a transmission line has been\nachieved where the emitter resonance broadens to a significant fraction of its\nfrequency. In this work we gain significantly improved control over this\nregime. We do so by combining the simplicity of a transmon qubit and a bespoke\nEM environment with a high density of discrete modes, hosted inside a\nsuperconducting metamaterial. This produces a unique device in which the\nhybridisation between the qubit and up to 10 environmental modes can be\nmonitored directly. Moreover the frequency and broadening of the qubit\nresonance can be tuned independently of each other in situ. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our device combines this tunability with ultrastrong coupling\nand a qubit nonlinearity comparable to the other relevant energy scales in the\nsystem. We also develop a quantitative theoretical description that does not\ncontain any phenomenological parameters and that accurately takes into account\nvacuum fluctuations of our large scale quantum circuit in the regime of\nultrastrong coupling and intermediate non-linearity. The demonstration of this\nnew platform combined with a quantitative modelling brings closer the prospect\nof experimentally studying many-body effects in quantum optics. A limitation of\nthe current device is the intermediate nonlinearity of the qubit.

The apparent time direction of the decision tree originates in\nan assumed relative proximity to the initial state.

The latter quantity is a polynomial constructed with the\ncomponents of the wave function $\\psi_{i_1, \\dots, i_n}$ which is invariant\nunder local unitary transformation. For spin 1/2 chains (i.e. $d=2$) with $n=2$\nand $n=3$ sites, the hyperdeterminant coincides with the concurrence and the\ntangle respectively. In this paper we consider spin chains with $n=4$ sites\nwhere the hyperdeterminant is a polynomial of degree 24 containing around $2.8\n\\times 10^6$ terms. This huge object can be written in terms of more simple\npolynomials $S$ and $T$ of degrees 8 and 12 respectively. In this paper we\ncompute $S$, $T$ and the hyperdeterminant for eigenstates of the following spin\nchain Hamiltonians: the transverse Ising model, the XXZ Heisenberg model and\nthe Haldane-Shastry model. Those invariants are also computed for random\nstates, the ground states of random matrix Hamiltonians in the Wigner-Dyson\nGaussian ensembles and the quadripartite entangled states defined by Verstraete\net al. in 2002. Finally, we propose a generalization of the hyperdeterminant to\nthermal density matrices.

Another important\nresult is that the Roughness performs well for discriminating both pure and\nmixed states.

As an\nexciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical\nnonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly\ncorrelated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall\neffect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Feb 2018 16:40:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2019 15:02:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ozawa", "Tomoki", ""], ["Price", "Hannah M.", ""], ["Amo", "Alberto", ""], ["Goldman", "Nathan", ""], ["Hafezi", "Mohammad", ""], ["Lu", "Ling", ""], ["Rechtsman", "Mikael", ""], ["Schuster", "David", ""], ["Simon", "Jonathan", ""], ["Zilberberg", "Oded", ""], ["Carusotto", "Iacopo", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.04196", "submitter": "Michel Planat Dr", "authors": "Michel Planat, Raymond Aschheim, Marcelo M.

Based on this observation we conjecture a modified version of the\nLieb-Robinson bound in dissipative systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Feb 2018 07:46:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yong-Liang", ""], ["Huang", "Yichen", ""], ["Chen", "Xie", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.04530", "submitter": "Christopher Bentley", "authors": "P.-P.

These\ninteractions are described by a new Hamiltonian wave equation overcoming\nshortcomings of currently employed models. For example, the density matrix of\nthe quantum subsystem is always positive-definite. While the Liouville density\nof the classical subsystem is generally allowed to be unsigned, its sign is\nshown to be preserved in time for a specific infinite family of hybrid\nclassical-quantum systems.

The additional coherent driving of the\nthird available transition would form a closed-contour interaction (CCI) from\nwhich fundamentally new phenomena would emerge, including phase-controlled CPT\nand one atom interferometry.

Using photon echo techniques, at a detuning of 160 MHz we measure a\nmaximum ac Stark shift of 2$\\pi\\times$12.3 MHz per intra-cavity photon, which\nis large compared to both the homogeneous linewidth ($\\Gamma_h =$100 kHz) and\ncharacteristic width of isolated spectral features created through optical\npumping ($\\Gamma_f \\approx$3 MHz). The photon-ion interaction strength in the\ndevice is sufficiently large to control the frequency and phase of the ions for\nquantum information processing applications. In particular, we discuss and\nassess the use of the cavity enhanced ac Stark shift to realize all-optical\nquantum memory and detection protocols. Our results establish the ac Stark\nshift as a powerful added control in rare-earth ion quantum technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Feb 2018 01:51:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bartholomew", "John G.", ""], ["Zhong", "Tian", ""], ["Kindem", "Jonathan M.", ""], ["Lopez-Rios", "Raymond", ""], ["Rochman", "Jake", ""], ["Craiciu", "Ioana", ""], ["Miyazono", "Evan", ""], ["Faraon", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.06176", "submitter": "Tapio Simula", "authors": "Bernard Field and Tapio Simula", "title": "Introduction to topological quantum computation with non-Abelian anyons", "comments": "51 pages, 51 figures", "journal-ref": "Quantum Science and Technology (2018)", "doi": "10.1088/2058-9565/aacad2", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Topological quantum computers promise a fault tolerant means to perform\nquantum computation.

Theoretical studies showed\nthat quantum correlations can be used to revert the natural heat flow (from the\nhot body to the cold one), posing an apparent challenge to the second law of\nthermodynamics. Such an \"anomalous\" heat current was observed in a recent\nexperiment (arXiv:1711.03323), by employing two spin systems initially quantum\ncorrelated. Nevertheless, the precise relationship between this intriguing\nphenomenon and the initial conditions that allow it is not fully evident. Here,\nwe address energy transfer in a wider perspective, identifying a nonclassical\ncontribution that applies to the reversion of the heat flow as well as to more\ngeneral forms of energy exchange. We derive three theorems that describe the\nenergy transfer between two microscopic systems, for arbitrary initial\nbipartite states. Using these theorems, we obtain an analytical bound showing\nthat certain type of quantum coherence can optimize such a process,\noutperforming incoherent states. This genuine quantum advantage is corroborated\nthrough a characterization of the energy transfer between two qubits. For this\nsystem, it is shown that a large enough amount of coherence is necessary and\nsufficient to revert the thermodynamic arrow of time. As a second crucial\nconsequence of the presented theorems, we introduce a class of nonequilibrium\nstates that only allow unidirectional energy flow.

Here we show that we can overcome these limitations and obtain any\namount of certified random numbers from an entangled pair of qubit in a pure\nstate by making sequences of measurements on it. Moreover, the state can be\narbitrarily weakly entangled. In addition, this certification is achieved by\nnear-maximal violation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement in\nthe sequence. We also present numerical results giving insight on the\nresistance to imperfections and on the importance of the strength of the\nmeasurements in our scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 10:06:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Curchod", "Florian J.", ""], ["Johansson", "Markus", ""], ["Augusiak", "Remigiusz", ""], ["Hoban", "Matty J.", ""], ["Wittek", "Peter", ""], ["Ac\u00edn", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.07964", "submitter": "Zongping Gong", "authors": "Zongping Gong, Yuto Ashida, Kohei Kawabata, Kazuaki Takasan, Sho\n  Higashikawa, Masahito Ueda", "title": "Topological phases of non-Hermitian systems", "comments": "31 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables, to appear in Physical Review X", "journal-ref": "Phys.

A particular interest centers on the topological\nproperties of non-Hermitian systems, which exhibit unique phases with no\nHermitian counterparts. However, no systematic understanding in analogy with\nthe periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors has been\nachieved. In this paper, we develop a coherent framework of topological phases\nof non-Hermitian systems. After elucidating the physical meaning and the\nmathematical definition of non-Hermitian topological phases, we start with\none-dimensional lattices, which exhibit topological phases with no Hermitian\ncounterparts and are found to be characterized by an integer topological\nwinding number even with no symmetry constraint, reminiscent of the quantum\nHall insulator in Hermitian systems. A system with a nonzero winding number,\nwhich is experimentally measurable from the wave-packet dynamics, is shown to\nbe robust against disorder, a phenomenon observed in the Hatano-Nelson model\nwith asymmetric hopping amplitudes. We also unveil a novel bulk-edge\ncorrespondence that features an infinite number of (quasi-)edge modes. We then\napply the K-theory to systematically classify all the non-Hermitian topological\nphases in the Altland-Zirnbauer classes in all dimensions. The obtained\nperiodic table unifies time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries, leading to\nhighly nontrivial predictions such as the absence of non-Hermitian topological\nphases in two dimensions. We provide concrete examples for all the nontrivial\nnon-Hermitian AZ classes in zero and one dimensions. In particular, we identify\na Z2 topological index for arbitrary quantum channels.

The mission for the\nmachine is to find transfer schemes with fastest speeds while maintaining high\ntransfer fidelities. The first scenario we consider is when the Hamiltonian is\ntime-independent. We update the coupling strength by minimizing a loss function\ndependent on both the fidelity and the speed.

In the second scenario where a time-dependent external field is\nintroduced, we convert the state transfer process into a Markov decision\nprocess that can be understood by the machine. We solve it with the deep\nQ-learning algorithm. After training, the machine successfully finds transfer\nschemes with high fidelities and speeds, which are faster than previously known\nones.

This\nendeavour is a priori challenging, as known Bell inequalities for genuine\nnonlocality suffer from the above shortcomings, plus a number of measurement\nsettings scaling exponentially with the system size. We first show that most of\nthese constraints drop once the witnesses corresponding to these inequalities\nare expressed: in systems where multipartite expectation values can be\nevaluated, these witnesses can reveal genuine nonlocality for an arbitrary\nnumber of particles with just two collective measurements. We then introduce a\ngeneral framework focused on two-body Bell-like inequalities. We show that they\nalso provide information about the number of particles that are genuinely\nnonlocal.

As a second step, we\nreview a more advanced configuration based on reservoirs with a broadband\nfrequency distribution, and we highlight the potential of this configuration\nfor the quantum simulation of equilibrium quantum phases at zero temperature\nwith tunable chemical potential. As a proof of principle we establish the\napplicability of our scheme to the Bose-Hubbard model by confirming the\npresence of a perfect agreement with the ground-state predictions both in the\nMott Insulating and superfluid regions, and more generally in all parts of the\nparameter space.

For long correlation lengths and\nhigher temperature we find that additionally there is a component of the\nmagnetisation which decays very slowly, due to a reduced decay rate of fast\nmagnons. This effect could be useful for fast and noise-protected quantum or\nclassical information transfer and magnonics. We further compare ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic behaviour in noisy environments and find qualitatively\nsimilar behaviour in Ohmic but fundamentally different behaviour in super-Ohmic\nenvironments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 04:27:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 16:54:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Jeske", "Jan", ""], ["Rivas", "\u00c1ngel", ""], ["Ahmed", "Muhammad H.", ""], ["Martin-Delgado", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Cole", "Jared H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10288", "submitter": "Meng Khoon  Tey", "authors": "Yi-Quan Zou, Ling-Na Wu, Qi Liu, Xin-Yu Luo, Shuai-Feng Guo, Jia-Hao\n  Cao, Meng Khoon Tey, Li You", "title": "Beating the classical precision limit with spin-1 Dicke state of more\n  than 10000 atoms", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "PNAS 115 (25), 6381-6385 (2018)", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1715105115", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.quant-gas quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Interferometry is a paradigm for most precision measurements.

Furthermore, resurgent properties of transseries---usually described\nmathematically via alien calculus---are recast in equivalent physical\nlanguages: either a \"statistical mechanical\" language, as motions in chains and\nlattices; or a \"conformal field theoretical\" language, with underlying\nVirasoro-like algebraic structures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 14:47:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 10:14:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Aniceto", "In\u00eas", ""], ["Ba\u015far", "G\u00f6k\u00e7e", ""], ["Schiappa", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10448", "submitter": "Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi", "authors": "Diederik Aerts, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi, Sandro Sozzo and\n  Tomas Veloz", "title": "Quantum cognition goes beyond-quantum: modeling the collective\n  participant in psychological measurements", "comments": "19 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Probing the Meaning of Quantum Mechanics, World Scientific, pp.\n  355-382 (2019)", "doi": "10.1142/9789813276895_0017", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cs.AI quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In psychological measurements, two levels should be distinguished: the\n'individual level', relative to the different participants in a given cognitive\nsituation, and the 'collective level', relative to the overall statistics of\ntheir outcomes, which we propose to associate with a notion of 'collective\nparticipant'.

The\nlatter consists of a superconducting circuit, where a LC-resonator is coupled\nto a Josephson junction. The oscillator state fuels the engine, providing\nenergy absorbed by Cooper pairs, thus producing work in the form of an\nelectrical current against an external voltage bias. We show that this machine\ncan extract the maximal amount of work from all Gaussian and Fock states.\nFurthermore, we consider work extraction from a continuously stabilized\noscillator state. In both scenarios, coherence between energy eigenstates is\nbeneficial, increasing the power output of the machine.
