Results show that the quantum correlations\nbetween the monitored (monitoring) systems is considerably decreased\n(increased) as the measurement precision nears the exceptional point, at which\nthe passage time is half of the measurement duration. The results indicate that\nthe underlying mechanism by which the non-classical correlations of quantum\nsystems are transferred from one subsystem to another may be better revealed\nvia use of geometric approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 03:51:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Thilagam", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.0766", "submitter": "Doron Cohen", "authors": "Dotan Davidovich, Doron Cohen", "title": "Multiple path adiabatic crossing in a 3 site ring", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures, J.

The\nunderlying mechanism that allows for the possibility of both entanglement\nengineering and entanglement protection is the strong \"spin-orbit\" coupling\ninduced by the QW.

For a Dirac particle, the Hamiltonian and energy operators H\nand E were recently proved to depend on the tetrad field. We argue that this\nnon-uniqueness of H and E really is a physical problem. We compute the energy\noperator in the inertial and the rotating frame, using three tetrad fields: one\nfor each of two frameworks proposed to select the tetrad field so as to solve\nthis non-uniqueness problem, and one proposed by Ryder.

These properties are\na consequence of their weak interactions within a nearly linear medium. To\ncreate and manipulate nonclassical states of light, however, one requires a\nstrong, nonlinear interaction at the single photon level. One approach to\ngenerate suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong\ncoupling regime of cavity QED systems. In these systems, however, one only\nindirectly controls the quantum state of the light by manipulating the atoms. A\ndirect photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which\ntypically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So\nfar, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, where the\ninteraction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here,\nusing a 3D circuit QED architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium\nwhich enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We\nrealize a Gedankenexperiment proposed by Yurke and Stoler, in which the\ncollapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution\nis a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the\nnonlinear interaction between individual photons. During this evolution\nnon-classical superpositions of coherent states, i.e. multi-component\nSchroedinger cat states, are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring\nthe Husimi Q-function and confirm the non-classical properties of these\ntransient states by Wigner tomography.

The weaker the coupling,\nthe smaller the back-action on the system, but also the less information\nconveyed. If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected. However, for\na weak measurement in solid-state devices, an interaction of finite duration is\nlikely needed.\n  Here, we show how this finite duration generates a contribution of the\ndynamical phase to the readout statistics. Furthermore, we derive interpolation\nformulas that are able to describe the statistics of the weak measurement for\nthe whole range of pre- and postselected states. Phase-space averages appear in\nthe expansion, suggesting an interpretation in terms of non-positive\nprobabilities.

An\nexhaustive analysis of this kind of entanglement is performed, where the focus\nis on bipartite entanglement.

For example, entanglement witnessing is discussed not only for\nhybrid entangled states, but also for fully continuous variable two-mode\nSchroedinger cat states.

The present paper aims to clarify the situation. A known\nalgorithm for calculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\\epsilon j}$ on the\nbackground of the de Sitter space-time model is analyzed. It is shown that the\ndetermination of $R_{\\epsilon j}$ requires an additional constrain on quantum\nnumbers $\\epsilon R / \\hbar c >> j$, where $R$ is a curvature radius. When\ntaking into account this condition, the value of $R_{\\epsilon j}$ turns out to\nbe precisely zero. It is shown that the basic instructive definition for the\ncalculation of the reflection coefficient in de Sitter model is grounded\nexclusively on the use of zero order approximation in the expansion of a\nparticle wave function in a series on small parameter $1/R^{2}$, and it\ndemonstrated that this recipe cannot be extended on accounting for\ncontributions of higher order terms. So the result $R_{\\epsilon j}=0$ which has\nbeen obtained from examining zero-order term persists and cannot be improved.\nIt is claimed that the alculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\\epsilon\nj}$ is not required at all because there is no barrier in the effective\npotential curve on the background of the de Sitter space-time, the later\ncorrelate with the fact that the problem in de Sitter space reduces to a second\norder differential equation with only three singular points. However all known\nquantum mechanical problems with potentials containing one barrier reduce to a\nsecond order differential equation with four singular points, the equation of\nHeun class.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Nov 2012 16:57:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Red'kov", "V.", ""], ["Ovsiyuk", "E.", ""], ["Krylov", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.4250", "submitter": "Giannicola Scarpa", "authors": "Adan Cabello, Matthew G.

Lastly, we discuss in a\nspecific example how much a dissipation-induced pure Gaussian state can be\nperturbed by decoherence and parameter error.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Nov 2012 17:52:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Apr 2013 23:29:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ikeda", "Yusuke", ""], ["Yamamoto", "Naoki", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.5794", "submitter": "Alex Chao Han", "authors": "Alex C.

One might then wonder, does this\nquantum circuit produce a state that is separable or entangled? Here, we give\nevidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question,\neven if one has access to the power of quantum computation. We begin by\nexhibiting a two-message quantum interactive proof system that can decide the\nanswer to a promise version of the question. We then prove that the promise\nproblem is hard for the class of promise problems with \"quantum statistical\nzero knowledge\" (QSZK) proof systems by demonstrating a polynomial-time Karp\nreduction from the QSZK-complete promise problem \"quantum state\ndistinguishability\" to our quantum separability problem. By exploiting Knill's\nefficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a\ncircuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard\nwith respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as\nphrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a\ntwo-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and\nQSZK. We also consider a variant of the problem, in which a given\npolynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit accepts a quantum state as input,\nand the question is to decide if there is an input to this circuit which makes\nits output separable across some bipartite cut.
