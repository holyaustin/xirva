The generalized gradient approximation is a useful diagnostic for the\naccuracy of the local density approximation---when both methods agree, they are\nlikely accurate, when they disagree, neither is likely to be correct.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 00:44:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Freericks", "J.

The fabrication and\ncharacterization of novel luminescent defects with suitable opto-physical\nproperties is therefore of primary importance for further advances in these\nresearch fields. In this work we report on the investigation in the formation\nof photoluminescent (PL) defects upon MeV He implantation in diamond. Such\ncolor centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and\ncathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and\n560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between\nthe PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He\nimplantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL\nemission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were\neither unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover,\nthe PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the\ngraphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to\noptically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities.\nThe intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a\nfunction of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission\nwas observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\\deg}C, at the\nexpenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission\nintensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates\nfrom the formation of a stable lattice defect.

It is found that at\nboth zero and nonzero temperature $T$ the in-plane and out-of-plane\nconductivities of graphene are equal to each other with a high precision and\nessentially do not depend on the wave vector. At $T=0$ the conductivity of\ngraphene is real and equal to $\\sigma_0=e^2/(4\\hbar)$ up to small nonlocal\ncorrections in accordance with many authors. At some fixed $T\\neq 0$ the real\npart of the conductivity varies between zero at low frequencies $\\omega$ and\n$\\sigma_0$ for optical $\\omega$. If $\\omega$ is fixed, the conductivity varies\nbetween $\\sigma_0$ at low $T$ and zero at high $T$. The imaginary part of the\nconductivity of graphene is shown to depend on the ratio of $\\omega$ to $T$. In\naccordance to the obtained asymptotic expressions, at fixed $T$ it varies from\ninfinity at $\\omega=0$ to a negative minimum value reached at some $\\omega$,\nand then approaches to zero with further increase of $\\omega$. At fixed\n$\\omega$ the imaginary part of the conductivity varies from zero at $T=0$,\nreaches a negative minimum at some $T$ and then goes to infinity together with\n$T$. The numerical computations of both the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity are performed. The above results are obtained in the framework of\nquantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature and can be generalized for\ngraphene samples with nonzero mass gap parameter and chemical potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:43:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Klimchitskaya", "G.

In the distill step, one performs several rounds of\ndistillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such\nmagic state provides one good T gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the\noptimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many T gates\ninterleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood\nfor multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth\nanalysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and\nmultiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation\nprotocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This\nis because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the\nsame number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic\nerror suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated\nby control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines\nused in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a\ncostly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional\nresults on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient\nalgorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling\nas optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing\ncontrolled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly\noptimal.

The resulting counting statistics of\nstochastic jumps is used to identify the spectrum of the dynamical generator of\nthe QSW, serving as a novel graph invariant, based on which non-isomorphic\ngraphs are distinguished.

We numerically\ndemonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time-dependent Wigner\ndistribution, which is directly measurable in time-resolved ARPES experiments.\nOur results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence\nof a gapped bulk, and thus suggest experimental signatures of a novel\nsurface-bulk coupling mechanism that is fundamental for proposals to engineer\nnon-trivial states by periodic driving.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 20:01:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 07:38:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kolodrubetz", "Michael", ""], ["Fregoso", "Benjamin M.", ""], ["Moore", "Joel E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03467", "submitter": "Yefim Levin Semenovitch", "authors": "Yefim S.

Second, we present a setup for two\nmechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode\nsqueezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case.

Bell's nonlocality for\nquantum states is usually detected by violation of some Bell's inequalities,\nsuch as Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits. Steering is a\nmanifestation of nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's\nnonlocality. This peculiar feature has led to a curious quantum phenomenon, the\none-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. The one-way steering was an important\nopen question presented in 2007, and positively answered in 2014 by Bowles\n\\emph{et al.}, who presented a simple class of one-way steerable states in a\ntwo-qubit system with at least thirteen projective measurements. The inspiring\nresult for the first time theoretically confirms quantum nonlocality can be\nfundamentally asymmetric. Here, we propose another curious quantum phenomenon:\nBell nonlocal states can be constructed from some steerable states. This novel\nfinding not only offers a distinctive way to study Bell's nonlocality without\nBell's inequality but with steering inequality, but also may avoid locality\nloophole in Bell's tests and make Bell's nonlocality easier for demonstration.\nFurthermore, a nine-setting steering inequality has also been presented for\ndeveloping more efficient one-way steering and detecting some Bell nonlocal\nstates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 03:33:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 03:49:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jing-Ling", ""], ["Ren", "Changliang", ""], ["Chen", "Changbo", ""], ["Ye", "Xiang-Jun", ""], ["Pati", "Arun Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.07076", "submitter": "Naoki Watamura", "authors": "Masahiro Nozaki, Naoki Watamura", "title": "Quantum Entanglement of Locally Excited States in Maxwell Theory", "comments": "23 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/JHEP12(2016)069", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In 4 dimensional Maxwell gauge theory, we study the changes of (Renyi)\nentangle-ment entropy which are defined by subtracting the entropy for the\nground state from the one for the locally excited states generated by acting\nwith the gauge invariant local operators on the state.

Nonlinear time dependence of the energy detuning from the\nF\\\"{o}rster resonance is used to achieve a high fidelity of population transfer\nbetween Rydberg states. Fidelity of two-qubit gates has been studied with an\nexample of the $90S+96S\\to 90P+95P$ Stark-tuned F\\\"{o}rster resonance in Cs\nRydberg atoms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 10:27:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 06:30:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 09:03:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Beterov", "I.

Upper and (almost) tight lower\nbounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in\nterms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the\ndimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized\nBell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell\ninequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1\nfor any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell\ninequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell\ninequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell\ninequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We\nshow how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum\ncommunication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication\nis proven using these lower bound techniques.
