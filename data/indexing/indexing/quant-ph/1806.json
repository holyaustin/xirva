Currently, the postprocessing mainly\ncontains four steps in the following order: sifting, parameter estimation,\ninformation reconciliation, and privacy amplification. For a quantum channel\nwith unknown prior characteristics, part of the raw keys (typically half) have\nto be sacrificed to estimate the channel parameters, which is used to assist in\nerror correction (part of information reconciliation) and estimate the secret\nkey rate. This introduces a tradeoff between the secret key rate and the\naccuracy of parameter estimation when considering the finite-size effect. In\nthis paper, we propose a high efficiency postprocessing method which uses all\nthe raw keys for both parameter estimation and key extraction. It is realized\nby exchanging the order of parameter estimation and information reconciliation,\nwhile the other steps remain unchanged. After the sifting step, the extra data\n(used for phase compensation and synchronization etc) can be used to roughly\nestimate the quantum channel parameters, or using the estimated results of last\nblock, thus the error correction can be realized normally. After the success of\nerror correction, the reconciler recovers the raw keys of the other side by a\nreverse mapping function. Then she uses all the raw keys of both sides for\nparameter estimation to estimate the quantum channel parameters and calculate\nthe secret key rate of the system. Finally, they perform the privacy\namplification step to obtain the unconditional security keys.

Inspired by the optimal tuning\nstrategy for frontier orbital energies [Stein, Kronik, and Baer, {\\it J. Am.\nChem.

However, here we point out that the problem can also be dealt\nwith from a reduced dynamics perspective. The key point is that the noise\nsuperoperator acting on the system must be suitably updated after measurement\ninterventions. Also considered is the effect of Markovian versus non-Markovian\nbehavior as well as classically non-Markovian processes on the violation of\nLeggett-Garg inequalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 14:53:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 Nov 2020 15:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Naikoo", "Javid", ""], ["Banerjee", "Subhashish", ""], ["Srikanth", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.00538", "submitter": "Gerardo Adesso", "authors": "Gerardo Adesso, Rosario Lo Franco, Valentina Parigi", "title": "Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact on contemporary\n  society", "comments": "3 pages, Introduction to Special Issue on \"Foundations of quantum\n  mechanics and their impact on contemporary society\" on Phil.

Previously,\nthe non-classical character of neutrino oscillation was tested with the\nLeggett-Garg inequality, where a clear violation of the classical bound was\nobserved [J. A. Formaggio et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 050402 (2016)].\nHowever, there are several limitations in testing neutrino oscillations with\nthe Leggett-Garg inequality. In particular, the degree of violation of the\nLeggett-Garg inequality cannot be taken as a \"measure of quantumness\". Here we\nfocus on quantifying the quantumness of experimentally-observed neutrino\noscillation, using the tools of recently-developed quantum resource theory. We\nanalyzed ensembles of reactor and accelerator neutrinos at distinct energies\nfrom a variety of neutrino sources, including Daya Bay (0.5 km and 1.6 km),\nKamland (180 km), MINOS (735 km), and T2K (295 km). The quantumness of the\nthree-flavoured neutrino oscillation is characterized within a 3{\\sigma} range\nrelative to the theoretical prediction. It is found that the maximal coherence\nwas observed in the neutrino source from the Kamland reactor. However, even\nthough the survival probability of the Daya Bay experiment did not vary\nsignificantly (dropped about 10 percent), the coherence recorded can reach up\nto 40 percent of the maximal value.

Specifically, we use PD\ntechniques to decompose a target molecular system into smaller subsystems\nrequiring fewer computational resources. In our framework, there are two levels\nof hybridization. At the first level, we use a classical algorithm to decompose\na target molecule into subsystems, and utilize a quantum algorithm to simulate\nthe quantum nature of the subsystems. The second level is in the quantum\nalgorithm. We consider the quantum--classical variational algorithm that\niterates between an expectation estimation using a quantum device and a\nparameter optimization using a classical device. We investigate three popular\nPD techniques for our hybrid approach: the fragment molecular-orbital (FMO)\nmethod, the divide-and-conquer (DC) technique, and the density matrix embedding\ntheory (DMET). We examine the efficacy of these techniques in correctly\ndifferentiating conformations of simple alkane molecules.

The contributions of this work are threefold. First of all,\nwe build upon the abstract theory of boundaries and domain walls of topological\nphases of matter to comprehensively catalog the objects realizable in color\ncodes. Together with our classification we also provide lattice representations\nof these objects which include three new types of boundaries as well as a\ngenerating set for all 72 color code twist defects. Our work thus provides an\nexplicit toy model that will help to better understand the abstract theory of\ndomain walls. Secondly, we discover a number of interesting new applications of\nthe cataloged objects for quantum information protocols. These include improved\nmethods for performing quantum computations by code deformation, a new\nfour-qubit error-detecting code, as well as families of new quantum\nerror-correcting codes we call stellated color codes, which encode logical\nqubits at the same distance as the next best color code, but using\napproximately half the number of physical qubits. To the best of our knowledge,\nour new topological codes have the highest encoding rate of local stabilizer\ncodes with bounded-weight stabilizers in two dimensions.

Ensembles were introduced in XIX century to bridge that\nchasm between continuous motion of phase space points in Newtonian dynamics and\nstasis of thermodynamics: While states of individual classical systems\ninevitably evolve, a phase space distribution of such states -- an ensemble --\ncan be time-independent. I show that entanglement (e.g., with the environment)\ncan yield a time-independent equilibrium in an individual quantum system. This\nallows one to eliminate ensembles -- an awkward stratagem introduced to\nreconcile thermodynamics with Newtonian mechanics -- and use an individual\nsystem interacting and therefore entangled with its heat bath to represent\nequilibrium and to elucidate the role of information and measurements in\nphysics. Thus, in our quantum Universe one can practice statistical physics\nwithout ensembles -- hence, in a sense, without statistics. The elimination of\nensembles uses ideas that led to the recent derivation of Born's rule from the\nsymmetries of entanglement, and I start with a review of that derivation.

In general, a finite\nrange of interaction leads to on-site, inter-site, exchange and\npartial-exchange terms.

Given the proximity of the energy levels in the D1\nline of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb, we are able to operate the FWM in $^{85}$Rb in\na regime that generates two-mode squeezed states in which both modes are\nsimultaneously on resonance with transitions in the D1 line of $^{87}$Rb, one\nmode with the $F=2$ to $F'=2$ transition and the other one with the $F=1$ to\n$F'=1$ transition. For this configuration, we obtain an intensity difference\nsqueezing level of $-3.5$ dB. Moreover, the intensity difference squeezing\nincreases to $-5.4$ dB and $-5.0$ dB when only one of the modes of the squeezed\nstate is resonant with the D1 $F=2$ to $F'=2$ or $F=1$ to $F'=1$ transition of\n$^{87}$Rb, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2018 23:40:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Saesun", ""], ["Marino", "Alberto M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.04862", "submitter": "Kevin Fischer", "authors": "Kevin A.

First, we add an anchor to the argument of the\nexponential in the CBA. The anchor is a permutation-dependent integral multiple\nof 2 pi. Once anchored, the distribution of these arguments simplifies,\nbecoming approximately Gaussian. The wave function is given by the Fourier\ntransform of this distribution and so the calculation of the wave function\nreduces to the calculation of the moments of the distribution. Second, we\nparametrize the permutation group as a map between integers and we bin these\nmaps. The calculation of the moments then reduces to a combinatorial exercise\non the partitioning into bins. As an example we consider the matrix element\nbetween the classical and quantum ground states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2018 14:37:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 09:36:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Evslin", "Jarah", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.07793", "submitter": "Jens Jakob S{\\o}rensen", "authors": "Jens Jakob S{\\o}rensen, Mogens Dalgaard, Alexander Holm Kiilerich,\n  Klaus M{\\o}lmer, Jacob Sherson", "title": "Quantum Control with Measurements and Quantum Zeno Dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

Nonetheless, one may expect sequences of bits generated by\nQRNGs to have properties that pseudo-random sequences do not; indeed,\npseudo-random sequences are necessarily computable, a highly nontypical\nproperty of sequences.\n  In this paper, we discuss the differences between QRNGs and PRNGs and the\nchallenges involved in certifying the quality of QRNGs theoretically and\ntesting their output experimentally. While QRNGs are often tested with standard\nsuites of statistical tests, such tests are designed for PRNGs and only verify\nstatistical properties of a QRNG, but are insensitive to many supposed\nadvantages of QRNGs. We discuss the ability to test the incomputability and\nalgorithmic complexity of QRNGs. While such properties cannot be directly\nverified with certainty, we show how one can construct indirect tests that may\nprovide evidence for the incomputability of QRNGs. We use these tests to\ncompare various PRNGs to a QRNG, based on superconducting transmon qutrits and\ncertified by the Kochen-Specker Theorem, to see whether such evidence can be\nfound in practice.\n  While our tests fail to observe a strong advantage of the quantum random\nsequences due to algorithmic properties, the results are nonetheless\ninformative: some of the test results are ambiguous and require further study,\nwhile others highlight difficulties that can guide the development of future\ntests of algorithmic randomness and incomputability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jun 2018 16:44:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:48:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Abbott", "Alastair A.", ""], ["Calude", "Cristian S.", ""], ["Dinneen", "Michael J.", ""], ["Huang", "Nan", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.08774", "submitter": "Juan Camilo L\\'opez Carre\\~no", "authors": "Juan Camilo L\\'opez Carre\\~no, Eduardo Zubizarreta Casalengua, Fabrice\n  P.

In particular, in\nmeasurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are\ngenerated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification\nprotocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are\nparticularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a\nsingle state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol\ncurrently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size\nof the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more\nresource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires\n$O(n^5\\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a\nprobability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also\nenables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph\nstates. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is\nnon-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph\nstates that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit\nand continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the\nresource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de\nFinetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our\nprotocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and\ntherefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not\nincrease the overhead.

A variety of many-body\nsystems can be represented in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving on\nthe Bloch sphere, where each momentum mode is decoupled and thus can be\nsimulated independently by a single qubit.

In our experiment, the spin\nstate, which is initially polarized longitudinally, evolves based on a\nHamiltonian with adjustable parameters depending on the momentum and strength\nof the transverse magnetic field. The time evolving quantum state is read out\nby state tomography. Evidence of dynamical quantum phase transitions, such as\npaths of time evolution states on the Bloch sphere, non-analytic behavior of\nthe dynamical free energy and the emergence of Skyrmion lattice in\nmomentum-time space, is observed.

Feasibility of the scheme realized with Cs atoms is discussed\nin detail, which shows that the two-qubit gate via Landau-Zener control can be\nrealized with the state-of-the-art experimental setup.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 03:01:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2018 16:33:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2018 14:11:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 11:15:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Xi-Rong", ""], ["Ding", "Zong-Xing", ""], ["Hu", "Chang-Sheng", ""], ["Shen", "Li-Tuo", ""], ["Li", "Weibin", ""], ["Wu", "Huaizhi", ""], ["Zheng", "Shi-Biao", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.09812", "submitter": "Raffi Nazaryan", "authors": "A.

We demonstrate\nthat (i) $C \\in \\left[ { - 1,\\frac{1}{{27}}} \\right]$ if two qubits are\ninfluenced by quantum common causes; (ii) $C \\in \\left[ { - \\frac{1}{{27}},1}\n\\right]$ if the relation between two qubits is quantum causality; (iii) a\ngeometric picture can illuminate the geometric interpretation of the\nprobabilistic mixture of quantum common causes and quantum causality. This\ngeometric picture also provides a basic heuristic to develop more complete\nmethods for discriminating the cases corresponding to $C \\in \\left[ { -\n\\frac{1}{{27}},\\frac{1}{{27}}} \\right]$. Our results demonstrate that quantum\ncommon causes and quantum causality can be discriminated in a considerable\nscope.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 15:06:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2018 15:26:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Mingdi", ""], ["Hou", "Yuexian", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.10063", "submitter": "Fabio Bagarello Dr.", "authors": "Fabio Bagarello", "title": "Finite-dimensional pseudo-bosons: a non-Hermitian version of the\n  truncated harmonic oscillator", "comments": "in press in Physics Letters A", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physleta.2018.06.044", "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a deformed version of the commutation rule introduced in 1967 by\nBuchdahl to describe a particular model of the truncated harmonic oscillator.\nThe rule we consider is defined on a $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\Hil_N$,\nand produces two biorhogonal bases of $\\Hil_N$ which are eigenstates of the\nHamiltonians $h=\\frac{1}{2}(q^2+p^2)$, and of its adjoint $h^\\dagger$.

One motivation is to find\na consistent unification of quantum theory and gravity, in which collapse\nprevents superpositions of space-times from developing. Another is to invoke\ncollapse to explain our perception of definite measurement outcomes. Combining\nthese motivations while avoiding two different collapse postulates seems to\nrequire that perceptibly different physical states necessarily create\nsignificantly different mass distributions in our organs of perception or\nbrains. Bassi et al. investigated this question in the context of mass density\ndependent spontaneous collapse models.

I reanalyse their arguments, and note a key problem: they treat\nthe relevant processes as though they take place in vacuo, rather than in\ncytoplasm. This makes a significant difference, since the models imply that\nsuperpositions collapse at rates that depend on the difference between the\ncoarse grained mass densities of their components. This increases the required\ncollapse rate, most likely by at least an order of magnitude and plausibly by\nsignificantly more. This casts some doubt on the claim that there are collapse\nmodel parameters consistent with known experiment that imply collapse times of\n<~ 100ms within the human eye.

In terms of\nthis coherence measure, the distribution of quantum coherence in multipartite\nsystems is studied and a corresponding polygamy relation is proposed. Its\noperational meanings and the relations between the generation of quantum\ncorrelations and the coherence are also investigated. Moreover, we present\nHellinger distance-based measure of non-classical correlation, which not only\ninherits the nice properties of the Hellinger distance including contractivity,\nand but also shows a powerful analytic computability for a large class of\nquantum states. We show that there is an explicit trade-off relation satisfied\nby the quantum coherence and this non-classical correlation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 08:11:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Zhi-Xiang", ""], ["Fei", "Shao-Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.10871", "submitter": "Peng Xue Dr.", "authors": "Kunkun Wang, Xingze Qiu, Lei Xiao, Xiang Zhan, Zhihao Bian, Wei Yi,\n  and Peng Xue", "title": "Simulating dynamic quantum phase transitions in photonic quantum walks", "comments": "13 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In our previous work\n[arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of \"quantum\nscarred\" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized\nmodel. Here we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the\nsame model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous\nthermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs\nensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum,\nwe identify non-ergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number\ngrows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were\nidentified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to\nexplain the revivals observed in experiment. Here we find that these\neigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local\nobservables, also exhibit sub-thermal entanglement entropy that scales\nlogarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class\nof quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the\ndynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering\napproximation to describe the structure and physical properties of\nquantum-scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars\nto various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the\nintroduced perturbation is compatible with the forward scattering\napproximation. In contrast, the perturbations which most efficiently destroy\nquantum scars also lead to the restoration of \"canonical\" thermalization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:05:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:46:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Turner", "C.
