We compare the transport\nproperties of pure and mixed-state chains, finding similarities that enable the\nexperimental study of pure-state transfer by its simulation via mixed-state\nchains, and demonstrate protocols for the perfect transfer of quantum\ninformation in these chains. Remarkably, mixed-state chains allow the use of\nHamiltonians which do not preserve the total number of excitations, and which\nare more readily obtainable from the naturally occurring magnetic dipolar\ninteraction.

The indispensability of detectors plays an important\nrole. Changes of separation status are alterations of kinematic description\nrather than some parts of dynamical trajectories and so more radical than\n'collapse of the wave function'. Textbook quantum mechanics does not provide\nany information of how separation status changes run, hence new rules must be\nformulated. This enables to satisfy the objectification requirement for\nregistrations. To show how the ideas work, a simplified model of registration\napparatus is constructed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Nov 2010 08:57:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Mar 2011 13:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2011 12:36:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hajicek", "Petr", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1736", "submitter": "Zhihao Ma", "authors": "Zhihao Ma, Zhi-Hua Chen", "title": "Analytical Bound of Concurrence", "comments": "there is a small error, make the bound too big", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give an analytical lower bound of concurrence for both bipartite and\nmultipartite quantum states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Nov 2010 09:17:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2011 08:12:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Zhihao", ""], ["Chen", "Zhi-Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1751", "submitter": "Christian Brouder", "authors": "Christian Brouder (IMPMC), G\\'erard H.

This discrimination is performed by inputting one-mode or\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states with fixed total energy. By optimizing over\nthis class of states, we find that the optimal inputs are pure, thus\ncorresponding to single- and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In particular, we\nshow that for any value of the damping rate smaller than a critical value there\nis a threshold on the energy that makes the two-mode squeezed vacuum state more\nconvenient than the corresponding single-mode state, whereas for damping larger\nthan this critical value two-mode squeezed vacua are always better. We then\nconsider the discrimination in realistic conditions, where it is unlikely to\nhave pure squeezing. Thus by fixing both input energy and squeezing, we show\nthat two-mode squeezed thermal states are always better than their single- mode\ncounterpart when all the thermal photons are directed into the dissipative\nchannel. Besides, this result also holds approximately for unbalanced\ndistribution of the thermal photons. Finally, we also investigate the role of\ncorrelations in the improvement of detection. For fixed input squeezing\n(single-mode or two-mode), we find that the reduction of the quantum Chernoff\nbound is a monotone function of the two-mode entanglement as well as the\nquantum mutual information and the quantum discord.

These bounds are used to judge how far a particular measurement is\nremoved from the optimal one.

We then propose a two-step\nstrategy to determine the (possibly mixed) state of n identically prepared\nqubits, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in a local minimax sense,\nusing `Quantum Local Asymptotic Normality' for qubits. We propose a physical\nimplementation of QLAN, based on interaction with the quantized EM field. In\ndifferential geometry, a bundle is called `natural' if diffeomorphisms of the\nbase lift to automorphisms of the bundle. We slightly extend this notion to\n`infinitesimal naturality', requiring only vector fields (infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphisms) to lift. We classify these bundles. Physical fields that\ntransform under (infinitesimal) space-time transformations must be described in\nterms of (infinitesimally) natural bundles. All spin structures are\ninfinitesimally natural. Our framework thus encompasses Fermionic fields, for\nwhich the notion of a natural bundle is too restrictive. Interestingly,\ngeneralized spin structures (e.g. spin-c structures) are not always\ninfinitesimally natural. We classify the ones that are.

A number of recent experiments have\nshown that the photoluminescence intensity in free standing nanowires is\npolarization dependent. One contribution to this effect is the anisotropy of\nthe dielectric function due to the fact that most nanowires crystalize in the\nwurtzite form. While little is known experimentally about the band structures\nwurtzite phase III-V semiconductors, we have previously predicted the bulk band\nstructure of nine III-V semiconductors in wurtzite phase.Here, we predict the\nfrequency dependent dielectric functions for nine non-Nitride wurtzite phase\nIII-V semiconductors (AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs and InSb).\nTheir complex dielectric functions are calculated in the dipole approximation\nby evaluating the momentum matrix elements on a dense grid of special k-points\nusing empirical pseudopotential wave functions.

There is no need to appeal to any `wave function'. To describe\na quantum system, we define the Clifford density element [CDE] as a product of\nan element of a minimal left ideal and its Clifford conjugate. The properties\nof the system are then completely specified in terms of bilinear invariants of\nthe first and second kind calculated using the CDE. Thus the quantum properties\nof a system can be completely described from within the algebra without the\nneed to appeal to any Hilbert space representation.\n  Furthermore we show that the essential bilinear invariants of the second kind\nare simply the Bohm energy and the Bohm momentum, entities that make their\nappearance in the Bohm interpretation. We also show how these parameters emerge\nfrom standard quantum field theory in the low energy, single particle\napproximation.

This result demonstrates again that the\ncommon perception that it is not possible to construct a fully relativistic\nversion of the Bohm approach is incorrect. We obtain the fully relativistic\nversion by using an approach based on Clifford algebras outlined in two earlier\npapers by Hiley and by Hiley and Callaghan. The relativistic model is different\nfrom the one originally proposed by Bohm and Hiley and by Doran and Lasenby. We\nobtain exact expressions for the Bohm energy-momentum density, a relativistic\nquantum Hamilton-Jacobi for the conservation of energy which includes an\nexpression for the quantum potential and a relativistic time development\nequation for the spin vectors of the particle. We then show that these reduce\nto the corresponding non-relativistic expressions for the Pauli particle which\nhave already been derived by Bohm, Schiller and Tiomno and in more general form\nby Hiley and Callaghan.

Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which\ninternally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it\nemerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal\nworkings of the device.

PQT\nmakes sense of the quantum world. PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT\nand is, furthermore, empirically testable (although not as yet tested). I argue\nthat Einstein almost put forward this version of quantum theory in 1916/17 in\nhis papers on spontaneous and induced radiative transitions, but retreated from\ndoing so because he disliked the probabilistic character of the idea.\nSubsequently, the idea was overlooked because debates about quantum theory\npolarised into the Bohr/Heisenberg camp, which argued for the abandonment of\nrealism and determinism, and the Einstein/Schr\\\"odinger camp, which argued for\nthe retention of realism and determinism, no one, as a result, pursuing the\nmost obvious option of retaining realism but abandoning determinism.

Dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low\ncontrol overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant\nsequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by\nUDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the\nrelative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state\nnuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the\nenvironment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close\nto a normal (Gaussian) distribution. We find that in the presence of such a\nbath, the CPMG sequence outperforms the UDD sequence.

We demonstrate that even under a few imperfect\nmeasurements it is possible to detect transitions of the qubit from its free\nground state to the excited state. The excitation probability grows\nexponentially fast in analogy with the quantum anti-Zeno effect. The dynamics\nand physics described in this paper is accessible to current superconducting\ncircuit technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 17:26:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 15:51:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sab\u00edn", "C.", ""], ["Le\u00f3n", "J.", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Ripoll", "J.

Furthermore we show that the\nminimum time required to enter this regime is $T\\sim \\pi/\\Delta$, where\n$\\Delta$ is the minimum spectral gap, unveiling an intimate connection between\nan optimized unitary dynamics and the intrinsic measure of the Hilbert space\nfor pure states. Surprisingly, the dynamics is non-adiabatic, this result can\nbe understood by assuming a simple two-level dynamics for the many-body system.\nFinally we classify the possible dynamical regimes in terms of the action\n$s=T\\Delta$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 18:16:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 12:30:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Caneva", "T.", ""], ["Calarco", "T.", ""], ["Fazio", "R.", ""], ["Santoro", "G.
