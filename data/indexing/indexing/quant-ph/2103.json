The result is a category-theoretic framework for\ndiscussing the following general question: How do different implementations of\nthe same input-output process compare to each other? In the proposed framework,\nan input-output process is modelled by a causally structured channel in some\nfixed theory, and its implementations are modelled by causally structured\ndilations formalising hidden side-computations. These dilations compare through\na pre-order formalising relative strength of side-computations. Chapter 1\nreviews a mathematical model for physical theories as semicartesian symmetric\nmonoidal categories. Many concrete examples are discussed, in particular\nquantum and classical information theory. The key feature is that the model\nfacilitates the notion of dilations. Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of\ndilations. It introduces a handful of simple yet potent axioms about dilations,\none of which (resembling the Purification Postulate [CDP10]) entails a duality\ntheorem encompassing a large number of classic no-go results for quantum\ntheory. Chapter 3 considers metric structure on physical theories, introducing\nin particular a new metric for quantum channels, the purified diamond distance,\nwhich generalises the purified distance [TCR10,Tom12] and relates to the Bures\ndistance [KSW08a]. Chapter 4 presents a category-theoretic formalism for\ncausality in terms of '(constructible) causal channels' and 'contractions'. It\nsimplifies aspects of the formalisms [CDP09,KU17] and relates to traces in\nmonoidal categories [JSV96].

In\naddition, the coherent QSNN is found more robust against both label noise and\ndevice noise so that it is a more adaptive option for practical implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2021 13:29:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Lu-Ji", ""], ["Lin", "Jia-Yi", ""], ["Wu", "Sheng-Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.03021", "submitter": "Fernando Luis", "authors": "Marcos Rub\\'in-Osanz, Fran\\c{c}ois Lambert, Feng Shao, Eric Rivi\\`ere,\n  R\\'egis Guillot, Nicolas Suaud, Nathalie Guih\\'ery, David Zueco, Anne-Laure\n  Barra, Talal Mallah and Fernando Luis", "title": "Chemical tuning of spin clock transitions in molecular monomers based on\n  nuclear spin-free Ni(II)", "comments": "22 pages, 11 figures and supplemental information", "journal-ref": "Chemical Science, 2021", "doi": "10.1039/D0SC05856D", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  We report the existence of a sizeable quantum tunnelling splitting between\nthe two lowest electronic spin levels of mononuclear Ni complexes.

Namely, applying an off-resonant drive to non-computational\ntransitions in a pair of capacitively-coupled fluxoniums induces a\n$\\textrm{ZZ}$-interaction due to unequal ac-Stark shifts of the computational\nlevels. With a continuous choice of frequency and amplitude, the drive can\neither cancel the static $\\textrm{ZZ}$-term or increase it by an order of\nmagnitude to enable a controlled-phase (CP) gate with an arbitrary programmed\nphase shift. The cross-entropy benchmarking of these non-Clifford operations\nyields a sub $1\\%$ error, limited solely by incoherent processes. Our result\ndemonstrates the advantages of strongly-anharmonic circuits over transmons in\ndesigning the next generation of quantum processors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 00:02:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Xiong", "Haonan", ""], ["Ficheux", "Quentin", ""], ["Somoroff", "Aaron", ""], ["Nguyen", "Long B.", ""], ["Dogan", "Ebru", ""], ["Rosenstock", "Dario", ""], ["Wang", "Chen", ""], ["Nesterov", "Konstantin N.", ""], ["Vavilov", "Maxim G.", ""], ["Manucharyan", "Vladimir E.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.04502", "submitter": "Kyle E.

Here, we present a fiber-based open\nFabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat exhibiting ultra-high\nmechanical stability while providing wide-range tunability in all three spatial\ndirections. We characterize the setup and demonstrate the operation with the\nroot-mean-square stability of less than $90$ pm at temperature of $6.5$ K and\nintegration bandwidth of $100$ kHz. Finally, we benchmark the cavity\nperformance by demonstrating the strong-coupling formation of\nexciton-polaritons in monolayer WSe$_2$ with a cooperativity of $1.6$. This set\nof results manifests the open-cavity in a closed-cycle cryostat as a versatile\nand powerful platform for low-temperature cavity QED experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:41:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Vadia", "Samarth", ""], ["Scherzer", "Johannes", ""], ["Thierschmann", "Holger", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fermeier", "Clemens", ""], ["Savio", "Claudio Dal", ""], ["Taniguchi", "Takashi", ""], ["Watanabe", "Kenji", ""], ["Hunger", "David", ""], ["Karra\u00ef", "Khaled", ""], ["H\u00f6gele", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.05625", "submitter": "Fabrizio Minganti", "authors": "Fabrizio Minganti, Ievgen I.

Despite the\nnon-equilibrium nature of lasing, the laser threshold was compared with thermal\nphase transitions systems more than forty years ago. For instance, the Landau\ntheory -- based on thermodynamical consideration -- has been used to\ncharacterize the Scully-Lamb laser model (SLLM), describing a single-mode laser\nwithout saturable absorbers. Accordingly, the laser threshold is a second-order\nphase transition, associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the\n$U(1)$ symmetry of the model. To capture a genuine non-equilibrium, quantum,\nand dissipative phase transition of the SLLM, here we employ a Liouvillian\nsuperoperator formalism derived from a Lindblad master equation. Our results\nconfirm that the $U(1)$ SSB can occur at the lasing threshold but, in contrast\nto the Landau theory and semiclassical approximation, they signal that the SLLM\n\"fundamental\" transition is a different phenomenon, which we call Liouvillian\nspectral collapse; that is, the emergence of diabolic points of infinite\ndegeneracy. By considering a generalized SLLM with additional dephasing, we\nwitness a second-order phase transition, with a Liouvillian spectral collapse,\nbut in the absence of symmetry breaking. This demonstrates the difference\nbetween the Liouvillian spectral collapse and a standard second-order phase\ntransition with symmetry breaking. We characterize the new phenomena associated\nwith the spectral collapse, such as the onset of a rather unusual\nmultistability enabled (and not suppressed) by the very presence of\nfluctuations. This multistability, characterizing the dissipative and quantum\norigin of lasing, can be experimentally revealed by the presence of a dynamical\nhysteresis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2021 18:53:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Minganti", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Arkhipov", "Ievgen I.", ""], ["Miranowicz", "Adam", ""], ["Nori", "Franco", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.05629", "submitter": "Edwin Ng", "authors": "Edwin Ng, Tatsuhiro Onodera, Satoshi Kako, Peter L.

In this work, we propose a\nhighly effective use of the surface-GKP code, i.e., the surface code consisting\nof bosonic GKP qubits instead of bare two-dimensional qubits. In our proposal,\nwe use error-corrected two-qubit gates between GKP qubits and introduce a\nmaximum likelihood decoding strategy for correcting shift errors in the\ntwo-GKP-qubit gates. Our proposed decoding reduces the total CNOT failure rate\nof the GKP qubits, e.g., from $0.87\\%$ to $0.36\\%$ at a GKP squeezing of\n$12$dB, compared to the case where the simple closest-integer decoding is used.\nThen, by concatenating the GKP code with the surface code, we find that the\nthreshold GKP squeezing is given by $9.9$dB under the the assumption that\nfinite-squeezing of the GKP states is the dominant noise source. More\nimportantly, we show that a low logical failure rate $p_{L} < 10^{-7}$ can be\nachieved with moderate hardware requirements, e.g., $291$ modes and $97$ qubits\nat a GKP squeezing of $12$dB as opposed to $1457$ bare qubits for the standard\nrotated surface code at an equivalent noise level (i.e., $p=0.36\\%$). Such a\nlow failure rate of our surface-GKP code is possible through the use of\nspace-time correlated edges in the matching graphs of the surface code decoder.\nFurther, all edge weights in the matching graphs are computed dynamically based\non analog information from the GKP error correction using the full history of\nall syndrome measurement rounds. We also show that a highly-squeezed GKP state\nof GKP squeezing $\\gtrsim 12$dB can be experimentally realized by using a\ndissipative stabilization method, namely, the Big-small-Big method, with fairly\nconservative experimental parameters. Lastly, we introduce a three-level\nancilla scheme to mitigate ancilla decay errors during a GKP state preparation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2021 23:07:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Noh", "Kyungjoo", ""], ["Chamberland", "Christopher", ""], ["Brand\u00e3o", "Fernando G.

I explain why this principle has no\nparadoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic \"everything\ndepends on everything else\" view.

However, noise in realistic quantum devices fundamentally\nlimits the utility of these quantum technologies. A conventional approach\ntowards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processing is to use\nmulti-qubit quantum error correction (QEC), that is, to encode a logical\nquantum bit (or a logical qubit) redundantly over many physical qubits such\nthat the redundancy can be used to detect errors. The required resource\noverhead associated with the use of conventional multi-qubit QEC schemes,\nhowever, is too high for these schemes to be realized at scale with currently\navailable quantum devices. Recently, bosonic (or continuous-variable) quantum\nerror correction has risen as a promising hardware-efficient alternative to\nmulti-qubit QEC schemes. In this thesis, I provide an overview of bosonic QEC\nand present my contributions to the field. Specifically, I present the\nbenchmark and optimization results of various single-mode bosonic codes against\npractically relevant excitation loss errors. I also demonstrate that\nfault-tolerant bosonic QEC is possible by concatenating a single-mode bosonic\ncode with a multi-qubit error-correcting code. Moreover, I discuss the\nfundamental aspects of bosonic QEC using the framework of quantum communication\ntheory. In particular, I present improved bounds on important\ncommunication-theoretic quantities such as the quantum capacity of bosonic\nGaussian channels. Furthermore, I provide explicit bosonic error correction\nschemes that nearly achieve the fundamental performance limit set by the\nquantum capacity.

To complement the analytical approach, we introduce a simple\ngraphical description of these CV-mode cluster states that depicts precisely\nhow the hidden qubit cluster states are entangled with the gauge modes, and we\noutline how these results would extend to the case of finitely squeezed states.\nThis work provides important insight that is both conceptually satisfying and\nhelps to address important practical issues like when a simpler resource (such\nas a Gaussian state) can stand in for a more complex one (like a GKP state),\nleading to more efficient use of the resources available for CV quantum\ncomputing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2021 03:13:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2021 23:17:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pantaleoni", "Giacomo", ""], ["Baragiola", "Ben Q.", ""], ["Menicucci", "Nicolas C.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.11592", "submitter": "Tomotaka Kuwahara", "authors": "Tomotaka Kuwahara, Keiji Saito", "title": "Lieb-Robinson bound and almost-linear light-cone in interacting boson\n  systems", "comments": "7 pages + 35 pages supplementary, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we investigate how quickly a local perturbation propagates in\ninteracting boson systems with Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians.

This paper provides a methodology for building this\nbridge systematically: We present an algorithm for constructing Hamiltonians\nthat conserve noncommuting quantities globally while transporting the\nquantities locally. The Hamiltonians can couple arbitrarily many subsystems\ntogether and can be integrable or nonintegrable. Special cases of our\nconstruction have appeared in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our Hamiltonians\nmay be realized physically with superconducting qudits, with ultracold atoms,\nwith trapped ions, and in QCD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Mar 2021 18:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Halpern", "Nicole Yunger", ""], ["Majidy", "Shayan", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.14044", "submitter": "Liujun Zou", "authors": "Cheng-Ju Lin and Liujun Zou", "title": "Reaction-diffusion dynamics in a Fibonacci chain: Interplay between\n  classical and quantum behavior", "comments": "A table of contents is provided", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The first of these is suggested and\ndeveloped in this Article and is based on a vibrational dressing of the\nexciton-cavity polaritons. This enables the description of distinct\nphonon-polariton sidebands that appear when the polariton splitting exceeds the\ntypical phonon frequency scale in the environment. The second approach is based\non a variationally optimized polaronic vibrational dressing of the electronic\nstate. Both of these approaches demonstrate good qualitative and quantitative\nagreement with reference calculations of the emission spectrum and are\nnumerically robust, even at elevated temperatures, where the thermal phonon\npopulation is significant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:32:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 May 2021 19:44:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bundgaard-Nielsen", "Matias", ""], ["M\u00f8rk", "Jesper", ""], ["Denning", "Emil Vosmar", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.14360", "submitter": "Sho Onoe Mr", "authors": "Sho Onoe, Thiago L.

Here we consider\nthe quantum correlations of magnons in a layered vdW magnet and identify an\nentanglement channel of magnons across the magnetic layers, which can be\neffectively tuned and even deterministically switched on and off by both\nmagnetic and electric means. This is a unique feature of vdW magnets in which\nthe underlying physics is well understood in terms of the competing roles of\nexchange and anisotropy fields that contribute to the magnon excitation.\nFurthermore, we show that such a tunable entanglement channel can mediate the\nelectrically controllable entanglement of two distant qubits, which also\nprovides a protocol to indirectly measure the entanglement of magnons. Our\nfindings provide a novel avenue to electrically manipulate the qubits and\nfurther open up new opportunities to utilize vdW magnets for quantum\ninformation science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 19:14:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "H.

Variational calculation of the two-electron reduced density\nmatrix (2-RDM) without the many-electron wave function exploits the pairwise\nnature of the electronic Coulomb interaction to compute a lower bound on the\nground-state energy with polynomial computational scaling. Recently, a\ndual-cone formulation of the variational 2-RDM calculation was shown to\ngenerate the ground-state energy, albeit not the 2-RDM, at a substantially\nreduced computational cost, especially for higher $N$-representability\nconditions such as the T2 constraint. Here we generalize the dual-cone\nvariational 2-RDM method to compute not only the ground-state energy but also\nthe 2-RDM. The central result is that we can compute the 2-RDM from a\ngeneralization of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Specifically, we prove that in\nthe Lagrangian formulation of the dual-cone optimization the 2-RDM is the\nLagrange multiplier. We apply the method to computing the energies and\nproperties of strongly correlated electrons -- including atomic charges,\nelectron densities, dipole moments, and orbital occupations -- in an\nillustrative hydrogen chain and the nitrogen-fixation catalyst FeMoco. The dual\nvariational computation of the 2-RDM with T2 or higher $N$-representability\nconditions provides a polynomially scaling approach to strongly correlated\nmolecules and materials with significant applications in atomic and molecular\nand condensed-matter chemistry and physics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 15:20:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mazziotti", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.17190", "submitter": "Vadim Grinenko A", "authors": "Vadim Grinenko, Daniel Weston, Federico Caglieris, Christoph Wuttke,\n  Christian Hess, Tino Gottschall, Ilaria Maccari, Denis Gorbunov, Sergei\n  Zherlitsyn, Jochen Wosnitza, Andreas Rydh, Kunihiro Kihou, Chul-Ho Lee, Rajib\n  Sarkar, Shanu Dengre, Julien Garaud, Aliaksei Charnukha, Ruben H\\\"uhne,\n  Kornelius Nielsch, Bernd B\\\"uchner, Hans-Henning Klauss, and Egor Babaev", "title": "Quartic metal: Spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry due to\n  four-fermion correlations in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$", "comments": "31 pages, 11 figures, supplemental information", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Discoveries of ordered quantum states of matter are of great fundamental\ninterest, and often lead to unique applications. The most well known example --\nsuperconductivity -- is caused by the formation and condensation of pairs of\nelectrons. A key property of superconductors is diamagnetism: magnetic fields\nare screened by dissipationless currents. Fundamentally, what distinguishes\nsuperconducting states from normal states is a spontaneously broken symmetry\ncorresponding to long-range coherence of fermion pairs. Here we report a set of\nexperimental observations in hole doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ which are\nnot consistent with conventional superconducting behavior. Our specific-heat\nmeasurements indicate the formation of fermionic bound states when the\ntemperature is lowered from the normal state. However, for $x \\sim 0.8$,\ninstead of the standard for superconductors, zero resistance and diamagnetic\nscreening, for a range of temperatures, we observe the opposite effect: the\ngeneration of self-induced magnetic fields measured by spontaneous Nernst\neffect and muon spin rotation experiments. The finite resistance and the lack\nof any detectable diamagnetic screening in this state exclude the spontaneously\nbroken symmetry associated with superconducting two-fermion correlations.\nInstead, combined evidence from transport and thermodynamic measurements\nindicates that the formation of fermionic bound states leads to spontaneous\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry above the superconducting transition\ntemperature. These results demonstrate the existence of a\nbroken-time-reversal-symmetry bosonic metal state.
