By\npostselecting the fields both in their coherent states, the entanglement of two\ninitially unentangled qubits can be largely improved.

His 1976 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with\nthe unitary property of local causality.

While there are other\nforms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between\nJarrett-completeness, \"fragile locality\", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain\nthat Bell's two versions are the essential ones. Although the two Bell's\ntheorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not, and the different\nversions of the theorem suggest quite different conclusions, which are embraced\nby different communities. For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled\nout by Bell's 1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle\nof common cause and explicitly by the Principle of relativistic causality, and\nit is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists pay no heed to\nReichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep the Principle of relativistic\ncausality, which, bolstered by an implicit \"Principle of agent-causation\",\nimplies their notion of locality. Thus for operationalists, Bell's theorem is\nthe 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that must be forgone.

This definition implies that no particles can be present in the vacuum\nstate. In classical physics, the only features of vacuum are those of its\ngeometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a\ndynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent\nand curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is\na structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are\nstrictly associated with physical objects such as particles and\nfinite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As\nI will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum\nphysics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example\nthat physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only\nwhen the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach\nproperties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing\nreal objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain\nperturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy\nshifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the\nvacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct\nviable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 16:55:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:32:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Paraoanu", "G.

The excited state lifetimes range from 1 -\n13 ns, consistent with the finite-size and surface effects of nanoparticles and\nsmall grains. We also observe discrete jumps in the fluorescence intensity\nbetween a bright state and a dark state. The dwell times in each state are\nexponentially distributed and the average dwell time in the bright (dark) state\ndoes (may) depend on the power of the exciting laser. Taken together, our\nmeasurements demonstrate the utility of a single-molecule approach to\nsemiconductor defect studies and highlight ZnO as a potential host material for\nsingle-defect based applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 21:22:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jungwirth", "N.

When we carry out the sequential secret\nsharing in the presence of noise we observe that the fidelity of secret sharing\nat the $k^{th}$ iteration is independent of the effect of noise at the\n$(k-1)^{th}$ iteration.

However, so far, solid state quantum\nfrequency conversion has not been achieved with long lived optical quantum\nmemories. Here, we demonstrate an ultra low noise solid state photonic quantum\ninterface suitable for connecting quantum memories based on atomic ensembles to\nthe telecommunication fiber network. The interface is based on an integrated\nwaveguide non linear device. As a proof of principle, we convert heralded\nsingle photons at 780nm emitted by a rubidium based quantum memory to the\ntelecommunication wavelength of 1552nm. We demonstrate a significant amount of\nnon classical correlations between the converted photon and the heralding\nsignal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 16:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Albrecht", "Boris", ""], ["Farrera", "Pau", ""], ["Fernandez-Gonzalvo", "Xavier", ""], ["Cristiani", "Matteo", ""], ["de Riedmatten", "Hugues", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2870", "submitter": "Alessandro Farace", "authors": "A.

Within this endeavor, the harnessing of many-body entanglement\nagainst the effects of the environment is a pressing issue. Besides being an\nimportant concept from a fundamental standpoint, entanglement is recognized as\na crucial resource for performance enhancements over classical methods.\nUnderstanding and controlling many-body entanglement in open systems may have\nimplications in quantum computing, quantum simulations, secure quantum\ncommunication, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical\ntransition, and other important questions of quantum foundations.\n  Here we present an overview of recent theoretical and experimental efforts to\nunderpin the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems. Entanglement is\ntaken as a dynamic quantity, and we survey how it evolves due to the\ninteraction of the entangled system with its surroundings. We analyze several\nscenarios, corresponding to different families of states and environments,\nwhich render a diversity of dynamical behaviors.\n  Contrary to single-particle quantities, that typically vanish only\nasymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear at a finite time. Moreover,\nimportant classes of entanglement show an exponential decay with the system\nsize when subject to local noise, posing yet another threat to the already\nchallenging scaling of quantum technologies. Results for the local and global\nnoise cases are summarized. Robustness-enhancement techniques, scaling laws,\nstatistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement decay are also\nreviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of entanglement dynamics in open\nquantum systems addressed to both theorists and experimentalists inside and\noutside the field of quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 19:15:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Aolita", "Leandro", ""], ["de Melo", "Fernando", ""], ["Davidovich", "Luiz", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.3733", "submitter": "Petros Wallden Dr", "authors": "Petros Wallden", "title": "Contrary Inferences in Consistent Histories and a Set Selection\n  Criterion", "comments": "13 pages.

This conception has led to a rather constraining way\nto think and understand the quantum world. Nonetheless, a closer look at the\nprinciples and formal body of this theory shows that, beyond longstanding\nprejudices, there is still room enough for alternative tools. This is the case,\nfor example, of Bohmian mechanics. As it is discussed here, there is nothing\ncontradictory or wrong with this hydrodynamical representation, which enhances\nthe dynamical role of the quantum phase to the detriment (to some extent) of\nthe probability density. The possibility to describe the evolution of quantum\nsystems in terms of trajectories or streamlines is just a direct consequence of\nthe fact that Bohmian mechanics (quantum hydrodynamics) is just a way to recast\nquantum mechanics in the more general language of the theory of\ncharacteristics. Misconceptions concerning Bohmian mechanics typically come\nfrom the fact that many times it is taken out of context and considered as an\nalternative theory to quantum mechanics, which is not the case. On the\ncontrary, an appropriate contextualization shows that Bohmian mechanics\nconstitutes a serious and useful representation of quantum mechanics, at the\nsame level as any other quantum picture, such as Schr\\\"odinger's, Heisenberg's,\nDirac's, or Feynman's, for instance.

In any concrete setup sufficiently many atoms have to\nbe confined and pumped within a finite cavity mode volume. Using a magic\nwavelength lattice minimizes light shifts and allows for almost uniform\ncoupling to the cavity mode. Never- theless, the atoms are subject to\ndipole-dipole interaction and collective spontaneous decay which compromises\nthe ultimate frequency stability. In the high density limit the Dicke\nsuperradiant linewidth enhancement will broaden the laser line and nearest\nneighbor couplings will induce shifts and fluctuations of the laser frequency.\nWe estimate the magnitude and scaling of these effects by direct numerical\nsimulations of few atom systems for different geometries and densities.

This\nquestion is important not only for the efficiency and the security of\ninformation processing, but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable\nevents are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures\nin the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among\ntwo or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and\ndifficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can\nbe circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical\nlaws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with\nthe recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv:1402:0489), our physical randomness\nextractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily\nlong and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against\nall-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of\nimplementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to\nthe devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary.\n  Our central technical contribution, the Equivalence Lemma, provides a general\nprinciple for proving composition security of untrusted-device protocols. It\nimplies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by\ncross-feeding any two expansion protocols.

Here we experimentally\nrealize fully deterministic, unconditional quantum teleportation of photonic\nqubits. The key element is to make use of a \"hybrid\" technique:\ncontinuous-variable (CV) teleportation of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit.\nBy optimally tuning the receiver's feedforward gain, the CV teleporter acts as\na pure loss channel, while the input dual-rail encoded qubit, based on a single\nphoton, represents a quantum error detection code against amplitude damping and\nhence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for\na faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect CV entangled states: the overall\ntransfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 for four distinct qubits, all of\nthem exceeding the classical limit of teleportation.

Many of these states are gapped and\nexhibit anyon excitations, which could be used for a robust form of quantum\ninformation processing. However, while numerous qubit array proposals exist to\nengineer the Hamiltonian for these systems, the question of how to stabilize\nthe many-body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon\nlosses remains largely unanswered. We here propose a simple mechanism which\nachieves this goal for abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states\nof light. Our construction uses a uniform two-photon drive field to couple the\nqubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ``shadow\" lattice, composed of\nqubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum\nsimulator itself. This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to\nbe rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons\nfrom being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached. The\nfractional quantum Hall state (with a small, transient population of quasihole\nexcitations) is thus the most stable state of the system, and all other\nconfigurations will relax toward it over time. The physics described here could\nbe implemented in a circuit QED architecture, and the device parameters needed\nfor our scheme to succeed are in reach of current technology.

We construct Seiberg-Witten type maps between associative and\nnonassociative backgrounds, and show how they may realise a nonassociative\ndeformation of gravity. We also explain how this approach is related to the\nquantization of certain Lie 2-algebras canonically associated to the twisted\nCourant algebroid, and cochain twist quantization using suitable quasi-Hopf\nalgebras of symmetries in the phase space description of R-space which\nconstructs a Drinfel'd twist with non-trivial 3-cocycle. We illustrate and\napply our formalism to present a consistent phase space formulation of\nnonassociative quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 16:30:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mylonas", "Dionysios", ""], ["Schupp", "Peter", ""], ["Szabo", "Richard J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.7310", "submitter": "Joshua Dempster", "authors": "Joshua Dempster, Bo Fu, David G.
