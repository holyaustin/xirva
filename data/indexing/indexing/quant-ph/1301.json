A quantum interface can be\nrealized by entangling the state of a single photon with the state of an atomic\nor solid-state quantum memory, as demonstrated in recent experiments with\ntrapped ions, neutral atoms, atomic ensembles, and nitrogen-vacancy spins. The\nentangling interaction couples an initial quantum memory state to two possible\nlight-matter states, and the atomic level structure of the memory determines\nthe available coupling paths. In previous work, these paths' transition\nparameters determine the phase and amplitude of the final entangled state,\nunless the memory is initially prepared in a superposition state, a step that\nrequires coherent control. Here we report the fully tunable entanglement of a\nsingle 40Ca+ ion and the polarization state of a single photon within an\noptical resonator. Our method, based on a bichromatic, cavity-mediated Raman\ntransition, allows us to select two coupling paths and adjust their relative\nphase and amplitude. The cavity setting enables intrinsically deterministic,\nhigh-fidelity generation of any two-qubit entangled state. This approach is\napplicable to a broad range of candidate systems and thus presents itself as a\npromising method for distributing information within quantum networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 17:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Stute", "A.", ""], ["Casabone", "B.", ""], ["Schindler", "P.", ""], ["Monz", "T.", ""], ["Schmidt", "P.

In\nthis context we analyze different kinds of symmetries and derive appropriate\nnormal forms for MPS representing these symmetries. Exploiting such symmetries\nby using these normal forms will lead to a reduction in the number of degrees\nof freedom in the MPS matrices. This paper provides a uniform platform for both\nwell-known and new results which are presented from the (multi-)linear algebra\npoint of view.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2013 15:22:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Huckle", "T.", ""], ["Waldherr", "K.", ""], ["Schulte-Herbrueggen", "T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.0751", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "Quantum Structure in Economics: The Ellsberg Paradox", "comments": "8 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1105.1814, arXiv:1104.1459, arXiv:1105.1812", "journal-ref": "In M.

To overcome these difficulties a distinction between 'risk' and\n'ambiguity' has been introduced which depends on the existence of a\nKolmogorovian probabilistic structure modeling these uncertainties. On the\nother hand, evidence of everyday life suggests that context plays a fundamental\nrole in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from\nphysics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions\nbetween entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian framework admitting a\nquantum-like representation.

It is\na rule that takes into account how one should assign probabilities to the\nconsequences of various intended measurements on a physical system, but\nexplicitly in terms of prior probabilities for and conditional probabilities\nconsequent upon the imagined outcomes of a special counterfactual reference\nmeasurement. This interpretation is seen particularly clearly by representing\nquantum states in terms of probabilities for the outcomes of a fixed, fiducial\nsymmetric informationally complete (SIC) measurement. We further explore the\nextent to which the general form of the new normative rule implies the full\nstate-space structure of quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 09:19:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Fuchs", "Christopher A.", ""], ["Schack", "Ruediger", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3332", "submitter": "Claude-Alain Pillet", "authors": "V.

We present a method for\nconstructing this representative state by means of a generalized Thermodynamic\nBethe Ansatz (GTBA). Going further, we introduce a framework for calculating\nthe time dependence of local observables as they evolve towards their\nstationary values. As an explicit example we consider quantum quenches in the\ntransverse-field Ising chain and show that previously derived results are\nrecovered efficiently within our framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 20:02:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Caux", "Jean-Sebastien", ""], ["Essler", "Fabian H.

This requires a repumper laser to\nmaintain the ion in the Doppler cooling cycle. Typically the 2D3/2 state, or\nsome of its hyperfine components if the ion has nuclear spin, has a higher\nmultiplicity than the upper state of the repumping transition. This can lead to\ndark states, which have to be destabilized by an external magnetic field or by\nmodulating the polarization of the repumper laser. We propose using\nunpolarized, incoherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) to drive the\nrepumping transition. An ASE source offers several advantages compared to a\nlaser. It prevents the buildup of dark states without external polarization\nmodulation even in zero magnetic field, it can drive multiple hyperfine\ntransitions simultaneously, and it requires no frequency stabilization. These\nfeatures make it very compact and robust, which is essential for the\ndevelopment of practical, transportable optical ion clocks. We construct a\ntheoretical model for the ASE radiation, including the possibility of the\nsource being partially polarized. Using 88Sr+ as an example, the performance of\nthe ASE source compared to a single-mode laser is analyzed by numerically\nsolving the eight-level density matrix equations for the involved energy\nlevels. Finally a reduced three-level system is derived, yielding a simple\nformula for the excited state population and scattering rate, which can be used\nto optimize the experimental parameters.

Even the formation of molecules in optical lattices\nmanifests itself in modified polariton properties as e.g. an anisotropic\noptical spectrum.

We identify the shortest timescale that successive measurements\napproximately commute.

We observe a two-fold\nreduction of the transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting\nartificial atom coupled to continuum squeezed vacuum generated by a Josephson\nparametric amplifier, allowing the transverse coherence time T_2 to exceed the\nvacuum decay limit of 2T_1. We demonstrate that the measured radiative decay\ndynamics can be used to tomographically reconstruct the Wigner distribution of\nthe the itinerant squeezed state. Our results are the first confirmation of a\ncanonical prediction of quantum optics and open the door to new studies of the\nquantum light-matter interaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2013 18:12:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 23:10:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Apr 2013 21:41:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Murch", "K.

We propose a new\nparadigm in light emission: we envision an ensemble of two-level emitters in an\nenvironment where the local density of optical states is modified on a time\nscale shorter than the decay time. A rate equation model is developed for the\nexcited state population of two-level emitters in a time-dependent environment\nin the weak coupling regime in quantum electrodynamics. As a realistic\nexperimental system, we consider emitters in a semiconductor microcavity that\nis switched by free-carrier excitation. We demonstrate that a short temporal\nincrease of the radiative decay rate depletes the excited state and drastically\nincreases the emission intensity during the switch time. The resulting\ntime-dependent spontaneous emission shows a distribution of photon arrival\ntimes that strongly deviates from the usual exponential decay: A deterministic\nburst of photons is spontaneously emitted during the switch event.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 13:40:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 09:43:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 13:12:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 15:25:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Thyrrestrup", "Henri", ""], ["Hartsuiker", "Alex", ""], ["G\u00e9rard", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Vos", "Willem L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7631", "submitter": "Kevin McCusker", "authors": "Kevin T.
