Maximal\nnon-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in\npurely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the\nsupport.

Understanding the complexity of the intermediate case in\nwhich the constraints are quantum but all local terms in the Hamiltonian\ncommute, is of importance for conceptual, physical and computational complexity\nreasons. Bravyi and Vyalyi showed in 2003, using a clever application of the\nrepresentation theory of C*-algebras, that if the terms in the Hamiltonian are\nall two-local, the problem is in NP, and the entanglement in the ground states\nis local. The general case remained open since then. In this paper we extend\nthe results of Bravyi and Vyalyi beyond the two-local case, to the case of\nthree-qubit interactions. We then extend our results even further, and show\nthat NP verification is possible for three-wise interaction between qutrits as\nwell, as long as the interaction graph is embedded on a planar lattice, or more\ngenerally, \"Nearly Euclidean\" (NE). The proofs imply that in all such systems,\nthe entanglement in the ground states is local. These extensions imply an\nintriguing sharp transition phenomenon in commuting Hamiltonian systems:\n3-local NE systems based on qubits and qutrits cannot be used to construct\nTopological order, as their entanglement is local, whereas for higher\ndimensional qudits, or for interactions of at least 4 qudits, Topological Order\nis already possible, via Kitaev's Toric Code construction.

For multiple layers the critical strength for the density-wave\ninstability decreases with the number of layers. The effect depends on density\nand is more pronounced in the low density regime. The lowest solution of the\ninstability corresponds to the density waves in the different layers being\nin-phase, whereas higher solutions have one or several adjancet layers that are\nout of phase. The parameter regime needed to explore this instability is within\nreach of current experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 09:46:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2011 14:29:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2011 16:39:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zinner", "N.

In this theory\nthe motion of an electron is considered to occur along a trajectory the\npresence of which is a reflection of the existence of a particle, as well as it\nis assumed that any motion is defined by a wave V(x,t). It is assumed that\nthere is an explicit relationship between the trajectory and wave equations of\nthe electron, which are established on the basis of the local variational\nprinciple. In this approach, an electron wave propagating in free space takes\nalong the electron trajectory. We used this theory to describe the electron\nmotion in a hydrogen-like atom and found its stationary states. The energies of\nthese states coincide with the known quantum mechanics solutions for the\nstationary energies of the hydrogen-like atom, however, in our approach the\nspatial trajectories of the electron have the form of the surfaces, which are\nformed in the region of nodes of the standing electron wave. These surfaces\nhave the form of spheres for the spherical symmetrical electron states and the\nradii of these spheres coincide with the radii of the Bohr orbits of these\nstates. Thus, in this approach the trajectory and wave measurements of the\nelectron get a consistent spatial description that is inherent to the picture\nof the corpuscular-wave monism. We discuss the considerable correspondence of\nthe proposed theory with the quantum mechanics results describing the\nstationary and non-stationary motions of the electron in the atom and their\ndifference.

Recently, however,\nseveral measurement procedures have been proposed in which the Heisenberg limit\nseemed to be surpassed. This led to an extensive debate over the question how\nthe sensitivity scales with the physical resources and the computational\nresources that are used in estimation procedures. Here, we reconcile the\nphysical definition of the relevant resources with the information-theoretical\nscaling in terms of the query complexity of a quantum network. This leads to a\nnovel and ultimate Heisenberg limit that applies to all conceivable measurement\nprocedures. The second result reveals a close relationship between quantum\nmetrology and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm over continuous-variable quantum\nsystems. Here, we develop a general procedure, characterized by two parameters,\nthat unifies parameter estimation and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The\nprocedure estimates a value of an unknown parameter with Heisenberg-limited\nprecision or solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem in a single run without the use\nof any entanglement. The third result illustrates how physical principles that\ngovern interaction of light and matter can be efficiently employed to create a\ncomputational resource for a (one-way) quantum computer.

That field induces the molecular dipoles to\nundergo pendular oscillations, which markedly affect the qubit states and the\ndipole-dipole interaction. We evaluate entanglement of the pendular qubit\nstates for two linear dipoles, characterized by pairwise concurrence, as a\nfunction of the molecular dipole moment and rotational constant, strengths of\nthe external field and the dipole-dipole coupling, and ambient temperature. We\nalso evaluate a key frequency shift, $\\triangle\\omega$, produced by the\ndipole-dipole interaction. Under conditions envisioned for the proposed quantum\ncomputers, both the concurrence and $\\triangle\\omega$ become very small for the\nground eigenstate. In principle, such weak entanglement can be sufficient for\noperation of logic gates, provided the resolution is high enough to detect the\n$\\triangle\\omega$ shift unambiguously. In practice, however, for many candidate\npolar molecules it appears a challenging task to attain adequate resolution.\nSimple approximate formulas fitted to our numerical results are provided from\nwhich the concurrence and $\\triangle\\omega$ shift can be obtained in terms of\nunitless reduced variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 20:53:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Qi", ""], ["Kais", "Sabre", ""], ["Friedrich", "Bretislav", ""], ["Herschbach", "Dudley", ""]]}]
