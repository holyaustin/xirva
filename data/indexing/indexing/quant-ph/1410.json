It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new\ninformation-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum\ncorrelations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on\narbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the\npossibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling\ncorrelations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also\nforms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum\nwinning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique\nnon-signaling winning strategy.

It is of interest to examine if the results\nof two or more measurements in the quantum scenario can be perceived from a\nclassical point of view or they still exhibit non-classical features. Clearly,\ncommuting observables can be measured jointly using projective measurements and\ntheir statistical outcomes can be discerned classically. However, such simple\nminded association of compatibility of measurements with commutativity turns\nout to be limited in an extended framework, where the usual notion of sharp\nprojective valued measurements of self adjoint observables gets broadened to\ninclude unsharp measurements of generalized observables constituting positive\noperator valued measures (POVM). There is a surge of research activity recently\ntowards gaining new physical insights on the emergence of classical behavior\nvia joint measurability of unsharp observables. Here, we explore the entropic\nuncertainty relation for a pair of discrete observables (of Alice's system)\nwhen an entangled quantum memory of Bob is restricted to record outcomes of\njointly measurable POVMs only. Within the joint measurability regime, the sum\nof entropies associated with Alice's measurement outcomes - conditioned by the\nresults registered at Bob's end - are constrained to obey an entropic steering\ninequality. In this case, Bob's non-steerability reflects itself as his\ninability in predicting the outcomes of Alice's pair of non-commuting\nobservables with better precision, even when they share an entangled state. As\na further consequence, the quantum advantage envisaged for the construction of\nsecurity proofs in key distribution is lost, when Bob's measurements are\nrestricted to the joint measurability regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Oct 2014 11:49:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 11:59:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Karthik", "H.

The entanglement entropy can be\noperationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the\nsubregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a\nreference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\ntheoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more\ngeneral bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new\ntask called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary\nsubregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale\nin a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that\nthe cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of\nconstrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the\nsigned length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,\nconstrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it.

Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate a QKD scheme that removes the need for a two-photon\nsystem and instead uses the idea of a two-qubit single-photon (TQSP) to\nsignificantly simplify the implementation and improve the efficiency of mdiQKD\nin several aspects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2014 19:03:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 17:37:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lim", "Charles Ci Wen", ""], ["Korzh", "Boris", ""], ["Martin", "Anthony", ""], ["Bussieres", "Felix", ""], ["Thew", "Rob", ""], ["Zbinden", "Hugo", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1857", "submitter": "Xi Han Li", "authors": "Xi-Han Li and Shohini Ghose", "title": "Analysis of N-qubit perfectly controlled teleportation schemes from the\n  controller's point of view", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.91.012320", "report-no": "Physics Review A 91 012320", "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We quantitatively analyze and evaluate the controller's power in $N$-qubit\ncontrolled teleportation schemes.

In this work, we propose a way to\nprepare a $W$-class entangled state of spatially-separated multiple qubits in\ndifferent cavities, which are connected to a coupler qubit. Because no cavity\nphoton is excited, decoherence caused by the cavity decay is greatly suppressed\nduring the entanglement preparation.

The\nresults are surprising due to the fact that these measures are very different\nin their nature and application.

The key ingredient in our method is the application of\nthe characteristic function formalism which has been used in continuous\nvariable QIPs.

The algebraic theory of the defects, known as a\n$G$-crossed braided tensor category $\\mathcal{C}_{G}^{\\times}$, allows one to\ncompute many properties, such as the number of topologically distinct types of\ndefects associated with each group element, their fusion rules, quantum\ndimensions, zero modes, braiding exchange transformations, a generalized\nVerlinde formula for the defects, and modular transformations of the\n$G$-crossed extensions of topological phases. We also examine the promotion of\nthe global symmetry to a local gauge invariance, wherein the extrinsic\n$G$-defects are turned into deconfined quasiparticle excitations, which results\nin a different topological phase $(\\mathcal{C}_{G}^{\\times})^{G}$.

We show that distillable entanglement, entanglement of\nassistance, and quantum discord can all be expressed in terms of the\nconcentrated information, thus revealing its role as a unifying informational\nprimitive. We finally investigate quantum state merging of mixed states with\nand without additional entanglement. The gap between classical and quantum\nconcentrated information is proven to be an operational figure of merit for\nmixed state merging in absence of additional entanglement.
