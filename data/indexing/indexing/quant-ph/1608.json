In this\npaper, we apply the Floquet theory to engineer anisotropic Haldane models on\nthe honeycomb lattice and two-leg ladder systems. We show that these\nanisotropic Haldane models still possess a topologically non-trivial band\nstructure associated with chiral edge modes (without the presence of a net unit\nflux in a unit cell), then referring to the quantum anomalous Hall effect.\nFocusing on (interacting) boson systems in s-wave bands of the lattice, we show\nhow to engineer through the Floquet theory, a quantum phase transition between\na uniform superfluid and a BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate) analog of FFLO\n(Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov) states, where bosons condense at non-zero\nwave-vectors. We perform a Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the quantum phase\ntransition on the graphene lattice, and compute observables such as chiral\ncurrents and the momentum distribution. The results are supported by exact\ndiagonalization calculations and compared with those of the isotropic\nsituation. The validity of high-frequency expansion in the Floquet theory is\nalso tested using time-dependent simulations for various parameters of the\nmodel. Last, we show that the anisotropic choice for the effective vector\npotential allows a bosonization approach in equivalent ladder (strip)\ngeometries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 20:43:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 15:11:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Plekhanov", "Kirill", ""], ["Roux", "Guillaume", ""], ["Hur", "Karyn Le", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00065", "submitter": "Qi-Bo Zeng", "authors": "Qi-Bo Zeng, Shu Chen, Rong L\\\"u", "title": "Transport through a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm ring with physical gain\n  and loss", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring system with a quantum\ndot (QD) embedded in each of its two arms.

To read out the collective\nspin states we propose a single Rydberg atom triggered avalanche scheme in\nwhich the presence of a single Rydberg atom conditionally transfers a large\nnumber of ground-state atoms in the trap to an untrapped state which can be\nreadily detected by site-resolved absorption imaging. Such a quantum simulator\nshould allow the study of quantum spin systems in almost arbitrary\ntwo-dimensional configurations. This paves the way towards engineering exotic\nspin models, such as spin models based on triangular-symmetry lattices which\ncan give rise to frustrated-spin magnetism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2016 19:15:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Whitlock", "Shannon", ""], ["Glaetzle", "Alexander W.", ""], ["Hannaford", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00260", "submitter": "Said R.

We also find that, at $m_z\n= \\frac{1}{3}$, (lattice) nematic and $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC-order\nstates are degenerate within the accuracy of the 9-site simplex-method, for all\nanisotropy. The 6- and 12-site coarse-grained PEPS methods produce\nalmost-degenerate nematic and $1 \\times 2$ VBC-Solid orders. Within our\naccuracy, the 6-site coarse-grained PEPS method gives slightly lower energies,\nwhich can be explained by the larger amount of entanglement this approach can\nhandle, even when the PEPS unit-cell is not commensurate with the expected\nground state. Furthermore, we do not observe chiral spin liquid behaviors at\nand close to the XY point, as has been recently proposed. Our results are the\nfirst tensor network investigations of the XXZ spin chain in a field, and\nreveal the subtle competition between nearby magnetic orders in numerical\nsimulations of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, as well as the delicate\ninterplay between energy optimization and symmetry in tensor networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 14:08:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 14:22:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:30:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 11:36:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kshetrimayum", "Augustine", ""], ["Picot", "Thibaut", ""], ["Orus", "Roman", ""], ["Poilblanc", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00446", "submitter": "Sahand Mahmoodian", "authors": "Peter Lodahl, Sahand Mahmoodian, S{\\o}ren Stobbe, Philipp Schneeweiss,\n  J\\\"urgen Volz, Arno Rauschenbeutel, Hannes Pichler, Peter Zoller", "title": "Chiral Quantum Optics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1038/nature21037", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  At the most fundamental level, the interaction between light and matter is\nmanifested by the emission and absorption of single photons by single quantum\nemitters.

The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum\nmany-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation\nwhich affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct\ndescription of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice\nboson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of\nquantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation -- that we dub\n\\emph{quantum mean-field} (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized\nto a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to\ncluster mean-field theory at $T=0$, while at any finite temperature it produces\na family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the\nquantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to\nstandard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is\ncaptured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional\nquantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study\nsystematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact\nresult, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sub-linear in the\n{ boundary-to-bulk ratio} of the clusters as $T\\to 0$, while it becomes faster\nthan linear as $T$ grows.

The SAW-spin\ncoupling takes place through a lamda-type three-level system where two ground\nspin states couple to a common excited state through a phonon-assisted as well\nas a direct dipole optical transition. Both coherent population trapping and\noptically-driven spin transitions have been realized.

A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance\nfrequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the\nposition of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in\nthe electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal\nmagnitude. In a quantum theory, however, an asymmetry between the sidebands can\nbe resolved when the oscillator's average number of vibrational excitations\n(phonons) becomes small, i.e., comparable to 1. We discuss the interpretation\nof this sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne photodetection measurement scheme\nand show that it depends on the choice of detector model. In the optical\nregime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum\ngiven by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is\nin that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise\nspectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures\nsymmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry\ncan be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity\nin interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree\nof freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field.\nFinally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where\nsideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms.\nWe show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical\ntheory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from\nthose of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures.

Such a minimum is our uncertainty lower bound:\nthe total information lost by replacing the target observables with their\noptimal approximations, evaluated at the worst possible state.

For secured practical\nimplementation, one needs to take two initially uncorrelated quantum systems\nand perform a unitary on the composite system to generate the nonlocal\nresource, which is supposed to violate a Bell inequality (say, Bell-CHSH).\nStates which do not violate Bell-CHSH inequality, but violate it when\ntransformed by a global unitary, can be deemed useful for the preparation of\nnonlocal resource. One may then start from a state which is Bell-CHSH local\n(take for example, a pure product state) and apply an appropriate global\nunitary on it which results in a Bell-CHSH non-local state. However, an\nintriguing fact is the existence of useless states from which no Bell-CHSH\nnon-local resource can be generated with a global unitary. This is due to the\npurity preserving nature of unitary operators which bound the amount of\ncorrelation in the set of final states depending on the purity of the initial\n(possibly uncorrelated) states. The present work confirms the existence of such\na set, pertaining to two qubit systems. The set exhibits counter intuitive\nfeatures by containing within it some entangled states which remain Bell-CHSH\nlocal on the action of any unitary. From practical perspective, this work draws\na line between useful and useless states for the task of preparing nonlocal\nresource using global unitary transformations. Furthermore through an analytic\ncharacterization of the set we lay down a generic prescription through which\none can operationally identify the useful states.

It is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the\ncomputational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are\ncorrectable with high probability, since if Merlin encodes the witness state in\na quantum error-correction code and sends it to Arthur, Arthur can correct the\nerror caused by the noisy channel. If we further assume that Arthur can do only\nsingle-qubit measurements, however, the problem becomes nontrivial, since in\nthis case Arthur cannot do the universal quantum computation by himself. In\nthis paper, we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent\nto QMA. To show it, we use measurement-based quantum computing: honest Merlin\nsends the graph state to Arthur, and Arthur does fault-tolerant\nmeasurement-based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only\nsingle-qubit measurements. By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also\nchecks the correctness of the graph state. Although this idea itself was\nalready used in several previous papers, these results cannot be directly used\nto the present case, since the test that checks the graph state used in these\npapers is so strict that even honest Merlin is rejected with high probability\nif the channel is noisy.

It establishes that every pure quantum state is real, in the context of\nquantum ontological models. Specifically, by guaranteeing the property of\nnot-Post-Peierls ($\\neg$PP) compatibility (or antidistinguishability) for a\nparticular set of states $P$, together with the ad hoc postulate known as\nPreparation Independence Postulate (PIP), the theorem establishes that these\ntwo properties imply the $\\psi$-onticity (realism) of the set of all pure\nstates. This PBR result has triggered two particular lines of research: On the\none hand, it has been possible to derive similar results without the use of the\nPIP, although at the expense of implying weaker properties than\n$\\psi$-onticity. On the other hand, it has also been proven that the property\nof $\\neg$PP compatibility alone is an explicit witness of usefulness for the\ntask known as conclusive exclusion of states. In this work, we explore the\n$\\neg$PP compatibility of the set of states $P$, when $P$ is under the\ninteraction of some noisy channels, which would consequently let us identify\nsome noisy scenarios where it is still possible to perform the task of\nconclusive exclusion of states. Specifically, we consider the set $P$ of\n$n$-qubit states in interaction with an environment by means of i) individual\nand ii) collective couplings. In both cases, we analytically show that the\nphenomenon of achieving $\\neg$PP compatibility, although reduced, it is still\npresent. Searching for an optimisation of this phenomenon, we report numerical\nexperiments up to $n=4$ qubits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 18:10:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 14:29:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ducuara", "Andr\u00e9s F.", ""], ["Susa", "Cristian E.", ""], ["Reina", "John H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.05049", "submitter": "Francesco Plastina", "authors": "G.

These theories are introduced in the context\nof idealized machines which convert heat into electrical power (heat-engines)\nor convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators). In this sense,\nthe machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be\nunderstood to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum\nmechanics is important for most such machines, they fall into the field of\nquantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we consider have few\ndegrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact\nwith are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories\nwhich can take into account different aspects of mesoscopic and nanoscale\nphysics, such as coherent quantum transport, magnetic-field induced effects\n(including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect), and single\nelectron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric\nconversion, and the thermoelectric figure of merit.

At\nfinite bias, for which a current flows across the leads, we investigate the\ndifferential response of the current to a temperature gradient. In particular,\nwe compare the influence of a bias voltage and of a finite temperature on this\nthermoelectric response. This is of interest from a fundamental point of view\nto better understand the two different decoherence mechanisms produced by a\nbias voltage and by temperature. Our results show that in this respect the\nthermoelectric response behaves differently from the electric conductance. In\nparticular, while the latter displays a similar qualitative behavior as a\nfunction of voltage and temperature, both in theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations, qualitative differences occur in the case of the thermoelectric\nresponse. In order to understand this effect, we analyze the different\ncontributions in connection to the behavior of the impurity spectral function\nversus temperature. Especially in the regime of strong interactions and large\nenough bias voltages we obtain a simple picture based on the asymmetric\nsuppression or enhancement of the split Kondo peaks as a function of the\ntemperature gradient.

Based on these findings, a method for actively\ndecreasing the ion's energy by reducing the spatial expansion of the buffer gas\narises (Forced Sympathetic Cooling).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 12:50:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["H\u00f6ltkemeier", "Bastian", ""], ["Weckesser", "Pascal", ""], ["L\u00f3pez-Carrera", "Henry", ""], ["Weidem\u00fcller", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07125", "submitter": "Nina Megier", "authors": "Nina Megier, Dariusz Chru\\'sci\\'nski, Jyrki Piilo, Walter T.

This sort of (approximate)\ncatalytic state transformations are relevant in the context of (i) state\npreparation using a bounded-size quantum clock or reference frame, where the\nclock or reference frame acts as a catalyst, (ii) quantum thermodynamics, where\nagain a clock can be used as a catalyst to prepare states which contain\ncoherence with respect to the system Hamiltonian, and (iii) cloning of unknown\nquantum states, where the given copies of state can be interpreted as a\ncatalyst for preparing the new copies. Using a recent result of Fawzi and\nRenner on approximate recoverability, we show that the achievable accuracy in\nthis kind of catalytic transformations can be determined by a single function,\nnamely the relative entropy of asymmetry, which is equal to the difference\nbetween the entropy of state and its symmetrized version: if the desired state\ntransition does not require a large increase of this quantity, then it can be\nimplemented with high fidelity using only symmetric operations. Our lower bound\non the achievable fidelity is tight in the case of cloners, and can be achieved\nusing the Petz recovery map, which interestingly turns out to be the optimal\ncloning map found by Werner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 22:28:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Marvian", "Iman", ""], ["Lloyd", "Seth", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07326", "submitter": "Ji\\v{r}\\'i Svozil\\'ik", "authors": "Ji\\v{r}\\'i Svozil\\'ik, Jan Pe\\v{r}ina Jr., Roberto de J.\n  Le\\'on-Montiel", "title": "Two-Photon Absorption Spectroscopy using Intense Phase-Chirped Entangled\n  Beams", "comments": "new version, accepted in Chemical Physics, 14 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We numerically analyze the use of intense entangled twin beams for\nultra-sensitive spectroscopic measurements in chemical and biological systems.\nThe examined scheme makes use of intense frequency-modulated (chirped)\nentangled beams to successfully extract information about the intermediate\nmaterial states that contribute to the two-photon excitation of an absorbing\nmedium.

More specifically, it covers four main topics: Coherent LQG\nControl, Free-Carrier Oscillations, Optical Ising Machines and Pulsed OPO\nDynamics. Tying them all together is a theory of open quantum systems called\nthe SLH model, which I introduce in Chapters 1-2. The SLH model is a general\nframework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is\nthe basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG\ncontrol is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent\nfeedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear\nquadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's\nsimultaneous utilization of both light quadratures. Semiclassical\ntruncated-Wigner techniques for quantum-optical networks are discussed in\nChapter 5, leading to a thorough discussion of quantum noise in systems with\nfree-carrier nonlinearities (Chapter 6), comparison to the Kerr nonlinearity,\nand potential applications for analog computing based on limit cycles and\namplification (Chapters 7-8). Ising machines based on optical parametric\noscillators (OPOs) are discussed in Chapters 9-10, the former focusing on large\n1D and 2D networks of OPOs, and the latter on the dynamics of a single OPO in\nthe ultrafast, synchronously-pumped regime.

Although a few\nanalytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing pulsed\nsingle-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at\nleast extremely idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture\nof pulsed single-photon sources by elaborating how to numerically and fully\ncharacterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating in a pulsed regime. In\norder to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum\nMonte--Carlo simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form\nof the quantum regression theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed\nsingle-photon source is connected to its photocount distribution and its\nmeasured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence. By doing so, we\nprovide a description of the relationship between instantaneous source\ncorrelations and the typical experimental interferometers (Hanbury-Brown and\nTwiss, Hong-Ou-Mandel, and Mach-Zehnder) used to characterize such sources.\nThen, we use these techniques to explore several prototypical quantum systems\nand their non-ideal behaviors. As an example numerical result, we show that for\nthe most popular single-photon source---a resonantly excited two-level\nsystem---its error probability is directly related to its excitation pulse\nlength.

Its\neigenvalues are, generally, complex and provide not only the energies but also\nthe lifetimes of the states of the system. The states may couple via the common\nenvironment of scattering wavefunctions into which the system is embedded. This\ncauses an {\\it external mixing} (EM) of the states. Mathematically, EM is\nrelated to the existence of singular (the so-called exceptional) points (EPs).\nThe eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator are biorthogonal, in contrast to\nthe orthogonal eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator. A quantitative measure\nfor the ratio between biorthogonality and orthogonality is the phase rigidity\nof the wavefunctions. At and near an EP, the phase rigidity takes its minimum\nvalue. The lifetimes of two nearby eigenstates of a quantum system bifurcate\nunder the influence of an EP. At the parameter value of maximum width\nbifurcation, the phase rigidity approaches the value one, meaning that the two\neigenfunctions become orthogonal. However, the eigenfunctions are externally\nmixed at this parameter value.

The\ninterplay between strong exciton-vibration coupling and strong exciton-cavity\ncoupling gives rise to a hybrid ground state, which we refer to as the lower\npolaron polariton. Explicit expressions for the ground-state wave function, the\nzero-temperature quasiparticle weight of the lower polaron polariton, the\nphotoluminescence line strength, and the mean number of vibrational quanta are\nobtained in terms of the optimal variational parameters. The dependence of\nthese quantities upon the exciton-cavity coupling strength reveals that strong\ncavity coupling leads to an enhanced vibrational dressing of the cavity mode,\nand at the same time a vibrational decoupling of the dark excitons, which in\nturn results in a lower polaron polariton resembling a single-mode dressed bare\nlower polariton in the strong-coupling regime.

Our analysis focuses in particular on deviations of the HD+\nvelocity distribution from thermal (Gaussian) distributions under the influence\nof collisions with fast ions produced during (laser-induced) chemical\nreactions, as such deviations turn out to significantly shift the\nhyperfine-less vibrational frequency as inferred from the saturated and\nDoppler-broadened spectrum, which contains partly unresolved hyperfine\nstructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 18:18:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Biesheuvel", "J.", ""], ["Karr", "J. -Ph.", ""], ["Hilico", "L.", ""], ["Eikema", "K.

In one approach, a counterdiabatic quantum\nHamiltonian $\\hat H_{CD}$ is constructed to suppress nonadiabatic excitations.\nIn the analogous classical problem, a counterdiabatic classical Hamiltonian\n$H_{CD}$ ensures that the classical action remains constant even under rapid\ndriving. Both the quantum and classical versions of this problem have been\nsolved for the special case of scale-invariant driving, characterized by linear\nexpansions, contractions or translations of the system. Here we investigate an\nexample of a non-scale-invariant system -- a tilted piston. We solve exactly\nfor the classical counterdiabatic Hamiltonian $H_{CD}(q,p,t)$, which we then\nquantize to obtain a Hermitian operator $\\hat H_{CD}(t)$. Using numerical\nsimulations, we find that $\\hat H_{CD}$ effectively suppresses non-adiabatic\nexcitations under rapid driving. These results offer a proof of principle --\nbeyond the special case of scale-invariant driving -- that quantum shortcuts to\nadiabaticity can successfully be constructed from their classical counterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 18:54:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Patra", "Ayoti", ""], ["Jarzynski", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.09012", "submitter": "Leonardo Disilvestro Leonardo Disilvestro", "authors": "Leonardo Disilvestro and Damian Markham", "title": "Quantum Protocols within Spekkens' Toy Model", "comments": "25 pages, 3 figures; Several changes from previous version, overall\n  readability and structure improved.

These advantages range from\ncomputational speeds-up to security improvements. A key question is where these\nadvantages come from. The toy model developed by Spekkens [R. W. Spekkens PRA\n75, 032110 (2012)] mimics many of the features of quantum mechanics, such as\nentanglement and no-cloning, regarded as being important in this regard,\ndespite being a local hidden variable theory. In this work we study several\nprotocols within Spekkens' toy model where we see it can also mimic the\nadvantages and limitations shown in the quantum case. We first provide explicit\nproofs for the impossibility of toy bit-commitment and the existence of a toy\nerror correction protocol and consequent $k-$threshold secret sharing. Then,\ndefining a toy computational model based on the quantum one-way computer we\nprove the existence of blind and verified protocols. Importantly, these two\nlast quantum protocols are known to achieve a better-than-classical security.\nOur results suggest that such quantum improvements need not arise from any\nBell-type non locality or contextuality, but rather as a consequence of\nsteering correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 19:41:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 11:03:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Disilvestro", "Leonardo", ""], ["Markham", "Damian", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.09013", "submitter": "Slava Smartsev", "authors": "Slava Smartsev, David Eger, Nir Davidson, Ofer Firstenberg", "title": "Continuous generation of delayed light", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1361-6455/aa8ecb", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use a Raman four-wave mixing process to read-out light from atomic\ncoherence which is continuously written.
