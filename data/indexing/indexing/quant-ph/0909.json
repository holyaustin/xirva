Classically, efficient\nsecret sharing schemes have been shown to be induced by matroids. Furthermore,\naccess structures of such schemes can be characterized by an excluded minor\nrelation. No such relations are known for quantum secret sharing schemes. In\nthis paper we take the first steps toward a matroidal characterization of\nquantum secret sharing schemes. In addition to providing a new perspective on\nquantum secret sharing schemes, this characterization has important benefits.\nWhile previous work has shown how to construct quantum secret sharing schemes\nfor general access structures, these schemes are not claimed to be efficient.\nIn this context the present results prove to be useful; they enable us to\nconstruct efficient quantum secret sharing schemes for many general access\nstructures.

The concept of steering was introduced in 1935 by\nSchr\\\"odinger as a generalization of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox.\nSurprisingly, it has only recently been formalized as a quantum information\ntask with arbitrary bipartite states and measurements, for which the existence\nof entanglement is necessary but not sufficient. Previous experiments in this\narea have been restricted to the approach of Reid [PRA 40, 913], which followed\nthe original EPR argument in considering only two different measurement\nsettings per side. Here we implement more than two settings so as to be able to\ndemonstrate experimentally, for the first time, that EPR-steering occurs for\nmixed entangled states that are Bell-local (that is, which cannot possibly\ndemonstrate Bell-nonlocality). Unlike the case of Bell inequalities, increasing\nthe number of measurement settings beyond two--we use up to six--dramatically\nincreases the robustness of the EPR-steering phenomenon to noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Sep 2009 03:28:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Jan 2011 23:28:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Saunders", "D.

First,\nwe study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of\nwell-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively\nlow velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.\nThe latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective\nrepulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via\nan effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that\nstationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear\ncontinuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic\noscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the\nstability of such structures. We find that for a sufficiently large number of\natoms, multiple soliton states may be dynamically stable, while for a small\nnumber of atoms, we predict a dynamical instability emerging from resonance\neffects between the eigenfrequencies of the soliton modes and the intrinsic\nexcitation frequencies of the condensate.

The theory\nis a version of orthodox(Copenhagen) quantum mechanics, based on the notion\nthat the unique and mysterious feature of quantum, as opposed to classical,\nsystems is the simultaneous existence of multiple incompatible representations\nof reality, referred to as \"frameworks\". A framework is a maximal set of\nproperties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.\nThis notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set\nof exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully\ncharacterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible\nframeworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior. Any prediction of\nthe theory must be confined to a single framework and combining elements from\ndifferent frameworks leads to quantum mechanically meaningless statements. This\n\"single framework rule\" is the precise mathematical statement of Bohr's\ncomplementarity. It is shown that if the microscopic description is assumed to\nincorporate these elements in a local setting, then distant entanglements,\nmacroscopic measurements, wave function collapse and other mysterious features\nof quantum behavior follow in a logical manner.

This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to\nthe Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the\nalpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used\nin the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces.

We then use the norms to establish\nwhat appears to be the most general spectral test for k-positivity currently\navailable, showing how it implies several other known tests as well as some new\nones. Building on this work, we frame the NPPT bound entangled problem as a\nconcrete problem on a specific limit, specifically that a particular entangled\nWerner state is bound entangled if and only if a certain norm inequality holds\non a given family of projections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 19:47:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:09:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 00:14:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 20 Aug 2010 18:15:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Johnston", "Nathaniel", ""], ["Kribs", "David W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3930", "submitter": "Bill Rosgen", "authors": "Bill Rosgen", "title": "Computational Distinguishability of Quantum Channels", "comments": "Ph.D. Thesis, 178 pages, 35 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The computational problem of distinguishing two quantum channels is central\nto quantum computing.

We study a particular example of\nthis dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic\nspins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe.\nBy introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of\nthe Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state.\nThis shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak\nmeasurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time.\nSimultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can\ndrive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary\nunitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master\nequation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the\npresence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this\nformalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of\nstate-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak\nmeasurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2009 16:42:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Deutsch", "Ivan H.", ""], ["Jessen", "Poul S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4553", "submitter": "Travis Norsen", "authors": "Travis Norsen", "title": "The Theory of (Exclusively) Local Beables", "comments": "32 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Found.

In particular, the usual quantum\nmechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)\nis not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has\nan associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of\nadditional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,\nin ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some\ninteresting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave\ntheories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically\nviable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration\nspace) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing\ncorresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.\nThat is the theory's \\emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue. Its\nvices include the fact that it only reproduces the empirical predictions of the\nordinary pilot-wave theory (equivalent, of course, to the predictions of\nordinary quantum theory) for spinless non-relativistic particles, and only then\nfor wave functions that are everywhere analytic. The goal is thus not to\nrecommend the TELB proposed here as a replacement for ordinary pilot-wave\ntheory (or ordinary quantum theory), but is rather to illustrate (with a crude\nfirst stab) that it might be possible to construct a plausible, empirically\nviable TELB, and to recommend this as an interesting and perhaps-fruitful\nprogram for future research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2009 21:11:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2010 19:56:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Jun 2010 14:21:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Norsen", "Travis", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4599", "submitter": "Guo Chuan Thiang", "authors": "Guo Chuan Thiang, Philippe Raynal, Berthold-Georg Englert", "title": "Optimal Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition of two-qubit states using\n  Semidefinite Programming", "comments": "7 pages. submitted to PRA", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Thus, the\ncondition that measurement and mixing entropies coincide is a strong constraint\non possible theories.
