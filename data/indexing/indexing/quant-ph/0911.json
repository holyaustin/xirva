It was resolved by Raz who\nshowed that strong parallel repetition does \\emph{not} hold, even in the very\nspecial case of games known as XOR games.\n  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case\nwhen the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the\nbehavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \\emph{perfect}) parallel\nrepetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear\nunique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called\nnon-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due\nto Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\\Theta(\\eps^2))^\\ell$.\n  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers\nnor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound\nis tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique\ngames in terms of a semidefinite program.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Nov 2009 20:28:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kempe", "Julia", ""], ["Regev", "Oded", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0249", "submitter": "Ho-Tsang Ng", "authors": "H.

Lett. 102, 230502 (2009)] we showed that the\npartition function of all classical spin models, including all discrete\nstandard statistical models and all Abelian discrete lattice gauge theories\n(LGTs), can be expressed as a special instance of the partition function of a\n4-dimensional pure LGT with gauge group Z_2 (4D Z_2 LGT). This provides a\nunification of models with apparently very different features into a single\ncomplete model. The result uses an equality between the Hamilton function of\nany classical spin model and the Hamilton function of a model with all possible\nk-body Ising-type interactions, for all k, which we also prove. Here, we\nelaborate on the proof of the result, and we illustrate it by computing\nquantities of a specific model as a function of the partition function of the\n4D Z_2 LGT. The result also allows one to establish a new method to compute the\nmean-field theory of Z_2 LGTs with d > 3, and to show that computing the\npartition function of the 4D Z_2 LGT is computationally hard (#P hard). The\nproof uses techniques from quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2009 10:06:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2009 09:40:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Apr 2010 08:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cuevas", "G.

In the\nfirst, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight\nthe effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward\nmanner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin\ntossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date\nwhile using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.\n  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a\nvariant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased\ncoins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional\nsecurity for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for\nany bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be\nunconditionally secure for any bias.\n  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,\nprior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a\ngeneral model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide\nrange of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit\ncheating attacks for such functions.\n  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random\nstring, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her\ndevices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an\narbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture\nsecurely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be\nexpanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large\nexpansion of such a string.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2009 17:01:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2011 04:42:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Colbeck", "Roger", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3835", "submitter": "Margareta Wallquist", "authors": "Margareta Wallquist, Klemens Hammerer, Peter Rabl, Mikhail Lukin and\n  Peter Zoller", "title": "Hybrid quantum devices and quantum engineering", "comments": "Proceedings of the Nobel symposium on Qu-bits for Quantum\n  Information, Gothenburg 2009", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The key\nto this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the\nenvironment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a\npurely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,\nmixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the\npointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between\nthe system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy\nincrease. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the\nstate of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.\nEnvironments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either\nbecause they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,\ntherefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the\nconcept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -\nthe deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified\nby the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is\ninformation regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In\naddition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting\nwith a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of\ninformation acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior\nindependent of the initial state of S.

Another\nproblem for which the Fourier transform has been recruited successfully on a\nquantum computer is the hidden shift problem.

[1] one of the authors proposed postulates for axiomatizing Quantum\nMechanics as a \"fair operational framework\", namely regarding the theory as a\nset of rules that allow the experimenter to predict future events on the basis\nof suitable tests, having local control and low experimental complexity. In\naddition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH\n(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of\na faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical\npower, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]\nin addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)\nand PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the\nprobabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the\npresent paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic\nmodels. The first model, \"the two-box world\" is an extension of the\nPopescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH\ninequality compatible with the no-signaling principle. The second model \"the\ntwo-clock world\" is actually a full class of models, all having a disk as\nconvex set of states for the local system. One of them corresponds to the \"the\ntwo-rebit world\", namely qubits with real Hilbert space. The third model--\"the\nspin-factor\"--is a sort of n-dimensional generalization of the clock. Finally\nthe last model is \"the classical probabilistic theory\".

Lett. 101, 230502 (2008))\nthat transports quantum information from one end of a spin chain to the other;\nand then implement it in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to demonstrate that the\ndecomposition is experimentally viable and well-scaled. We furthur\nexperimentally test the resilience of the state transfer to static errors in\nthe coupling parameters of the simulated Hamiltonian. This is done by\ndecomposing and simulating the corresponding imperfect unitaries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 08:55:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Nov 2010 10:22:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2012 22:13:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ajoy", "Ashok", ""], ["Rao", "Rama Koteswara", ""], ["Kumar", "Anil", ""], ["Rungta", "Pranaw", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5477", "submitter": "Andreas Lauchli", "authors": "Andreas M.
