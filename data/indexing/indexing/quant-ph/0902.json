A distinctly different\nquantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As\na function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band\nconsisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of\nthe conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin\ndegeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the\nmagnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot\ndistances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states\ntend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the\nhigher-in-energy excited states.\n  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a\nWigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized\nat the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram. Using the spin-resolved\npair-correlation functions, one can map the EXD many-body wave functions onto\nthe spin functions associated with the four localized electrons. Analogies with\nnanomagnets, such as finite Heisenberg clusters, are discussed. The ability to\ndetermine associated spin functions enables investigations concerning\nentanglement properties of the system of four electrons.
