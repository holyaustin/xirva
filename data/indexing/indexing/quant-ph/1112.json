The system is modeled\nas a three-mode system, two orthogonal polariton modes representing the coupled\noptical lattice and the cavity mode, and one mechanical mode representing the\noscillating mirror. We examine separately the cases of two-mode and three-mode\ninteractions which are distinguished by a suitable tuning of the mechanical\nmode to the polariton mode frequencies. In the two-mode case, we find that the\noccurrence of entanglement between one of the polariton modes and the\nmechanical mode is highly sensitive to the presence of the first-order\ncoherence between the modes. In particular, the creation of the first-order\ncoherence among the modes is achieved at the expense of entanglement between\nthe modes. In the three-mode case, we show that no entanglement is created\nbetween the independent polariton modes if both modes are coupled to the\nmechanical mode by the parametric interaction. There is no entanglement between\nthe polaritons even if the oscillating mirror is damped by a squeezed vacuum\nfield. The interaction creates the first-order coherence between the polaritons\nand the degree of coherence can, in principle, be as large as unity. This\ndemonstrates that the oscillating mirror can establish the first-order\ncoherence between two independent thermal modes.

In order to identify the\ncritical time $T^{\\ast}$, below which the target transformation is not\nreachable, as well as to determine the associated Pareto front, we introduce a\nnumerical method of Pareto front tracking (PFT). We consider closed two- and\nmulti-qubit systems with constant inter-qubit coupling strengths and each\nindividual qubit controlled by a separate time-dependent external field. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that unit fidelity (to a desired numerical accuracy) can\nbe achieved at any $T \\geq T^{\\ast}$ in most cases. However, the optimization\nsearch effort rises superexponentially as $T$ decreases and approaches\n$T^{\\ast}$. Furthermore, a small decrease in control time incurs a significant\npenalty in fidelity for $T < T^{\\ast}$, indicating that it is generally\nundesirable to operate below the critical time. We investigate the dependence\nof the critical time $T^{\\ast}$ on the coupling strength between qubits and the\ntarget gate transformation. Practical consequences of these findings for\nlaboratory implementation of quantum gates are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 21:27:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 17:46:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 2 Dec 2012 01:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tibbetts", "Katharine W.

It also provides a necessary and sufficient condition for what\nkind of measurement statistics is preserved by a unital quantum operation.\nFinally, our result clarifies and extends the work of St{\\o}rmer by giving a\nproof of a reduction theorem on the unassisted and entanglement-assisted\nclassical capacities, coherent information, and minimal output Renyi entropy of\na unital channel acting on finite-dimensional quantum state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2011 01:01:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2012 07:50:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 00:37:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Kai-Yan", ""], ["Fung", "Chi-Hang Fred", ""], ["Chau", "H.

Two types of resonant modulation are\nconsidered: additive, with frequency close to the oscillator eigenfrequency,\nand parametric, with frequency close to twice the eigenfrequency. It is shown\nthat relaxation of the oscillator is accompanied by quantum noise, which leads\nto a finite-width distribution over quantum states even for T=0. The quantum\nnoise also leads to switching between coexisting vibrational states via\ntransitions over the barrier in phase space. The switching mechanism, quantum\nactivation, has no analog in thermal equilibrium systems. The switching rates\ndisplay characteristic scaling near bifurcation points. The power and\nabsorption/amplification spectra of modulated oscillators are studied,\nincluding their fine structure. Nonresonant modulation can lead to cooling,\nheating, or self-sustained vibrations of an oscillator.

The first one,\ncalled the spin quantum-machine, is able to replicate the quantum probabilities\nassociated with the spin measurement of a spin-1/2 entity. The second one,\ncalled the \\emph{connected vessels of water model} (of which we shall present\nhere an alternative version based on elastics) is able to violate Bell's\ninequality, as coincidence measurements on entangled states can do.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Dec 2011 10:20:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Feb 2012 13:35:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 16:29:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 18:37:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2012 18:37:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["de Bianchi", "Massimiliano Sassoli", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.4056", "submitter": "Roman Schubert", "authors": "Roman Schubert, Raul O.

However, in\npractice, there exist conditions where CMA-ES converges to the global optimum\n(accomplishing its primary goal) while it does not learn the true covariance\nmatrix (missing an auxiliary objective), likely due to step-size deficiency.\nThese circumstances can involve high-dimensional landscapes with large\ncondition numbers. This paper introduces a novel technique entitled Forced\nOptimal Covariance Adaptive Learning (FOCAL), with the explicit goal of\ndetermining the Hessian at the global basin of attraction. It begins by\nintroducing theoretical foundations to the inverse relationship between the\nlearned covariance and the Hessian matrices. FOCAL is then introduced and\ndemonstrated to retrieve the Hessian matrix with high fidelity on both model\nlandscapes and experimental Quantum Control systems, which are observed to\npossess a non-separable, non-quadratic search landscape. The recovered Hessian\nforms are corroborated by physical knowledge of the systems.

The dependence of the eigenstates' entanglement\non the energy, as well as its behaviour in the regime of vanishing interaction,\nare similar to those observed in the three-electron system.

PETs do not affect scattering phase\nshifts and bound state energies of two-body system but are conventionally\nsupposed to modify two-body bound state observables such as the rms radius and\nelectromagnetic moments. Purpose: In order to preserve all bound state\nobservables, we propose a new particular case of PETs, a deuteron-equivalent\ntransformation (DET-PET), which leaves unchanged not only scattering phase\nshifts and bound state (deuteron) binding energy but also the bound state wave\nfunction. Methods: The construction of DET-PET is discussed; equations defining\nthe simplest DET-PETs are derived. We apply these simplest DET-PETs to the\nJISP16 $NN$ interaction and use the transformed $NN$ interactions in\ncalculations of $^3$H and $^4$He binding energies in the No-core Full\nConfiguration (NCFC) approach based on extrapolations of the No-core Shell\nModel (NCSM) basis space results to the infinite basis space. Results: We\ndemonstrate the DET-PET modification of the $np$ scattering wave functions and\nstudy the DET-PET manifestation in the binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He\nnuclei and their correlation (Tjon line). Conclusions: It is shown that some\nDET-PETs generate modifications of the central component while the others\nmodify the tensor component of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs are able to\nmodify significantly the $np$ scattering wave functions and hence the off-shell\nproperties of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs give rise to significant changes\nin the binding energies of $^3$H (in the range of approximately 1.5 MeV) and\n$^4$He (in the range of more than 9 MeV) and are able to modify the correlation\npatterns of binding energies of these nuclei.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Dec 2011 17:12:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2012 11:01:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Shirokov", "A.
