A unique solution is the teleportation of an\nentangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource\nto relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement\npurification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater.\nSince the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in\nlaboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in\nreal-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space\nentanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and\nTenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously\nindependent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for\nthe entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the\nclassical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and\nspace-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the\nfeasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the\nindependence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow\nfor efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our\nassay to lay the ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic\nhigh-loss and even turbulent quantum channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 21:01:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2014 21:02:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 May 2014 15:54:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 11:02:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Herbst", "Thomas", ""], ["Scheidl", "Thomas", ""], ["Fink", "Matthias", ""], ["Handsteiner", "Johannes", ""], ["Wittmann", "Bernhard", ""], ["Ursin", "Rupert", ""], ["Zeilinger", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0014", "submitter": "Charles Sebens", "authors": "Charles Sebens", "title": "Quantum Mechanics as Classical Physics", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": "Philosophy of Science, Vol. 82, No. 2 (April 2015), pp. 266-291", "doi": "10.1086/680190", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Here I explore a novel no-collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics which\ncombines aspects of two familiar and well-developed alternatives, Bohmian\nmechanics and the many-worlds interpretation.

Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's\ntheorem. The commonly accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in\nagreement with the Copenhagen interpretation. Here it is recalled that\nindeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis,\nand that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same\ntime another solution to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism'\nor 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism appears to be a philosophical position\nthat is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance Spinoza's\ndeterminism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic\nsolutions, choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical\nquestion, not a matter of physical experimentation, as is widely believed. If\nit is impossible to use physics for deciding between both positions, it is\nlegitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued\nthat probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is\ninstrumental for advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of\ndeterminism allows to answer a series of precise questions from probability\ntheory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions.

When for example measuring a photon using a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second\nbeam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted.\nThe decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after\nthe photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler's famous\ndelayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this\nexperiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam\nsplitter is itself still a classical object. Here we propose and realize a\nvariant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment. We configure a\nsuperconducting quantum circuit as a Ramsey interferometer, where the element\nthat acts as the first beam-splitter can be put in a quantum superposition of\nits active and inactive states, as verified by the negative values of its\nWigner function. We show that this enables the wave and particle aspects of the\nsystem to be observed with a single setup, without involving an ancilla that is\nnot itself a part of the interferometer. We also study the transition of this\nquantum beam-splitter from a quantum to a classical object due to decoherence,\nas observed by monitoring the interferometer output.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 12:31:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 14:32:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Shi-Biao", ""], ["Zhong", "You-Peng", ""], ["Xu", "Kai", ""], ["Wang", "Qi-Jue", ""], ["Wang", "H.", ""], ["Shen", "Li-Tuo", ""], ["Yang", "Chui-Ping", ""], ["Martinis", "John M.", ""], ["Cleland", "A.

We apply the scheme to a\nrare-earth compound LiHoF4 and calculate the echo signal, which is related to\nthe quantum fluctuations of the system. We observe enhanced signals at the\nphase boundary. The FRES should be useful for studying quantum fluctuations in\na broad range of spin systems, including cold atoms, quantum dots, solid-state\nimpurities, and transparent magnetic materials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 13:10:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Shao-Wen", ""], ["Liu", "Ren-Bao", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0432", "submitter": "Aleksey Fedorov", "authors": "Ilya A.

Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009) designed quantum protocols that\nguarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias. The probability of any outcome in\nthese protocols is provably at most $1/\\sqrt{2} + \\delta$ for any given $\\delta\n> 0$. However, no explicit description of these protocols is known, and the\nnumber of rounds in the protocols tends to infinity as $\\delta$ goes to 0.

We present a search algorithm to identify protocols\nwith low bias within a natural class, protocols based on bit-commitment (Nayak\nand Shor, 2003) restricting to commitment states used by Mochon (2005). An\nanalysis of the resulting protocols via semidefinite programs (SDPs) unveils a\nsimple structure. For example, we show that the SDPs reduce to second-order\ncone programs. We devise novel cheating strategies in the protocol by\nrestricting the semidefinite programs and use the strategies to prune the\nsearch.\n  The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given\nby a mesh over the parameter space. The protocols have up to six rounds of\ncommunication, with messages of varying dimension and include the best known\nexplicit protocol (with bias 1/4). We conduct two kinds of search: one for\nprotocols with bias below 0.2499, and one for protocols in the neighbourhood of\nprotocols with bias 1/4. Neither of these searches yields better bias.

The second approach makes full use of the mode aspect\nof second quantization whereby separability can be formulated as absence of\nnon-local correlation among two different sets of modes. While the first\napproach applies to pure states only, the second one is more general and\ncharacterizes generic entangled states.

This minimal system allows us to address generic\nissues in synchronization and scalability of entanglement with multiple buses,\nwhile pointing the way toward a modular large-scale quantum computer\narchitecture that promises less spectral crowding and less decoherence.

We give three\npostulates -- no higher-order interference, classical decomposability of\nstates, and strong symmetry -- and prove that the only non-classical\noperational probabilistic theories satisfying them are real, complex, and\nquaternionic quantum theory, together with 3-level octonionic quantum theory\nand ball state spaces of arbitrary dimension. Then we show that adding\nobservability of energy as a fourth postulate yields complex quantum theory as\nthe unique solution, relating the emergence of the complex numbers to the\npossibility of Hamiltonian dynamics.

In this work we\ndefine the position-dependent ladder operators and an effective local\nphoton-number operator that are consistent with the canonical commutation\nrelations and use these concepts to describe the energy transfer and thermal\nbalance in layered geometries. This approach results in a position-dependent\nphoton-number concept that is simple and consistent with classical energy\nconservation arguments. The operators are formed by first calculating the\nvector potential operator using Green's function formalism and Langevin noise\nsource operators related to the medium and its temperature, and then defining\nthe corresponding position-dependent annihilation operator that is required to\nsatisfy the canonical commutation relations in arbitrary geometry. Our results\nsuggest that the effective photon number associated with the electric field is\ngenerally position dependent and enables a straightforward method to calculate\nthe energy transfer rate between the field and the local medium. In particular,\nour results predict that the effective photon number in a vacuum cavity formed\nbetween two lossy material layers can oscillate as a function of the position\nsuggesting that also the local field temperature oscillates.

We present the basic ideas with simplified\ncalculations so that it is readable to both specialists and nonspecialists in\nthis area of research. A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of\nquantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and\nmomentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,\nthe formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin\ncoherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate\nindependent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path\nintegral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are\napplied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic\nanisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The\nsuppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero\nmagnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result\n(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate. At nonzero magnetic\nfield we present both the experimental and the theoretical results of the\noscillation of tunneling splitting as a function of the applied magnetic field\napplied along the spin hard anisotropy axis direction. The experimental and the\ntheoretical results of the tunneling in antiferromagnetic exchange coupled\ndimer model are also reviewed. As the spin coherent state path integral\nformalism is a semi-classical method, an alternative exact mapping of a spin\nsystem to a particle in a potential field (effective potential method) is\nderived. This effective potential method allows for the investigation of phase\ntransition of the escape rate in spin systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:45:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Aug 2014 18:05:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 19:01:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Owerre", "S.

For this purpose, we approach the question from three\nperspectives. Firstly, we look at the situation from the standard quantum\nangle, more specifically the de Broglie wavelength analysis of the behavior of\nmacroscopic entities, indicate how a problem with spin and identity arises, and\nillustrate how both play a fundamental role in well-established experimental\nquantum-macroscopical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensates. Secondly,\nwe analyze how the question is influenced by our result in axiomatic quantum\ntheory, which proves that standard quantum theory is structurally incapable of\ndescribing separated entities. Thirdly, we put forward our new 'conceptual\nquantum interpretation', including a highly detailed reformulation of the\nquestion to confront the new insights and views that arise with the foregoing\nanalysis. At the end of the final section, a nuanced answer is given that can\nbe summarized as follows. The specific and very classical perception of human\nseeing -- light as a geometric theory -- and human touching -- only ruled by\nPauli's exclusion principle -- plays a role in our perception of macroscopic\nentities as ontologically stable entities in space. To ascertain quantum\nbehavior in such macroscopic entities, we will need measuring apparatuses\ncapable of its detection.

Three of its main properties are that\nit is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under local\noperations applied to systems $A$ and $B$, and that it obeys the duality\nrelation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$ for a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. The\nconditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, an\nentanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for an\nentanglement measure. As such, it has been an open question to find R\\'enyi\ngeneralizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for a\ndeeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond the\ntraditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. The present paper\naddresses this question, by defining different $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi generalizations\n$I_{\\alpha}(A;B|C)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we can\nprove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit\n$\\alpha\\rightarrow1$. Furthermore, we prove that many of these generalizations\nsatisfy non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity with respect to local\noperations on one of the systems $A$ or $B$ (with it being left as an open\nquestion to prove that monotoniticity holds with respect to local operations on\nboth systems). The quantities defined here should find applications in quantum\ninformation theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leave\nthis for future work. We also state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity of\nthe R\\'enyi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to the\nR\\'enyi parameter $\\alpha$.
