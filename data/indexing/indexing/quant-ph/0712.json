This entanglement process is constrained by the symmetries of the\nscattering system and the boundary conditions on the incoming state. Applying\nthese constraints, three different mechanisms of entanglement can be\nidentified: the superposition of reflected and transmitted modes, momentum\ncorrelations of the reflected mode due to inversion of the relative momentum,\nand momentum correlations in the transmitted and reflected modes due to\ndependence of the scattering amplitude on the relative momentum. We consider\nthree standard potentials, the hard core, Dirac delta, and double Dirac delta,\nand show that the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the\ninteraction and on the properties of the incoming wave function.

The mean probability distribution of a Markov chain on a hypercube\nis known to mix to a uniform distribution in time O(n log n). We show that the\nmean probability distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on a hypercube\nmixes to a (generally non-uniform) distribution pi(x) in time O(n) and the\nstationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk. An\nexplicit expression for pi(x) is derived for the particular case of a symmetric\nwalk. These results are consistent with those obtained previously for a\ncontinuous-time quantum walk. The effect of decoherence due to randomly\nbreaking links between connected sites in the hypercube is also considered. We\nfind that the probability distribution mixes to the uniform distribution as\nexpected. However, the mixing time has a minimum at a critical decoherence rate\n$p \\approx 0.1$. A similar effect was previously reported for the QW on the\nN-cycle with decoherence from repeated measurements of position. A controlled\namount of decoherence helps to obtain--and preserve--a uniform distribution\nover the $2^n$ sites of the hypercube in the shortest possible time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 22:24:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2007 17:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Marquezino", "F.

With certain conditions on the interaction\nparameters, this chain can break into a simple two-state system and an\nadditional spectator state. Alternatively, a two-photon resonance condition in\nthis Householder-basis chain can be enforced, which heralds the existence of\nanother spectator state.

Moreover, it is shown that a suitable sequence\nof Householder transformations can cast an arbitrary N-dimensional hermitian\nHamiltonian into a tridiagonal form.

It is known that\nstabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily\nimplemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so\ncalled $\\mathcal{C}_k$ hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature\n\\textbf{402}, 390). Moreover, a subset of $\\mathcal{C}_k$ gates, called\nsemi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture\nthan the traditional teleportation setup (Phys.

In this paper we study the structure of\n$\\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation\nat least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another\none.

This paper\ndevelops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use\nof prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of\nmulti-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual\nisolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits\nfor \"commuting-operator provers\", who share private space, but can apply only\nsuch operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers.\nCommuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but\nprior-entangled provers, and thus, limits for commuting-operator provers\nimmediately give limits for usual entangled provers. Using this method, we\nobtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-\nShimony-Holt inequality for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in\nevery n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy\nwith prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a 3-prover 1-round binary\ninteractive proof for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe,\nKobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof\nsystem, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value\nof a 3-prover 1-round binary-answer game is equal to 1 or at most 1-1/p(n) for\nsome polynomial p, where n is the number of questions.

In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible\narchitecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave\nfield states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in\ncircuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric\ninteraction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of\nsuperconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical\nsystems.

A mathematical model is proposed\nfor the principal feature of consciousness assumed in EEC, namely its ability\n(in the state of sleep, trance or meditation, when the explicit consciousness\nis disabled) to obtain information from all alternative classical realities\n(Everett's worlds) and select the favorable realities. To represent this\nability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which\ncorrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future\nstate. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by\nthe goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way\nsymmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.\nPossible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere\nof life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are\nconsidered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those\nwhich are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct\nsighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The\nproblem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the\nframework of this theory. Automats may perform intellectual operations, but not\npostcorrection, therefore artificial intellect but not an artificial life can\nbe created. The brain serves as an interface between the body and\nconsciousness, but the most profound level of consciousness is not a function\nof brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2007 14:18:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mensky", "Michael B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3620", "submitter": "Joshua Combes", "authors": "Joshua Combes and Howard M.

We discuss in detail a general method for the explicit\nevaluation of the multipartite components of geometric entanglement, and we\nshow that the entire set of geometric measures establishes an ordering among\nthe different types of bipartite and multipartite entanglement. In particular,\nit determines a consistent hierarchy between $GHZ$ and $W$ states, clarifying\nthe original result of Wei and Goldbart that $W$ states possess a larger global\nentanglement than $GHZ$ states. Furthermore, we show that all multipartite\ncomponents of geometric entanglement in symmetric states obey a property of\nself-similarity and scale invariance with the total number of qubits and the\nnumber of qubits per party.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Dec 2007 21:26:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Apr 2008 01:12:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 12:58:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Blasone", "M.", ""], ["Dell'Anno", "F.", ""], ["De Siena", "S.", ""], ["Illuminati", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4093", "submitter": "Lev Kaplan", "authors": "Eric J.

In particular, it implies that key agreement in the\nbounded-storage model (using a standard sample-and-hash protocol) is fully\nsecure against quantum adversaries, thus solving a long-standing open problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2007 17:21:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Koenig", "Robert", ""], ["Renner", "Renato", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4297", "submitter": "Xiaolei Zhang", "authors": "Xiaolei Zhang", "title": "On the Nature of Quantum Phenomena", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  It is shown that a coherent understanding of all quantized phenomena,\nincluding those governed by unitary evolution equations as well as those\nrelated to irreversible quantum measurements, can be achieved in a scenario of\nsuccessive nonequilibrium phase transitions, with the lowest hierarchy of these\nphase transitions occurring in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire\nmatter and energy content of the universe. In this formalism, the physical laws\nthemselves are resonantly-selected and ordered in the universe cavity in a\nhierarchical manner, and the values of fundamental constants are determined\nthrough a Generalized Mach's Principle.

It defines the QC of some indeterminate-length qubit string \\rho\nas the minimum base length of any quantum input which makes a quantum Turing\nmachine (QTM) halt and output \\rho, up to some error tolerance.\n  First, we prove that there is a QTM which is universal in the sense of input\nbase length. Furthermore, we show several general properties of QTMs, including\na result on mutually orthogonal ``halting spaces'', and a way to transform\nevery almost-halting input into a deterministically-halting input by adding at\nmost a constant number of qubits.\n  Afterwards, we apply these results to QC.
