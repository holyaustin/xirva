However, since over a decade now,\nvariations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in\noptical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a\nfocus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an\nintroduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss\nbriefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended\nBose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,\nnext-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the\nimportance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding\napproximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the\nmodels to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects\nthe density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site\ninteraction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both\ncontact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also\nthe effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep\noptical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects,\nmainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to\neffective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also\nexamples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as\nwell as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\nFinally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\\\"odinger models of the Salerno\ntype that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling\nbetween the adjacent sites.

This enhancement grows as the\ntransparency window width, \\Delta_EIT, is narrowed. Decreasing \\Delta_EIT,\nhowever, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses\nof a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the\nnonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow\nEIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is\nnot only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its\nincreased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter\n(temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to\nprolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase\nshift that grows linearly with \\Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may\nsaturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the\ndetectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound. For many\npurposes, it is this detectability which is of interest, more than the absolute\nmagnitude of the peak phase shift. We present analytical expressions based on a\nlinear time-invariant model that accounts for the temporal behavior of the\ncross-phase modulation for several parameter ranges of interest.

In such optical fibers, the light is guided over\nlong distances by continuous total internal reflection which occurs at the\ninterface between the fiber core with a higher refractive index and the lower\nindex cladding. Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the\nwaveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this\nfield is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical\nfibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to\nefficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g.,\ntapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by\nthe latter can lead to significant coupling of the light's spin and orbital\nangular momentum.

However, it soon turned\nout to even require some hypercomplex algebra. Incorporating Special Relativity\nleads to an equation (Dirac 1928) requiring pairwise anti-commuting\ncoefficients, usually $4\\times 4$ matrices. A unitary ring of square matrices\nis an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic\nproperties and relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by\nbiquaternions. In this paper, we first consider the basics of non-relativistic\nand relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex algebras and also\nshow how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated\nusing biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations\nwithin hypercomplex algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our\npurpose equations akin to Schr\\\"odinger's should be able to be set up and\nsolved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms of\neach other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence\nbe a subalgebra. Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by $\\mathcal{J}$. It must\nbe isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$, hence containing an internal identity element.\nThe bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions, and\ntherefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also\nshow that bicomplex numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds\nof conjugates. One of these treats the elements of $\\mathcal{J}$ like the usual\nconjugate treats complex numbers. This defines a quantity what we call a\nmodulus which, in contrast to the complex absolute square, remains non-real\n(but may be called `pseudo-real').

In parallel,\nthe quantum nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has spawned the\nfield of quantum imaging that encompasses technologies such as quantum ghost\nimaging and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The emergence of\nsuch quantum technologies also highlights the need for the development of\nmethods for characterizing the elusive quantum state itself. In this document,\nwe describe new technologies that use the quantum properties of light for\nsecurity. The first is a technique that extends the principles behind QKD to\nthe field of imaging. By applying the polarization-based BB84 protocol to\nindividual photons in an active imaging system, we obtained images that are\nsecure against intercept-resend jamming attacks. The second technology\npresented in this article is based on an extension of quantum ghost imaging. We\nused a holographic filtering technique to build a quantum ghost image\nidentification system that uses a few pairs of photons to identify an object\nfrom a set of known objects. The third technology addressed in this document is\na high-dimensional QKD system that uses orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes of\nlight for encoding. Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one\nto impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels\nof security. We discuss the development of two OAM-QKD protocols based on the\nBB84 and Ekert QKD protocols. The fourth and final technology presented in this\narticle is a relatively new technique called direct measurement that uses\nsequential weak and strong measurements to characterize a quantum state.

The ability of the Bohmian formalism to\nanalyze this last type of problems for (open) quantum systems remains mainly\nunexplored by the scientific community. The authors of this review are\nconvinced that the final status of the Bohmian theory among the scientific\ncommunity will be greatly influenced by its potential success in these type of\nproblems that present non-unitary and/or nonlinear quantum evolutions. A brief\nintroduction of the Bohmian formalism and some of its extensions are presented\nin the last part of this review.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jun 2014 08:49:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2014 06:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Benseny", "A.", ""], ["Albareda", "G.", ""], ["Sanz", "A.

For this purpose, a set of\nD slits with complex transmission are displayed on a spatial light modulator\n(SLM). In a recent work we have shown a method that requires a single\nphase-only SLM to control independently the complex coefficients which define\nthe quantum state of dimension D. The amplitude information was codified by\nintroducing phase gratings inside each slit and the phase value of the complex\ntransmission was added to the phase gratings.

Although this method\nhas proven to be a good alternative to compact the previously reported\narchitectures, it presents some features that could be improved. In this paper\nwe present an alternative scheme to codify the required phase values that\nminimizes the effects of temporal phase fluctuations associated to the SLM\nwhere the codification is carried on. In this scheme the amplitudes are set by\nappropriate phase gratings addressed at the SLM while the relative phases are\nobtained by a lateral displacement of these phase gratings.

We employ our procedure to\ncapture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the\nquantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum\nfields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix\nproduct states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states\nnaturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and\nare thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting\nquantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point\ncorrelation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation\nfunctions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at\nhand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for\nquasi-condensates. In this setting, we can use the quality of our tomographic\nreconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved\nphysical processes. We discuss the potential of such methods in the context of\npartial verification of analogue quantum simulators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 20:01:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Steffens", "A.", ""], ["Friesdorf", "M.", ""], ["Langen", "T.", ""], ["Rauer", "B.", ""], ["Schweigler", "T.", ""], ["H\u00fcbener", "R.", ""], ["Schmiedmayer", "J.", ""], ["Riofr\u00edo", "C.

The key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations and\nstates which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal.

Adding chiral\nfunctionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling\nintegrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel\ntopological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates\nphotons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are\nreverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a\nnon-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and\nscattering may become directional.

Single-photon\nemission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\\% is observed\nunder conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the\nwaveguide.

The computational study of their electronic\nstructure is often challenging, because a reliable description of the\ncorrelation, and in particular of the static one, requires multi-reference\ntechniques. The Jastrow correlated Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP) is a\ncompact and efficient wave function ansatz, based on the valence-bond\nrepresentation, which can be used within Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches.\nThe AGP part can be rewritten in terms of molecular orbitals, obtaining a\nmulti-determinant expansion with zero-seniority number. In the present work we\ndemonstrate the capability of the JAGP ansatz to correctly describe the\nelectronic structure of two diradical prototypes: the orthogonally twisted\nethylene, C2H4, and the methylene, CH2, representing respectively a\nhomosymmetric and heterosymmetric system. On the other hand, we show that the\nsimple ansatz of a Jastrow correlated Single Determinant (JSD) wave function is\nunable to provide an accurate description of the electronic structure in these\ndiradical molecules, both at variational level and, more remarkably, in the\nfixed-nodes projection schemes showing that a poor description of the static\ncorrelation yields an inaccurate nodal surface. The suitability of JAGP to\ncorrectly describe diradicals with a computational cost comparable with that of\na JSD calculation, in combination with a favorable scalability of QMC\nalgorithms with the system size, opens new perspectives in the ab initio study\nof large diradical systems, like the transition states in cycloaddition\nreactions and the thermal isomerization of biological chromophores.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 11:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zen", "Andrea", ""], ["Coccia", "Emanuele", ""], ["Luo", "Ye", ""], ["Sorella", "Sandro", ""], ["Guidoni", "Leonardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4342", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vallone Dr.", "authors": "Davide Bacco, Matteo Canale, Nicola Laurenti, Giuseppe Vallone, Paolo\n  Villoresi", "title": "Experimental quantum key distribution with finite-key security analysis\n  for noisy channels", "comments": "20 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Nature Communication 4, 2363 (2013)", "doi": "10.1038/ncomms3363", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In quantum key distribution implementations, each session is typically chosen\nlong enough so that the secret key rate approaches its asymptotic limit.\nHowever, this choice may be constrained by the physical scenario, as in the\nperspective use with satellites, where the passage of one terminal over the\nother is restricted to a few minutes.

Here, we describe a novel technique to\nrealize such nonlinearities using graphene, exploiting the strong per-photon\nfields associated with tightly confined graphene plasmons in combination with\nspatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. We show that in properly\ndesigned graphene nanostructures, these conditions enable extremely strong\ninternal down-conversion between a single quantized plasmon and an entangled\nplasmon pair, or the reverse process of second harmonic generation. A separate\nissue is how such strong internal nonlinearities can be observed, given the\nnominally weak coupling between these plasmon resonances and free-space\nradiative fields. On one hand, by using the collective coupling to radiation of\nnanostructure arrays, we show that the internal nonlinearities can manifest\nthemselves as efficient frequency conversion of radiative fields at extremely\nlow input powers. On the other hand, the development of techniques to\nefficiently couple to single nanostructures would allow these nonlinear\nprocesses to occur at the level of single input photons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 13:24:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2015 15:12:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 07:56:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Manzoni", "Marco T.", ""], ["Silveiro", "Iv\u00e1n", ""], ["de Abajo", "F.

For\nHardy's inequalities, their homogenizations bear stronger quantum violation for\nthe maximally entangled state; the tight Bell inequalities without quantum\nviolation give the boundary of quantum and supra-quantum, but their\nhomogenizations do not have the similar properties. We find their\nhomogenization are violated by the maximally entangled state. Numerically\ncomputation shows the the domains of quantum violation of homogenized Hardy's\ninequalities for the generalized GHZ states are smaller than those of Hardy's\ninequalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 03:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 07:22:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xu", ""], ["Su", "Hong-Yi", ""], ["Xu", "Zhen-Peng", ""], ["Wu", "Yu-Chun", ""], ["Chen", "Jing-Ling", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4599", "submitter": "Nina Hadis Amini", "authors": "Nina H.

The outcome\nof our analysis suggests that cyclic deformations create novel scenarios of\nphysical and mathematical applicability of defect structures supported by the\nsine-Gordon theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 21:55:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 16:38:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bernardini", "Alex E.", ""], ["Chinaglia", "Mariana", ""], ["da Rocha", "Roldao", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4906", "submitter": "Emerson Sadurni", "authors": "E.

We show that such a\nstatement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \\emph{gapped quantum\nliquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can \"dissolve\" any\nproduct states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually\ncorrespond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy.\nSymmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids,\nbut with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the\nuniversality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations\n(without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and\nsymmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological\nentanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the\nexact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This\nmethod can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry\nand the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of\ntopological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by\n\\emph{stochastic local (SL) transformations} (i.e.\\ \\emph{local invertible\ntransformations}): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking\nclasses to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of\nsuccess, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL\ntransformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity.

The\napproach describes the disappearance of the off-diagonal terms (\"truncation\")\nof the density matrix as a physical effect due to A, while the registration of\nthe outcome has classical features due to the large size of the pointer\nvariable, the magnetisation. A quantum ambiguity implies that the density\nmatrix at the final time can be decomposed on many bases, not only the one of\nthe measurement. This quantum oddity prevents to connect individual outcomes to\nmeasurements, a difficulty known as the \"measurement problem\". It is shown that\nit is circumvented by the apparatus as well, since the evolution in a small\ntime interval erases all decompositions, except the one on the measurement\nbasis. Once one can derive the outcome of individual events from quantum\ntheory, the so-called \"collapse of the wave function\" or the \"reduction of the\nstate\" appears as the result of a selection of runs among the original large\nset. Hence nothing more than standard quantum mechanics is needed to explain\nfeatures of measurements. The employed statistical formulation is advocated for\nthe teaching of quantum theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2014 17:15:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Nieuwenhuizen", "Theo M.", ""], ["Perarnau-Llobet", "Marti", ""], ["Balian", "Roger", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.5235", "submitter": "Clevenson Hannah", "authors": "Hannah Clevenson, Matthew E.

Based on this framework, we derive a family of universal\nmeasurement uncertainty relations, provide a simple information theoretic\nexplanation of quantitative wave--particle duality, and offer new perspectives\nfor understanding Bell nonlocality, contextuality, and quantum precision limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 14:25:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 14:25:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Huangjun", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.6932", "submitter": "Keisuke Fujii", "authors": "Keisuke Fujii and Shuhei Tamate", "title": "Computational quantum-classical boundary of complex and noisy quantum\n  systems", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures, v2,v3: improved versions", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is often said that the transition from quantum to classical worlds is\ncaused by decoherence originated from an interaction between a system of\ninterest and its surrounding environment.
