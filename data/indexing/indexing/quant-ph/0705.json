The\nconcurrence of two qubit thermal entanglement and its dependence on anisotropic\nparameters, external magnetic field and temperature are studied in details. We\nfound that in all cases, inclusion of the DM interaction, which is responsible\nfor weak ferromagnetism in mainly antiferromagnetic crystals and spin\narrangement in low symmetry magnets, creates (when it does not exist) or\nstrengthens (when it exists) entanglement in $XYZ$ spin chain. This implies\nexistence of a relation between arrangement of spins and entanglement, in which\nthe DM coupling plays an essential role. It suggests also that anisotropic\nantisymmetric exchange interaction could be an efficient control parameter of\nentanglement in the general $XYZ$ case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2007 17:16:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gurkan", "Zeynep Nilhan", ""], ["Pashaev", "Oktay K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.0681", "submitter": "Samina S.

It\nfollows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting\ncase of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming\nsignificant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible\nfor a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum\nmeasurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a\ngeneralized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian\nin this norm-preserving, nonlinear, Schrodinger equation dominates during a\nquantum measurement, and leads to a breakdown of linear superposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2007 13:57:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "T.

For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting\nformulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.\nCombining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and\naccurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves\na sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of\nphotons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on\nthe two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our\ncomputations show that the changes in the ionization history due to the\nadditional two-photon process from high shell (n>2) likely do not reach the\npercent-level. For conservative assumptions we find a correction DN_e/N_e~-0.4%\nat redshift z~1160. This is numerically similar to the result of another recent\nstudy; however, the physics leading to this conclusion is rather different. In\nparticular, our calculations of the effective two-photon decay rates yield\nsignificantly different values, where the destructive interference of the\nresonant and non-resonant terms plays a crucial role in this context (abridged)\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2007 18:37:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2008 15:21:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chluba", "J.", ""], ["Sunyaev", "R.
