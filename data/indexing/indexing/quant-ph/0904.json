Even using a schedule with provably minimum idle time, for our\nnoise model and choice of error-correction code, we find that these additional\nidles negate any benefits of error correction. Using additional qubit\noperations, we can greatly suppress idle-induced errors, making error\ncorrection beneficial, provided the qubit operations achieve an error rate less\nthan $2 \\times 10^{-5}$. We discuss other consequences of these constraints\nsuch as error-correction code choice and physical qubit operation speed.

Such a formulation and\nprobabilistic interpretation of QFT allows to interpret the wave function as a\npilot wave that describes deterministic particle trajectories, which\nautomatically includes a deterministic and continuous description of particle\ncreation and destruction. In particular, when the conditional wave function\nassociated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime\ncoordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,\ndescribing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime. In a\nmore general situation a dependence on this spacetime coordinate is negligibly\nsmall but not strictly zero, in which case the trajectory does not stop but the\nmeasuring apparatus still behaves as if this particle has been destroyed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2009 11:36:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2009 10:13:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 08:47:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 10:10:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 10:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nikolic", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2293", "submitter": "Miloslav Znojil", "authors": "Miloslav Znojil and Hendrik B.

In this limit the receiver's maximum fidelity\nreduces to the classical limit 2/3. However, this nice feature is not\nmaintained at the Y- and isotropy-noise channels. For Y-noise channel the\n$\\pi$-tangle vanishes at $0.61 \\leq \\kappa t$. At $\\kappa t = 0.61$ the\nreceiver's maximum fidelity becomes 0.57, which is much less than the classical\nlimit. Similar phenomenon occurs at the isotropic noise channel. We also\ncomputed the three-tangles analytically for the X- and Z-noise channels. The\nremarkable fact is that the three-tangle for Z-noise channel is exactly same\nwith the corresponding $\\pi$-tangle. In the X-noise channel the three-tangle\nvanishes at $0.10 \\leq \\kappa t$. At $\\kappa t = 0.10$ the receiver's fidelity\ncan be reduced to the classical limit provided that the accomplice performs the\nmeasurement appropriately. However, the receiver's maximum fidelity becomes\n8/9, which is much larger than the classical limit. Since the Y- and\nisotropy-noise channels are rank-8 mixed states, their three-tangles are not\ncomputed explicitly. Instead, we have derived their upper bounds with use of\nthe analytical three-tangles for other noisy channels.

In a short wavelength regime where semiclassical\ntheories are most relevant, such transport phenomena, being quintessentially\ninterference based, are difficult to understand with the system's specific\nlong-time classical dynamics. Fortunately, semiclassical methods applied to\nwave packet propagation can provide a natural approach to understanding the\nconnections, even though they are known to break down progressively as time\nincreases. This is due to the fact that some long-time transport properties can\nbe deduced from intermediate-time behavior. Thus, these methods need only\nretain validity and be carried out on much shorter time scales than the\ntransport phenomena themselves in order to be valuable. The initial value\nrepresentation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk [M. F. Herman\nand E. Kluk, Chem. Phys. 91, 27 (1984)] is heavily used in a number of\nmolecular and atomic physics contexts, and is of interest here. It is known to\nbe increasingly challenging to implement as the underlying classical chaos\nstrengthens, and we ask whether it is possible to implement it well enough to\nextract the kind of intermediate time information that reflects wave packet\nlocalization at long times. Using a system of two coupled quartic oscillators,\nwe focus on the localizing effects of transport barriers formed by stable and\nunstable manifolds in the chaotic sea and show that these effects can be\ncaptured with the Herman-Kluk propagator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2009 14:52:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 13:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Goletz", "Christoph-Marian", ""], ["Grossmann", "Frank", ""], ["Tomsovic", "Steven", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3175", "submitter": "Lincoln D.
