Each spin experiences the same\nenvironment interaction, consisting of an energy conserving and an energy\nexchange part.\n  We find the decay rates of the reduced density matrix elements in the energy\nbasis. We show that if the spins do not interact among each other, then the\nfastest decay rates of off-diagonal matrix elements induced by the energy\nconserving interaction is of order N^2, while that one induced by the energy\nexchange interaction is of the order N only. Moreover, the diagonal matrix\nelements approach their limiting values at a rate independent of N.\n  For a general spin system the decay rates depend in a rather complicated (but\nexplicit) way on the size N and the interaction between the spins.\n  Our method is based on a dynamical quantum resonance theory valid for small,\nfixed values of the couplings.

The atomic transition interacts dispersively with a mode of a\nstanding-wave cavity, which is coherently pumped by a laser. In this setup, the\nintensity of the intracavity field is determined by the refractive index of the\natomic medium, and thus by the atomic density distribution. Vice versa, the\ndensity distribution of the atom is determined by the cavity field potential,\nwhose depth is proportional to the intracavity field amplitude. In this work we\nshow that this nonlinearity leads to an instability in the intracavity\nintensity that differs substantially from dispersive optical bistability, as\nthis effect is already present in the regime, where the atomic dipole is\nproportional to the cavity field. Such instability is driven by the matter\nwaves fluctuations and exhibits a peculiar dependence on the fluctuations in\nthe atomic density distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2008 13:13:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2008 10:35:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Larson", "Jonas", ""], ["Morigi", "Giovanna", ""], ["Lewenstein", "Maciej", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.2646", "submitter": "Iannis Kominis", "authors": "I.

Recently, it has been shown how to construct\na theory dubbed \"completely quantized collapse\" (CQC) which is predictively\nequivalent to CSL. In CQC, a quantized random field is introduced, and CSL's\nclassical random field becomes its eigenvalue. In CQC, energy is conserved,\nwhich allows one to understand that energy is conserved in CSL, as the\nparticle's energy gain is compensated by the random field's energy loss. Since\nthe random field has energy, it should have gravitational consequences. For\nthat, one needs to know the random field's energy density. In this paper, it is\nshown how to construct a symmetric, conserved, energy-momentum-stress-density\ntensor associated with the quantized random field, even though this field obeys\nno dynamical equation and has no Lagrangian.

Three models are examined:\nthe quartic double-well potential $V(x)=x^4-5x^2$, the cubic potential\n$V(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2-gx^3$, and the periodic potential $V(x)=-\\cos x$. For the\nquartic potential a wave packet that is initially localized in one side of the\ndouble-well can tunnel to the other side. Complex solutions to the classical\nequations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore,\nclassical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and\nodd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum\nwave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near\nthe origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability\ncurrent that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding\nclassical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the\nperiodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can\ntunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute\na localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the\nenergy of the quantum particle lies in a conduction band, then the particle\ndelocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical\nparticle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random\nwalk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle\nbecomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2008 19:08:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bender", "Carl M.", ""], ["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hook", "Daniel W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4206", "submitter": "Prasanta K.

In this model, Alice gets\nan input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output\na,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).\n  We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity\ndistributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which\ngives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum\ncommunication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.\nWe show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they\ncoincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual\nexpressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These\nlower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,\nmost notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special\ncase of Boolean functions.\n  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at\nmost linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend\non the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between\nmaximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known\nonly for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.\n  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical\ncommunication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any\nnon-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum\ndistribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of\ncommunication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 16:08:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2008 21:29:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2009 15:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 20:40:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 15:15:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Degorre", "Julien", ""], ["Kaplan", "Marc", ""], ["Laplante", "Sophie", ""], ["Roland", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4860", "submitter": "Mahmoud Abdel-Aty", "authors": "Mahmoud Abdel-Aty", "title": "Synthesis of maximally entangled mixed states and disentanglement in\n  coupled Josephson charge qubits", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Eur.
