Our numerical\nresults indicate that the transition separating area and volume law scaling of\nthe EE does not coincide with the non-thermal to thermal transition.\nConsequently, there exists an extended non-ergodic phase for an intermediate\nenergy window where the many body eigenstates violate the ETH while manifesting\nvolume law EE scaling.

For the simplest spinless systems, with say $m$ particles in $N$\nsingle particle states and interacting via $k$-body interactions, we have\nEGUE($k$) and the embedding algebra is $U(N)$. A finite quantum system, induced\nby a transition operator, makes transitions from its states to the states of\nthe same system or to those of another system. Examples are electromagnetic\ntransitions (same initial and final systems), nuclear beta and double beta\ndecay (different initial and final systems), particle addition to/removal from\na given system and so on. Towards developing a complete statistical theory for\ntransition strength densities, we have derived formulas for lower order\nbivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of\ntransition operators. For a spinless fermion system, using EGUE($k$)\nrepresentation for Hamiltonian and an independent EGUE($t$) representation for\ntransition operator, finite-$N$ formulas for moments up to order four are\nderived, for the first time, for the transition strength densities. Formulas\nfor the moments up to order four are also derived for systems with two types of\nspinless fermions and a transition operator similar to beta decay and\nneutrinoless beta decay operators.

Photon pairs with wavelengths around 890 nm and 1320 nm are\ngenerated via type II phase-matched parametric down-conversion. Clustering in\nthis dispersive cavity restricts the whole conversion spectrum to one\nsingle-longitudinal-mode in a single cluster yielding a narrow bandwidth of\nonly 60 MHz. The high conversion efficiency in the waveguide, together with the\nspectral clustering in the doubly resonant waveguide, leads to a high\nbrightness of $3\\times10^4~$pairs/(s$\\cdot$mW$\\cdot$MHz). This source exhibits\nprominent single-longitudinal-mode purity and remarkable temporal shaping\ncapability. Especially, due to temporal broadening, we can observe that the\ncoherence time of the two-photon component of PDC state is actually longer than\nthe one of the single photon states. The miniaturized monolithic design makes\nthis source have various fiber communication applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 07:51:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Kai-Hong", ""], ["Herrmann", "Harald", ""], ["Krapick", "Stephan", ""], ["Brecht", "Benjamin", ""], ["Ricken", "Raimund", ""], ["Quiring", "Viktor", ""], ["Suche", "Hubertus", ""], ["Sohler", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Silberhorn", "Christine", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01892", "submitter": "Shannon Whitlock", "authors": "H.

The hallmark of entanglement is\nthe detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the\nviolation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this\nviolation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and\nartificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable\nstates, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations\nis typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate\nthis reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an\noscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can\ncontinuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its\ndependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement\nbetween an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a\n`Bell-cat' state. We use a circuit QED architecture, high-fidelity\nmeasurements, and real-time feedback control to violate Bell's inequality\nwithout post-selection or corrections for measurement inefficiencies.\nFurthermore, we investigate the influence of decoherence by continuously\nvarying the size of created Bell-cat states and characterize the entangled\nsystem by joint Wigner tomography. These techniques provide a toolset for\nquantum information processing with entangled qubits and resonators. While\nrecent results have demonstrated a high level of control of such systems, this\nexperiment demonstrates that information can be extracted efficiently and with\nhigh fidelity, a crucial requirement for quantum computing with resonators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 22:20:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Vlastakis", "Brian", ""], ["Petrenko", "Andrei", ""], ["Ofek", "Nissim", ""], ["Sun", "Luayn", ""], ["Leghtas", "Zaki", ""], ["Sliwa", "Katrina", ""], ["Liu", "Yehan", ""], ["Hatridge", "Michael", ""], ["Blumoff", "Jacob", ""], ["Frunzio", "Luigi", ""], ["Mirrahimi", "Mazyar", ""], ["Jiang", "Liang", ""], ["Devoret", "M.

In addition, we show that conversion can be\nachieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition\nexcept for special cases.

The second method is to add a supplementary\nstate appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first\nmethod. Especially, for the qubit system, any non-maximally pure entangled\nstate can be a universal resource for the asymptotic reversibility when copies\nof the state is sufficiently many.

One explores how feedback loops in clocking\naffect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of\nunpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of\ninvestigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live\nclocks extends information theory by expressing the need to actively maintain\ncommunications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them.\n  We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of\ncoordinates in a spacetime.

Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform.

This type of graphs include the cycle graphs of odd\nlength, the Paley graphs of prime vertices, and the cubit residue graphs of\nprime vertices. Examples of other graphs are also discussed. This endows the\nLov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$ function with a more straightforward operational meaning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 05:53:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 11:26:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lai", "Ching-Yi", ""], ["Duan", "Runyao", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.06051", "submitter": "Bai-Song Xie", "authors": "Z.

Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness\namplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where\nthe violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the\ndevice for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and\npresent a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of\nSantha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling\ncomponents.

A key example is\nthe tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state\npreparation in ion trap experiments \\cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography\nbecomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to\ninvestigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior\ninformation about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such\nmodels. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient\nestimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist\nin first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to\nan appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues\nbelow a certain \"noise level\" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or\nnormalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the\nspace dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as\n$r\\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a\nlower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling\nis optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive\nsimulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the\nnumber of measurement repetitions. We find that all estimators perform\nsignificantly better that the least squares, with the \"physical estimator\"\n(which is a bona fide density matrix) slightly outperforming the other\nestimators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 16:31:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Butucea", "Cristina", ""], ["Guta", "Madalin", ""], ["Kypraios", "Theodore", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.08300", "submitter": "Mark Stockman", "authors": "Hamed Koochaki Kelardeh, Vadym Apalkov, and Mark I.
