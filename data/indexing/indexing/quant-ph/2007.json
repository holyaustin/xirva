By introducing the concept of \\emph{clipping\nof entanglement}, we show that the delay is characterized by thermodynamic\nproperties of the black hole associated with the symmetry. We also show that\nthe information remnant is closely related to the symmetry-breaking of the\nblack hole.

One of the promising candidates to achieve classical\ndelegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation\n($RSP_{CC}$), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a\nclassical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing $RSP_{CC}$\nas a sub-module is unclear.\n  In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive\nCryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the\ngoal of $RSP_{CC}$ as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical\nchannels and then reveal the security limitations of using $RSP_{CC}$. First,\nwe uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources\n(from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any\nclassically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full\nclassical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum\nstate, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find\nthat the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their\nguarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second,\nthe above result does not rule out that a specific $RSP_{CC}$ protocol can\nreplace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal\nBlind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS '09).\nHowever, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven\ncomposable security as soon as $RSP_{CC}$ is used as a subroutine. Third, we\nshow that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the\n$RSP_{CC}$ protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt '19), preserves the\nweaker, game-based, security of UBQC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2020 13:15:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Badertscher", "Christian", ""], ["Cojocaru", "Alexandru", ""], ["Colisson", "L\u00e9o", ""], ["Kashefi", "Elham", ""], ["Leichtle", "Dominik", ""], ["Mantri", "Atul", ""], ["Wallden", "Petros", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.01677", "submitter": "Fabio Bagarello Dr.", "authors": "Fabio Bagarello", "title": "Susy for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, with a view to coherent states", "comments": "In press in Mathematical Physics, Analysis and Geometry", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11040-020-09353-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an extended version of supersymmetric quantum mechanics which can\nbe useful if the Hamiltonian of the physical system under investigation is not\nHermitian.

A natural question is then how realistic and\nuniversal those properties are. Here, we address these issues by considering a\ndifferent description of dissipative quantum systems, namely, the discrete-time\nKraus map representation of completely positive quantum dynamics. Through\nrandom matrix theory (RMT) techniques and numerical exact diagonalization, we\nstudy random Kraus maps, allowing for a varying dissipation strength, and their\nlocal circuit counterpart. We find the spectrum of the random Kraus map to be\neither an annulus or a disk inside the unit circle in the complex plane, with a\ntransition between the two cases taking place at a critical value of\ndissipation strength. The eigenvalue distribution and the spectral transition\nare well described by a simplified RMT model that we can solve exactly in the\nthermodynamic limit, by means of non-Hermitian RMT and quaternionic free\nprobability. The steady state, on the contrary, is not affected by the spectral\ntransition. It has, however, a perturbative crossover regime at small\ndissipation, inside which the steady state is characterized by uncorrelated\neigenvalues. At large dissipation (or for any dissipation for a large-enough\nsystem), the steady state is well described by a random Wishart matrix. The\nsteady-state properties thus coincide with those already observed for random\nLindbladian dynamics, indicating their universality. Quite remarkably, the\nstatistical properties of the local Kraus circuit are qualitatively the same as\nthose of the nonlocal Kraus map, indicating that the latter, which is more\ntractable, already captures the realistic and universal physical properties of\ngeneric open quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jul 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:42:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["S\u00e1", "Lucas", ""], ["Ribeiro", "Pedro", ""], ["Can", "Tankut", ""], ["Prosen", "Toma\u017e", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.04329", "submitter": "Kang Yang", "authors": "Kang Yang, Siddhardh C.

Finally, numerical\nsimulation is performed for an interstitial square coupled MRRs array with\nidentical couplers and a regular square coupled MRRs array. The simulation\nresult verifies the analytical analysis. Finally, the loaded quality factors of\nthe interstitial 5-ring configuration, the regular 4-ring configuration and the\n1-ring configuration are obtained. It is found that the loaded quality factor\nof the interstitial 5-ring configuration is up to 20 times and 8 times as high\nas those of the 1-ring configuration and the regular 4-ring configuration\nrespectively, mainly due to the degenerated eigen modes at the resonant\nfrequency. Thus, the interstitial square coupled MRRs array has the great\npotential to form high-quality integrated photonics components, including\nfilters and resonance based sensing devices like the parity-time symmetric\nsensors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 16:53:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Liao", "Shaolin", ""], ["Ou", "Lu", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.07223", "submitter": "Etsuo Segawa", "authors": "Etsuo Segawa, Yusuke Yoshie", "title": "Quantum search of matching on signed graphs", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We construct a quantum searching model of a signed edge driven by a quantum\nwalk.

We refer to\nthis protocol as spin-CTAP (coherent transport by adiabatic passage) in analogy\nto a related protocol developed for charge state transfer in quantum dot\narrays. The insensitivity of this adiabatic protocol to pulse imperfections has\npotential advantages for reading out extended spin qubit arrays. When the\nstatic exchange interaction varies across the array, a quantum-controlled\nversion of spin-CTAP is possible, where the transfer process is conditional on\nthe spin states in the middle of the array. This conditional operation can be\nused to generate N-qubit entangled GHZ states. Using a realistic noise model,\nwe analyze the robustness of the spin-CTAP operations and find that\nhigh-fidelity (>95%) spin eigenstate transfer and GHZ state preparation is\nfeasible in current devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2020 03:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2020 20:40:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gullans", "M.

When the evolution is governed by a\ncompletely positive map, there exist reversibility conditions, known as the\nquantum error correcting code conditions, which are necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the reversibility of a quantum operation on a subspace, the code\nspace. However, if we suppose that the evolution is not described by a\ncompletely positive map, necessary and sufficient conditions are not known.\nHere we consider evolutions that do not necessarily correspond to a completely\npositive map. We prove that the completely positive map error correcting code\nconditions can lead to a code space that is not in the domain of the map,\nmeaning that the output of the map is not positive.

The main object of study is the LocalHamiltonian\nproblem, which is concerned with estimating the ground-state energy of a local\nHamiltonian and is complete for the class QMA, a quantum generalization of the\nclass NP. A major challenge in the field is to understand the complexity of the\nLocalHamiltonian problem in more physically natural parameter regimes. One\ncrucial parameter in understanding the ground space of any Hamiltonian in\nmany-body physics is the spectral gap, which is the difference between the\nsmallest two eigenvalues. Despite its importance in quantum many-body physics,\nthe role played by the spectral gap in the complexity of the LocalHamiltonian\nis less well-understood. In this work, we make progress on this question by\nconsidering the precise regime, in which one estimates the ground-state energy\nto within inverse exponential precision. Computing ground-state energies\nprecisely is a task that is important for quantum chemistry and quantum\nmany-body physics.\n  In the setting of inverse-exponential precision, there is a surprising result\nthat the complexity of LocalHamiltonian is magnified from QMA to PSPACE, the\nclass of problems solvable in polynomial space. We clarify the reason behind\nthis boost in complexity. Specifically, we show that the full complexity of the\nhigh precision case only comes about when the spectral gap is exponentially\nsmall.

However, intrinsic structural imperfections lead to bulk\nconductivity, and the roles of magnetic defects are still unknown. With higher\nconcentrations of same types of magnetic defects, the isostructural compound\nMnSb$_2$Te$_4$ is a better model system for a systematic investigation of the\nconnections among magnetic, topology and lattice defects. In this work, the\nimpact of antisite defects on the magnetism and electronic structure is studied\nin MnSb$_2$Te$_4$. Mn-Sb site mixing leads to complex magnetic structures and\ntunes the interlayer magnetic coupling between antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic. The detailed nonstoichiometry and site-mixing of MnSb$_2$Te$_4$\ncrystals depend on the growth parameters, which can lead to $\\approx$40\\% of Mn\nsites occupied by Sb and $\\approx$15\\% of Sb sites by Mn in as-grown crystals.\nSingle crystal neutron diffraction and electron microscopy studies show nearly\nrandom distribution of the antisite defects. Band structure calculations\nsuggest that the Mn-Sb site-mixing favors a FM interlayer coupling, consistent\nwith experimental observation, but is detrimental to the band inversion\nrequired for a nontrivial topology.

First, we use it to get a converging hierarchy of upper bounds on the\nregularized sandwiched $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi divergence between quantum channels for\n$\\alpha > 1$. Second it allows us to prove a chain rule property for the\nsandwiched $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi divergence for $\\alpha > 1$ which we use to\ncharacterize the strong converse exponent for channel discrimination. Finally\nit allows us to get improved bounds on quantum channel capacities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2020 15:28:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2021 13:32:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Fawzi", "Hamza", ""], ["Fawzi", "Omar", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.12608", "submitter": "Francisco F.

This work thus proves ErFeO3 to be a unique system\nthat exhibits a SRPT in thermal equilibrium, in contrast to previous\nobservations of laser-driven non-equilibrium SRPTs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2020 01:00:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bamba", "Motoaki", ""], ["Li", "Xinwei", ""], ["Peraca", "Nicolas Marquez", ""], ["Kono", "Junichiro", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.13271", "submitter": "Kevin Stitely", "authors": "Kevin Stitely, Stuart J Masson, Andrus Giraldo, Bernd Krauskopf, and\n  Scott Parkins", "title": "Superradiant Switching, Quantum Hysteresis, and Oscillations in a\n  Generalized Dicke Model", "comments": "6 pages main, 5 figures, 3 pages supplemental", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Since the inception of quantum\ntheory, it has been debated whether complex numbers are actually essential, or\nwhether an alternative consistent formulation is possible using real numbers\nonly. Here, we attack this long-standing problem both theoretically and\nexperimentally, using the powerful tools of quantum resource theories. We show\nthat - under reasonable assumptions - quantum states are easier to create and\nmanipulate if they only have real elements. This gives an operational meaning\nto the resource theory of imaginarity. We identify and answer several important\nquestions which include the state-conversion problem for all qubit states and\nall pure states of any dimension, and the approximate imaginarity distillation\nfor all quantum states. As an application, we show that imaginarity plays a\ncrucial role for state discrimination: there exist real quantum states which\ncan be perfectly distinguished via local operations and classical\ncommunication, but which cannot be distinguished with any nonzero probability\nif one of the parties has no access to imaginarity. We confirm this phenomenon\nexperimentally with linear optics, performing discrimination of different\ntwo-photon quantum states by local projective measurements.

First, a review of how Quantum\nEntanglement and Quantum Cryptography can be integrated into macroscopic\nmechanical systems for controls and autonomy applications is presented, as well\nas how quantum teleportation concepts may be applied to the classical domain.\nIn quantum teleportation, an entangled pair of photons which are correlated in\ntheir polarizations are generated and sent to two autonomous platforms, which\nwe call the Alice Robot and the Bob Robot. Alice has been given a quantum\nsystem, i.e. a photon, prepared in an unknown state, in addition to receiving\nan entangled photon. Alice measures the state of her entangled photon and her\nunknown state jointly and sends the information through a classical channel to\nBob. Although Alice original unknown state is collapsed in the process of\nmeasuring the state of the entangled photon (due to the quantum non-cloning\nphenomenon), Bob can construct an accurate replica of Alice state by applying a\nunitary operator. This paper, and the previous investigations of the\napplications of hybrid classical-quantum capabilities in control of dynamical\nsystems, are aimed to promote the adoption of quantum capabilities and its\nadvantages to the classical domain particularly for autonomy and control of\nautonomous classical systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 06:04:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Dec 2020 04:31:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Khoshnoud", "Farbod", ""], ["Lamata", "Lucas", ""], ["de Silva", "Clarence W.", ""], ["Quadrelli", "Marco B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15285", "submitter": "Stefan Hillmich", "authors": "Stefan Hillmich, Igor L.

In this work, we implement a\nsemi-autonomous algorithm to obtain an approximation of the eigenvectors of an\narbitrary Hermitian operator using the IBM quantum computer. To this end, we\nonly use single-shot measurements and pseudo-random changes handled by a\nfeedback loop, reducing the number of measures in the system. Due to the\nclassical feedback loop, this algorithm can be cast into the reinforcement\nlearning paradigm. Using this algorithm, for a single-qubit observable, we\nobtain both eigenvectors with fidelities over 0.97 with around 200 single-shot\nmeasurements. For two-qubits observables, we get fidelities over 0.91 with\naround 1500 single-shot measurements for the four eigenvectors, which is a\ncomparatively low resource demand, suitable for current devices.

The dynamics of probability distributions is\ndriven by the maximization of an entropy subject to constraints that carry the\nrelevant physical information -- directionality, correlations, gauge\ninteractions, etc. The challenge is to identify those constraints and to\nestablish a criterion for how the constraints themselves are updated. In this\npaper the ED framework is extended to describe a spin-1/2 point particle. In ED\nspin is neither modelled as a rotating body, nor through the motion of a point\nparticle; it is an epistemic property of the wave function. The constraint that\nreflects the peculiar rotational properties of spin is most effectively\nexpressed in the language of geometric algebra. The updating of all constraints\nis carried out in a way that stresses the central importance of symmetry\nprinciples. First we identify the appropriate symplectic and metric structures\nin the phase space of probabilities, their conjugate momenta, and the spin\nvariables. This construction yields a derivation of the Fubini-Study metric for\na spin-1/2 particle which highlights its deep connection to information\ngeometry. Then we construct an ED that preserves both the symplectic structure\n(a Hamiltonian flow) and the metric structure (a Killing flow).

It was shown that both\nmolecular electronic and nuclear spin levels can be used as qubits. In solid\nstate systems with dopants, an electric field was shown to effectively change\nthe spacing between the nuclear spin qubit levels when the electron spin\ndensity is high at the nucleus of the dopant. Inspired by such solid-state\nsystems, we propose that divalent lanthanide (Ln) complexes with an unusual\nelectronic configuration of Ln$^{2+}$ have a strong interaction between the Ln\nnuclear spin and the electronic degrees of freedom, which renders electrical\ntuning of the interaction.

The present work not only supplies a framework to address\npurely theoretical questions but also could be used to provide a theoretical\ndescription of experiments in quantum simulators, which have recently seen an\nincreased effort targeting two-dimensional geometries. Importantly, our method\ncan be applied to any quantum many-body system with a well-defined classical\nlimit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 14:03:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 18:00:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Verdel", "Roberto", ""], ["Schmitt", "Markus", ""], ["Huang", "Yi-Ping", ""], ["Karpov", "Petr", ""], ["Heyl", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.16115", "submitter": "Boris Braverman", "authors": "Boris Braverman, Alexander Skerjanc, Nicholas Sullivan, Robert W.
