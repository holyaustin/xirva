In the region where PT symmetry is unbroken, the sign problem can\nalways be solved in principle.

The advantages of this are especially apparent when more than\none decoherence channel is present. We show that a measure proposed by Rivas et\nal. is a surprisingly simple function of the canonical decoherence rates, and\ngive an example of a master equation that is non-Markovian for all times t>0,\nbut to which nearly all proposed measures are blind.

Our\nconstructive protocol leverages a novel way to herald the correlations suitable\nfor deterministic quantum computation through a random sampling, and may be\nextensible to other ground states of various 2D valence bond phases beyond the\nAKLT state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 19:51:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 12 Mar 2011 23:52:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 18:52:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Miyake", "Akimasa", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3496", "submitter": "Konstantinos Moulopoulos", "authors": "Konstantinos Moulopoulos", "title": "Nonlocal Phases of Local Quantum Mechanical Wavefunctions in Static and\n  Time-Dependent Aharonov-Bohm Experiments", "comments": "49 pages, 1 figure, presented in Conferences \"50 years of the\n  Aharonov-Bohm effect and 25 years of the Berry's phase\" (Tel Aviv and\n  Bristol), published in Journ.

This includes a situation for identical, fluid-separated slabs in\nwhich the exact force changes sign with the orientation of the wire arrays,\nwhereas PFA predicts attraction.

Here we describe a class of dynamic\nmetamaterials, based on the quantum properties of coupled atom-cavity arrays,\nwhich are intrinsically lossless, reconfigurable, and operate fundamentally at\nthe quantum level. We show how this new class of metamaterial could be used to\ncreate a reconfigurable quantum superlens possessing a negative index gradient\nfor single photon imaging.

Universal control of the two-electron qubit is then demonstrated using\nquantum state tomography. The presented technique provides the basis for single\nand potentially multiple qubit operations with gate times that approach the\nthreshold required for quantum error correction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Sep 2010 17:54:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Foletti", "Sandra", ""], ["Bluhm", "Hendrik", ""], ["Mahalu", "Diana", ""], ["Umansky", "Vladimir", ""], ["Yacoby", "Amir", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5345", "submitter": "Lajos Di\\'osi", "authors": "L.

We generalize the Mandel matrix from\none-mode states to the two-mode situation, leading to a natural classification\nof states with varying levels of nonclassicality. For two--mode states we\npresent a single test that can, if successful, simultaneously show\nnonclassicality as well as NPT entanglement.

We observe that such perturbation leads to the\ncreation of multiple Dirac fermions consistent with Z2 or Mod(2) symmetry.\nTaken collectively, these results are a helpful guide in manipulating\ntopological surfaces for probing fundamental physics or developing device\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 18:40:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2012 19:22:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wray", "L.

The former is called the histories approach\nto quantum mechanics and the latter is called measurement based quantum\ncomputation. Although a rigorous concrete model for the universe has not been\ncompleted, a quantum measure and integration theory has been developed which\nmay be useful for future progress. In this work we show that the quantum\nintegral is the unique functional satisfying certain basic physical and\nmathematical principles. Since the set of paths (or trajectories) for a quantum\ncomputer is finite, this theory is easier to treat and more developed. We\nobserve that the sum of the quantum measures of the paths is unity and the\ntotal interference vanishes. Thus, constructive interference is always balanced\nby an equal amount of destructive interference. As an example we consider a\nsimplified two-slit experiment\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 19:45:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gudder", "Stan", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.6230", "submitter": "Alexander Russell", "authors": "Cristopher Moore and Alexander Russell", "title": "Approximate Representations and Approximate Homomorphisms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.RT cs.DM math.GR quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Approximate algebraic structures play a defining role in arithmetic\ncombinatorics and have found remarkable applications to basic questions in\nnumber theory and pseudorandomness. Here we study approximate representations\nof finite groups: functions f:G -> U_d such that Pr[f(xy) = f(x) f(y)] is\nlarge, or more generally Exp_{x,y} ||f(xy) - f(x)f(y)||^2$ is small, where x\nand y are uniformly random elements of the group G and U_d denotes the unitary\ngroup of degree d. We bound these quantities in terms of the ratio d / d_min\nwhere d_min is the dimension of the smallest nontrivial representation of G. As\nan application, we bound the extent to which a function f : G -> H can be an\napproximate homomorphism where H is another finite group. We show that if H's\nrepresentations are significantly smaller than G's, no such f can be much more\nhomomorphic than a random function.\n  We interpret these results as showing that if G is quasirandom, that is, if\nd_min is large, then G cannot be embedded in a small number of dimensions, or\nin a less-quasirandom group, without significant distortion of G's\nmultiplicative structure. We also prove that our bounds are tight by showing\nthat minors of genuine representations and their polar decompositions are\nessentially optimal approximate representations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 19:49:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "Cristopher", ""], ["Russell", "Alexander", ""]]}]
