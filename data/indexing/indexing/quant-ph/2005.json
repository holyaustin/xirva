For any decision problem\n$f$, the minimum complexity of a span program for $f$ is equal, up to a\nconstant factor, to the quantum query complexity of $f$. Moreover, this\ncorrespondence is constructive. A span program for $f$ with complexity $C$ can\nbe compiled into a bounded error quantum algorithm for $f$ with query\ncomplexity $O(C)$, and vice versa.\n  In this work, we prove an analogous connection for quantum time complexity.\nIn particular, we show how to convert a quantum algorithm for $f$ with time\ncomplexity $T$ into a span program for $f$ such that it compiles back into a\nquantum algorithm for $f$ with time complexity $\\widetilde{O}(T)$. While the\nquery complexity of quantum algorithms obtained from span programs is\nwell-understood, it is not generally clear how to implement certain\nquery-independent operations in a time-efficient manner. We show that for span\nprograms derived from algorithms with a time-efficient implementation, we can\npreserve the time efficiency when implementing the span program. This means in\nparticular that span programs not only fully capture quantum query complexity,\nbut also quantum time complexity.\n  One practical advantage of being able to convert quantum algorithms to span\nprograms in a way that preserves time complexity is that span programs compose\nvery nicely.

In measurements of the\nthe intrinsic loss rates of high frequency modes, it can be challenging to\ndesign an appropriate coupling to the measurement circuit in such a way that\nthe resulting signal is sufficiently strong but also that this coupling does\nnot lead to unwanted loading circuit, obscuring the intrinsic internal loss\nrates. Here, we propose and demonstrate a spectroscopic probe of high-Q\nresonators based on the phenomena of electromagnetically-induced transparency\n(EIT) between the resonator and qubit in the weak dispersive coupling regime.\nApplying a sideband drive signal to the qubit, we observe an interference dip\noriginated from EIT in the qubit spectroscopy, originating from the quantum\ninterference between the qubit probe signal and sideband transition. From the\nwidth and the depth of the dip, we are able to extract the single-photon\nlinewidth of the resonator from an analytical model. Working in a previously\nunexplored regime in which the qubit has a larger linewidth than the resonator\nreduces the technical challenge of making a high-coherence qubit and is\nadvantageous for remaining in the weakly-invasive limit of coupling to the\nresonator. Furthermore, the sideband and the dispersive coupling between the\nresonator and the qubit can be tuned $in~situ$ controlling the strength of the\nsideband drive power. This $in-situ$ tuneability allows the technique to be\napplied for efficient measurement of the resonator loss rate for any quality\nfactor below a fixed upper bound, on the order of $10^8$ for our device,\nallowing a wide range of quality factors to probed using a single design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2020 07:28:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2020 09:43:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2020 08:50:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 05:26:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ann", "Byoung-moo", ""], ["Steele", "Gary A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.01991", "submitter": "Hou Ian", "authors": "Tiantian Huan, Rigui Zhou, Franco Nori, Hou Ian", "title": "Periodic entanglement revivals of asynchronously excited cavity-coupled\n  qubits", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a multi-partite system, the multipartite concurrence of the entire system\ndiffers from the sum of the bipartite concurrences of its components.

A possible way to\nextend well-established electronic-structure methods to this situation is to\nembed the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a higher-dimensional light-matter hybrid\nauxiliary configuration space. In this work we show the importance of the\nresulting hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics of the polaritons, which are the new\nfundamental particles of the ``photon-dressed'' Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for\nsystems in cavities. We show that violations of these statistics can lead to\nunphysical results.

We further present a general\nprescription how to extend a given first-principles approach to polaritons and\nas an example introduce polaritonic Hartree-Fock theory. While being a\nsingle-reference method in polariton space, polaritonic Hartree-Fock is a\nmulti-reference method in the electronic space, i.e. it describes electronic\ncorrelations. We also discuss possible applications to polaritonic QEDFT. We\napply this theory to a lattice model and find that the more delocalized the\nbound-state wave function of the particles is, the stronger it reacts to\nphotons. The main reason is that within a small energy range many states with\ndifferent electronic configurations are available as opposed to a strongly\nbound (and hence energetically separated) ground-state wave function.

A prediction for this\ndistribution, which is accurate in the separable phase, and should deviate from\nthe true distribution in the fully-entangled phase, provides a possible\nbenchmarking task for quantum computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 18:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Vijay", "Sagar", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.03137", "submitter": "Elliot Catt", "authors": "Elliot Catt and Marcus Hutter", "title": "A Gentle Introduction to Quantum Computing Algorithms with Applications\n  to Universal Prediction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this technical report we give an elementary introduction to Quantum\nComputing for non-physicists.

A systematic and computationally convenient\nway to overcome this issue is to employ the spectator-qubit method: by coupling\nan auxiliary qubit to the two-level fluctuator ensemble, an analytical\napproximation for $S({\\omega})$ fully consistent with the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem can be obtained.

But the\neffectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity\nprecludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat\nstates or energy squeezed states.

Specifically, we examine two quantum systems\nparameterized differently by the same random variable such that the first\nsystem alone offers a more accurate guess about the variable in any figure of\nmerit, while the two copies of the second system together do more in some\nfigures of merit than the two copies of the original system. This finding\nunveils a conceptual discrepancy between classical information and its carrier,\nand implies the possibility of hiding classical information in a form of\nquantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2020 01:34:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2020 07:12:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Miyazaki", "Jisho", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.06708", "submitter": "Abuenameh Aiyejina", "authors": "Abuenameh Aiyejina and Roger Andrews", "title": "The dynamics of a polariton dimer in a disordered coupled array of\n  cavities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Eur.

Our results show that, in the hard-core limit, there exists a\nrung-pair localization both at the edges and in the bulk. Using center-of-mass\nframe, the two-particle system can be mapped to an effective single-particle\nsystem with an approximate sub-lattice symmetry.

The\nbasis is taken to be conceptual variables, physical variables that may be\naccessible or inaccessible, i.e., it may be possible or impossible to assign\nnumerical values to them. In an epistemic process, the accessible variables are\njust ideal observations as observed by an actor or by some communicating\nactors. Group actions are defined on these variables, and using group\nrepresentation theory this is the basis for developing the Hilbert space\nformalism here. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables are\nderived as a result of the formalism, and in the discrete case it is argued\nthat the possible physical values are the eigenvalues of these operators. The\nBorn formula is derived under specific assumptions. The whole discussion here\nis a supplement to the author's book [1]. The interpretation of quantum states\n(or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions to\nnature together with sharp answers to those questions. Resolutions if the\nidentity are then connected to the questions themselves; these may be\ncomplementary in the sense defined by Bohr. This interpretation may be called a\ngeneral epistemic interpretation of quantum theory. It is similar to Zwirn's\nrecent Convival Solipsism, and also to QBism, and more generally, can be seen\nas a concrete implementation of Rovelli's Relational Quantum Mechanics. The\nfocus in the present paper is, however, as much on foundation as on\ninterpretation.

One major but poorly\ninvestigated experimental source of gauge-invariance violation is an imperfect\npreparation of the initial state.

A defect due to faulty initialization of the gauge field leads to a\nmild proliferation of the associated violation. Furthermore, we characterize\nthe influence of immobile and mobile defects by monitoring the spread of\nentanglement entropy.

Negatively charged\ntin-vacancy (SnV$^-$) centers in diamond have emerged as promising candidates\nfor quantum emitters because of their excellent optical and spin properties\nincluding narrow-linewidth emission and long spin coherence times. SnV$^-$\ncenters need to be incorporated in optical waveguides for efficient on-chip\nrouting of the photons they generate. However, such integration has yet to be\nrealized. In this Letter, we demonstrate the coupling of SnV$^-$ centers to a\nnanophotonic waveguide. We realize this device by leveraging our recently\ndeveloped shallow ion implantation and growth method for generation of\nhigh-quality SnV$^-$ centers and the advanced quasi-isotropic diamond\nfabrication technique. We confirm the compatibility and robustness of these\ntechniques through successful coupling of narrow-linewidth SnV$^-$ centers (as\nnarrow as $36\\pm2$ MHz) to the diamond waveguide.

In\nthis paper, we consider relationship between quantum multipartite maskers\n(QMMs) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs).

We call such\nan $S$ a QMM of $Q$. By establishing an expression of a QMM, we obtain a\nrelationship between QMMs and QECCs, which reads that an isometry is a QMM of\nall pure states of a system if and only if its range is a QECC of any\none-erasure channel.

We outline the interdisciplinary connections of different stages of\nthe thermalization process to non-equilibrium dynamics in other systems across\nenergy scales ranging from inflationary cosmology, to strong field QED, to\nultracold atomic gases, with emphasis on the universal dynamics of non-thermal\nand of hydrodynamic attractors. We survey measurements in heavy-ion collisions\nthat are sensitive to the early non-equilibrium stages of the collision and\ndiscuss the potential for future measurements. We summarize the current\nstate-of-the art in thermalization studies and identify promising avenues for\nfurther progress.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 18:00:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:15:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Berges", "J\u00fcrgen", ""], ["Heller", "Michal P.", ""], ["Mazeliauskas", "Aleksas", ""], ["Venugopalan", "Raju", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12309", "submitter": "Marcos Rigol", "authors": "Marlon Brenes, John Goold and Marcos Rigol", "title": "Low-frequency behavior of off-diagonal matrix elements in the integrable\n  XXZ chain and in a locally perturbed quantum-chaotic XXZ chain", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures, as published", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The dynamics of\nentanglement has recently been studied in the context of measurement-induced\nentanglement transitions, where the steady-state entanglement collapses from a\nvolume-law to an area-law at a critical measurement probability $p_{c}$.\nInterestingly, there is a distinction in the value of $p_{c}$ depending on how\nwell the underlying unitary dynamics scramble quantum information. For strongly\nchaotic systems, $p_{c} > 0$, whereas for weakly chaotic systems, such as\nintegrable models, $p_{c} = 0$. In this work, we investigate these\nmeasurement-induced entanglement transitions in a system where the underlying\nunitary dynamics are many-body localized (MBL). We demonstrate that the\nemergent integrability in an MBL system implies a qualitative difference in the\nnature of the measurement-induced transition depending on the measurement\nbasis, with $p_{c} > 0$ when the measurement basis is scrambled and $p_{c} = 0$\nwhen it is not. This feature is not found in Haar-random circuit models, where\nall local operators are scrambled in time. When the transition occurs at $p_{c}\n> 0$, we use finite-size scaling to obtain the critical exponent $\\nu =\n1.3(2)$, close to the value for 2+0D percolation. We also find a dynamical\ncritical exponent of $z = 0.98(4)$ and logarithmic scaling of the R\\'{e}nyi\nentropies at criticality, suggesting an underlying conformal symmetry at the\ncritical point.

Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum\nbattery, subjected to a static driving, are obtained exploiting a proper\nmapping into the so-called spin-boson model. Analytic expressions for the time\nevolution of the energy stored in the weak coupling regime are presented\nrelying on a systematic weak damping expansion. Here, decoherence and pure\ndephasing dissipative coupling are discussed in details. We argue that the\nformer results in better charging performances, showing also interesting\nfeatures reminiscent of the Lamb shift level splitting renormalization induced\nby the presence of the reservoir. Charging stability is also addressed, by\nmonitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched\noff. This study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects,\nable to include also non Markovian effects, and it reveals the importance of\ncontrolling and, possibly, engineering system-bath coupling in the realization\nof quantum batteries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2020 14:11:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Carrega", "Matteo", ""], ["Crescente", "Alba", ""], ["Ferraro", "Dario", ""], ["Sassetti", "Maura", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.14055", "submitter": "Ansgar Graf", "authors": "Ansgar Graf, Raphael Kozlovsky, Klaus Richter, Cosimo Gorini", "title": "Theory of magnetotransport in shaped topological insulator nanowires", "comments": "Published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.
