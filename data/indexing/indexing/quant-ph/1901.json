We\ninvestigate the complexity for a dyonic black hole, and we find the surprising\nfeature that the late-time growth is sensitive to the ratio between electric\nand magnetic charges. In particular, the late-time growth rate vanishes when\nthe black hole carries only a magnetic charge. If the dyonic black hole is\nperturbed by a light shock wave, a similar feature appears for the switchback\neffect, e.g., it is absent for purely magnetic black holes. We then show how\nthe inclusion of a surface term to the action can put the electric and magnetic\ncharges on an equal footing, or more generally change the value of the\nlate-time growth rate. Next, we investigate how the causal structure influences\nthe late-time growth with and without the surface term for charged black holes\nin a family of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories. Finally, we connect the\nprevious discussion to the complexity=action proposal for the two-dimensional\nJackiw-Teitelboim theory.

Our quantum generator can be complemented with a classical\nfunction, such as a neural network, as part of the classical post-processing.\nWe demonstrate the application of the quantum variational generator using a\ngenerative adversarial learning approach, where the quantum generator is\ntrained via its interaction with a discriminator model that compares the\ngenerated samples with those coming from the real data distribution. We show\nthat our quantum generator is able to learn target probability distributions\nusing either a classical neural network or a variational quantum circuit as the\ndiscriminator. Our implementation takes advantage of automatic differentiation\ntools to perform the optimization of the variational circuits employed. The\nframework presented here for the design and implementation of variational\nquantum generators can serve as a blueprint for designing hybrid\nquantum-classical architectures for other machine learning tasks on near-term\nquantum devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2019 18:52:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Romero", "Jonathan", ""], ["Aspuru-Guzik", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00851", "submitter": "Pascal Cerfontaine", "authors": "Pascal Cerfontaine, Ren\\'e Otten, M.

For example, their high\nvoltage to current ratio and their dissipationless nature can be exploited to\nmanufacture low-loss microwave transmission lines and resonators with a\ncharacteristic impedance of the order of the quantum of resistance $h/e^2\\sim\n25\\mathrm{k\\Omega}$. The high value of the impedance guarantees that the\nvoltage per photon is high and for this reason high impedance resonators can be\nexploited to obtain larger values of coupling to systems with a small charge\ndipole, e.g. spin qubits. In this paper, we provide a microscopic analysis of\nthe physics of quantum Hall effect devices capacitively coupled to external\nelectrodes. The electrical current in these devices is carried by edge\nmagnetoplasmonic excitations and by using a semiclassical model, valid for a\nwide range of quantum Hall materials, we discuss the spatial profile of the\nelectromagnetic field in a variety of situations of interest. Also, we perform\na numerical analysis to estimate the lifetime of these excitations and, from\nthe numerics, we extrapolate a simple fitting formula which quantifies the $Q$\nfactor in quantum Hall resonators. We then explore the possibility of reaching\nthe strong photon-qubit coupling regime, where the strength of the interaction\nis higher than the losses in the system. We compute the Coulomb coupling\nstrength between the edge magnetoplasmons and singlet-triplet qubits, and we\nobtain values of the coupling parameter of the order $100\\mathrm{MHz}$;\ncomparing these values to the estimated attenuation in the resonator, we find\nthat for realistic qubit designs the coupling can indeed be strong.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2019 18:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bosco", "Stefano", ""], ["DiVincenzo", "David P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.01460", "submitter": "M.

Here we present a\ngeneral theory of the \"non-stabiliserness\" of quantum operations rather than\nstates, which are useful for classical simulation of more general circuits. We\nintroduce two magic monotones, called channel robustness and magic capacity,\nwhich are well-defined for general n-qubit channels and treat all\nstabiliser-preserving CPTP maps as free operations. We present two\ncomplementary Monte Carlo-type classical simulation algorithms with sample\ncomplexity given by these quantities and provide examples of channels where the\ncomplexity of our algorithms is exponentially better than previous known\nsimulators.

Most conventional solid-state single-photon sources are based on\nsingle emitters such as self-assembled quantum dots, which are created at\nrandom locations and require spectral filtering. These issues hinder the\nintegration of a single-photon source into a scaleable photonic quantum network\nfor applications such as on-chip photonic quantum processors. In this work,\nusing only regular lithography techniques on a conventional GaAs quantum well,\nwe realise an electrically triggered single-photon source with a GHz repetition\nrate and without the need for spectral filtering. In this device, a single\nelectron is carried in the potential minimum of a surface acoustic wave (SAW)\nand is transported to a region of holes to form an exciton. The exciton then\ndecays and creates a single photon in a lifetime of ~ 100ps. This SAW-driven\nelectroluminescence (EL) yields photon antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.39 \\pm\n0.05$, which satisfies the common criterion for a single-photon source\n$g^{(2)}(0) < 0.5$. Furthermore, we estimate that if a photon detector receives\na SAW-driven EL signal within one SAW period, this signal has a 79%-90% chance\nof being a single photon. This work shows that a single-photon source can be\nmade by combining single-electron transport and a lateral n-i-p junction. This\napproach makes it possible to create multiple synchronised single-photon\nsources at chosen positions with photon energy determined by quantum-well\nthickness.

Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification\nprocedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap\namplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original\nPCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa).

More precisely, the\nmacro-objectification of states of experimental devices is obtained exclusively\nin virtue of their clear ontologies and dynamical laws without any intervention\nof human observers. Hence, it will be argued that in these theoretical\nframeworks the measurement problem and the determinate-experience problem are\nlogically distinct issues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 13:36:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Oldofredi", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.05308", "submitter": "Prineha Narang", "authors": "Nicholas Rivera, Thomas Christensen and Prineha Narang", "title": "Phonon polaritonics in two-dimensional materials", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00518", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.optics quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Extreme confinement of electromagnetic energy by phonon polaritons holds the\npromise of strong and new forms of control over the dynamics of matter. To\nbring such control to the atomic-scale limit, it is important to consider\nphonon polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Recent studies have pointed\nout that in 2D, splitting between longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and\nTO) phonons is absent at the $\\Gamma$ point, even for polar materials. Does\nthis lack of LO--TO splitting imply the absence of a phonon polariton in polar\nmonolayers? Here, we derive a first-principles expression for the conductivity\nof a polar monolayer specified by the wavevector-dependent LO and TO phonon\ndispersions. In the long-wavelength (local) limit, we find a universal form for\nthe conductivity in terms of the LO phonon frequency at the $\\Gamma$ point, its\nlifetime, and the group velocity of the LO phonon. Our analysis reveals that\nthe phonon polariton of 2D is simply the LO phonon of the 2D system. For the\nspecific example of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we estimate the confinement\nand propagation losses of the LO phonons, finding that high confinement and\nreasonable propagation quality factors coincide in regions which may be\ndifficult to detect with current near-field optical microscopy techniques.\nFinally, we study the interaction of external emitters with two-dimensional hBN\nnanostructures, finding extreme enhancement of spontaneous emission due to\ncoupling with localized 2D phonon polaritons, and the possibility of multi-mode\nstrong and ultra-strong coupling between an external emitter and hBN phonons.\nThis may lead to the design of new hybrid states of electrons and phonons based\non strong coupling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jan 2019 22:35:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rivera", "Nicholas", ""], ["Christensen", "Thomas", ""], ["Narang", "Prineha", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.05352", "submitter": "Steffen Schl\\\"or", "authors": "Steffen Schl\\\"or, J\\\"urgen Lisenfeld, Clemens M\\\"uller, Alexander\n  Bilmes, Andre Schneider, David P.

The goal\nis to determine entangling abilities of such arbitrary bipartite quantum\ninteractions. Doing so provides fundamental limitations on information\nprocessing tasks, including entanglement distillation and secret key\ngeneration, over a bipartite quantum network. We also discuss limitations on\nthe entropy change and its rate for dynamics of an open quantum system weakly\ninteracting with the bath. We introduce a measure of non-unitarity to\ncharacterize the deviation of a doubly stochastic quantum process from a\nnoiseless evolution.\n  Next, we introduce information processing tasks for secure read-out of\ndigital information encoded in read-only memory devices against adversaries of\nvarying capabilities. The task of reading a memory device involves the\nidentification of an interaction process between probe system, which is in\nknown state, and the memory device. Essentially, the information is stored in\nthe choice of channels, which are noisy quantum processes in general and are\nchosen from a publicly known set. Hence, it becomes pertinent to securely read\nmemory devices against scrutiny of an adversary. In particular, for a secure\nread-out task called private reading when a reader is under surveillance of a\npassive eavesdropper, we have determined upper bounds on its performance. We do\nso by leveraging the fact that private reading of digital information stored in\na memory device can be understood as secret key agreement via a specific kind\nof bipartite quantum interaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Jan 2019 16:56:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Siddhartha", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.05941", "submitter": "Nikodem Szpak", "authors": "Nikodem Szpak and Ralf Sch\\\"utzhold", "title": "Time reversal and quantum Loschmidt echo in optical lattices", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A quantum Loschmidt echo (also referred to as quantum time mirror)\ncorresponds to an effective time inversion after which the quantum wave\nfunction reverses its previous time evolution and eventually reaches its\ninitial distribution again.

Given the\nchallenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks\nshould be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing\ntechniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display\npotential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae,\nthat are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational\nalgorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional\nhigh-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum\nimaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of\nclassical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared to their\nclassical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per\niteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or\nhigh-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time\nevolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analog of\nminimally entangled typical thermal states.

The\nadditional ingredient with respect to the wave function is a position in the\nconfiguration space, which drives the collapse in a completely deterministic\nway. This new variable is equivalent to a set of positions of all the\nparticles, i.e. a set of Bohmian positions, which obey the usual guiding\nequation of Bohmian theory. Any superposition of quantum states of a\nmacroscopic object occupying different regions of space is projected by a\nlocalization process onto the region occupied by the positions. Since the\nBohmian positions are well defined in a single realization of the experiment, a\nspace localization into one region is produced. The mechanism is based on the\ncorrelations between these positions arising from the cohesive forces inside\nmacroscopic objects.\n  The model introduces two collapse parameters, which play a very similar role\nto those of the GRW and CSL theories. With appropriate values of these\nparameters, we check that the corresponding dynamics rapidly projects\nsuperpositions of macroscopic states localized in different regions of space\ninto a single region, while is keeps a negligible effect in all situations\nwhere the predictions of standard quantum dynamics are known to be correct. The\npossible relations with gravity are briefly speculated.

Despite the long history of the Principle, its\nfundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently\nmisunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is\nejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from\nour perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total\nentropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational\ninformation motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the\nrequirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less\nrestrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic\ncomputational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of\ncomputational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational\noperations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be\nfully explored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2019 18:52:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Michael P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10331", "submitter": "Flavio Del Santo", "authors": "Veronika Baumann, Flavio Del Santo and Caslav Brukner", "title": "Comment on Healey's \"Quantum Theory and the Limits of Objectivity\"", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Found.

They allow to\ndeal with quantum transport phenomena and are an advanced tool for constructing\nnovel quantum algorithms. Quantum walks on graphs are fundamentally different\nfrom classical random walks analogs, in particular, they walk faster than\nclassical ones on certain graphs, enabling in these cases quantum algorithmic\napplications and quantum-enhanced energy transfer. However, little is known\nabout the possible advantages on arbitrary graphs not having explicit\nsymmetries. For these graphs one would need to perform simulations of classical\nand quantum walk dynamics to check if the speedup occurs, which could take a\nlong computational time. Here we present a new approach for the solution of the\nquantum speedup problem, which is based on a machine learning algorithm that\npredicts the quantum advantage by just looking at a graph. The convolutional\nneural network, which we designed specifically to learn from graphs, observes\nsimulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum\nadvantage, allowing to identify graphs that exhibit quantum advantage without\nperforming any quantum walk or random walk simulations. The performance of our\napproach is evaluated for line and random graphs, where classification was\nalways better than random guess even for the most challenging cases.
