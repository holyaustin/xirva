However, it remains an open question whether they exist in all\nfinite dimensions. A SIC-POVM is usually thought of as a highly symmetric\nstructure in quantum state space. However, its elements can equally well be\nregarded as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(d,C). In this paper we examine the\nresulting structure constants, which are calculated from the traces of the\ntriple products of the SIC-POVM elements and which, it turns out, characterize\nthe SIC-POVM up to unitary equivalence. We show that the structure constants\nhave numerous remarkable properties. In particular we show that the existence\nof a SIC-POVM in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain\nstructure in the adjoint representation of gl(d,C). We hope that transforming\nthe problem in this way, from a question about quantum state space to a\nquestion about Lie algebras, may help to make the existence problem tractable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 10:39:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Appleby", "D.

Certain exotic smooth\nR^4's define a generalized embedding into a space which is K-theoretic\nequivalent to a noncommutative Banach algebra. Furthermore, we show that a\nfactor III von Neumann algebra is naturally related with nonstandard smoothing\nof a small R^4 and conjecture that this factor is the unique hyperfinite factor\nIII_1.

Finally, the formalism used for discussion of Bell inequalities\nintroduces two assumptions that are not necessary for a random field model,\nlocality of initial conditions and non-contextuality, even though these\nassumptions are, in contrast, very natural for a classical particle model.\nWhether we discuss physics in terms of particles or in terms of events and\n(random) fields leads to differences that a glance would be well to notice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 17:49:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Morgan", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5057", "submitter": "Huw Price", "authors": "Peter Evans, Huw Price and K.

However, the correlations\ncharacteristic of EPR-Bell (EPRB) experiments also arise in familiar cases\nelsewhere in QM, where the two measurements involved are timelike rather than\nspacelike separated; and in which the correlations are usually assumed to have\na local causal explanation, requiring no action-at-a-distance. It is\ninteresting to ask how this is possible, in the light of Bell's Theorem. We\ninvestigate this question, and present two options. Either (i) the new cases\nare nonlocal, too, in which case action-at-a-distance is more widespread in QM\nthan has previously been appreciated (and does not depend on entanglement, as\nusually construed); or (ii) the means of avoiding action-at-a-distance in the\nnew cases extends in a natural way to EPRB, removing action-at-a-distance in\nthese cases, too. There is a third option, viz., that the new cases are\nstrongly disanalogous to EPRB. But this option requires an argument, so far\nmissing, that the physical world breaks the symmetries which otherwise support\nthe analogy. In the absence of such an argument, the orthodox combination of\nviews -- action-at-a-distance in EPRB, but local causality in its timelike\nanalogue -- is less well established than it is usually assumed to be.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 22:33:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 14 Feb 2010 23:10:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 20 Jun 2010 06:26:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Peter", ""], ["Price", "Huw", ""], ["Wharton", "K.

According to protective\nmeasurement, a charged quantum system has mass and charge density distributing\nin space, proportional to the modulus square of its wave function. In a\nrealistic interpretation, the wave function of a quantum system can be taken as\na description of either a physical field or the ergodic motion of a particle.\nIf the wave function is a physical field, then the mass and charge density will\nbe distributed throughout space at a given time for a charged quantum system,\nand thus there will exist gravitational and electrostatic self-interactions of\nits wave function. This not only violates the superposition principle of\nquantum mechanics but also contradicts experimental observations. Thus the wave\nfunction cannot be a description of a physical field but a description of the\nergodic motion of a particle. For the later there is only a localized particle\nwith mass and charge at every instant, and thus there will not exist any\nself-interaction for the wave function. It is further argued that the classical\nergodic models, which assume continuous motion of particles, cannot be\nconsistent with quantum mechanics. Based on the negative result, we suggest\nthat the wave function is a description of the quantum motion of particles,\nwhich is random and discontinuous in nature. On this interpretation, the\nmodulus square of the wave function not only gives the density of probability\nof the particle being found in certain locations, but also gives the density of\nobjective probability of the particle being there. We show that this new\ninterpretation of the wave function provides a natural realistic alternative to\nthe orthodox interpretation, and its implications for other realistic\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics are also briefly discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 02:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2011 11:16:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Shan", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5108", "submitter": "Gregory Engel", "authors": "Gitt Panitchayangkoon, Dugan Hayes, Kelly A.

This process occurs with near-perfect quantum\nefficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that\ncoherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many\nphotosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson\nantenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both\nincoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that\nenvironmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological\ntemperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a\nquantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum\ncoherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we\npresent the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at\nphysiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a\nrudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the\nwave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to\nbiological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime\nto correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores,\nand we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears\nconstant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and\nmediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The\npersistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these\nconditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum\ncomputational devices that can operate at high temperature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 06:17:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Panitchayangkoon", "Gitt", ""], ["Hayes", "Dugan", ""], ["Fransted", "Kelly A.", ""], ["Caram", "Justin R.", ""], ["Harel", "Elad", ""], ["Wen", "Jianzhong", ""], ["Blankenship", "Robert E.", ""], ["Engel", "Gregory S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5120", "submitter": "Kwang C.

Beyond quantum\ncomputational purposes, it has been used to explain and control the dynamics in\nvarious physical systems. In order to use the quantum walk to its fullest\npotential, it is important to know and optimize the properties purely due to\nquantum dynamics and in presence of noise. Various studies of its dynamics in\nthe absence and presence of noise have been reported. We propose new approaches\nto optimize the dynamics, discuss symmetries and effect of noise on the quantum\nwalk. Making use of its properties, we propose the use of quantum walk as an\nefficient new tool for various applications in physical systems and quantum\ninformation processing. In the first and second part of this dissertation, we\ndiscuss evolution process of the quantum walks, propose and demonstrate the\noptimization of discrete-time quantum walk using quantum coin operation from\nSU(2) group and discuss some of its properties. We investigate symmetry\noperations and environmental effects on dynamics of the walk on a line and an\nn-cycle highlighting the interplay between noise and topology. Using the\nproperties and behavior of quantum walk discussed in part two, in part three we\npropose the application of quantum walk to realize quantum phase transition in\noptical lattice, that is to efficiently control and redistribute ultracold\natoms in optical lattice. We also discuss the implementation scheme. Another\napplication we consider is creation of spatial entanglement using quantum walk\non a quantum many body system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2010 06:36:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Jun 2010 01:29:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chandrashekar", "C.
