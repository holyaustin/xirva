Emergence from events has an operational motivation in\nrequiring that every physical quantity---including space-time---be defined\nthrough precise measurement procedures. Topological homogeneity is a\nrequirement for having space-time metric emergent from the pure topology of\ncausal connections, whereas physically homogeneity corresponds to the\nuniversality of the physical law.

In\nterms of the curvature coupling parameter and the mass of the field, two very\ndifferent regimes are realized, which exhibit monotonic and oscillatory\nbehavior of the vacuum expectation values, respectively, far from the sphere.\nThe decay of the boundary induced expectation values at large distances from\nthe sphere is shown to be power-law (monotonic or oscillating), independent of\nthe value of the field mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 15:52:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Feb 2012 15:07:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Milton", "K.", ""], ["Saharian", "A.

GEO600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves the\nusefulness of quantum entanglement and the qualification of squeezed light as a\nkey technology for future GW astronomy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Sep 2011 08:49:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["The LIGO Scientific Collaboration", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.2300", "submitter": "Jinchuan Hou", "authors": "Xiaofei Qi and Jinchuan Hou", "title": "A characterization of optimal entanglement witnesses", "comments": "15", "journal-ref": "Phy.

This\napproach has been shown to give very accurate results for critical parameters\nby using a systematic expansion with global basis-type functions. Recently, the\nfinite element method was shown to be a powerful numerical method for ab initio\nelectronic structure calculations with a variable real-space resolution. In\nthis work, we demonstrate how to obtain quantum critical parameters by\ncombining the finite element method (FEM) with finite size scaling (FSS) using\ndifferent ab initio approximations and exact formulations. The critical\nparameters could be atomic nuclear charges, internuclear distances, electron\ndensity, disorder, lattice structure, and external fields for stability of\natomic, molecular systems and quantum phase transitions of extended systems. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of this approach we provide detailed calculations\nof applying FEM to approximate solutions for the two-electron atom with varying\nnuclear charge; these include Hartree-Fock, density functional theory under the\nlocal density approximation, and an \"exact\"' formulation using FEM. We then use\nthe FSS approach to determine its critical nuclear charge for stability; here,\nthe size of the system is related to the number of elements used in the\ncalculations. Results prove to be in good agreement with previous Slater-basis\nset calculations and demonstrate that it is possible to combine finite size\nscaling with the finite-element method by using ab initio calculations to\nobtain quantum critical parameters.

The aim of the present\npaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \"polar\" codes that are\ncapacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon\nobserved by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is\nan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \"channel combining\"\nand \"channel splitting,\" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are\nperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless\nfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the\nchannel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data\ntransmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and\n\"frozen\" bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of the\npresent paper are threefold. First, we leverage several known results from the\nquantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization\neffect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs.

Taking in recent years particles' statistics explicitly into account,\nwithin the MCTDH for fermions (MCTDHF) and for bosons (MCTDHB), has opened up\nfurther opportunities to treat larger systems of interacting identical\nparticles, primarily in laser-atom and cold-atom physics. With the increase of\nexperimental capabilities to simultaneously trap mixtures of two, three, and\npossibly even multiple kinds of interacting composite identical particles\ntogether, we set up the stage in the present work and specify the MCTDH method\nfor such cases. Explicitly, the MCTDH method for systems with three kinds of\nidentical particles interacting via all combinations of two- and three-body\nforces is presented, and the resulting equations-of-motion are briefly\ndiscussed. All four possible mixtures of fermions and bosons are presented in a\nunified manner. Particular attention is paid to represent the coefficients'\npart of the equations-of-motion in a compact recursive form in terms of\none-body density operators only. The recursion utilizes the recently proposed\nCombinadic-based mapping for fermionic and bosonic operators in Fock space\n[Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 81}, 022124 (2010)] and successfully applied and implemented\nwithin MCTDHB. Our work sheds new light on the representation of the\ncoefficients' part in MCTDHF and MCTDHB without resorting to the matrix\nelements of the many-body Hamiltonian with respect to the time-dependent\nconfigurations. It suggests a recipe for efficient implementation of the\nschemes derived here for mixtures which is suitable for parallelization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2011 20:46:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alon", "Ofir E.", ""], ["Streltsov", "Alexej I.", ""], ["Sakmann", "Kaspar", ""], ["Lode", "Axel U.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability. We implement the\ncorrecting three-qubit gate, known as a conditional-conditional NOT (CCNot) or\nToffoli gate, using an interaction with the third excited state of a single\nqubit, in 63 ns. We find 85\\pm1% fidelity to the expected classical action of\nthis gate and 78\\pm1% fidelity to the ideal quantum process matrix. Using it,\nwe perform a single pass of both quantum bit- and phase-flip error correction\nwith 76\\pm0.5% process fidelity and demonstrate the predicted first-order\ninsensitivity to errors.

The effect of this is that the\nlifetime of the system is linear in the length of the fixed key. This is\nsupported by the composability theorem for QKD, that in this setting provides\nan upper bound to the security loss on the secret hash function, which is\nexponential in the number of authentication rounds. This needs to be taken into\naccount when using the protocol, since the authentication gets weakened at each\nsubsequent round and thus the QKD generated is key is not as strong as when the\nauthentication is strong.

Calling spin-down the minority component and\nspin-up the majority component, the limit of small relative density $x=n\\ds\n/n\\us$ is usually considered as a gas of non interacting polarons. This allows\nto calculate, in the expansion of the total energy of the system in powers of\n$x$, the terms proportional to $x$ (corresponding to the binding energy of the\npolaron) and to $x^{5/3}$ (corresponding to the kinetic energy of the polaron\nFermi sea). We investigate in this paper terms physically due to an interaction\nbetween polarons and which are proportional to $x^2$ and $x^{7/3}$. We find\nthree such terms. A first one corresponds to the overlap between the clouds\ndressing two polarons. The two other ones are due to the modification of the\nsingle polaron binding energy caused by the non-zero density of polarons. The\nsecond term is due to the restriction of the polaron momentum by the Fermi sea\nformed by the other polarons. The last one results from the modification of the\nspin-up Fermi sea brought by the other polarons. The calculation of all these\nterms is made at the simplest level of a single particle-hole excitation. It is\nperformed for all the possible interaction strengths within the stability range\nof the polaron.

In particular, we develop a nonperturbative\ntheory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter,\nfor arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained\nfor the average and the distribution of the meter pointer variable, which hold\nto all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in\naddition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to\ndescribe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the\ngeneralized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new\nregimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the\ninverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer\ndeflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal\nconditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear\nregime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close\nto the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being\ntypically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the\namplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively\ndifferent quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the\nfree system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal\nmeters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class\nof the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical\ncalculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory\nis extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement.
