We show that, in practice, the gain,\nquantum efficiency, and output field squeezing of these devices are limited by\nusually neglected higher-order corrections to the idealized model. To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength.

This article forms part of a Special\nVolume of the journal Open Systems & Information Dynamics arising from that\nconference; and it aims to celebrate a related discovery -- also by Sudarshan\n-- that of Quantum Maps (which had their 55th anniversary in the same year).\nNowadays, much like the master equation, quantum maps are ubiquitous in physics\nand chemistry. Their importance in quantum information and related fields\ncannot be overstated. In this manuscript, we motivate quantum maps from a\ntomographic perspective, and derive their well-known representations. We then\ndive into the murky world beyond these maps, where recent research has yielded\ntheir generalisation to non-Markovian quantum processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:40:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Milz", "Simon", ""], ["Pollock", "Felix A.", ""], ["Modi", "Kavan", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.00798", "submitter": "J\\'er\\'emy Ribeiro", "authors": "J\\'er\\'emy Ribeiro, Gl\\'aucia Murta, and Stephanie Wehner", "title": "Fully device independent Conference Key Agreement", "comments": "6+17 pages, 1 figure.

An affirmative answer\nto this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i)\nthe unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on $d\\otimes d$,\ni.e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were\nassumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in\nexperiment.

Firstly\nwe provide a brief modernized discussion of the general framework of\nphase-space quantum mechanics. We extend previous work and show how this leads\nto a framework that can describe any system in phase space -- putting it for\nthe first time on a truly equal footing to Schr\\\"odinger's and Heisenberg's\nformulation of quantum mechanics. Importantly, we do this in a way that\nrespects the unifying principles of \"parity\" and \"displacement\" in a natural\nbroadening of previously developed phase space concepts and methods. Secondly\nwe consider how this framework is realized for different quantum systems; in\nparticular we consider the proper construction of Weyl functions for some\nexample finite dimensional systems.

These codes have yet to be compared\nusing the same error model; we provide such a comparison by determining the\nentanglement fidelity of all codes with respect to the bosonic pure-loss\nchannel (i.e., photon loss) after the optimal recovery operation.

In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found\nusing popular local-search based heuristic approaches such as k-means and\nhierarchical clustering. Due to their greedy nature, such techniques do not\nguarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to sub-optimal\nclustering assignments. Other classes of global-search based techniques, such\nas simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms may offer better\nquality results but can be too time consuming to implement. In this work, we\ndescribe how quantum annealing can be used to carry out clustering. We map the\nclustering objective to a quadratic binary optimization (QUBO) problem and\ndiscuss two clustering algorithms which are then implemented on\ncommercially-available quantum annealing hardware, as well as on a purely\nclassical solver \"qbsolv.\" The first algorithm assigns N data points to K\nclusters, and the second one can be used to perform binary clustering in a\nhierarchical manner. We present our results in the form of benchmarks against\nwell-known k-means clustering and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe proposed techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 20:24:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Jan 2018 00:20:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Vaibhaw", ""], ["Bass", "Gideon", ""], ["Tomlin", "Casey", ""], ["Dulny", "Joseph", "III"]]}, {"id": "1708.05767", "submitter": "A.

A recent proposal by virtue of longitudinal coupling\nsuggests a new scheme to realize fast, high-fidelity, and {\\it ideal QND}\nreadout of qubit state.

The\npartial-collapse weak measurement theory is useful for such as the\nmeasurement-based feedback control and other quantum applications. (ii) In the\nphysical aspect, we construct the joint qubit-plus-cavity entangled state under\ncontinuous measurement and present a comprehensive analysis for the quantum\nefficiency,qubit-state purity, and signal-to-noise ratio in the output\ncurrents.

This enables\nus to propose a simple but efficient MA-MDI-QKD scheme resilient to memory\nerrors and capable of beating, in terms of rate and reach, existing QKD\ndemonstrations. We also show how we can extend this setup to a quantum repeater\nsystem, reaching, thus, larger distances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Aug 2017 08:16:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Nov 2017 06:06:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Piparo", "Nicolo Lo", ""], ["Razavi", "Mohsen", ""], ["Munro", "William J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.06595", "submitter": "Marco Piani", "authors": "Enrico Sindici, Marco Piani", "title": "A simple class of bound entangled states based on the properties of the\n  antisymmetric subspace", "comments": "5 pages, fixed typos, close to version accepted in Phys.

However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often\ndifficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body\ndynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been\nperformed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,\ntheoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and\nnew theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations.

We first demonstrate that in the high frequency regime, the\ndescription of the many-body system by an effective Floquet-Hamiltonian with a\nrenormalized tunnelling energy remains valid, by comparing the results to\nmeasurements in an equivalent static lattice. For near-resonant driving, the\nenhancement and sign reversal of correlations is explained by a microscopic\nmodel, in which the particle tunnelling and magnetic exchange energies can be\ncontrolled independently.

Here\nwe show that the coupling of a quantum system to the standard model of a\nthermal environment, a bath of harmonic oscillators, can be decomposed into a\n\"cascade\" made up of the quasi-continuum coupling structures of Fermi's golden\nrule. This clarifies the connection between the physics of the golden rule and\nthat of a thermal bath, and provides a non-rigorous but physically intuitive\nderivation of the Markovian master equation directly from the former. The exact\nsolution to the Hamiltonian of the golden rule, known as the Bixon-Jortner\nmodel, generalized for an asymmetric spectrum, provides a window on how the\nevolution induced by the bath deviates from the master equation as one moves\noutside the Markovian regime. Our analysis also reveals the relationship\nbetween the oscillator bath and the \"random matrix model\" (RMT) of a thermal\nbath. We show that the cascade structure is the one essential difference\nbetween the two models, and the lack of it prevents the RMT from generating\ntransition rates that are independent of the initial state of the system.

In order to put a TI into any\npractical use, these materials need to be fabricated into devices whose basic\nunits are often p-n junctions. Unique electronic properties of a 'topological'\np-n junction were proposed theoretically such as the junction electronic state\nand the spin rectification. However, the fabrication of a lateral topological\np-n junction has been challenging because of materials, process, and\nfundamental reasons. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach to realize a\np-n junction of topological surface states (TSS's) of a three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological insulator (TI) with an atomically abrupt interface. When a\nultrathin Sb film is grown on a 3D TI of Bi2Se3 with a typical n-type TSS, the\nsurface develops a strongly p-type TSS through the substantial hybridization\nbetween the 2D Sb film and the Bi2Se3 surface. Thus, the Bi2Se3 surface covered\npartially with Sb films bifurcates into areas of n- and p-type TSS's as\nseparated by atomic step edges with a lateral electronic junction of as short\nas 2 nm.

Here we study the role of boundary conditions in PT quantum mechanics\nby constructing a simple model that is the PT symmetric analog of a particle in\na box. The model has the usual particle in a box Hamiltonian but boundary\nconditions that respect PT symmetry rather than hermiticity. We find that for a\nbroad class of PT-symmetric boundary conditions the model respects the\ncondition of unbroken PT-symmetry, namely that the Hamiltonian and the symmetry\noperator PT have simultaneous eigenfunctions, implying that the energy\neigenvalues are real. We also find that the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint under\nthe PT inner product. Thus we obtain a simple soluble model that fulfils all\nthe requirements of PT quantum mechanics.

We provide a solution by means of an\noptimisation within the space of Gaussian quantum channels, which allows for an\nintuitive visualisation of the problem.

In this paper, we improve the\nphase noise tolerance of the SQCC scheme using a true LO by adopting a refined\nnoise model where phase noises originated from different sources are treated\ndifferently: on one hand, phase noise associated with the coherent receiver may\nbe regarded as \\emph{trusted} noise, since the detector can be calibrated\nlocally and the photon statistics of the detected signals can be determined\nfrom the measurement results; on the other hand, phase noise due to the\ninstability of fiber interferometers may be regarded as \\emph{untrusted} noise,\nsince its randomness (from the adversary's point to view) is hard to justify.\nSimulation results show the tolerable phase noise in this refined noise model\nis significantly higher than that in the previous study where all the phase\nnoises are assumed to be untrusted. We conduct an experiment to show the\nrequired phase stability can be achieved in a coherent communication system\nusing a true LO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:46:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Dec 2017 19:38:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Qi", "Bing", ""], ["Lim", "Charles Ci Wen", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08829", "submitter": "Roger Brown", "authors": "R.

One of the results here is a\ntheorem demonstrating that a large class of discrete-time quantum walks have\nrelativistic dynamics in the continuum limit.

The\ndegree of multistability can be controlled by an external voltage. In the case\nof two coexisting states, the system is effectively binary, opening a door to\nexploitation for developing spintronic memory devices.
