This process requires logical operators, acting on protected\nqubits, to be translated into physical operators (circuits) acting on physical\nquantum states. We propose a mathematical framework for synthesizing physical\ncircuits that implement logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.\nCircuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical Clifford\noperator in $\\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$ as a partial $2m \\times 2m$ binary\nsymplectic matrix, where $N = 2^m$. We state and prove two theorems that use\nsymplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all binary symplectic\nmatrices that satisfy a system of linear equations. As a corollary of these\nresults, we prove that for an $[\\![ m,k ]\\!]$ stabilizer code every logical\nClifford operator has $2^{r(r+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions, where $r = m-k$, up\nto stabilizer degeneracy. The desired physical circuits are then obtained by\ndecomposing each solution into a product of elementary symplectic matrices,\nthat correspond to elementary circuits. This enumeration of all physical\nrealizations enables optimization over the ensemble with respect to a suitable\nmetric.

We discovered and described analytically the property of asymptotic\northogonality resulting in a new type of structure in quantum spin glass. Its\neigen-spectrum is split into the alternating sequence of bands formed by\nquantum states of two distinct types ($x$ and $z$). Those of $z$-type are\nnon-ergodic extended eigenstates (NEE) in the basis of $\\{\\sigma_z\\}$ operators\nthat inherit the structure of the classical spin glass with exponentially long\ndecay times of Edwards Anderson order parameter at any finite value of\ntransverse field $B_{\\perp}$.

Quantum evolution within a given\nband of each type is described by a Hamiltonian that belongs to either the\nensemble of Preferred Basis Levi matrices ($z$-type) or Gaussian Orthogonal\nensemble ($x$-type). We characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics using fractal\ndimension $D$ that depends on energy density (temperature) and plays a role of\nthermodynamic potential: $D=0$ in MBL phase, $0<D<1$ in NEE phase,\n$D\\rightarrow 1$ in ergodic phase in infinite temperature limit.

The analogous diagnostic in quantum\nmany-body systems is an exponential growth of out-of-time-ordered correlation\nfunctions (OTOCs). These quantities can be computed for various models, but\ntheir experimental study requires the ability to evolve quantum states backward\nin time, similar to the canonical Loschmidt echo measurement. In some simple\nsystems, backward time evolution can be achieved by reversing the sign of the\nHamiltonian; however in most interacting many-body systems, this is not a\nviable option. Here we propose a new family of protocols for OTOC measurement\nthat do not require backward time evolution. Instead, they rely on ordinary\ntime-ordered measurements performed in the thermofield double (TFD) state, an\nentangled state formed between two identical copies of the system. We show\nthat, remarkably, in this situation the Lyapunov chaos exponent $\\lambda_L$ can\nbe extracted from the measurement of an ordinary two-point correlation\nfunction. As an unexpected bonus, we find that our proposed method yields the\nso-called \"regularized\" OTOC -- a quantity that is believed to most directly\nindicate quantum chaos. According to recent theoretical work, the TFD state can\nbe prepared as the ground state of two weakly coupled identical systems and is\ntherefore amenable to experimental study.

Our study consists of two parts: in the first, we\nconsider accelerated motion in free space, namely, switching off the coupling\nto the mirror. This results in motion induced radiation, which we quantify via\nthe vacuum persistence amplitude. In the model we use, the atom is described by\na quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). We show that its natural frequency poses a\nthreshold which separates different regimes, involving or not the internal\nexcitation of the oscillator, with the ulterior emission of a photon. At higher\norders in the coupling to the field, pairs of photons may be created by virtue\nof the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE). In the second part, we switch on the\ncoupling to the mirror, which we describe by localized microscopic degrees of\nfreedom. We show that this leads to the existence of quantum contactless\nfriction as well as to corrections to the free space emission considered in the\nfirst part. The latter are similar to the effect of a dielectric on the\nspontaneous emission of an excited atom. We have found that, when the atom is\naccelerated and close to the plate, it is crucial to take into account the\nlosses in the dielectric in order to obtain finite results for the vacuum\npersistence amplitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jul 2019 20:50:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2019 15:45:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Farias", "M.

While much\neffort over the last two decades has been devoted to the study of entanglement\nof bipartite states, very little is known about the entanglement of bipartite\nchannels. In this work, we rigorously study the entanglement of bipartite\nchannels as a resource theory of quantum processes.

Then we focus on the dynamical resource theory where\nfree operations are positive partial transpose (PPT) superchannels, but we do\nnot assume that they are realized by PPT pre- and post-processing. This leads\nto a greater mathematical simplicity that allows us to express all resource\nprotocols and the relevant resource measures in terms of semi-definite\nprograms. Along the way, we generalize the negativity from states to channels,\nand introduce the max-logarithmic negativity, which has an operational\ninterpretation as the exact asymptotic entanglement cost of a bipartite\nchannel. Finally, we use the non-positive partial transpose (NPT) resource\ntheory to derive a no-go result: it is impossible to distill entanglement out\nof bipartite PPT channels under any sets of free superchannels that can be used\nin entanglement theory.

With nanophotonics being an experiment-driven\nfield, the absence of appropriate theoretical methods to describe\nground-breaking advances has often emerged as an important issue. To address\nthis problem, the temptation to directly transfer and extend concepts already\navailable from quantum optics is strong, even if a rigorous justification is\nnot always available. In this Review we discuss situations where, in our view,\nthis strategy has indeed overstepped its bounds. We focus on exciton--plasmon\ninteractions, and particularly on the idea of calculating the number of\nexcitons involved in the coupling. We analyse how, starting from an unfounded\ninterpretation of the term N/V that appears in theoretical descriptions at\ndifferent levels of complexity, one might be tempted to make independent\nassumptions for what the number N and the volume V are, and attempt to\ncalculate them separately. Such an approach can lead to different, often\ncontradictory results, depending on the initial assumptions (e.g. through\ndifferent treatments of $V$ as the -- ambiguous in plasmonics -- mode volume).\nWe argue that the source of such contradictions is the question itself -- How\nmany excitons are coupled?, which disregards the true nature of the coupled\ncomponents of the system, has no meaning and often not even any practical\nimportance. If one is interested in validating the quantum nature of the system\n-- which appears to be the motivation driving the pursuit of strong coupling\nwith small N -- one could instead focus on quantities such as the photon\nemission rate or the second-order correlation function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2019 21:40:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 14:03:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tserkezis", "C.", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez-Dom\u00ednguez", "A.

Furthermore, we show how an effective Markovian master equation\nwith broken detailed balance for the system alone can emerge from a full\ndescription, allowing for an investigation of the entropic cost associated to\nbreaking detailed balance. Interestingly, while the entropic cost of performing\na perfect measurement diverges, the entropic cost of breaking detailed balance\ndoes not.

These results suggest that qiCCA is\nconsiderably useful and quantum-inspired computation has the potential to\nunlock a new field in which exponentially large dimensional data can be\nanalyzed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Jul 2019 07:35:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2020 14:19:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Koide-Majima", "Naoko", ""], ["Majima", "Kei", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03242", "submitter": "Dandan Li", "authors": "Dan-Dan Li, Xiao-Hong Huang, Wei Huang, Fei Gao", "title": "Device-Independent Quantum Private Query Protocol without the Assumption\n  of Perfect Detectors", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures,", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The first device-independent quantum private query protocol (MRT17) which is\nproposed by Maitra \\emph{et al.} [Phys.

The philosophical part of the problem is to explain why a closed\nsystem has definite experimental outcomes. The physical part is to show\nmathematically that there exists a limit in which the contradiction between\nunitary Schroedinger dynamics and a reduction process leading to distinct\noutcomes becomes negligible according to an explicitly stated criterion, and to\nmake this criterion as objective as possible. The physical problem is solved\nhere by redefining the notion of a quantum state and finding a suitable measure\nfor the change of state upon reduction. The appropriate definition of the\nquantum state is not as a ray or density operator in Hilbert space, but rather\nas an equivalence class consisting of all density operators in a given\nsubspace, the members of which all describe the same experimental outcome. For\nsystems containing only subsystems that are integrated with their environments,\nthese equivalence classes can be represented mathematically by projection\noperators, and the resulting formalism is closely related to that used by von\nNeumann to study the increase of entropy predicted by the second law of\nthermodynamics. However, nearly isolated subsystems are reduced only\nindirectly, as a consequence of their interaction with integrated subsystems.\nThe reduced states of isolated subsystems are the same conditional states used\nin the definition of quantum discord.

A promising remedy\ncould benefit from the highly controllable and tunable electromagnetic fields\nof a nano-photonic cavity with strong local electric-field enhancements.\nUtilizing this feature, here we calculate the interaction between fast moving,\nthermal atoms and a nano-beam photonic crystal cavity (PCC) with large quality\nfactor and small mode volume. Through fully quantum mechanical calculations,\nincluding Casimir-Polder potential (i.e. the effect of the surface on radiation\nproperties of an atom) we show, when designed properly, the achievable coupling\nbetween the flying atom and the cavity photon would be strong enough to lead to\nRabi flopping in spite of short interaction times. In addition, the\ntime-resolved detection of different trajectories can be used to identify\nsingle and multiple atom counts. This probabilistic approach will find\napplications in cavity QED studies in dense atomic media and paves the way\ntowards realizing coherent quantum control schemes in large-scale macroscopic\nsystems aimed at out of the lab quantum devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2019 12:52:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alaeian", "Hadiseh", ""], ["Ritter", "Ralf", ""], ["Basic", "Muamera", ""], ["Loew", "Robert", ""], ["Pfau", "Tilman", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.04703", "submitter": "Andrea Pizzi", "authors": "Andrea Pizzi, Johannes Knolle and Andreas Nunnenkamp", "title": "Period-$n$ discrete time crystals and quasicrystals with ultracold\n  bosons", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

However, contrary to\nexpectations, there is an increase in the contrast of the interference pattern,\ndemonstrating that path selective decoherence can not only lead to a decrease,\nbut under certain conditions, to an increase of the fringe contrast. Here we\nexplain this seemingly counter-intuitive effect based on a model for a\nmulti-path interference, with four to six slits, in the presence of\ndecoherence. The effect of the environment is modeled via a coupling to a bath\nof harmonic oscillators. When decoherence is introduced in one of the multiple\npaths, an enhancement in fringe contrast is seen under certain conditions. A\nsimilar effect is shown to appear if instead of path-selective decoherence, a\nselective path detector is introduced. Our analysis points to the fact that\nwhile traditional fringe visibility captures the wave nature in the two-path\ncase, it can fail in multi-path situations. We explain the enhancement of\nfringe visibility and also show that quantum coherence based on the l1 norm of\ncoherence, in contrast to traditional visibility, remains a good quantifier of\nwave nature, even in such situations. The enhancement of fringe contrast in the\npresence of environmental decoherence underscores the limitations of\ntraditional visibility as a good measure for wave nature in quantifying\ncomplementarity and also makes it an unlikely candidate for quantifying\ndecoherence.

One effective technique used\nfor rotation sensing is Sagnac interferometry, in which a wave is split,\ntraverses two paths that enclose an area, and then recombined. The resulting\ninterference signal depends on the rotation rate of the system and the area\nenclosed by the paths [5]. Optical Sagnac interferometers are an important\ncomponent in present-day navigation systems [6], but suffer from limited\nsensitivity and stability. Interferometers using matter waves are intrinsically\nmore sensitive and have demonstrated superior gyroscope performance [7-9], but\nthe benefits have not been large enough to offset the substantial increase in\napparatus size and complexity that atomic systems require. It has long been\nhoped that these problems might be overcome using atoms confined in a guiding\npotential or trap, as opposed to atoms falling in free space [10-12]. This\nallows the atoms to be supported against gravity, so a long measurement time\ncan be achieved without requiring a large drop distance. The guiding potential\ncan also be used to control the trajectory of the atoms, causing them to move\nin a circular loop that provides the optimum enclosed area for a given linear\nsize [13].

The key constituents of the channel\nresource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum\nchannels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum\nsuperchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel).\nOne main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box\ntransformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel\nbox (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an\nasymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer\nthan its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in\nwhich this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or $n$-shot regimes,\nwith the latter having parallel and sequential variants. As in our prior work\n[arXiv:1905.11629], we consider two special cases of the general channel box\ntransformation problem, known as distinguishability distillation and dilution.\nFor the one-shot case, we find that the optimal values of the various tasks are\nequal to the non-smooth or smooth channel min- or max-relative entropies, thus\nendowing all of these quantities with operational interpretations. In the\nasymptotic sequential setting, we prove that the exact distinguishability cost\nis equal to the channel max-relative entropy and the distillable\ndistinguishability is equal to the amortized channel relative entropy of\n[arXiv:1808.01498].

In this realm, the phases with\ntopological order cannot be characterized by symmetry alone. Moreover, the\nrelevant phase transitions do occur without spontaneous symmetry breaking,\nbeyond the scope of Landau's theory. The first realization of such phases is\nthe discovery of the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was followed soon\nby a topological interpretation. Later on, a distinct, half-integer QHE was\nalso found from graphene, which has almost spin degeneracy described by $SU(2)$\nsymmetry. The previous theoretical predictions were realized in this finding.\nIt has been well understood that the anomaly of this half-integer QHE\noriginates from the presence of $2$D massless Dirac fermions around the zero\nenergy with respect to the original Dirac points (DPs). The very characteristic\nlies in that there exists a topologically robust zero-mode LL that is a\nconstant function of the perpendicular magnetic field. More deeply, this\nzero-mode LL is protected by the local chiral symmetry (CS), against CS\npreserving perturbations provided that intervalley scattering between the\ndouble DPs is inhibited, where the CS arises from the global sublattice\nsymmetry in spinless graphene. Since massless Dirac particles are broadly\npresent in condensed matter with various symmetries, not to mention Dirac\nbosonic systems, it is of interest to see how about the situations in other\nsystems with $2$D massless Dirac fermions.

In this paper we address the\nissue of the interplay between information and disturbance for a general\noperational probabilistic theory. The traditional notion of disturbance\nconsiders the fate of the system state after the measurement. However, the fact\nthat the system state is left untouched ensures that also correlations are\npreserved only in the presence of local discriminability.

We prove a\ngeneral theorem showing that information that can be retrieved without\ndisturbance corresponds to perfectly repeatable and discriminating tests. Based\non this, we prove a structure theorem for operational probabilistic theories,\nshowing that the set of states of any system decomposes as a direct sum of\nperfectly discriminable sets, and such decomposition is preserved under system\ncomposition.

One of the biggest limitations on the RSXS\ntechnique is the presence of a severe fluorescence background which, like the\nRSXS cross section itself, is enhanced under resonant conditions. This\nbackground prevents the study of weak signals such as diffuse scattering from\nglassy or fluctuating order that is spread widely over momentum space. Recent\nadvances in superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) detectors have led to\nmajor improvements in energy resolution and detection efficiency in the soft\nx-ray range. Here, we perform a RSXS study of stripe-ordered\nLa$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ at the Cu $L_{3/2}$ edge (932.2 eV) using a TES\ndetector with 1.5 eV resolution, to evaluate its utility for mitigating the\nfluorescence background problem. We find that, for suitable degree of detuning\nfrom the resonance, the TES rejects the fluorescence background, leading to a 5\nto 10 times improvement in the statistical quality of the data compared to an\nequivalent, energy-integrated measurement. We conclude that a TES presents a\npromising approach to reducing background in RSXS studies and may lead to new\ndiscoveries in materials exhibiting valence band order that is fluctuating or\nglassy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jul 2019 03:54:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 01:57:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Joe", "Y.

This photonic\ncircuit can be electrically reconfigured, but only the output optical signal\ncan be monitored. As a result, the conventional control methods cannot be\nnaively applied. Characterizing such a chip is challenging for three reasons.\nFirst, there are uncertainties associated with the Hamiltonian describing the\nchip. Second, we expect distortions of the control voltages caused by the\nchip's electrical response, which cannot be directly observed. Finally, there\nare imperfections in the measurements caused by losses from coupling the chip\nexternally to optical fibers. We developed a deep neural network approach to\nsolve these problems. The architecture is designed specifically to overcome the\naforementioned challenges using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based network as\nthe central component.

Within this approach, a part of\nthe system becomes informationally isolated (restricted) which leads to a\nnatural emergence of the classical domain.

In its basic version,\nMMS involves two ancilla qubits, $A$ and $X$, entangled with each other and\nwith the System $S$. Informational or thermodynamic cost of measurement is\nrepresented by $X$-qubit being isolated, i.e. becoming unavailable for future\ninteractions with the rest of the system. Conditional upon this isolation,\n$A$-qubit, that plays the role of an Apparatus, becomes classical and records\nthe outcome of the measurement. The procedure may be used to perform von\nNeumann-style projective measurements or generalized ones, that corresponds to\nPositive-Operator Value Measure (POVM). By repeating the same generalized\nmeasurement multiple times with different $A$- and $X$-qubits, one\nasymptotically approaches the wave function collapse in the basis determined by\nthe premeasurement process. We present a simple result for the total\ninformation extracted after $N$ such weak measurements.

With our current technology we achieve a rejection of\nbackground and stray light of order 5 and also report an image contrast\nimprovement up to a factor of 5.5, which is resilient to both environmental\nnoise and transmission losses. The quantum illumination protocol differs from\nusual quantum schemes in that the advantage is maintained even in the presence\nof noise and loss. Our approach may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to\nbe applied to real-world applications where the suppression of background light\nand noise is important, such as imaging under low-photon flux and quantum\nLIDAR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:35:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gregory", "Thomas", ""], ["Moreau", "Paul-Antoine", ""], ["Toninelli", "Ermes", ""], ["Padgett", "Miles J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.09386", "submitter": "Artur Izmaylov", "authors": "Tzu-Ching Yen, Vladyslav Verteletskyi, and Artur F.

This topological nature can be understood by mapping the Hamiltonian\nto a three-dimensional (3D) cubic lattice model with a homogeneous magnetic\nfield.

Under a harmonic trap\npotential, as often used in cold atom experiments, we show, by numerical\nsimulations, that nearly quantized pumping occurs when the phase of the\nsuperlattice potential is driven at a moderate speed.

In the rectifying\nregion with larger modulation amplitudes, we uncover that the pumping direction\nis restricted to exactly the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis direction.

We\ndemonstrate this empirically using random Ising spin glass problems run on the\ntwo latest generations of the D-Wave quantum annealers. We then proceed to show\nthat this doomsday scenario can be mitigated using a simple error suppression\nand correction scheme known as quantum annealing correction (QAC). By using\nQAC, the time-to-solution scaling of the same D-Wave devices is improved to\nbelow that of the classical upper bound, thus restoring hope in the speedup\nprospects of quantum annealing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 22:50:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Pearson", "Adam", ""], ["Mishra", "Anurag", ""], ["Hen", "Itay", ""], ["Lidar", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12684", "submitter": "David Amaro", "authors": "David Amaro, Jemma Bennett, Davide Vodola and Markus M\\\"uller", "title": "Analytical percolation theory for topological color codes under qubit\n  loss", "comments": "15 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In\nparticular, compared to brute force diagonalization that is already virtually\nimpossible for a moderate number of fermions, our analysis enables us to make\nunprecedented efficient predictions about the energy gap of complex spin\nmixtures.

The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel,\nhowever, has remained controversial since the first attempts to calculate it,\nwhich relied on the group delay. It is now well understood that this delay (the\narrival time of the transmitted wave packet peak at the far side of the\nbarrier) can be smaller than the barrier thickness divided by the speed of\nlight, without violating causality. There have been a number of experiments\nconfirming this, and even a recent one claiming that tunnelling may take no\ntime at all. There have also been efforts to identify another timescale, which\nwould better describe how long a given particle spends in the barrier region.\nHere we present a direct measurement of such a time, studying Bose-condensed\n$^{87}$Rb atoms tunnelling through a 1.3-${\\mu}$m thick optical barrier. By\nlocalizing a pseudo-magnetic field inside the barrier, we use the spin\nprecession of the atoms as a clock to measure the time it takes them to cross\nthe classically forbidden region. We find a traversal time of 0.62(7) ms and\nstudy its dependence on incident energy. In addition to finally shedding light\non the fundamental question of the tunnelling time, this experiment lays the\ngroundwork for addressing deep foundational questions about history in quantum\nmechanics: for instance, what can we learn about where a particle was at\nearlier times by observing where it is now?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:18:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ramos", "Ram\u00f3n", ""], ["Spierings", "David", ""], ["Racicot", "Isabelle", ""], ["Steinberg", "Aephraim M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.13592", "submitter": "Paul Brookes", "authors": "P.
