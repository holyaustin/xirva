We\nhere introduce the $\\textit{inflation technique}$ for tackling this problem. An\ninflation of a causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain\nmultiple copies of each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of\neach copy mirrors that of the original. To every distribution of the observed\nvariables that is compatible with the original causal structure, we assign a\nfamily of marginal distributions on certain subsets of the copies that are\ncompatible with the inflated causal structure. It follows that compatibility\nconstraints for the inflation can be translated into compatibility constraints\nfor the original causal structure. Even if the constraints at the level of\ninflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied by\ndisjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply\nthis method to derive new inequalities whose violation by a distribution\nwitnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal structure (of\nwhich Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are prominent\nexamples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the\noriginal causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the\ninflation. For three observed binary variables with pairwise common causes, it\nyields inequalities that are stronger in at least some aspects than those\nobtainable by existing methods. We also describe an algorithm that derives a\nweaker set of inequalities but is more efficient.

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the\ncorrelation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single\nmicro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.\nFurthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when\nappropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a\ncutoff on low occupancy UV modes.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting\nthe D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of\nCTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution.

Here, we calculate the\nfour-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a\ntextbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times\nwith the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both\nquantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the\nLyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the\nlogarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and\nto the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference\nappears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength $K$, where\nno classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent quickly\ndecreases as $K \\to 0$, while the OTOC's growth rate may decrease much slower\nshowing higher sensitivity to small chaotic islands in the phase space.

Here we report an observation of double CHSH-Bell\ninequality violations for a single pair of entangled photons with strength\ncontinuous-tunable optimal weak measurements in photonic system for the first\ntime.

Since the photon number operators after the DFT do not\ncommute with the initial photon number operators, entanglement is necessary to\nachieve strong correlations in both the initial mode photon numbers and the\nphoton numbers observed after the DFT.

Based on the Hamiltonian of electromagnetics and quantum\nmechanics, a unified Maxwell-Schrodinger system is derived by the variational\nprinciple. The coupled system is well-posed and symplectic, which ensures\nenergy conserving property during the time evolution. However, due to the\ndisparity of wavelengths of EM waves and that of electron waves, a numerical\nimplementation of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to the\nmultiscale coupled system is extremely challenging. To overcome this\ndifficulty, a reduced eigenmode expansion technique is first applied to\nrepresent the wave function of the particle. Then, a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) governing the time evolution of the\nslowly-varying expansion coefficients are derived to replace the original\nSchrodinger equation. Finally, Maxwell's equations represented by the vector\npotential with a Coulomb gauge, together with the ODEs, are solved\nself-consistently. For numerical examples, the interaction between EM fields\nand a particle is investigated for both the closed, open and inhomogeneous\nelectromagnetic systems. The proposed approach not only captures the Rabi\noscillation phenomenon in the closed cavity but also captures the effects of\nradiative decay and shift in the open free space. After comparing with the\nexisting theoretical approximate models, it is found that the approximate\nmodels break down in certain cases where a rigorous self-consistent approach is\nneeded.

The difference between our routing protocol and the\nclassical one is that in the former, the processes used to find a quantum route\nand establish quantum channel entanglement occur simultaneously. The Bell state\nmeasurement results of each hop are piggybacked to quantum route finding\ninformation. This method reduces the total number of packets and the magnitude\nof air interface delay.

This approach applies to\nstrongly interacting systems that are weakly coupled to multiple reservoirs at\nhigh temperature, illustrated by an Anderson quantum dot, but shows potential\nfor generalization. Pumping gives rise to a nonadiabatic geometric phase that\ncan be described by a framework originally developed for classical dissipative\nsystems by Landsberg. This geometric phase is accumulated by the transported\nobservable (charge, spin, energy) and not by the quantum state. It thus differs\nradically from the adiabatic Berry-Simon phase, even when generalizing it to\nmixed states, following Sarandy and Lidar. Importantly, our geometric\nformulation of pumping stays close to a direct physical intuition (i) by tying\ngauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transported\nobservable and (ii) by deriving a geometric connection from a driving-frequency\nexpansion of the current. Our approach provides a systematic and efficient way\nto compute the geometric pumping of various observables, including charge,\nspin, energy and heat. Our geometric curvature formula reveals a general\nexperimental scheme for performing geometric transport spectroscopy that\nenhances standard nonlinear spectroscopies based on measurements for static\nparameters.

Based on this simulator, we can thus replace the tasks that\ninvolve only a few single photon inputs with the ones that only make use of\nimperfect photon sources. In addition, our method also provides a quantum\nsimulator to quantum computation based on quantum optics. In the main context,\nwe take phase randomized coherent state as an example for analysis. A general\nphoton source applies similarly and may provide some further advantages for\ncertain tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 02:05:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Xiao", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhen", ""], ["Lutkenhaus", "Norbert", ""], ["Ma", "Xiongfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.06820", "submitter": "Jiawei Hu", "authors": "Yiquan Yang, Jiawei Hu and Hongwei Yu", "title": "Entanglement dynamics for uniformly accelerated two-level atoms coupled\n  with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations", "comments": "22 pages, 12 figures, published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this inherently holistic theory - neither\nconspiratorial, retrocausal, fine tuned nor nonlocal - superdeterminism is not\ninvoked by fiat but is emergent from these `consistent histories'\nnumber-theoretic constraints. Invariant set theory provides new perspectives on\nmany of the contemporary problems at the interface of quantum and gravitational\nphysics, and, if correct, may signal the end of particle physics beyond the\nStandard Model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 16:33:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Palmer", "T.

While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the\nuniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult\nto implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum\nstates under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford\ngroup plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its\nelements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm\nconstants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that\nshould be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the \"degree of\nlocalization in phase space\" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important\nClifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result\nimplies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing\npure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here\nto prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This\npaper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor\npowers of the Clifford group.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 19:44:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kueng", "Richard", ""], ["Zhu", "Huangjun", ""], ["Gross", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.08628", "submitter": "Max Frenzel", "authors": "Max F.

It combines the\ncrystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it\nis built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous\nsymmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous\ntranslational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50\nyears ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A\nvariant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed\nlattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice\nsupersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that\ncharacterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the\nrealization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking.\nThe continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically\ncoupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities.

By disentangling the dynamical and\ngeometric contributions to this phase we describe a general strategy to measure\nthe topological invariant in these quantum walks. As an example, we propose an\nexperimental protocol in a circuit QED architecture where a superconducting\ntransmon qubit plays the role of the coin, while the quantum walk takes place\nin the phase space of a cavity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:00:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ramasesh", "Vinay V.", ""], ["Flurin", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Rudner", "Mark S.", ""], ["Siddiqi", "Irfan", ""], ["Yao", "Norman Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09584", "submitter": "Matthew McKague", "authors": "Matthew McKague", "title": "Self-testing in parallel with CHSH", "comments": "Changes from anonymous referee comments", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Self-testing allows classical referees to verify the quantum behaviour of\nsome untrusted devices.

The\nqubits are defined by the spin states of a single electron confined in a\nquantum dot, coupled via exchange interactions, controlled using a microwave\ncavity, and measured via gate-based dispersive readout \\cite{Colless2013}. This\nsystem, based entirely on available technology and existing components, is\ncompatible with general surface code quantum error correction\n\\cite{Terhal2015}, enabling large-scale universal quantum computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 12:40:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Veldhorst", "M.", ""], ["Eenink", "H.
