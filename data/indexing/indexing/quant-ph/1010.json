Moreover, we show that for both parameters two-mode squeezed\nvacuum states are more efficient than either coherent, thermal or single-mode\nsqueezed states. This suggests that at high energy regimes two-mode squeezed\nvacuum states are optimal within the Gaussian setup. This optimality result\nindicates a stronger form of compatibility for the estimation of the two\nparameters. Indeed, not only the minimum variance can be achieved at fixed\nprobe states, but also the optimal state is common to both parameters.\nAdditionally, we explore numerically the performance of non-Gaussian states for\nparticular parameter values to find that maximally entangled states within\nD-dimensional cutoff subspaces perform better than any randomly sampled states\nwith similar energy.

The role of correlations on the domain of definition and on the\nadditivity of energy and entropy is discussed: it is proved that energy is\ndefined and additive for all separable systems, while entropy is defined and\nadditive only for separable systems uncorrelated from their environment;\ndecorrelation entropy is defined.

These properties are essential for quantum turbo code\nfamilies to have a minimum distance growing with blocklength and for their\niterative decoding algorithm to converge, respectively. Here, we show that the\nentanglement-assisted paradigm simplifies the theory of quantum turbo codes, in\nthe sense that an entanglement-assisted quantum (EAQ) convolutional encoder can\npossess both of the aforementioned desirable properties. We give several\nexamples of EAQ convolutional encoders that are both recursive and\nnon-catastrophic and detail their relevant parameters. We then modify the\nquantum turbo decoding algorithm of Poulin et al., in order to have the\nconstituent decoders pass along only \"extrinsic information\" to each other\nrather than a posteriori probabilities as in the decoder of Poulin et al., and\nthis leads to a significant improvement in the performance of unassisted\nquantum turbo codes. Other simulation results indicate that\nentanglement-assisted turbo codes can operate reliably in a noise regime 4.73\ndB beyond that of standard quantum turbo codes, when used on a memoryless\ndepolarizing channel. Furthermore, several of our quantum turbo codes are\nwithin 1 dB or less of their hashing limits, so that the performance of quantum\nturbo codes is now on par with that of classical turbo codes. Finally, we prove\nthat entanglement is the resource that enables a convolutional encoder to be\nboth non-catastrophic and recursive because an encoder acting on only\ninformation qubits, classical bits, gauge qubits, and ancilla qubits cannot\nsimultaneously satisfy them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Oct 2010 20:03:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 17:54:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2013 14:56:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""], ["Hsieh", "Min-Hsiu", ""], ["Babar", "Zunaira", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1273", "submitter": "Yeong-Cherng Liang", "authors": "Yeong-Cherng Liang, Robert W.

We revisit this\nexample here, using it as an entree to three central concepts in quantum\nfoundations: contextuality, Bell-nonlocality, and complementarity.\nSpecifically, we show that Specker's parable offers a narrative thread that\nweaves together a large number of results, including: the impossibility of\nmeasurement-noncontextual and outcome-deterministic ontological models of\nquantum theory (the Kochen-Specker theorem), in particular the proof of\nKlyachko; the impossibility of Bell-local models of quantum theory (Bell's\ntheorem), especially the proofs by Mermin and Hardy; the impossibility of a\npreparation-noncontextual ontological model of quantum theory; and the\nexistence of triples of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be\nmeasured jointly pairwise but not triplewise. Along the way, several novel\nresults are presented, including: a generalization of a theorem by Fine\nconnecting the existence of a joint distribution over outcomes of\ncounterfactual measurements to the existence of a noncontextual model; a\ngeneralization of Klyachko's proof of the Kochen-Specker theorem; a proof of\nthe Kochen-Specker theorem in the style of Hardy's proof of Bell's theorem; a\ncategorization of contextual and Bell-nonlocal correlations in terms of\nfrustrated networks; a new inequality testing preparation noncontextuality; and\nlastly, some results on the joint measurability of POVMs and the question of\nwhether these can be modeled noncontextually. Finally, we emphasize that\nSpecker's parable provides a novel type of foil to quantum theory, challenging\nus to explain why the particular sort of contextuality and complementarity\nembodied therein does not arise in a quantum world.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Oct 2010 20:54:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2011 16:53:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2011 11:51:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 28 Dec 2016 03:16:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Liang", "Yeong-Cherng", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""], ["Wiseman", "Howard M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1280", "submitter": "Andon Rangelov A", "authors": "A.

In this paper we present a lower bound for squashed entanglement in\nterms of a distance to the set of separable states. This implies that squashed\nentanglement is faithful, that is, strictly positive if and only if the state\nis entangled. We derive the bound on squashed entanglement from a bound on\nquantum conditional mutual information, which is used to define squashed\nentanglement and corresponds to the amount by which strong subadditivity of von\nNeumann entropy fails to be saturated. Our result therefore sheds light on the\nstructure of states that almost satisfy strong subadditivity with equality. The\nproof is based on two recent results from quantum information theory: the\noperational interpretation of the quantum mutual information as the optimal\nrate for state redistribution and the interpretation of the regularised\nrelative entropy of entanglement as an error exponent in hypothesis testing.\nThe distance to the set of separable states is measured by the one-way LOCC\nnorm, an operationally-motivated norm giving the optimal probability of\ndistinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two parties, using\nany protocol formed by local quantum operations and one-directional classical\ncommunication between the parties.

One possible\nrelationship between these two notions of space was unearthed by Banaschewski\nand Mulvey, who proved a constructive version of Gelfand duality in which the\nGelfand spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra comes out as a pointfree space.\nBeing constructive, this result applies in arbitrary toposes (with natural\nnumbers objects, so that internal C*-algebras can be defined). Earlier work by\nthe first three authors, shows how a noncommutative C*-algebra gives rise to a\ncommutative one internal to a certain sheaf topos. The latter, then, has a\nconstructive Gelfand spectrum, also internal to the topos in question. After a\nbrief review of this work, we compute the so-called external description of\nthis internal spectrum, which in principle is a fibered pointfree space in the\nfamiliar topos Sets of sets and functions. However, we obtain the external\nspectrum as a fibered topological space in the usual sense.

Here, we give a complete characterization of the ground\nspace of any two-body frustration-free Hamiltonian of qubits. Namely, it is a\nspan of tree tensor network states of the same tree structure. This\ncharacterization allows us to show that the problem of determining the ground\nstate degeneracy is as hard as, but no harder than, its classical analog.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Oct 2010 19:39:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Zhengfeng", ""], ["Wei", "Zhaohui", ""], ["Zeng", "Bei", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2504", "submitter": "Sergei Suslov K", "authors": "Erwin Suazo and Sergei K.

One direct operational manifestation of these\nuncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information\nlocking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a\nuniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical\nkey of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this\nquantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about\nthe message, in which case the message is said to be \"locked\". Furthermore,\nknowing the key, it is possible to recover, that is \"unlock\", the message. In\nthis paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection\nbetween uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We\nintroduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to\nlow-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also\nimplies an entropic uncertainty relation. We prove that random bases satisfy\nuncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better parameters than\npreviously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs.\nWe apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size\nindependent of the message length. We give efficient constructions of metric\nuncertainty relations. The bases defining these metric uncertainty relations\nare computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads to the\nfirst explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover,\nwe present a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current\ntechnology.

The results indicate that the\nVinet EOS model that fitted to low-pressure experimental data overestimates the\ncompressibility of dense hydrogen drastically when beyond 500 GPa.

When\ncompressed beyond about 2.8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become\ncompetitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using\nnudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy\nbarrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the\ncase of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV\nphase, the existent barrier might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa\nat low temperatures.

An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show\nthat the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state\ncontrol of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.\nThe suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar\nmolecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the\ndipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to\nquantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where\nquantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Oct 2010 20:55:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["de Miranda", "M.

If symmetries are imposed, phases without symmetry breaking\n(i.e., with unique ground states) are classified by the cohomology classes of\nthe symmetry group, this is, the equivalence classes of its projective\nrepresentations, a result first derived in [X. Chen, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen,\nPhys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011); arXiv:1008.3745]. For phases with symmetry\nbreaking (i.e., degenerate ground states), we find that the symmetry consists\nof two parts, one of which acts by permuting the ground states, while the other\nacts on individual ground states, and phases are labelled by both the\npermutation action of the former and the cohomology class of the latter. Using\nProjected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), we subsequently extend our framework to\nthe classification of two-dimensional phases in the neighborhood of a number of\nimportant cases, in particular systems with unique ground states, degenerate\nground states with a local order parameter, and topological order. We also show\nthat in two dimensions, imposing symmetries does not constrain the phase\ndiagram in the same way it does in one dimension. As a central tool, we\nintroduce the isometric form, a normal form for MPS and PEPS which is a\nrenormalization fixed point. Transforming a state to its isometric form does\nnot change the phase, and thus, we can focus on to the classification of\nisometric forms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Oct 2010 20:57:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 06:07:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 23 Oct 2011 23:20:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schuch", "Norbert", ""], ["Perez-Garcia", "David", ""], ["Cirac", "Ignacio", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.3733", "submitter": "Adan Cabello", "authors": "Adan Cabello, Jan-Ake Larsson", "title": "Quantum contextuality for rational vectors", "comments": "REVTeX4-1, 1 page", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The corresponding dephasing\nrate is found to be close to the quantum limit in the low-gain limit of the\namplifier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 15:28:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Mar 2011 01:35:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 14:12:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ong", "F.
