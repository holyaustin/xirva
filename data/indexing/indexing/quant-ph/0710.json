In this\nmodification, we find formal expectation values for certain `observables' such\nas momentum-squared and Parity are altered but those for functions of positions\nare unaltered. However, by arguing that every real measurement can ultimately\nbe taken to be a position measurement, we prove that, in practice, it is\nimpossible to detect any alteration at all and, in particular, we predict no\nalteration for Roger Penrose's experiment. Nevertheless, Kay's modification\ncontains no Schr\\\"odinger Cat-like states, and also allows an `events'\ninterpretation which we tentatively propose and begin to explore. We also\nobtain a Second-Law type result for a non-relativistic toy-model closed system\nand argue that similar results will apply for a wide class of model Newtonian\nand post-Newtonian closed systems although we argue that ordinary actual\nlab-sized systems can never be treated as closed for the purpose of calculating\ntheir entropy. Compared with `collapse models' such as GRW, Kay's Newtonian\ntheory does a similar job while being free from ad hoc assumptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Oct 2007 12:12:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kay", "Bernard S.", "", "York"], ["Abyaneh", "Varqa", "", "York"]]}, {"id": "0710.1015", "submitter": "Simen Ellingsen", "authors": "Simen A.

The estimated function appears to be strongly consistent with our\npreviously-formulated Dyson-index (beta = 1, 2, 4) ansatz, dictating that the\nquaternionic (beta=4) separability function should be exactly proportional to\nthe square of the separability function for the 15-dimensional convex set of\ntwo-qubit complex (beta=2) systems, as well as the fourth power of the\nseparability function for the 9-dimensional convex set of two-qubit real\n(beta=1) systems.

In this paper,\nwe benchmark the performances of loopy quantum belief propagation (QBP) in the\ncontext of finite-tempereture quantum many-body physics. Our results indicate\nthat QBP provides reliable estimates of the high-temperature correlation\nfunction when the typical loop size in the graph is large. As such, it is\nsuitable e.g. for the study of quantum spin glasses on Bethe lattices and the\ndecoding of sparse quantum error correction codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2007 17:49:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2008 15:27:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Poulin", "David", ""], ["Bilgin", "Ersen", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4321", "submitter": "M.

We find four characteristic separation ranges. In the first\nregion, which for the empty gold shell occurs for distances, d, smaller than\nthe thickness of the coating, the result agrees with that on a solid gold\nsphere and varies as d^(-2); for larger separations there is a region where the\nforce behaves as if the coating is strictly two dimensional and varies as\nd^(-5/2); in the third region the dependence is more unspecific; in the forth\nregion when d is larger than the radius, the force varies as d^(-4).

In addition, we prove an upper bound for the\ncapacity of the channel. The upper bound is smaller than the capacity of the\nerasure channel when it is assisted by two-way classical communication. Thus,\nwe prove the separation between quantum capacities assisted by backward\nclassical communication and two-way classical communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2007 19:56:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Jan 2008 16:29:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2008 16:40:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2010 18:56:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Debbie", ""], ["Lim", "Joungkeun", ""], ["Shor", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5945", "submitter": "Leslie Ballentine", "authors": "Leslie Ballentine", "title": "Objective and Subjective Probabilities in Quantum Mechanics", "comments": "Paper given at a conference in Vaxjo, Sweden, 11 June 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.2827319", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  The concept of probability was prominent in the original foundations of\nquantum mechanics, and continues to be so today. Indeed, the controversies\nregarding objective and subjective interpretations of probability have again\nbecome active. I argue that, although both objective and subjective\nprobabilities have domains of relevance in QM, their roles are quite distinct.\nEven where both are legitimate, the objective and subjective probabilities\ndiffer, both conceptually and numerically. There are quantum probabilities that\nhave no useful subjective interpretations, and there are subjective\nprobabilities that cannot be realized as quantum probabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2007 19:58:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ballentine", "Leslie", ""]]}]
