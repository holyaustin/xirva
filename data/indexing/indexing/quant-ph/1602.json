These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite\nsuperposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial\ncodes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in\nbosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and\ndisplacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For\nrealistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform\napproximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between\nerror detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error\nrecovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The\nbinomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means\nof measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of\nthe binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes\nwith even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes\nare related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of\nrequiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as\nthe ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat\ncodes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several\nadvantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate\northonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for\nrepumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are\nrealizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should\nprove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories,\nphotonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and\ndown-conversion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 21:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 16:46:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 18:47:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Michael", "Marios H.", ""], ["Silveri", "Matti", ""], ["Brierley", "R.

Recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to\nthe stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several\ninteresting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour,\nself-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics\nof these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative\nprocesses contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To\nexplore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice\ngas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master\nequation. We interpolate between the coherent and the strongly dephased regime\nby defining a generalised concept of a blockade length. We find indications\nthat the main features observed in the strongly dissipative limit persist when\nthe dissipation is not strong enough to annihilate quantum coherences at the\ndynamically relevant time scales. These features include the existence of a\ntime-dependent Rydberg blockade radius, and a growth of the density of\nexcitations which is compatible with the power-law behaviour expected in the\nclassical limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 14:32:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Levi", "Emanuele", ""], ["Gutierrez", "Ricardo", ""], ["Lesanovsky", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.01340", "submitter": "Philipp Strasberg", "authors": "Philipp Strasberg, and Gernot Schaller, and Neill Lambert, and Tobias\n  Brandes", "title": "Nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the strong coupling and non-Markovian\n  regime based on a reaction coordinate mapping", "comments": "updated and improved version; 19 pages incl. 10 figures and 5 pages\n  appendix", "journal-ref": "New.

Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of\nfunctionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating\nclassical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible\n[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate\nschemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have\nnumerous applications.\n  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via\nquantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which\nencompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe\nclassical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description\nor a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of\nobfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,\nindistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three\nvariants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many\napplications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum\nfully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.\n  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of\nfoundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove\nthat quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries\ncan possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic\ntransformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits\nis impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation\nis impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse.

We argue that this\nentails a notion of nonintegrability: a generic general relativistic model, at\nleast when coupled to cosmologically interesting matter, likely possesses\nneither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows\nthat the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot\ncarry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;\none thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.\nThis has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we\ninvestigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that\nfails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of\nthe toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac\nobservables and a suitable semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to\nrealistic candidate theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution\nto a long-standing problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of\nquantization.

The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still\nevolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the\ncontext of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside\nthe code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The\nresult is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or\ntheir assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also\nprove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far\nfrom the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression.

The proposed system consists of a\nminimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror\nSloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a\nMembrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the\nhigh-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms\nwhich lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation\npressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using\nthe Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical\ntrapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most\nimportant being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that\npractical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz,\ncould achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring\nstiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 $\\mu$g or less could\nachieve a Q-factor of $10^{11}$ at a frequency of 100 kHz.

In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a\n\"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the\nlifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has\nthus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works\nhave demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,\nphotons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily\nillustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test\nthe capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over\ntime. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by\nsuppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded\nin superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting\nresonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using\nreal-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and\ncorrect. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the\nencoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20\ntimes greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an\nuncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element\nof the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the\npower of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC\nschemes.

Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the\npreparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well\nas their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a\ndissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the\nfield of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical\noscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the\nelectromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent\ntheoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of\nthe mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir\nto an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in\na microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous,\ncold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to\nmanipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to\ndynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe\nthe onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves\n(masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum\nresource.

The latter has however some\ndrawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of\nBell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find\nthe experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation\nsuffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the\nBell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct\ninformation-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical\ncommunication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of\nmany instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per\ninstance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a\nconvex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number\nof measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental\nsetup. Focusing on the bipartite case, in this paper, we present a simple\nmethod for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space\nand, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the\ncorresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional\nrelationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is\nillustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the\nviolation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit\nas well as two-qutrit states.

We\nfirst illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify\nit using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 20:39:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ge", "Li", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.05569", "submitter": "Juven C.

For infinite number of states, several\nnatural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable. It\nturns out that each level of distinguishability naturally corresponds to one of\nthe generalizations of linear independence to families of infinite vectors. As\nan important example, we apply the general theory to von Neumann's lattice, a\nsubsystem of coherent states which corresponds to a lattice in the classical\nphase space. We prove that the condition for distinguishability is that the\narea of the fundamental region of the lattice is greater than the Planck\nconstant, and also find subtle behavior on the threshold. These facts reveal\nthe measurement theoretical meaning of the Planck constant and give a\njustification for the interpretation that it is the smallest unit of area in\nthe phase space. The cases of uncountably many states and of mixed states are\nalso discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 09:22:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kawakubo", "Ryuitiro", ""], ["Koike", "Tatsuhiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06100", "submitter": "B.

In this\ncase, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between\ndiagonal and off-diagonal nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping\napproaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 22:07:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 16:05:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gherib", "Rami", ""], ["Ye", "Liyuan", ""], ["Ryabinkin", "Ilya G.", ""], ["Izmaylov", "Artur F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06353", "submitter": "Patrick Rooney", "authors": "Patrick Rooney, Anthony M.

At high effective temperature, entanglement\nentropy is dominated by the thermodynamic entropy, however, mutual information\nsubtracts out this contribution and measures the actual quantum entanglement.\nFinally, we study the entanglement/disentanglement transition of mutual\ninformation in the presence of chemical potential which shows that the quantum\nentanglement between two sub-regions decreases with the increase of chemical\npotential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 23:26:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kundu", "Sandipan", ""], ["Pedraza", "Juan F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07367", "submitter": "Kazuhisa Ogawa", "authors": "Kazuhisa Ogawa and Masao Kitano", "title": "Classical realization of dispersion-canceled, artifact-free, and\n  background-free optical coherence tomography", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Optics Express Vol. 24, Issue 8, pp. 8280-8289 (2016)", "doi": "10.1364/OE.24.008280", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum-optical coherence tomography (Q-OCT) provides a dispersion-canceled\naxial-imaging method, but its practical use is limited by the weakness of the\nlight source and by artifacts in the images.

Not only the\ntime step of the resulting method is not restricted by the usual CFL condition\nand thus a large time step is allowed, but also the mass conservation can be\nmaintained. In particular, for the system consisting of identical particles,\nthe advective-spectral-mixed method can also rigorously preserve physical\nsymmetry relations. The performance is validated through several typical\nnumerical experiments, like the Gaussian barrier scattering, electron-electron\ninteraction and a Helium-like system, where the third-order accuracy against\nboth grid spacing and time stepping is observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 08:15:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Xiong", "Yunfeng", ""], ["Chen", "Zhenzhu", ""], ["Shao", "Sihong", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08860", "submitter": "SayedMohammad Hosseini", "authors": "Sayed Mohammad Hosseini, Mahdi Davoudi Darareh, Shahrooz Janbaz and\n  Ali Zaghian", "title": "An Adiabatic Quantum Algorithm for Determining Gracefulness of A Graph", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1515/zna-2017-0011", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Graph labelling is one of the noticed contexts in combinatorics and graph\ntheory.

The main conceptual development builds\nfirmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum\nmethod for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local\noperations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum\nprivacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach\nhas previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,\nincluding the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.\nHere we use this approach along with a \"privacy test\" to establish a general\nmeta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of\napplications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's\nrelative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private\ncommunication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to\nsecond-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private\ncommunication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private\ncommunication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by\nunlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for\nestablishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols\nconducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several\nchannels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds\non the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic\nchannels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 10:43:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 03:19:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 16:55:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""], ["Tomamichel", "Marco", ""], ["Berta", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08902", "submitter": "Yury Sherkunov", "authors": "Y.

The\ncavity dynamics only correspond to their reduced dimensional counterparts in\nthe far field where such excitonic processes are not typically of interest.\nThere is an intermediate regime, though, where sufficiently small cavities\ncause a substantial decrease in separation sensitivity that results in one\ncomponent of the dipole-dipole coupling tensor being much larger than those of\nfree space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 17:18:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 17:34:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 May 2016 12:14:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["LaCount", "Michael D.", ""], ["Lusk", "Mark T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.09072", "submitter": "Monica De Angelis", "authors": "Monica De Angelis", "title": "On diffusion effects of the perturbed sine-Gordon equation with Neumann\n  boundary conditions", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Neumann boundary problem for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation\ndescribing the electrodynamics of Josephson junctions has been considered.
