The number of\noscillators needed to represent N-level systems scales linearly with N for\nSchrodinger states, in contrast to N^2 for the density matrix formalism.\nAlthough the well-known equivalence (SU(2), SO(3) homomorphism) of 2-level\nquantum dynamics to a rotation in real, physical space cannot be generalized to\narbitrary N-level systems, representing quantum dynamics by a system of coupled\nharmonic oscillators in one physical dimension is general for any N. Values for\nthe classical coupling constants are readily obtained from the system\nHamiltonian, allowing construction of classical mechanical systems that can\nprovide visual insight into the dynamics of abstract quantum systems as well as\na metric for characterizing the interface between quantum and classical\nmechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 17:00:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2013 17:12:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Skinner", "Thomas E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0781", "submitter": "Victor Manuel Bastidas Valencia", "authors": "V.

It is first examined if\nthe quantum discord is classically described by the hidden-variable model of\nBell in the Hilbert space with $d=2$. The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models. If one imposes the linearity condition, their model is\nconverted to a factored product of two $d=2$ models which describes quantum\nmechanical separable states. The CHSH inequality thus does not test the\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$. This observation is consistent with an\napplication of the CHSH inequality to quantum cryptography by Ekert, which is\nbased on mixed separable states without referring to dispersion-free\nrepresentations.

Relaxing the restriction hypothesis also\nallows us to introduce a 'self-dualization' procedure, which yields a new class\nof theories that share many features of quantum theory, such as obeying\nTsirelson's bound for the maximally entangled state. We then characterize joint\nstates, generalizing the maximal tensor product. We show how this new tensor\nproduct can be used to describe the convex closure of the Spekkens toy theory,\nand in doing so we obtain an analysis of why it is local in terms of the\ngeometry of its state space. We show that the unrestricted version of the\nSpekkens toy theory is the theory known as 'boxworld' that allows maximal\nnonlocal correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 21:00:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Janotta", "Peter", ""], ["Lal", "Raymond", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.2650", "submitter": "Ching-Kit Chan", "authors": "Ching-Kit Chan and L.

The\nquantum inequalities severely limit the utilization of negative energy to\nproduce gross macroscopic effects, such as violations of the second law of\nthermodynamics. The restrictions on the sampled energy density along the\nworldlines of accelerated observers are much weaker than for inertial\nobservers. Here we will illustrate this with several explicit examples. We\nconsider the worldline of a particle undergoing sinusoidal motion in space in\nthe presence of a single mode squeezed vacuum state of the electromagnetic\nfield. We show that it is possible for the integrated energy density along such\na worldline to become arbitrarily negative at a constant average rate. Thus the\naveraged weak energy condition is violated in these examples.This can be the\ncase even when the particle moves at non-relativistic speeds. We use the\nRaychaudhuri equation to show that there can be net defocussing of a congruence\nof these accelerated worldlines. This defocussing is an operational signature\nof the negative integrated energy density. These results in no way invalidate\nnor undermine either the validity or utility of the quantum inequalities for\ninertial observers. In particular, they do not change previous constraints on\nthe production of macroscopic effects with negative energy, e.g., the\nmaintenance of traversable wormholes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2013 16:49:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ford", "L.

Quantum Key Distribution,\nthe working mechanism of quantum repeaters and the various quantum\ncommunication protocols are all based on quantum entanglement. On the other\nhand, quantum entanglement is extremely fragile and sensitive to the noise of\nthe communication channel over which it has been transmitted. To share\nentanglement between distant points, high fidelity quantum channels are needed.\nIn practice, these communication links are noisy, which makes it impossible or\nextremely difficult and expensive to distribute entanglement. In this work we\nfirst show that quantum entanglement can be generated by a new idea, exploiting\nthe most natural effect of the communication channels: the noise itself of the\nlink. We prove that the noise transformation of quantum channels that are not\nable to transmit quantum entanglement can be used to generate distillable\n(useable) entanglement from classically correlated input. We call this new\nphenomenon the Correlation Conversion property (CC-property) of quantum\nchannels. The proposed solution does not require any non-local operation or\nlocal measurement by the parties, only the use of standard quantum channels.\nOur results have implications and consequences for the future of quantum\ncommunications, and for global-scale quantum communication networks.

The universality class of the transition\nimprints a signature on the resulting density of topological defects: It obeys\na power law in the quench rate, with an exponent dictated by a combination of\nthe critical exponents of the transition. In inhomogeneous systems the\nsituation is more complicated, as the spontaneous symmetry breaking competes\nwith bias caused by the influence of the nearby regions that already chose the\nnew vacuum. As a result, the choice of the broken symmetry vacuum may be\ninherited from the neighboring regions that have already entered the new phase.\nThis competition between the inherited and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nenhances the role of causality, as the defect formation is restricted to a\nfraction of the system where the front velocity surpasses the relevant sound\nvelocity and phase transition remains effectively homogeneous. As a\nconsequence, the overall number of topological defects can be substantially\nsuppressed. When the fraction of the system is small, the resulting total\nnumber of defects is still given by a power law related to the universality\nclass of the transition, but exhibits a more pronounced dependence on the\nquench rate.

This significantly increases the lifetime of the memory\ncompared to the code with noninteracting stabilizers. We investigate how the\nfidelity, with which the toric code is realized, depends on the period length T\nof the pulse sequence and the magnitude of possible pulse errors. We derive an\noptimal period T_opt that maximizes the fidelity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2013 20:44:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 15:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Becker", "Daniel", ""], ["Tanamoto", "Tetsufumi", ""], ["Hutter", "Adrian", ""], ["Pedrocchi", "Fabio L.", ""], ["Loss", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4008", "submitter": "Emerson Sadurni", "authors": "Emerson Sadurni", "title": "Time dependent Stark ladders: Exact propagator and caustic control", "comments": "11 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "2013 J.

Here, we\naddress this question by analyzing the transport properties of a boundary\ndriven spinless fermion chain with nearest-neighbor interactions subject to\nbulk dephasing. The many-body nonequilibrium stationary state is determined\nusing large-scale matrix product simulations of the corresponding quantum\nmaster equation. We find dephasing enhanced transport only in the strongly\ninteracting regime, where it is shown to induce incoherent transitions bridging\nthe gap between bound dark states and bands of mobile eigenstates. The generic\nnature of the transport enhancement is illustrated by a simple toy model, which\ncontains the basic elements required for its emergence. Surprisingly, the\neffect is significant even in the linear response regime of the full system,\nand it is predicted to exist for any large and finite chain. The response of\nthe system to dephasing also establishes a signature of an underlying\nnonequilibrium phase transition between regimes of transport degradation and\nenhancement. The existence of this transition is shown not to depend on the\nintegrability of the model considered. As a result, dephasing enhanced\ntransport is expected to persist in more realistic nonequilibrium strongly\ncorrelated systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 16:14:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 20:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mendoza-Arenas", "J.

If this\nwas possible for density functional theory as well, one could reduce in such\ncases time-dependent density functional theory to a time-independent Floquet\ndensity functional theory. We analyze under which conditions the Floquet\ntheorem is applicable in a density-functional framework. By employing numerical\n{\\em ab initio} solutions of the interacting time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with time-periodic external potentials we show that the exact\neffective potential in the corresponding Kohn-Sham equation is {\\em not}\nunconditionally periodic. Whenever several Floquet states in the interacting\nsystem are involved in a physical process the corresponding\nHartree-exchange-correlation potential is not periodic with the external\nfrequency only. Using an analytically solvable example we demonstrate that, in\ngeneral, the periodicity of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian cannot be\nrestored by choosing a different initial state. Only if the external periodic\npotential is sufficiently weak such that the initial state of the interacting\nsystem evolves adiabatically to a single, field-dressed state, the resulting\nKohn-Sham system admits the application of the Floquet theorem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2013 14:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kapoor", "V.", ""], ["Ruggenthaler", "M.", ""], ["Bauer", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.6134", "submitter": "Xiao-Feng Qian", "authors": "X.-F.

In many solid-state quantum\nsystems, these operations rely on disparate techniques that can vary widely\ndepending on the particular qubit structure. One such qubit, the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond, can be initialized and read out\nthrough its special spin selective intersystem crossing, while microwave\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) techniques provide unitary spin rotations.\nInstead, we demonstrate an alternative, fully optical approach to these control\nprotocols in an NV center that does not rely on its intersystem crossing. By\ntuning an NV center to an excited-state spin anticrossing at cryogenic\ntemperatures, we use coherent population trapping and stimulated Raman\ntechniques to realize initialization, readout, and unitary manipulation of a\nsingle spin. Each of these techniques can be directly performed along any\narbitrarily-chosen quantum basis, removing the need for extra control steps to\nmap the spin to and from a preferred basis. Combining these protocols, we\nperform measurements of the NV center's spin coherence, a demonstration of this\nfull optical control. Consisting solely of optical pulses, these techniques\nenable control within a smaller footprint and within photonic networks.\nLikewise, this approach obviates the need for both ESR manipulation and spin\naddressability through the intersystem crossing. This method could therefore be\napplied to a wide range of potential solid-state qubits, including those which\ncurrently lack a means to be addressed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 01:09:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Mar 2013 01:28:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yale", "Christopher G.", ""], ["Buckley", "Bob B.", ""], ["Christle", "David J.", ""], ["Burkard", "Guido", ""], ["Heremans", "F.

Here, we revisit the geometric discord by considering\ngeneral Schatten p-norms, explicitly showing that the 1-norm is the only p-norm\nable to define a consistent quantum correlation measure. In addition, by\nrestricting the optimization to the tetrahedron of two-qubit Bell-diagonal\nstates, we provide an analytical expression for the 1-norm geometric discord,\nwhich turns out to be equivalent to the negativity of quantumness. We\nillustrate the measure by analyzing its monotonicity properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 23:51:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 22:50:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 9 Jun 2013 00:12:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Paula", "F.

The usual approach has been to express\nthe Hamiltonian as $H=H_0+\\epsilon H_1$, and to seek a solution for C in the\nform $C=e^Q P$, where $Q=Q(q,p)$ is odd in the momentum p, even in the\ncoordinate q, and has a perturbation expansion of the form $Q=\\epsilon\nQ_1+\\epsilon^3 Q_3+\\epsilon^5 Q_5+\\ldots$. [In previous work it has always been\nassumed that the coefficients of even powers of $\\epsilon$ in this expansion\nwould be absent because their presence would violate the condition that\n$Q(p,q)$ is odd in p.] In an earlier paper it was argued that the C operator is\nnot unique because the perturbation coefficient $Q_1$ is nonunique. Here, the\nnonuniqueness of C is demonstrated at a more fundamental level: It is shown\nthat the perturbation expansion for Q actually has the more general form\n$Q=Q_0+\\epsilon Q_1+\\epsilon^2 Q_2+\\ldots$ in which {\\it all} powers and not\njust odd powers of $\\epsilon$ appear.

Math. Phys., DOI 10.1007/s00220-012-1645-2]\n(see also arXiv:1202.3903) taking the initial state as an absorbing one. We\nextend this notion of monitored recurrence to absorbing subspaces of arbitrary\nfinite dimension.\n  The generating function approach leads to a connection with the well-known\ntheory of operator-valued Schur functions. This is the cornerstone of a\nspectral characterization of subspace recurrence that generalizes some of the\nmain results in the above mentioned paper. The spectral decomposition of the\nunitary step operator driving the evolution yields a spectral measure, which we\nproject onto the subspace to obtain a new spectral measure that is purely\nsingular iff the subspace is recurrent, and consists of a pure point spectrum\nwith a finite number of masses precisely when all states in the subspace have a\nfinite expected return time.\n  This notion of subspace recurrence also links the concept of expected return\ntime to an Aharonov-Anandan phase that, in contrast to the case of state\nrecurrence, can be non-integer. Even more surprising is the fact that averaging\nsuch geometrical phases over the absorbing subspace yields an integer with a\ntopological meaning, so that the averaged expected return time is always a\nrational number. Moreover, state recurrence can occasionally give higher return\nprobabilities than subspace recurrence, a fact that reveals once more the\ncounterintuitive behavior of quantum systems.\n  All these phenomena are illustrated with explicit examples, including as a\nnatural application the analysis of site recurrence for coined walks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 19:05:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bourgain", "J.", ""], ["Gr\u00fcnbaum", "F.
