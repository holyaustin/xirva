The motivation comes\nfrom a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating\nquantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to\nHeidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.\n  Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent\nto finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is\nattached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other\ntheories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this\npaper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow\n$\\breve{A}_\\phi:\\Si_\\phi\\map\\R_\\phi$ where $\\Si_\\phi$ and $\\R_\\phi$ are two\nspecial objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the\nappropriate topos, $\\tau_\\phi$.\n  We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system,\n$S$. The first, $\\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\\L{S}$, is\na higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with\nan intuitionistic logic. With the aid of $\\PL{S}$ we expand and develop some of\nthe earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum\nphysics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection\noperator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf $\\Sig$--the topos\nquantum analogue of a classical state space.

This is done by calculating the reduced single particle\ndensity matrix, the pair-distribution function, and momentum distribution of\nthe gas as a function of barrier strength and particle number. With increasing\nbarrier height we find that the ground state occupation in a diagonal basis\ndiverges from the $\\sqrt N$ behavior that is expected for the case of a simple\nharmonic trap. In fact, the scaling of the occupation number depends on whether\none has an even or odd number of particles. Since this quantity is a measure of\nthe coherence of our sample we show how the odd-even effect manifests itself in\nboth the momentum distribution of the Bose gas and interference fringe\nvisibility during free temporal evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2008 12:33:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Mar 2008 10:47:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2008 09:30:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2008 09:31:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Goold", "J.", ""], ["Busch", "Th.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0870", "submitter": "Curceanu Catalina", "authors": "C.

Large-scale quantum communication (of\nthe order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond\nthis distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission\nchannel. Quantum communication eventually fails when the probability of a dark\ncount in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a\nphoton is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, D\\\"{u}r, Cirac\nand Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining\nentanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable\ndistances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated,\nthe implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to\nthe difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement\nswapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ\nquantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ\nwith atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled\nwith a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by\nperforming a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they\nhave passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement\nis stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic\nexcitations into photons.

Two main\nissues to consider when designing control methods are accuracy and efficiency,\nfor which two complementary approaches have been developed so far to control\nqubit registers with liquid-state NMR methods.

In order to explain this, it is necessary to construct a quantum\nbound-state picture valid in all Lorentz frames. It is noted that Paul A. M.\nDirac studied this problem of constructing relativistic quantum mechanics\nbeginning in 1927. It is noted further that he published major papers in this\nfield in 1945, 1949, 1953, and in 1963. By combining these works by Dirac, it\nis possible to construct a Lorentz-covariant theory which can explain hadronic\nphenomena in the static and high-speed limits, as well as in between. It is\nshown also that this Lorentz-covariant bound-state picture can explain what we\nobserve in high-energy laboratories, including the parton distribution function\nand the behavior of the proton form factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2008 13:59:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Y.

The standard circuit model of quantum computing\nrequires a universal set of quantum logic gates for the implementation of\narbitrary quantum operations. As in classical models of computation, quantum\nerror correction techniques enable rectification of small imperfections in gate\noperations, thus allowing for perfect computation in the presence of noise. For\nfault-tolerant computation, it is commonly believed that error thresholds\nranging between 10^-4 and 10^-2 will be required depending on the noise model\nand the computational overhead for realizing the quantum gates. Up to now, all\nexperimental implementations have fallen short of these requirements. Here, we\nreport on a Molmer-Sorensen type gate operation entangling ions with a fidelity\nof 99.3(1)% which together with single-qubit operations forms a universal set\nof quantum gates. The gate operation is performed on a pair of qubits encoded\nin two trapped calcium ions using a single amplitude-modulated laser beam\ninteracting with both ions at the same time. A robust gate operation, mapping\nseparable states onto maximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically\nswitching the laser-ion coupling on and off. We analyse the performance of a\nsingle gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations.

Using a different mathematical framework, namely,\nquasi-set theory, we avoid working within a\nlabel-tensor-product-vector-space-formalism, to use Redhead and Teller's words,\nand get a more intuitive way of dealing with the formalism of quantum\nmechanics, although the underlying logic should be modified. Thus, this paper\ncan be regarded as a tentative to follow and enlarge Heinsenberg's suggestion\nthat new phenomena require the formation of a new \"closed\" (that is, axiomatic)\ntheory, coping also with the physical theory's underlying logic and\nmathematics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2008 18:35:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Domenech", "G.", ""], ["Holik", "F.", ""], ["Krause", "D.", ""]]}]
