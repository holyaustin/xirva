We demonstrate a\nsuper-resolving phase measurement with two entangled qubits of different\nphysical realizations: an nitrogen-vacancy centre electron spin and a proximal\n${}^{13}$C nuclear spin. The experimental data shows clearly the uncertainty\nreduction when entanglement resource is used, confirming the theoretical\nexpectation. Our results represent an elemental demonstration of enhancement of\nquantum metrology against classical procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 10:28:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 05:47:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Gang-Qin", ""], ["Zhang", "Yu-Ran", ""], ["Chang", "Yan-Chun", ""], ["Yue", "Jie-Dong", ""], ["Fan", "Heng", ""], ["Pan", "Xin-Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0492", "submitter": "Nitin Jain", "authors": "Nitin Jain, Birgit Stiller, Imran Khan, Vadim Makarov, Christoph\n  Marquardt, and Gerd Leuchs", "title": "Risk analysis of Trojan-horse attacks on practical quantum key\n  distribution systems", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures, and author biographies (closer to the published\n  version)", "journal-ref": "IEEE J.

Due\nto the possibly drastic intensity increase of an input coherent light in the\ngain-loss waveguide couplers with parity-time (PT) symmetry, the Kerr effect\nfrom a nonlinearity added into the systems can be greatly enhanced, and is\nexpected to create the macroscopic entangled states of the output light fields\nwith huge photon numbers. Meanwhile, the quantum noises also coexist with the\namplification and dissipation of the light fields. Under the interplay between\nthe quantum noises and nonlinearity, the quantum dynamical behaviors of the\nsystems become rather complicated.

The\nenhanced Kerr nonlinearity is found to give rise to a previously unknown\ndecoherence effect that is irrelevant to the quantum noises, and imposes a\nlimit on the emergence of macroscopic nonclassicality.

We\nanalytically show that the Schmidt rank grows exponentially with $n$ and that\nthe half-chain entanglement entropy to the leading order scales as $\\sqrt{n}$\n(Eq. 16).

They consider locality-preserving operations which are\nimplemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus\nfault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions\nand applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we\npresent a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we\nprove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a\nlocality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a\nmacroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a\nD-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th\nlevel Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with\nnon-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and\nTerhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial\ntransversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such,\nno family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of\nthe Clifford hierarchy may exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer\nand subsystem codes, and is not restricted to geometrically-local codes. Fourth\nwe extend the result of Bravyi and K\\\"onig to subsystem codes. A technical\ndifficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not\napply to subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming the presence of\nerror threshold in a subsystem code, and the same conclusion as Bravyi-K\\\"onig\nis recovered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2014 21:50:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Pastawski", "Fernando", ""], ["Yoshida", "Beni", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1721", "submitter": "George Goedecke", "authors": "G.H.

The\nalgorithm is based on the use of a quantum subroutine for finding hidden shifts\nin $d$ dimensions, which is a variant of algorithms proposed by Kuperberg.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Aug 2014 11:03:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 16:13:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 05:25:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Montanaro", "Ashley", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1826", "submitter": "Tim Maudlin", "authors": "Tim Maudlin", "title": "What Bell Did", "comments": "28 pages.

For 3, 4 and 5 parties, we show that\nit is possible to violate these inequalities with high probability, when the\nparties choose their measurements from the three Pauli operators, defined only\nwith respect to their local frames. Moreover, the probability of violation, and\nthe amount of violation, are increased when each party chooses their\nmeasurements from the four operators describing the vertices of a tetrahedron.\nWe also consider how many randomly chosen measurement directions are needed to\nviolate the Bell inequalities with high probability. We see that the obtained\nlevels of violation are sufficient to also demonstrate genuine multipartite\nentanglement and nonseparability. Finally, we show analytically that choosing\nfrom two measurement settings per party is sufficient to demonstrate the\nmaximum degree of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonseparability with\ncertainty when the parties' reference frames are aligned in one direction so\nthat they differ only in rotations around one axis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Aug 2014 12:46:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 13:50:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Senel", "Celal Furkan", ""], ["Lawson", "Thomas", ""], ["Kaplan", "Marc", ""], ["Markham", "Damian", ""], ["Diamanti", "Eleni", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1855", "submitter": "Hendra Nurdin", "authors": "Onvaree Techakesari and Hendra I.

Because the plasmonic waveguide confines the\neffective mode area to subwavelength scale, it can bridge nanophotonics and\nquantum optics and may be used as near-field quantum probe in a quantum\nnear-field micro/nanoscope, which can realize high spatial resolution,\nultrasensitive, fiber-integrated, and plasmon-enhanced detection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Aug 2014 15:10:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 08:20:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ming", ""], ["Zou", "Chang-Ling", ""], ["Ren", "Xi-Feng", ""], ["Xiong", "Xiao", ""], ["Cai", "Yong-Jing", ""], ["Guo", "Guo-Ping", ""], ["Tong", "Li-Min", ""], ["Guo", "Guang-Can", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.2427", "submitter": "Mario Mastriani", "authors": "Mario Mastriani", "title": "Quantum Boolean Image Denoising", "comments": "27 pages, 19 figures, 4 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1406.5121; and text overlap with arXiv:quant-ph/0402085,\n  arXiv:1301.0011 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A quantum Boolean image processing methodology is presented in this work,\nwith special emphasis in image denoising. A new approach for internal image\nrepresentation is outlined together with two new interfaces:\nclassical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical. The new quantum-Boolean image\ndenoising called quantum Boolean mean filter (QBMF) works with computational\nbasis states (CBS), exclusively. To achieve this, we first decompose the image\ninto its three color components, i.e., red, green and blue. Then, we get the\nbitplanes for each color, e.g., 8 bits-per-pixel, i.e., 8 bitplanes-per-color.\nFrom now on, we will work with the bitplane corresponding to the most\nsignificant bit (MSB) of each color, exclusive manner. After a\nclassical-to-quantum interface (which includes a classical inverter), we have a\nquantum Boolean version of the image within the quantum machine. This\nmethodology allows us to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters\nthe results of the measured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended\nto quantum algorithms outside image processing too. After filtering of the\ninverted version of MSB (inside quantum machine) the result passes through a\nquantum-classical interface (which involves another classical inverter) and\nthen proceeds to reassemble each color component and finally the ending\nfiltered image. Finally, we discuss the more appropriate metrics for image\ndenoising in a set of experimental results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2014 14:43:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mastriani", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.2432", "submitter": "Carl Bender", "authors": "Carl M.

Responsible\nfor the speed-up is a subroutine called the quantum order finding algorithm\n(QOFA) which calculates the order -- the smallest integer, $r$, satisfying $a^r\n\\mod N =1$, where $a$ is a randomly chosen integer coprime to $N$ (meaning\ntheir greatest common divisor is one, $\\gcd(a, N) =1$). Given $r$, and with\nprobability not less than $1/2$, the factors are given by $p_1 = \\gcd\n(a^{\\frac{r}{2}} - 1, N)$ and $p_2 = \\gcd (a^{\\frac{r}{2}} + 1, N)$. For odd\n$r$ it is assumed the factors cannot be found (since $a^{\\frac{r}{2}}$ is not\ngenerally integer) and the QOFA is relaunched with a different value of $a$.\nBut a recent paper [E. Martin-Lopez: Nat Photon {\\bf 6}, 773 (2012)] noted that\nthe factors can sometimes be found from odd orders if the coprime is square.\n  This raises the question of improving SFA's success probability by\nconsidering odd orders. We show that an improvement is possible, though it is\nsmall. We present two techniques for retrieving the order from apparently\nuseless runs of the QOFA: not discarding odd orders; and looking out for new\norder finding relations in the case of failure. In terms of efficiency, using\nour techniques is equivalent to avoiding square coprimes and disregarding odd\norders, which is simpler in practice. Even still, our techniques may be useful\nin the near future, while demonstrations are restricted to factoring small\nnumbers. The most convincing demonstrations of the QOFA are those that return a\nnon-power-of-two order, making odd orders that lead to the factors attractive\nto experimentalists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2014 15:15:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 07:53:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lawson", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.2749", "submitter": "Michael Biercuk", "authors": "T.

Finally, we apply this method to exhaustively enumerate\nthe tunnel coupling for all donor-donor configurations within a large search\nvolume, demonstrating conclusively that the tunnel coupling has no spatially\nstable regions.

We show that, in this particular setting, the most\ngeneral adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a\nquantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a\nconstant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to\nzero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy\nregistered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states\nthat any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than\nthe channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily\nconverges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal\nstrong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we\ncan establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted\ncapacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our\nchannel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as\nwas used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is a\nkey tool in our analysis. Finally, by combining our results with recent results\nof Hayashi and Tomamichel, we find a novel operational interpretation of the\nmutual information of a quantum channel N as the optimal type II error exponent\nwhen discriminating between a large number of independent instances of N and an\narbitrary \"worst-case\" replacer channel chosen from the set of all replacer\nchannels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Aug 2014 18:17:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 20:16:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:51:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cooney", "Tom", ""], ["Mosonyi", "Mil\u00e1n", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.3379", "submitter": "Matthew Hastings", "authors": "M.

The analysis makes use\nof several aspects of classical electromagnetic theory which are unfamiliar to\nmost physicists, including the Darwin Lagrangian, acceleration-based electric\nfields, internal electromagnetic momentum in a magnet, and a magnet model\ninvolving at least three mutually-interacting particles. Only when the\nacceleration-based electric forces acting on the passing charge are included do\nwe find consistency with all the relativistic conservation laws: energy, linear\nmomentum, angular momentum, and constant center-of-mass velocity. The electric\nforces on the passing charge lead to a lag effect which accounts quantitatively\nfor the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. Thus the classical analysis strongly\nsuggests that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift (observed when electrons pass a\nlong solenoid which corresponds to a line of magnetic dipoles) is the analogue\nof the Matteucci-Pozzi phase shift (observed when electrons pass a line of\nelectric dipoles). The classical electromagnetic analysis suggests experiments\nto distinguish the proposed classical-based lag effect from the presently\naccepted view that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is a quantum topological\neffect arising from magnetic fluxes in the absence of classical electromagnetic\nforces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Aug 2014 16:34:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 14:24:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Boyer", "Timothy H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.3758", "submitter": "Thomas Jordan", "authors": "Thomas F.

However, as this set consists\nonly of product states, such a distance captures all the correlations (quantum\nand classical) between modes. Therefore it is merely un upper bound for the\ngeometric discord, no matter which is the employed distance. In this work we\nchoose for this purpose the Hellinger metric that is known to have many\nbeneficial properties recommending it as a good measure of quantum behaviour.\nIn general, this metric is determined by affinity, a relative of the Uhlmann\nfidelity with which it shares many important features. As a first step of our\nwork, the affinity of a pair of $n$-mode Gaussian states is written. Then, in\nthe two-mode case, we succeeded in determining exactly the closest Gaussian\nproduct state and computed the Gaussian discord accordingly. The obtained\ngeneral formula is remarkably simple and becomes still friendlier in the\nsignificant case of symmetric two-mode Gaussian states. We then analyze in\ndetail two special classes of two-mode Gaussian states of theoretical and\nexperimental interest as well: the squeezed thermal states and the mode-mixed\nthermal ones. The former are separable under a well-known threshold of\nsqueezing, while the latter are always separable. It is worth stressing that\nfor symmetric states belonging to either of these classes, we find consistency\nbetween their geometric Hellinger discord and the originally defined discord in\nthe Gaussian approach. At the same time, the Gaussian Hellinger discord of such\na state turns out to be a reliable measure of the total amount of its cross\ncorrelations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2014 20:42:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 21 Mar 2015 22:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Marian", "Paulina", ""], ["Marian", "Tudor A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4491", "submitter": "Paul M.

This (zero-dimensional)\nmodel serves as a simplified arena to explore BH particle\nproduction/evaporation and back-action effects under an explicitly unitary\nevolution which enforces quantized energy/particle conservation. Within our\nanalogous quantum optical model we examine the entanglement between two emitted\nparticle/anti-particle and anti-particle/particle pairs coupled via the black\nhole (BH) evaporating `pump' source. We also analytically and dynamically\nverify the `Page information time' for our model which refers to the\nconventionally held belief that the information in the BH radiation becomes\nsignificant after the black hole has evaporated half its initial energy into\nthe outgoing radiation. Lastly, we investigate the effect of BH particle\nproduction/evaporation on two modes in the exterior region of the BH event\nhorizon that are initially maximally entangled, when one mode falls inward and\ninteracts with the black hole, and the other remains forever outside and\nnon-interacting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2014 22:17:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 05:17:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Alsing", "Paul M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4517", "submitter": "Hongwei Yu", "authors": "Wenting Zhou, Hongwei Yu", "title": "Energy shift and Casimir-Polder force for an atom out of thermal\n  equilibrium near a dielectric substrate", "comments": "42 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Physical Review A 90, 032501 (2014)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.90.032501", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the energy shift and the Casimir-Polder force of an atom out of\nthermal equilibrium near the surface of a dielectric substrate.

More generally, phase-insensitive bosonic\nchannels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifying\nprocesses. Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these\nchannels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds\nfor the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number\nconstraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of\nsecond-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest\none, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of\ncommunication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to\nunderstand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite\nnumber of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code\nsize for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for\nits capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by\nproving a general \"one-shot\" coding theorem for channels with classical inputs\nand pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The\ntheorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel\noutput is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine\nwhether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 15:32:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2015 03:48:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""], ["Renes", "Joseph M.", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5333", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "Jaime Sa\\~nudo and Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "title": "Statistical magnitudes and the Klein tunneling in bi-layer graphene:\n  influence of evanescent waves", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1309.3931", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall nlin.PS quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of the Klein tunneling across a potential barrier in bi-layer\ngraphene is addressed.

The physical objective as a functional of the field\nforms the quantum control landscape, whose topology, under certain conditions,\nhas been shown to contain no critical point suboptimal traps, thereby enabling\neffective searches for fields that give the global maximum of the objective.\nThis paper addresses the structure of the landscape as a complement to\ntopological critical point features. Recent work showed that landscape\nstructure is highly favorable for optimization of state-to-state transition\nprobabilities, in that gradient-based control trajectories to the global\nmaximum value are nearly straight paths. The landscape structure is codified in\nthe metric $R\\geq 1.0$, defined as the ratio of the length of the control\ntrajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial and optimal controls.\nA value of $R=1$ would indicate an exactly straight trajectory to the optimal\nobservable value. This paper extends the state-to-state transition probability\nresults to the quantum ensemble and unitary transformation control landscapes.\nAgain, nearly straight trajectories predominate, and we demonstrate that $R$\ncan take values approaching 1.0 with high precision. However, the interplay of\noptimization trajectories with critical saddle submanifolds is found to\ninfluence landscape structure. A fundamental relationship necessary for\nperfectly straight gradient-based control trajectories is derived wherein the\ngradient on the quantum control landscape must be an eigenfunction of the\nHessian.

One-dimensional systems provide\nfundamental insights since they are often amenable to exact methods. However,\nno exact solution is known for the experimentally relevant case of external\nconfinement. Here, we propose a powerful ansatz for the one-dimensional Fermi\ngas in a harmonic potential near the limit of infinite short-range repulsion.\nFor the case of a single impurity in a Fermi sea, we show that our ansatz is\nindistinguishable from numerically exact results in both the few- and many-body\nlimits. We furthermore derive an effective Heisenberg spin-chain model\ncorresponding to our ansatz, valid for any spin-mixture, within which we obtain\nthe impurity eigenstates analytically. In particular, the classical Pascal's\ntriangle emerges in the expression for the ground-state wavefunction. As well\nas providing an important benchmark for strongly correlated physics, our\nresults are relevant for emerging quantum technologies, where a precise\nknowledge of one-dimensional quantum states is paramount.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 18:34:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Jul 2015 05:20:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Levinsen", "Jesper", ""], ["Massignan", "Pietro", ""], ["Bruun", "Georg M.", ""], ["Parish", "Meera M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.7099", "submitter": "Ram\\'on L\\'opez-Pe\\~na Dr.", "authors": "Armando Figueroa, Julio L\\'opez, Octavio Casta\\~nos, Ram\\'on\n  L\\'opez-Pe\\~na, Margarita A.
