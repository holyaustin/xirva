In the transition from vanishing to\narbitrary non-vanishing temperature, the long time back-flow of information is\nstable for $3+4n<\\alpha_0<4+4n$, while it is reverted for $2+4n<\\alpha_0<3+4n$\nand $4+4n<\\alpha_0<5+4n$. The patterns of the information flow are not altered\nif the low frequency Ohmic-like profiles of the SDs are perturbed with\nadditional factors that consist in arbitrary powers of logarithmic forms.\nConsequently, the flow of information can be controlled, directed and reverted\nover long times by engineering a wide variety of reservoirs that includes and\ncontinuously departs from the Ohmic-like structure at low frequencies.\nNon-Markovianity and recoherence appear according to the same rules along with\nthe back-flow of information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:00:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Giraldi", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00823", "submitter": "Holger Waalkens", "authors": "Holger Dullin and Holger Waalkens", "title": "Defect in the Joint Spectrum of Hydrogen due to Monodromy", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very\nlarge couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly\nequal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic\nstates are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state. We interpret\nthe emergence of the two-fold degeneracy of the vacuum of both circuits as an\nenvironmental suppression of flux/charge tunneling due to their dressing by\nvirtual low-/high-impedance photons in the resonator. For flux tunneling, the\ndressing is nothing else than the shunting of a Josephson atom with a large\ncapacitance of the resonator.

We introduce the notion of\nper-branch observables---expectation values with respect to the different\ndecohered branches of the wave function---and show that the evolution of modes\non individual branches varies from branch to branch.

Here we present a truly quantum\nversion, the first in which a measurement apparatus deterministically entangles\ntwo distinct optical beams, enabling us to experimentally ask a question\ndirectly analogous to that of the original proposal: \"In a two-arm\ninterferometer containing one photon in total, can the result of a measurement\nof the photon number in one arm turn out to be greater than 1?\" Specifically,\nwe show that a single photon, when properly post-selected, can have an effect\nequal to that of eight photons: that is, in a system where a single photon has\nbeen calibrated to write a nonlinear phase shift of \\phi_0 on a probe beam, we\nmeasure phase shifts as large as 8\\phi_0 for appropriately post-selected single\nphotons. This is the first deterministic weak-value experiment in optics which\ndefies classical explanation, and constitutes a realization of our proposal for\nweak-value amplification (WVA) of the small optical nonlinearity at the\nsingle-photon level. It opens up a new regime for the study of entanglement of\noptical beams, as well as further investigations of the power of WVA for the\nmeasurement of small quantities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 04:28:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hallaji", "Matin", ""], ["Feizpour", "Amir", ""], ["Dmochowski", "Greg", ""], ["Sinclair", "Josiah", ""], ["Steinberg", "Aephraim M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.04929", "submitter": "Nelson Leung", "authors": "Nelson Leung, Mohamed Abdelhafez, Jens Koch, David I.

We further revisit the currently known results\nstating the equivalence between separability and positive partial transposition\n(PPT) for specific classes of Gaussian states.

In particular, we recover the\nPPT-separability equivalence for: (i) Gaussian states of $1$ vs $n$ modes; and\n(ii) isotropic Gaussian states. In passing, we also retrieve (iii) the recently\nestablished equivalence between separability of a Gaussian state and and its\ncomplete Gaussian extendability. Our techniques are then applied to progress\nbeyond the state of the art. We show that: (iv) Gaussian states that are\ninvariant under partial transposition are necessarily separable; (v) the PPT\ncriterion is necessary and sufficient for separability for Gaussian states of\n$m$ vs $n$ modes that are symmetric under the exchange of any two modes\nbelonging to one of the parties; and (vi) Gaussian states which remain PPT\nunder passive optical operations can not be entangled by them either.

First, we study the\nhardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along\nthe lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show\nthat there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with\nsampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a\nstatistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.\nCompared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk\ndirectly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being\nsampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new\nalgorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates\nin polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known\nalgorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of\nAaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of\nthe form \"if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH\ncollapses\"--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson\nand Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant\nversus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities.\nFifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly.

In the multi-copy\nregime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly\nsuper-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of\ntwo tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their\nmaximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those\ntripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative\nwhen taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on\ndetermining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate,\nwhich turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt\nrank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal\nSchmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative\nproperty, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal\nSchmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states, by resorting\nto certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of\nmatrix semi-invariants.

This motivates a natural comparison between,\non the one hand, adiabatic preparation of steady states of Lindbladian\ngenerators and, on the other hand, relaxation towards the same steady states\nsubject to the final Lindbladian of the adiabatic process. In this work we thus\nadopt the perspective that the goal is the most efficient possible preparation\nof such steady states, rather than ground states. Using known rigorous bounds\nfor the open-system adiabatic theorem and for mixing times, we are then led to\na disturbing conclusion that at first appears to doom efforts to build physical\nquantum annealers: relaxation seems to always converge faster than adiabatic\npreparation. However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time\nfor Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we\nshow that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation.\nTo test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and\nthe relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative\nquasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the\n\"spike\" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we\nfind that the answer to the \"which wins\" question depends for each model on the\ntemperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the \"spike\"\nproblem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an\nimportant role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure.\nThus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both\npure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 14:19:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 17:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Venuti", "Lorenzo Campos", ""], ["Albash", "Tameem", ""], ["Marvian", "Milad", ""], ["Lidar", "Daniel", ""], ["Zanardi", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.07986", "submitter": "Patrizia Vitale", "authors": "Vladimir I.

The contribution of such a process would be to\nprovide a physical basis for the ontological indeterminacy needed to derive the\nirreversible Second Law against a backdrop of otherwise reversible,\ndeterministic physical laws. An alternative understanding of the source of this\npossible quantum \"collapse\" or non-unitarity is presented herein, in terms of\nthe Transactional Interpretation (TI).

To date,\nmany different approaches to quantum state estimation have been developed, yet\nno one method fits all applications, and all fail relatively quickly as the\ndimensionality of the unknown state grows. In this work, we suggest that\nprojected gradient descent is a method that can evade some of these\nshortcomings.
