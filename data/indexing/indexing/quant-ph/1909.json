Despite their ability to describe essential\nphysics with relatively few basis functions, these representations can suffer\nfrom a quartic growth of the number of integrals. Recent results have shown\nthat, for some quantum and classical algorithms, moving to representations with\ndiagonal two-body operators can result in dramatically lower asymptotic costs,\neven if the number of functions required increases significantly. We introduce\na way to interpolate between the two regimes in a systematic and controllable\nmanner, such that the number of functions is minimized while maintaining a\nblock diagonal structure of the two-body operator and desirable properties of\nan original, primitive basis. Techniques are analyzed for leveraging the\nstructure of this new representation on quantum computers. Empirical results\nfor hydrogen chains suggest a scaling improvement from $O(N^{4.5})$ in\nmolecular orbital representations to $O(N^{2.6})$ in our representation for\nquantum evolution in a fault-tolerant setting, and exhibit a constant factor\ncrossover at 15 to 20 atoms. Moreover, we test these methods using modern\ndensity matrix renormalization group methods classically, and achieve excellent\naccuracy with respect to the complete basis set limit with a speedup of 1-2\norders of magnitude with respect to using the primitive or Gaussian basis sets\nalone.

This radiation emission, known as the Cherenkov\neffect, is among the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics. As such, it\nis used in numerous applications of particle detectors, particle accelerators,\nlight sources, and medical imaging. Surprisingly, all Cherenkov-based\napplications and experiments thus far were fully described by classical\nelectrodynamics even though theoretical work predicts new Cherenkov phenomena\ncoming from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum description could provide new\npossibilities for the design of highly controllable light sources and more\nefficient accelerators and detectors. Here, we provide a direct evidence of the\nquantum nature of the Cherenkov effect and reveal its intrinsic quantum\nfeatures. By satisfying the Cherenkov condition for relativistic electron\nwavefunctions and maintaining it over hundreds of microns, each electron\nsimultaneously accelerates and decelerates by absorbing and emitting hundreds\nof photons in a coherent manner. We observe this strong interaction in an\nultrafast transmission electron microscope, achieving for the first time a\nphase-matching between a relativistic electron wavefunction and a propagating\nlight wave. Consequently, the quantum wavefunction of each electron evolves\ninto a coherent plateau, analogous to a frequency comb in ultrashort laser\npulses, containing hundreds of quantized energy peaks. Our findings prove that\nthe delocalized wave nature of electrons can become dominant in stimulated\ninteractions.

Using Floquet analysis, we show that\nquasiperiodicity is born out of non $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations via\na supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Changing the detuning between the\nlevel spacings in the two ensembles and the repump rate results in the\nsynchronization of the two chaotic ensembles. In this regime, the chaotic\nintensity fluctuations of the light radiated by the two ensembles are\nidentical.

Furthermore, it is\nknown that any one non-Gaussian Hamiltonian, along with Gaussian unitaries,\nmakes for universal quantum resources. Photon subtraction, a readily-realizable\nnon-Gaussian operation, therefore, has been a popular tool to try and engineer\nnon-Gaussian states for universal quantum processing. In this paper, we give a\nformula to calculate the fidelity between a non-Gaussian target state and the\nheralded state resulting from an $N$-mode Gaussian state subjected to\nmulti-mode, multi-photon subtraction. We also derive an easy-to-calculate upper\nbound of said fidelity. Then, we consider an example of an $N$-mode coherent\ncat-basis cluster state (CCCS), a resource sufficient for universal quantum\ncomputing---and prove that the fidelity between the state produced by photon\nsubtraction on any Gaussian state and the CCCS cannot be more than $1/2^N$.\nFurther, we prove that photon subtraction can be used to prepare states whose\nfidelity with coherent GHZ states is very close to one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Sep 2019 16:21:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 01:45:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gagatsos", "Christos N.", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.03513", "submitter": "Arash Riazi", "authors": "Arash Riazi, Changjia Chen, Eric Y.

The\nentanglement between photons can be present in various degrees of freedom\n(DOFs), and even the simplest bi-partite systems can occupy a large Hilbert\nspace. Therefore, it is desirable to exploit this multi-dimensional space for\nvarious quantum applications by fully controlling the properties of the\nentangled photons in multiple DOFs. While current entangled-photon sources are\ncapable of generating entanglement in one or more DOFs, there is currently a\nlack of practical techniques that can shape and control the entanglement\nproperties in multiple DOFs. Here we show that cascading two or more\nentangled-photon sources with tunable linear media in between allows us to\ngenerate photon-pairs whose entanglement properties can be tailored and shaped\nin the frequency and polarisation domains. We first develop a quantum\nmechanical model to study the quantum state generated from the cascade\nstructure with special considerations paid to the effects of pump temporal\ncoherence, linear dispersion, and in-structure polarisation transformation\napplied between the entangled-photon sources. We then experimentally generate\nphoton-pairs with tunable entanglement properties by manipulating the\ndispersion and birefringence properties of the linear medium placed in between\ntwo entangled-photon sources.

There, the\nemergent conservation law is reflected in the appearance of an `integrability'\nof an effective Hamiltonian. These results hold for a wide variety of\nHamiltonians, including the Ising model in a transverse field in {\\it any\ndimension} and for {\\it any form of Ising interactions}. The phenomenon is also\nshown to be robust in the presence of {\\it two-body Heisenberg interactions\nwith any arbitrary choice of couplings}. Further, we construct a real-time\nperturbation theory which captures resonance phenomena where the conservation\nbreaks down, giving way to unbounded heating.

It is also shown that both of the real and\nimaginary parts can be inferred by observing the probability in practice, which\nhas an advantage that an additional system of a pointer is not needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2019 01:26:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Yokota", "Kazuhiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.04815", "submitter": "Jon Links", "authors": "Arlei P.

Our results identify regions\nin the space of Hamiltonian control fields and circuit-depth which are most\namenable to reliable noise extrapolation, as well as shedding light on how\nlow-level hardware characterization can be used as a predictive tool for\nuncertainty quantification in error mitigated NISQ computations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2019 17:18:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Garmon", "J.

Capturing the complete multi-time statistics\ndefining a stochastic process lies at the heart of any proper treatment of\nmemory effects. In this thesis, using a novel framework for the\ncharacterisation of quantum stochastic processes, we first solve the long\nstanding question of unambiguously describing the memory length of a quantum\nprocesses. This is achieved by constructing a quantum Markov order condition\nthat naturally generalises its classical counterpart for the quantification of\nfinite-length memory effects. As measurements are inherently invasive in\nquantum mechanics, one has no choice but to define Markov order with respect to\nthe interrogating instruments that are used to probe the process at hand:\ndifferent memory effects are exhibited depending on how one addresses the\nsystem, in contrast to the standard classical setting. We then fully\ncharacterise the structural constraints imposed on quantum processes with\nfinite Markov order, shedding light on a variety of memory effects that can\narise through various examples. Lastly, we introduce an instrument-specific\nnotion of memory strength that allows for a meaningful quantification of the\ntemporal correlations between the history and the future of a process for a\ngiven choice of experimental intervention. These findings are directly relevant\nto both characterising and exploiting memory effects that persist for a finite\nduration. In particular, immediate applications range from developing efficient\ncompression and recovery schemes for the description of quantum processes with\nmemory to designing coherent control protocols that efficiently perform\ninformation-theoretic tasks, amongst a plethora of others.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Sep 2019 21:37:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Taranto", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.05263", "submitter": "Sarang Gopalakrishnan", "authors": "Utkarsh Agrawal, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur, Brayden Ware", "title": "Anomalous low-frequency conductivity in easy-plane XXZ spin chains", "comments": "5pp, 2 figs, plus supplemental material", "journal-ref": "Phys.

It is a very versatile\ntechnique which allows for the emulation of interactions that do not only\ndepend on inter-particle separations or do not decay with particle separation.\nWe detail the proposed experimental scheme and consider two examples of\ninteracting phenomena, self-trapping and the decay of Bloch oscillations, that\nare observable with the proposed technique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Duncan", "Callum W.", ""], ["Hartmann", "Michael J.", ""], ["Thomson", "Robert R.", ""], ["\u00d6hberg", "Patrik", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.07407", "submitter": "Bruno Bertini", "authors": "Bruno Bertini, Pavel Kos, Tomaz Prosen", "title": "Operator Entanglement in Local Quantum Circuits I: Chaotic Dual-Unitary\n  Circuits", "comments": "23 pages, 6 figures; v2 29 pages, 6 figures, improved exposition", "journal-ref": "SciPost Phys. 8, 067 (2020)", "doi": "10.21468/SciPostPhys.8.4.067", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th nlin.CD quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The entanglement in operator space is a well established measure for the\ncomplexity of the quantum many-body dynamics.

Each\npulse has a chirped detuning, which induces a half crossing, and acts as a\n$\\pi/2$ pulse in the adiabatic regime. The phase jump is imprinted onto the\npopulation ratio of the created superposition state. Of the various possible\nrelations between the two pulses, we select the case when the Rabi frequency\nand the detuning of the second pulse are mirror images of those of the first\npulse, and the two detunings have opposite signs. Then the mixing angle of the\nsuperposition state depends on the phase jump only. For other arrangements, the\nsuperposition mixing angle is shifted by the dynamic phases of the propagators,\nwhich makes these cases suitable for state tomography. This twin setup comes\nalong with the advantage that it reduces the error $\\epsilon$ of each\nindividual pulse down to $4\\epsilon^2$ overall. Therefore, the proposed\ntechnique combines the benefits of robustness stemming from adiabatic evolution\nwith accuracy generated by the twin-pulse error suppression, and flexibility of\nthe superposition state controlled by the phase jump $\\phi$. In addition, we\npresent a simple exactly soluble trigonometric model in order to illustrate the\nproposed technique. In this model, when the pulse area $A$ increases the\nnonadiabatic oscillations are damped as $A^{-1}$ for a single pulse and\n$A^{-2}$ for the two-pulse sequence.

QPT is a major quantum information processing tool,\nsince it especially allows one to characterize the actual behavior of quantum\ngates, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. However, usual QPT\nprocedures are complicated, since they set several constraints on the quantum\nstates used as inputs of the process to be characterized. In this paper, we\nextend QPT so as to avoid two such constraints. On the one hand, usual QPT\nmethods requires one to know, hence to precisely control (i.e. prepare), the\nspecific quantum states used as inputs of the considered quantum process, which\nis cumbersome. We therefore propose a Blind, or unsupervised, extension of QPT\n(i.e. BQPT), which means that this approach uses input quantum states whose\nvalues are unknown and arbitrary, except that they are requested to meet some\ngeneral known properties (and this approach exploits the output states of the\nconsidered quantum process). On the other hand, usual QPT methods require one\nto be able to prepare many copies of the same (known) input state, which is\nconstraining.

We present a detailed discussion and theoretical\ncharacterization of the present approach. We simulate the molecular signal\nexperimentally using a single atomic ion indicating that different rovibronic\nmolecular states can be resolved and individually detected with our method. The\npresent approach for the coherent control and non-destructive detection of the\nquantum state of a single molecular ion opens up new perspectives for precision\nspectroscopies relevant for, e.g., tests of fundamental physical theories and\nthe development of new types of clocks based on molecular vibrational\ntransitions. It will also enable the observation and control of chemical\nreactions of single particles on the quantum level. While focusing on N$_2^+$\nas a prototypical example in the present work, our method is applicable to a\nwide range of diatomic and polyatomic molecules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 11:20:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Meir", "Ziv", ""], ["Hegi", "Gregor", ""], ["Najafian", "Kaveh", ""], ["Sinhal", "Mudit", ""], ["Willitsch", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.10298", "submitter": "Arnau Rios", "authors": "Marina Pons, Bruno Juli\\'a-D\\'iaz, Arnau Rios, Isaac Vida\\~na and\n  Artur Polls", "title": "The Hellmann-Feynman theorem at finite temperature", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures.

We use qubit-qubit\ncrosstalks (couplings) of IBM superconducting quantum processors to simulate\nTrotterized dynamics of spin clusters and then we compare the obtained results\nwith the results of conventional digital computation based on two-qubit gates\nfrom the universal set. The comparison shows that digital-analog approach\nsignificantly outperforms standard digital approach for this simulation\nproblem, despite of the fact that crosstalks in IBM quantum processors are\nsmall. We argue that the efficiency of digital-analog quantum computing can be\nimproved with the help of more specialized processors, so that they can be used\nto efficiently implement other quantum algorithms. This indicates the prospect\nof a digital-to-analog strategy for near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum\ncomputers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 06:51:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2020 08:24:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Babukhin", "D.

The relation is more\nvivid when we choose one of the observables in such a way that its eigen basis\nmatches with the basis in which the coherence is measured.

However, this\nunderstanding is far from complete and will require the development of new\ntools to quantify correlations in CFT.\n  This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product\nexpansion (OPE) blocks in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal\nfamily to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields in AdS which are\ndiffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered in\nthe maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In\nless symmetric states the duality must be modified. Working with excited states\nwithin AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis shows how the OPE block decomposes into\nmore fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields integrated over\nnon-minimal geodesics.\n  Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics of entanglement\nmeasures for general quantum systems.

Furthermore, the reliability of such methods is higher when the\nnature of short-ranged interactions need not be modeled explicitly. This may be\nnecessary for two reasons: (1) there are interactions that occur over a short\nrange that cannot be accurately modeled with a potential function and/or (2)\nthe entire Hamiltonian loses its reliability when applied at short distances.\nThis work is an investigation of the utility and consequences of omitting a\nfinite region of space from quantum mechanical analysis, accomplished by\nimposition of an artificial boundary behind which obscured short-ranged\nphysical effects may operate. With this method, a free function of integration\nthat depends on momentum is interpreted as a function encoding information\nneeded to match a long-distance wavefunction to an appropriate state function\non the other side of the boundary. Omitting part of the space from analysis\nimplies that the strict unitarity requirement of quantum mechanics must be\nrelaxed, since particles can actually propagate beyond the boundary. Strict\northogonality of eigenmodes and hermiticity of the Hamiltonian must also be\nrelaxed in this method; however, all of these canonical relations are obeyed\nwhen averaged over sufficiently long times. What is achieved, therefore,\nappears to be an effective long-wavelength theory, at least for stationary\nsystems. As examples, the quantum defect theory of the one-dimensional Coulomb\ninteraction is recovered, as well as a new perspective of the inverse-square\npotential and the free particle, as well as the Wigner time delay associated\nwith contact interactions.
