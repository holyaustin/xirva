If we allow plugging input and\noutput wires together, we can intuitively represent complex compositions of\nprocesses, formalised as morphisms in a monoidal category.\n  [...] The first major contribution of this dissertation is the introduction\nof a discretised version of a string diagram called a string graph. String\ngraphs form a partial adhesive category, so they can be manipulated using\ndouble-pushout graph rewriting. Furthermore, we show how string graphs modulo a\nrewrite system can be used to construct free symmetric traced and compact\nclosed categories on a monoidal signature.\n  The second contribution is in the application of graphical languages to\nquantum information theory. We use a mixture of diagrammatic and algebraic\ntechniques to prove a new classification result for strongly complementary\nobservables. [...] We also introduce a graphical language for multipartite\nentanglement and illustrate a simple graphical axiom that distinguishes the two\nmaximally-entangled tripartite qubit states: GHZ and W. [...]\n  The third contribution is a description of two software tools developed in\npart by the author to implement much of the theoretical content described here.\nThe first tool is Quantomatic, a desktop application for building string graphs\nand graphical theories, as well as performing automated graph rewriting\nvisually. The second is QuantoCoSy, which performs fully automated,\nmodel-driven theory creation using a procedure called conjecture synthesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 14:45:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 10:57:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kissinger", "Aleks", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.0211", "submitter": "Waldemar K{\\l}obus", "authors": "Waldemar K{\\l}obus, Wies{\\l}aw Laskowski, Marcin Markiewicz, Andrzej\n  Grudka", "title": "Nonlocality activation in entanglement swapping chains", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We study\nimplications of this bound, provide new examples of entanglement distribution\nvia unentangled states and put further limits on this phenomenon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 18:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 16:54:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 08:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chuan", "T.

The established theory of tunneling two state systems (TTLS) in\nits original form (i.e. without extra fitting functions and parameters), is\nunable to explain this universality. While the TTLS model can be modified,\nparticularly by including long range phonon induced interactions to explain the\nuniversal value of Q, (a) it is not clear that the essential features of the\noriginal model that has been successful in explaining the experimental data is\npreserved, and (b) even if it is, it is not clear that the postulates of the\noriginal model remain necessary. The purpose of this study is to derive the\nuniversal acoustic absorption and related quantities observed in disordered\nsolids by starting from a many-body quantum theory of unspecified amorphous\nblocks that mutually interact through the strain field. Based on very generic\nassumptions and having no adjustable fitting parameters, the frequency and\ninitial state averaged macroscopic attenuation of a group of interacting\ndisordered blocks is calculated in the low temperature regime by a novel \"trace\nmethod\", which then is iterated up-to experimental length scales through a real\nspace renormalization group approach. Then using a heuristic second-order\nperturbation argument, the frequency dependence of Q is found, and combined\nwith the previous result to yield the observed universal values in the MHz-Ghz\nrange of frequencies. It is concluded that strong microscopic postulates are\nnot necessary in order to explain the thermal conductivity, velocity shift and\nsound attenuation of disordered media in the low temperature regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 19:04:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Vural", "Dervis Can", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1285", "submitter": "Asaf Paris-Mandoki", "authors": "Asaf Paris-Mandoki, Roc\\'io J\\'auregui", "title": "Analytical results for the Morse potential in s-wave ultracold\n  scattering: three dimensional vs. one dimensional problem", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Taking advantage of the known analytic expression of the eigenfunctions and\neigenenergies of the Morse Hamiltonian, explicit expressions are found for the\nscattering length $a$ and the effective range $r_e$ which determine the s-wave\nscattering of ultracold atoms.

Despite the\nhuge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual\nanswer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how\nthey may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell\ninequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for\na very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual\nprinciple, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our\nnotion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell\ninequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It\napplies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers\nnot only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly\napplied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There\nis much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach\ndirectly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very\ngeneral notion of contextuality.\n  There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without\ninequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a\nsense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On\nthe hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach\nreconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be\nconverted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable\nviolations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality\nexhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown\nto lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 23:23:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 09:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2012 00:11:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:37:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 22:31:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 16:32:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Abramsky", "Samson", ""], ["Hardy", "Lucien", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1364", "submitter": "Dragomir Z.

In the\nfully quantized formalism the chirality density is promoted to operator status,\nwhose exploration with reference to an arbitrary polarization basis reveals\nrelationships to optical angular momentum and helicity operators. Analyzing\nmulti-mode beams with complex wave-front structures, notably Laguerre-Gaussian\nmodes, affords a deeper understanding of the interplay between optical\nchirality and optical angular momentum. By developing theory with due\ncognizance of the photonic character of light, it emerges that only the spin\nangular momentum of light is engaged in such observations. Furthermore, it is\nshown that these prominent measures of the helicity of chiral electromagnetic\nradiation have a common basis, in differences between the populations of\noptical modes associated with angular momenta of opposite sign. Using a\ncalculation of the rate of circular dichroism as an example, with coherent\nstates to model the electromagnetic field, it is discovered that two terms\ncontribute to the differential effect. The primary contribution relates to the\ndifference in left- and right- handed photon populations; the only other\ncontribution, which displays a sinusoidal distance-dependence, corresponding to\nthe claim of nodal enhancements, is connected with the quantum photon\nnumber-phase uncertainty relation.

To support this theory, we present experimental results\nshowing one particular asymmetric entanglement where a 0.78/0.22 beamsplitter\nis optimal for observing entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2012 03:20:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Wagner", "Katherine", ""], ["Janousek", "Jiri", ""], ["Armstrong", "Seiji", ""], ["Morizur", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Lam", "Ping Koy", ""], ["Bachor", "Hans-Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1999", "submitter": "Gavin K.

Our scheme is\nbased on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate\npolynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the \"black-box\" version\nof our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is\nunconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative\nto a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in\nWiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the\nbank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in\nWiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that\nallows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if\nthe counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is\nsimpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based\nscheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the\nstandard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition\nfor quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables.

Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution\nfunction is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables.\nExperimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving\nthe six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right\nGrassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is\nequivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.\n  The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique)\npositive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic\noperators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also\nunusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are\nused to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new\nbosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled\nequations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical\nGrassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz\nfrom a 1980 paper by Stenholm.

We prove that it is not possible for the\nprover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the\nprotocol multiple times in parallel.\n  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,\nwinning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability\nfor the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given\nthat the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered\nis $p$. A reasonable conjecture for the answer would be \\sum_{m \\geq k} {n\n\\choose m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m}, as that is the answer when it is optimal for the\nprover to act independently. This is known to be the correct answer when k=n,\nand also in the classical case. It is also correct in some generalizations of\nthe classical case that we will discuss later.

Our findings have exhibited several interesting features of\nthe non-perturbative regimes such as the chain-size independence, pulse\nstrength upper-bound, noncontinuous valid parameter regions, etc. Furthermore,\nwe find that our non-perturbative scheme is robust against randomness in model\nfabrication and time-dependent random noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2012 10:17:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhao-Ming", ""], ["Wu", "Lian-Ao", ""], ["Jing", "Jun", ""], ["Shao", "Bin", ""], ["Yu", "Ting", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.5408", "submitter": "Gang Chen", "authors": "Lixian Yu, Shiqun Zhu, Qifeng Liang, Gang Chen, and Suotang Jia", "title": "Analytical solutions for the Rabi model", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.86.015803", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.other", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Rabi model that describes the fundamental interaction between a two-level\nsystem with a quantized harmonic oscillator is one of the simplest and most\nubiquitous models in modern physics.

At high fields\nthe ground state is such that the electron is drawn to the interface, leaving\nthe donor practically ionized. Valley splitting at the interface occurs due to\nthe valley-orbit coupling, V_vo^I = |V_vo^I| e^{i theta}. At intermediate\nelectric fields, close to a characteristic shuttling field, the electron states\nmay constitute hybridized states with valley compositions different from the\ndonor and the interface ground states.

The degree of level\nrepulsion, thus the width of the anti-crossing gap, depends on the relative\nvalley compositions, which vary with |V_vo^I|, theta and the interface-donor\ndistance. We focus on the valley configurations of the states involved in the\ndonor-interface tunneling process, given by the anti-crossing of the three\nlowest eigenstates.
