For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity\nquantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental\nadvances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by\ntrapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been\nachieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground\nstate of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have\nbeen reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained\nan elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by\ncombining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This\nallows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the\nnew situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly\ncoupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned\ndeterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a\nsingle antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a\ncontrolled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the\nheating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the\ncoupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The\nspectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range\nof atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings\nexceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we\nattribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2007 02:14:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Oct 2007 13:20:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Colombe", "Yves", ""], ["Steinmetz", "Tilo", ""], ["Dubois", "Guilhem", ""], ["Linke", "Felix", ""], ["Hunger", "David", ""], ["Reichel", "Jakob", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1413", "submitter": "Azhar Iqbal", "authors": "Azhar Iqbal and Taksu Cheon (Kochi University of Technology)", "title": "Evolutionary stability in quantum games", "comments": "38 pages, 2 figures, contributed chapter to the book \"Quantum Aspects\n  of Life\" edited by D.

In addition to the\nexcitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a\nnon-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The\nmeasurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave\nmixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An\nimportant point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of\nmolecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming\nlaser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration\nlaser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are\nrecorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the\nconstant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of\nthe excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have\nsufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of\nthe same levels.

This is a state in which the energy density can be made\narbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one\ninstant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is\naccompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature\nwhich allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who\ninitially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter\nfluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in\ndetail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state\nin terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function\nbetween energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless\nminimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter\nanalysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.\nRemarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.\nMore specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region\nof space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy\ninto the region.

Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction\ntechniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on\nthe raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)\nsetting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of\ndifferent techniques are known and proven to work.\n  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the\nclassical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness\nextraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our\nresult allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the\nquantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to\nencrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure\nagainst a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum\nuncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure\nencryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show\nhow to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum\nattacker.

The latter describes the quantum dynamics of a tracer\nparticle in a dilute, ideal gas by means of a translation-covariant master\nequation. We discuss the type of approximations required to obtain the\ngeneralized form of the Caldeira-Leggett master equation, along with their\nphysical justification. Microscopic expressions for the diffusion and\nrelaxation coefficients are obtained by analyzing the limiting form of the\nequation in both the Schroedinger and the Heisenberg picture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2007 14:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Vacchini", "Bassano", ""], ["Hornberger", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4436", "submitter": "Jukka Kiukas", "authors": "J.

We\nshow that the high amplitude limit, when performed on the moment operators,\nactually determines uniquely the entire statistics of a rotated quadrature\namplitude of the signal field, thereby verifying the usual assumption that the\nhomodyne detection achieves a measurement of that observable. We also consider,\nin a general setting, the possibility of constructing a measurement of a single\nquantum observable from a sequence of observables by taking the limit on the\nlevel of moment operators of these observables. In this context, we show that\nunder some natural conditions (each of which is satisfied by the homodyne\ndetector example), the existence of the moment limits ensures that the\nunderlying probability measures converge weakly to the probability measure of\nthe limiting observable. The moment approach naturally requires that the\nobservables be determined by their moment operator sequences (which does not\nautomatically happen), and it turns out, in particular, that this is the case\nfor the balanced homodyne detector.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2007 15:05:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kiukas", "J.", ""], ["Lahti", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4438", "submitter": "J.
