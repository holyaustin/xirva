In all the cases examined, this goes along with\ninterleaving function evaluations with non-computational unitary\ntransformations that each time maximize the amount of information about Bob's\nchoice acquired by Alice with function evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jul 2011 18:25:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Sat, 18 Aug 2012 13:12:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 14:12:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2012 13:30:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2012 17:45:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 13:48:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 18:52:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 11:07:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 11:23:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 08:34:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2012 21:45:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 14:19:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 16:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Castagnoli", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.0952", "submitter": "Daniel Kabat", "authors": "Daniel Kabat and Dimitra Karabali", "title": "Thermal diffractive corrections to Casimir energies", "comments": "31 pages, 7 figures, LaTeX. v2: minor typos fixed, version to appear\n  in PRD", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevD.84.065029", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the interplay of thermal and diffractive effects in Casimir\nenergies.

After an\nintroduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years. A\nflexible and rather realistic model is introduced, describing the measurement\nof the $z$-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory\nsimulated by a Curie--Weiss magnet, including $N \\gg1$ spins weakly coupled to\na phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may\ntransit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with\nthe tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.\n  A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are\nfound, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal\nmeasurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of\nincompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the\nHamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix $D(t)$. On a longer\ntime scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state\n$D(t_{\\rm f})$ that involves correlations between the system and the\nindications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration.

The method simulates the overall effect on the condensate wave\nfunction in a given AI design using two separate elements. These are (1)\nmodeling the effect of a Bragg pulse on the wave function and (2) approximating\nthe evolution of the wave function during the intervals between the pulses. The\nactual sequence of these pulses and intervals is then followed to determine the\napproximate final wave function from which the interference pattern can be\ncalculated. The exact evolution between pulses is assumed to be governed by the\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation whose solution is approximated using a\nLagrangian Variational Method to facilitate rapid prototyping. The method\npresented here is an extension of an earlier one that was used to analyze the\nresults of an experiment [J.E. Simsarian, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2040\n(2000)], where the phase of a Bose-Einstein condensate was measured using a\nMach- Zehnder-type Bragg AI. We have developed both 1D and 3D versions of this\nmethod and we have determined their validity by comparing their predicted\ninterference patterns with those obtained by numerical integration of the 1D GP\nequation and with the results of the above experiment. We find excellent\nagreement between the 1D interference patterns predicted by this method and\nthose found by the GP equation. We show that we can reproduce all of the\nresults of that experiment without recourse to an ad hoc velocity-kick\ncorrection needed by the earlier method, including some experimental results\nthat the earlier model did not predict. We also found that this method provides\nestimates of 1D interference patterns at least four orders-of-magnitude faster\nthan direct numerical solution of the 1D GP equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2011 18:08:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jul 2011 17:09:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2011 17:01:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Benton", "Brandon", ""], ["Krygier", "Michael", ""], ["Heward", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Edwards", "Mark", ""], ["Clark", "Charles W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.2365", "submitter": "Naresh Sharma", "authors": "Smarajit Das, Naresh Sharma and Siddharth Muthukrishnan", "title": "On some special cases of the Entropy Photon-Number Inequality", "comments": "12 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of Theory of Quantum Computation, Communication, and\n  Cryptography (TQC), Tokyo, Japan, May 2012, vol. 7582, Lecture Notes in\n  Computer Science", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-35656-8_10", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the Entropy Photon-Number Inequality (EPnI) holds where one of\nthe input states is the vacuum state and for several candidates of the other\ninput state that includes the cases when the state has the eigenvectors as the\nnumber states and either has only two non-zero eigenvalues or has arbitrary\nnumber of non-zero eigenvalues but is a high entropy state.

Two different measures of\nthe impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed: the\nimpurity-entanglement-entropy S_{imp} and the negativity N. The first, S_{imp},\nis based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement-entropy in the\nabsence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present.\nThe other, N, is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the\nimpurity and the impurity itself.

In the case of optical\nmemories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic\nchannels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light\n(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of\nmemory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is\nstored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of\nchannels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of\ndata is realized by a process of \"parallel\" channel discrimination, where the\nentire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal\ncollective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum\nreading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits\nper cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the\nphysical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic\nchannels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean\ntotal number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a\nseparation between the quantum reading capacity and the maximum information\nrate achievable by classical transmitters, i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures\nof coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical transmitters\nthat are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the\nadvantages of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:00:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Pirandola", "Stefano", ""], ["Lupo", "Cosmo", ""], ["Giovannetti", "Vittorio", ""], ["Mancini", "Stefano", ""], ["Braunstein", "Samuel L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3502", "submitter": "Jonas Anderson", "authors": "Jonas T.

When the physical\nlength of the problem is of order or larger than lc, the quantum potential may\nhave a finite range of efficacy maintaining the non-local behavior on a\ndistance lL (named here \"quantum non-locality length\") depending both by the\nnoise amplitude and by the inter-particle strength of interaction. In the\ndeterministic limit (quantum mechanics) the model shows that the \"quantum\nnon-locality length\" lLalso becomes infinite. The QSHA unveils that in linear\nsystems fluctuations are not sufficient to break the quantum non-locality\nshowing that lL is infinite even if lc is finite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 08:33:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 07:05:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sat, 21 Sep 2013 09:18:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2012 08:25:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 May 2012 14:33:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 08:46:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 15:32:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2012 10:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2012 07:35:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 10:53:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 17:41:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chiarelli", "Piero", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4201", "submitter": "Zlatko Dimcovic", "authors": "Zlatko Dimcovic, Daniel Rockwell, Ian Milligan, Robert M.

Such theories\ncannot be tested until we have a handle on ordinary environmental decoherence\nprocesses. Here we show that the theory for insulating electronic spin systems\ncan make accurate predictions for environmental decoherence in molecular-based\nquantum magnets [5]. Experimental understanding of decoherence in molecular\nmagnets has been limited by short decoherence times, which make coherent spin\nmanipulation extremely difficult [6-9]. Here we reduce the decoherence by\napplying a strong magnetic field. The theory predicts the contributions to the\ndecoherence from phonons, nuclear spins, and intermolecular dipolar\ninteractions, for a single crystal of the Fe8 molecular magnet. In experiments\nwe find that the decoherence time varies strongly as a function of temperature\nand magnetic field. The theoretical predictions are fully verified\nexperimentally - there are no other visible decoherence sources.
