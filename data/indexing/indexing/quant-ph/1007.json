Results for both\ntwo mode condensates and the simpler single mode condensate case are presented.\nA hybrid phase space distribution functional method is used where the\ncondensate modes are described via a truncated Wigner representation, and the\nbasically unoccupied non-condensate modes are described via a positive P\nrepresentation. The Hamiltonian for the system is described in terms of quantum\nfield operators for the condensate and non-condensate modes. The functional\nFokker-Planck equation for the double phase space distribution functional is\nderived. Equivalent Ito stochastic equations for the condensate and\nnon-condensate fields that replace the field operators are obtained, and\nstochastic averages of products of these fields give the quantum correlation\nfunctions used to interpret interferometry experiments. The stochastic field\nequations are the sum of a deterministic term obtained from the drift vector in\nthe functional Fokker-Planck equation, and a noise field whose stochastic\nproperties are determined from the diffusion matrix in the functional\nFokker-Planck equation. The noise field stochastic properties are similar to\nthose for Gaussian-Markov processes in that the stochastic averages of odd\nnumbers of noise fields are zero and those for even numbers of noise field\nterms are sums of products of stochastic averages associated with pairs of\nnoise fields. However each pair is represented by an element of the diffusion\nmatrix rather than products of the noise fields themselves. The treatment\nstarts from a generalised mean field theory for two condensate mode. The\ngeneralized mean field theory solutions are needed for calculations using the\nIto stochastic field equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 08:30:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2010 15:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 01:45:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Dalton", "B.

We advance a natural\nconjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator\n[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is\nessentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of\nthe standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a\nquestion that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature\n[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture\nimplies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This\nentails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by\nsmall quantum circuits, whose row-supports are \"nearly-disjoint.\" (2) We give a\nsimple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any\nefficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can\nbe distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum\nalgorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a\nproblem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired\noracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's \"GLN conjecture\" [A10] implies our\nconjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture\nwas recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open\nfor depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an\noracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open\nproblem.

Appreciating significance of the challenging problem of the\nclassical turbulence it can be expressed that the idea to study it in terms of\nquantized line is indeed very important and may be regarded as a breakthrough.\nFor this reason, this theory should be carefully scrutinized. One of the basic\narguments supporting this point of view is the fact that vortex tangle decays\nat zero temperature, when the apparent mechanism of dissipation (mutual\nfriction) is absent. Since the all possible mechanisms of dissipation of the\nvortex energy, discussed in the literature, are related to the small scales, it\nis natural to suggest that the Kolmogorov cascade takes the place with the flow\nof the energy, just as in the classical turbulence. In a series of recent\nexperiment attenuation of vortex line density was observed and authors\nattribute this decay to the properties of the Kolmogorov turbulence. In the\npresent work we discuss alternative possibility of decay of the vortex tangle,\nwhich is not related to dissipation at small scales. This mechanism is just the\ndiffusive like spreading of the vortex tangle. We discuss a number of the key\nexperiments, considering them both from the point of view of alternative\nexplanation and of the theory of Kolmogorov turbulence in quantum fluids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2010 08:32:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nemirovskii", "Sergey K.", ""], ["Kondaurova", "L.

A\nprominent example observed in atomic three-level-systems is the phenomenon of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), in which a control laser\ninduces a narrow spectral transparency window for a weak probe laser beam. The\nconcomitant rapid variation of the refractive index in this spectral window can\ngive rise to dramatic reduction of the group velocity of a propagating pulse of\nprobe light. Dynamic control of EIT via the control laser enables even a\ncomplete stop, that is, storage, of probe light pulses in the atomic medium.\nHere, we demonstrate optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT)--formally\nequivalent to EIT--in a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved\nsideband regime. A control laser tuned to the lower motional sideband of the\ncavity resonance induces a dipole-like interaction of optical and mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. Under these conditions, the destructive interference of\nexcitation pathways for an intracavity probe field gives rise to a window of\ntransparency when a two-photon resonance condition is met. As a salient feature\nof EIT, the power of the control laser determines the width and depth of the\nprobe transparency window. OMIT could therefore provide a new approach for\ndelaying, slowing and storing light pulses in long-lived mechanical excitations\nof optomechanical systems, whose optical and mechanical properties can be\ntailored in almost arbitrary ways in the micro- and nano-optomechanical\nplatforms developed to date.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 16:05:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Weis", "S.", ""], ["Riviere", "R.", ""], ["Deleglise", "S.", ""], ["Gavartin", "E.", ""], ["Arcizet", "O.", ""], ["Schliesser", "A.", ""], ["Kippenberg", "T.

In cavities having\nmultiple degenerate modes, the quasi-continuum of possible lattice\narrangements, and the continuous symmetry breaking associated with the adoption\nof a particular lattice arrangement, give rise to phenomena such as phonons,\ndefects, and frustration, which have hitherto been unexplored in ultracold\natomic settings involving neutral atoms. The present work develops a\nnonequilibrium field-theoretic approach to explore the self-organization of a\nBEC in a pumped, lossy optical cavity. We find that the transition is well\ndescribed, in the regime of primary interest, by an effective equilibrium\ntheory. At nonzero temperatures, the self-organization occurs via a\nfluctuation-driven first-order phase transition of the Brazovskii class; this\ntransition persists to zero temperature, and crosses over into a quantum phase\ntransition of a new universality class. We make further use of our\nfield-theoretic description to investigate the role of nonequilibrium\nfluctuations on the self-organization transition, as well as to explore the\nnucleation of ordered-phase droplets, the nature and energetics of topological\ndefects, supersolidity in the ordered phase, and the possibility of frustration\ncontrolled by the cavity geometry. In addition, we discuss the range of\nexperimental parameters for which we expect the phenomena described here to be\nobservable, along with possible schemes for detecting ordering and fluctuations\nvia either atomic correlations or the correlations of the light emitted from\nthe cavity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2010 15:21:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2010 15:13:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Sarang", ""], ["Lev", "Benjamin L.", ""], ["Goldbart", "Paul M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0951", "submitter": "Leandro Aolita", "authors": "Leandro Aolita, Augusto J.

Because\nthe magnitude of the resonance peaks depend sensitively on the low frequency\ndissipation of the cavity metal, experiments in this set-up could be a critical\ntest of the disputed thermal correction to the Casimir force between metal\nplates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jul 2010 07:11:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ellingsen", "Simen \u00c5.", ""], ["Buhmann", "Stefan Yoshi", ""], ["Scheel", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1089", "submitter": "Robert Alicki", "authors": "Robert Alicki", "title": "Quantum memories and Landauer's principle", "comments": "10 pages, no figures, lecture given at 46 School of Theoretical\n  Physics, Ladek, Poland, February 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1142/9789814317443_0001", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two types of arguments concerning (im)possibility of constructing a scalable,\nexponentially stable quantum memory equipped with Hamiltonian controls are\ndiscussed.

The same models,\nbased on the linear Schrodinger equation with time-dependent trapping\npotentials, apply to the description of optical planar systems designed for the\nswitching of trapped light beams. The analysis is carried out in the analytical\nform, using exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation.

We also analyze effects entailed by the application of a kick to a bound\nparticle, the most interesting one being a kick-induced transition between the\nDWP's ground and excited states. In the latter case, the largest transition\nprobability is achieved at particular strength of the kick.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2010 20:22:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sonkin", "Eduard", ""], ["Malomed", "Boris A.", ""], ["Granot", "Er'el", ""], ["Marchewka", "Avi", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.2441", "submitter": "Majid Ghojavand", "authors": "Majid Ghojavand, Mohammad Ali Jafarizadeh, Shahin Rouhani", "title": "Generating maximally entangled distant pair in invariant stratification\n  spin networks", "comments": "14 pages 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2010/12/P12023", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the generation of Bell states between distant vertices\nin a permanently coupled quantum spin network, interacting via invariant\nstratification graphs.

We conclude that the\nreference site can generate a Bell state with a vertex if the corresponding\nupper bound of the vertex is 1 e-bit. Thus for generation of a Bell state this\nupper bound must be saturated. Taking this into account, we obtain the\ncharacteristic constraint of the proper graphs. We introduce a special class of\nantipodal invariant stratification graphs, which is called reflective, whereas\nthe antipode vertex obeys the characteristic constraint. We also show that the\nantipodal association scheme graphs are reflective so Bell states can be\ngenerated between the antipodal vertices.

We study a class of photonic circuits comprising: 1) a\nnonlinear periodically poled two-mode waveguide structure, 2) a set of\nsingle-mode and two-mode waveguide-based couplers arranged in such a way that\nthey suitably separate the three photons comprising the SPDC process, and, for\nsome applications, 3) a holographic Bragg grating that acts as a dichroic\nreflector. The first circuit produces frequency-degenerate down-converted\nphotons, each with even spatial parity, in two separate single-mode waveguides.\nChanging the parameters of the elements allows this same circuit to produce two\nnondegenerate down-converted photons that are entangled in frequency or\nsimultaneously entangled in frequency and polarization. The second photonic\ncircuit is designed to produce modal entanglement by distinguishing the photons\non the basis of their frequencies. A modified version of this circuit can be\nused to generate photons that are doubly entangled in mode number and\npolarization. The third photonic circuit is designed to manage dispersion by\nconverting modal, spectral, and polarization entanglement into path\nentanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jul 2010 18:54:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 12:38:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Sep 2010 10:55:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Saleh", "Mohammed F.", ""], ["Di Giuseppe", "Giovanni", ""], ["Saleh", "Bahaa E.

We use this approach to develop\nalternative methods of classical simulation that have strong connections to the\nstudy of non-local correlations: we construct noisy quantum computers that\nadmit operations outside the Clifford set and can generate some forms of\nmultiparty quantum entanglement, but are otherwise classical in that they can\nbe efficiently simulated classically and cannot generate non-local statistics.\nAlthough the approach provides new regimes of noisy quantum evolution that can\nbe efficiently simulated classically, it does not appear to lead to significant\nreductions of existing upper bounds to fault tolerance thresholds for common\nnoise models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2010 15:52:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:03:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ratanje", "N.", ""], ["Virmani", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.3462", "submitter": "Kimball A.

In order for the\nquantum game to reduce properly to the classical game, we require legal quantum\nmoves to be orthogonal to all previous moves. We also admit interference\neffects, by squaring the sum of amplitudes over all moves by a player to\ncompute his or her occupation level of a given site. A player wins when the\nsums of occupations along any of the eight straight lines we can draw in the $3\n\\times 3$ grid is greater than three. We play the quantum tic-tac-toe first\nrandomly, and then deterministically, to explore the impact different opening\nmoves, end games, and different combinations of offensive and defensive\nstrategies have on the outcome of the game. In contrast to the classical\ntic-tac-toe, the deterministic quantum game does not always end in a draw. In\ncontrast also to most classical two-player games of no chance, it is possible\nfor Player 2 to win. More interestingly, we find that Player 1 enjoys an\noverwhelming quantum advantage when he opens with a quantum move, but loses\nthis advantage when he opens with a classical move. We also find the quantum\nblocking move, which consists of a weighted superposition of moves that the\nopponent could use to win the game, to be very effective in denying the\nopponent his or her victory.

In this way\nthe elements of the density matrix can be linearly related to a set of measured\nquantities.

In the\nIHB case, we find that when the two IHBs have the same temperatures, the two\ncoupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be thermalized with the same\ntemperature as those of the IHBs. However, in the case of two IHBs at different\ntemperatures, just when the energy detuning between the two TLSs satisfies a\nspecial condition, the two coupled TLSs in eigenstate representation can be\nthermalized with an immediate temperature between those of the two IHBs.

The most widespread technique for creating these quantum\nresources is the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of laser light\ninto photon pairs. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known\nas phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations which are used to produce\ntwo-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom. It has been a\nlongstanding goal of the quantum optics community to realise a source that can\nproduce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches\nconsidered, none have been technically feasible. In this paper we report the\nobservation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Here each\ntriplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum\ncorrelations will extend over all three photons in a way not achievable with\nindependently created photon pairs. We expect our photon-triplet source to open\nup new avenues of quantum optics and become an important tool in quantum\ntechnologies. Our source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum\ncorrelations, the post-selection free generation of tripartite entanglement\nwithout post- selection and the generation of heralded entangled-photon pairs\nsuitable for linear optical quantum computing. Two of the triplet photons have\na wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, ideally suited\nfor three-party quantum communication.

These two forces drive a range of exotic phases\nincluding spin liquids, valence bond crystals, pseudogapped metals, and\nunconventional superconductivity. Of particular interest is that in several\nmaterials there is a direct transition as a function of pressure from a spin\nliquid Mott insulating state to a superconducting state. Experiments on these\nmaterials raise a number of profound questions about the quantum behaviour of\nfrustrated systems, particularly the intimate connection between spin liquids\nand superconductivity. Insights into these questions have come from a wide\nrange of theoretical techniques including first principles electronic\nstructure, quantum many-body theory and quantum field theory. In this review we\nintroduce the basic ideas of the field by discussing a simple frustrated\nHeisenberg model with four spins. We then describe the key experimental\nresults, emphasizing that for two materials, k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu_2(CN)_3 and\nEtMe_3Sb[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, there is strong evidence for a spin liquid ground\nstate, and for EtMe_3P[Pd(dmit)_2]_2, a valence bond solid ground state. We\nreview theoretical attempts to explain these phenomena, arguing that this can\nbe captured by a Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice at half\nfilling, and that resonating valence bond wavefunctions can capture most of the\nessential physics. We review evidence that this model can have a spin liquid\nground state for a range of parameters that are realistic for the relevant\nmaterials. We conclude by summarising the progress made thus far and\nidentifying some of the key questions still to be answered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jul 2010 07:19:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Jan 2011 02:54:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Powell", "B.
