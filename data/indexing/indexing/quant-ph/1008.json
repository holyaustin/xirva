We prove that a six-qubit code without\nentanglement assistance cannot simultaneously possess a Calderbank-Shor-Steane\n(CSS) stabilizer and correct an arbitrary single-qubit error. A corollary of\nthis result is that the Steane seven-qubit code is the smallest single-error\ncorrecting CSS code.

We argue that an infinite space actually renders the Born rule\nredundant, by physically realizing all outcomes of a quantum measurement in\ndifferent regions, with relative frequencies given by the square of the wave\nfunction amplitudes. Our formal argument hinges on properties of what we term\nthe quantum confusion operator, which projects onto the Hilbert subspace where\nthe Born rule fails, and we comment on its relation to the oft-discussed\nquantum frequency operator. This analysis unifies the classical and quantum\nlevels of parallel universes that have been discussed in the literature, and\nhas implications for several issues in quantum measurement theory.

Using\ndetailed atomistic modeling, we investigate CTAP in a more realistic triple\ndonor system in the presence of inevitable fabrication imperfections. In\nparticular, we investigate how an adiabatic pathway for CTAP is affected by\ndonor misplacements, and propose schemes to correct for such errors.

Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time. However, as\nthe pulse spacing becomes shorter than the bath correlation time, an optimum is\nreached. For even shorter delays, the pulse imperfections dominate over the\ndecoherence losses and cause the quantum state to decay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Aug 2010 18:01:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Sep 2010 11:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Alvarez", "Gonzalo A.", ""], ["Ajoy", "Ashok", ""], ["Peng", "Xinhua", ""], ["Suter", "Dieter", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1985", "submitter": "Jorge Casanova", "authors": "N.

This enables us to introduce the notion of\nquantum object. 2) Classical systems are defined as macroscopic quantum objects\nin states close to maximum entropy. For classical mechanics, new states of such\nkind are introduced, the so-called maximum-entropy packets, and shown to\napproximate classical dynamics better than Gaussian wave packets. 3) A new\nsolution of quantum measurement problem is proposed for measurements that are\nperformed on microsystems. First, it is assumed that readings of registration\napparatuses are always signals from detectors. This implies restrictions on\nwhat is observable. Second, an application of the cluster separability\nprinciple leads to the key notion of the paper: the separation status of\nmicrosystems. The processes of preparation and registration include changes of\nseparation status. A crucial observation is that standard quantum mechanics\ndoes not prescribe the evolution during such changes.

In this article we show that\nthe dynamics in the presence of coupling to the cavity mode can be described\nsolely by a modified time evolution of the wave numbers. In particular, we show\nthat collective excitations with a well- defined wave number pass without\ndispersion from negative to positive valued wave numbers without populating the\nzero wave number spin wave mode.
