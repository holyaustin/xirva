By introducing a bipartite system using a lattice model of scalar\nfield, we apply the separability criterion based on the partial transpose\noperation and numerically calculate the bipartite entanglement between separate\nspatial regions. We find that the initial entangled state becomes separable or\ndis-entangled when the size of the spatial regions exceed the Hubble horizon.\nThis is necessary condition for the appearance of classicality of the quantum\nfluctuation. We further investigate the condition for the appearance of the\nclassical distribution function and find that the condition is given by the\ninequality for the symplectic eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the scalar\nfield.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 May 2008 12:21:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 May 2008 10:23:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2008 03:30:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nambu", "Yasusada", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.1484", "submitter": "Cheuk-Yin Wong", "authors": "Li-Li Yu (1), Wei-Ning Zhang (2), and Cheuk-Yin Wong (3), (1, Harbin\n  Inst Tech, China; 2, Dalian Univ Tech, China; 3, ORNL, USA)", "title": "HBT interferometry with quantum transport of the interfering pair", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.Rev.C78:014908,2008", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevC.78.014908", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-ph nucl-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the late stage of the evolution of a pion system in high-energy heavy-ion\ncollisions when pions undergo multiple scatterings, the quantum transport of\nthe interfering pair of identical pions plays an important role in determining\nthe characteristics of the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interference.

The crucial role is\nplayed in this by the Bohr's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most\ncomplete description possible for an even individual system. The alternative of\nintroducing extra dynamical variables, called hidden variables, in addition to\nthe wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the\ndesirable features of classical physics, is then explored. The first such\nsuccessful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic\ninterpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal\ndescription as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus\ndifferently. We begin with the construction of the Bohm's theory. He introduces\nparticle positions as the hidden variables. The particle positions play a\nspecial role in Bohm theory. The particle trajectories are guided by the\nwavefunction. The Bohm theory is deterministic. The probability enters through\na special assumption, ``quantum equilibrium'' hypothesis, for the initial\nconditions on the ensemble of particle trajectories. The ``wave or particle''\ndilemma is resolved by a ``wave and particle'' resolution. The measurements in\nBohm theory can be described without mysticism.

The notion of a spin system is broadly conceived, in order to\nencompass macroscopic test masses as the limiting case of large-j spins.

The resulting simulation\nformalism is used to construct a positive P-representation for the thermal\ndensity matrix. Single-spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy\n(MRFM) is simulated, and the data statistics are shown to be those of a random\ntelegraph signal with additive white noise. Larger-scale spin-dust models are\nsimulated, having no spatial symmetry and no spatial ordering; the\nhigh-fidelity projection of numerically computed quantum trajectories onto\nlow-dimensionality Kahler state-space manifolds is demonstrated.

A spin-off from\nour work is a contribution to the PEC literature: we obtain a useful\nalternative expression for the PEC Casimir piston in 3+1 dimensions and also\nevaluate the Casimir force per unit area on an infinite strip, a geometry of\nexperimental interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2008 02:39:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Edery", "A.", ""], ["Marachevsky", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4045", "submitter": "Lea Santos", "authors": "L.

Moreover, we\ninvestigate the dependence of the block entanglement on the choice of the modes\nforming the block and on the ODLRO; consequently we determine the multipartite\ncontent of the entanglement through the evaluation of the generalized \"Meyer\nWallach\" measure in the direct and reciprocal lattice. The determination of the\npersistency of entanglement shows how the network of correlations depicted\nexhibits a self-similar structure which is robust with respect to \"local\"\nmeasurements.
