Earlier, it was shown\nthat every combinatorial graph corresponds to quantum states whose\ncharacteristics are reflected in the structure of the underlined graph. A\nnumber of combinatorial relations between quantum discord and simple graphs\nwere studied. To extend the scope of these studies, we need to generalize the\nearlier concepts applicable to simple graphs to weighted graphs, corresponding\nto a diverse class of quantum states. To this effect, we determine the class of\nquantum states whose density matrix representation can be derived from graph\nLaplacian matrices associated with a weighted directed graph and call them\ngraph Laplacian quantum states. We find the graph-theoretic conditions for zero\nand non-zero quantum discord for these states.

This question has recently taken on a new urgency with the rise of\nsuperconducting circuits in quantum computing, circuit quantum electrodynamics,\nmagnetometry, electrometry and metrology. Superconducting circuits made from\naluminium or niobium are fundamentally limited by losses due to two-level\ndefects within the amorphous oxide layers encasing them. On the other hand,\nthese circuits also provide a novel and effective method for studying the very\ndefects which limit their operation. We can now go beyond ensemble measurements\nand probe individual defects -- observing the quantum nature of their dynamics\nand studying their formation, their behaviour as a function of applied field,\nstrain, temperature and other properties. This article reviews the plethora of\nrecent experimental results in this area and discusses the various theoretical\nmodels which have been used to describe the observations.

To that end,\na new multi-objective optimization algorithm is developed to find an optimal\nspectral phase of an ultrafast laser pulse, which is capable of eliminating all\npossible nonlinear optical responses while maximizing the probability of\nsingle-photon absorption between quantum states. This work not only deepens our\nunderstanding of light-matter interactions, but also offers a new way to study\nphotophysical and photochemical processes in the \"absence\" of nonlinear optical\neffects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 06:34:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shu", "Chuan-Cun", ""], ["Dong", "Daoyi", ""], ["Petersen", "Ian R.", ""], ["Henriksen", "Niels E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.02137", "submitter": "Lev Vaidman", "authors": "Lev Vaidman", "title": "A Comment on \"Paradox of photons disconnected trajectories being located\n  by means of 'weak measurements' in the nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer\"", "comments": "To be published in JETP", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1134/S0021364017070037", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The criticism of the experiment showing discontinuous traces of photons\npassing through a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer is shown to be unfounded.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 09:02:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Vaidman", "Lev", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.02165", "submitter": "Hexi Shi", "authors": "C.

We\nperform chip-to-chip indium bonding in vacuum at $190^{\\circ}C$ with indium\nfilm thicknesses of $150 nm$. We characterize the dc and microwave performance\nof bonded devices at room and cryogenic temperatures. At $10 mK$, we find a dc\nbond resistance of $515 n{\\Omega}mm^2$. Additionally, we show minimal microwave\nreflections and good transmission up to $6.8 GHz$ in a tunnel-capped, bonded\ndevice as compared to a similar uncapped device. As a proof of concept, we\nfabricate and measure a set of tunnel-capped superconducting resonators,\ndemonstrating that our bonding technology can be used in quantum computing\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 May 2017 02:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["McRae", "C.

However, in these systems the study of\nthe so called excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have not\nreceived so much attention.\n  Purpose: A quantum analysis of the ESQPTs in the two-fluid Lipkin model is\npresented in this work. The study is performed through the Hamiltonian\ndiagonalization for selected values of the control parameters in order to cover\nthe most interesting regions of the system phase diagram. [Method:] A\nHamiltonian that resembles the consistent-Q Hamiltonian of the interacting\nboson model (IBM) is diagonalized for selected values of the parameters and\nproperties such as the density of states, the Peres lattices, the\nnearest-neighbor spacing distribution, and the participation ratio are\nanalyzed.\n  Results: An overview of the spectrum of the two-fluid Lipkin model for\nselected positions in the phase diagram has been obtained. The location of the\nexcited-state quantum phase transition can be easily singled out with the Peres\nlattice, with the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution, with Poincar\\'e\nsections or with the participation ratio.\n  Conclusions: This study completes the analysis of QPTs for the two-fluid\nLipkin model, extending the previous study to excited states. The ESQPT\nsignatures in composed systems behave in the same way as in single ones,\nalthough the evidences of their presence can be sometimes blurred.

A brief review of the\nanalytical and sophisticated numerical methods required to tackle these systems\nis included.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 May 2017 04:30:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Noh", "Changsuk", ""], ["Clark", "Stephen R.", ""], ["Jaksch", "Dieter", ""], ["Angelakis", "Dimitris G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.04472", "submitter": "Lukas Slodicka", "authors": "Petr Ob\\v{s}il, Luk\\'a\\v{s} Lachman, Tuan Pham, Adam Le\\v{s}und\\'ak,\n  V.

Our theoretical\nanalysis and numerical calculations demonstrate that this squeeze-and-cool\nmechanism offers a quick technique for deeply cooling a macroscopic mechanical\nresonator to an unprecedented temperature region below the zero-point\nfluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 May 2017 09:04:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 May 2017 04:50:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:25:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Lin", ""], ["Yang", "Cheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Weiping", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.04985", "submitter": "Inanc Adagideli", "authors": "A.

The finite cavity electromagnetic decay rate can lead to either\namplification or cooling of the mechanical oscillator, and lead in particular\nto a parametric oscillatory instability, associated with regenerative\noscillations of the mechanical oscillator, an effect limiting the circulating\npower in laser gravitational wave interferometers. These effects implicitly\nrely on an electromagnetic cavity whose dissipation rate vastly exceeds that of\nthe mechanical oscillator, a condition naturally satisfied in most\noptomechanical systems. Here we consider the opposite limit, where the\nmechanical dissipation is engineered to dominate over the electromagnetic one,\nessentially reversing role of electromagnetic and mechanical degree of freedom.\nAs a result, the electromagnetic field is now subject to dynamical backaction:\nthe mechanical oscillator provides a feedback mechanism which modifies the\ndamping rate of the electromagnetic cavity.

We adopt a\nquantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback\ncontrol. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process\nplays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum\nmeasurement and post-selection must be considered in the backward process in\nsharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with\nquantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space\nof quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong\nirreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute\nirreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down.\nIn the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute\nirreversibility because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region\ncompatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems,\nabsolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective\nmeasurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically\nforbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of\nabsolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum\ncoherent driving.

However,\nunlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational\nproofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally\nestablish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal\nstructure.\n  Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone\nprocess, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using\nsoftware proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.\n  However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some\nscenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete\nstring diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not\nprecise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams.\n  The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for\nequational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is\namenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families\nof string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph\ngrammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using\nrewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents\nequational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families\nof string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free\ngraph grammars respectively.

If correct,\nthis is a spectacular impossibility theorem for hidden variable theories, which\nis more general than the theorems of Bell and Leggett. C&R's claim essentially\nmeans that in any hidden variable theory that is compatible with\nquantum-mechanical predictions, probabilities of measurement outcomes are\nindependent of these hidden variables. On closer inspection, however, the\ngenerality and validity of the claim can be contested. First, it is based on an\nassumption called 'Freedom of Choice'. As the name suggests, this assumption\ninvolves the independence of an experimenter's choice of measurement settings.\nBut in the way C&R define this assumption, a no-signalling condition is\nsurreptitiously presupposed, making the assumption less innocent than it\nsounds. When using this definition, any hidden variable theory violating\nParameter Independence, such as Bohmian Mechanics, is immediately shown to be\nincompatible with quantum-mechanical predictions. Also, the argument of C&R is\nhard to follow and their mathematical derivation contains several gaps, some of\nwhich cannot be closed in the way they suggest.

In such a setting, it\nis often useful to know the maximum amount of information that can be reliably\ntransmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the capacity per unit cost.

For each task, we define the corresponding capacity per\nunit cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity.\nFurthermore, for the special and natural case in which there is a zero-cost\nstate, we obtain expressions in terms of an optimized relative entropy\ninvolving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an\nexplicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the capacity per\nunit cost.

In 1+1D, we demonstrate that\nthe out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) satisfies a biased diffusion equation,\nwhich gives exact results for the spatial profile of the OTOC, and the\nbutterfly speed $v_{B}$. We find that in 1+1D the `front' of the OTOC broadens\ndiffusively, with a width scaling in time as $t^{1/2}$. We address fluctuations\nin the OTOC between different realizations of the random circuit, arguing that\nthey are negligible in comparison to the broadening of the front. Turning to\nhigher D, we show that the averaged OTOC can be understood exactly via a\nremarkable correspondence with a classical droplet growth problem. This implies\nthat the width of the front of the averaged OTOC scales as $t^{1/3}$ in 2+1D\nand $t^{0.24}$ in 3+1D (KPZ exponents). We support our analytic argument with\nsimulations in 2+1D.

Often the proof of this theorem is cited to be in Ref.\n[C. Caves, Phys. Rev. D 23, 1693 (1981)], but upon further inspection, no such\nclaim is made there. A quantum-Fisher-information-based argument suggestive of\nthis no-go theorem appears in Ref. [M. Lang and C. Caves, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n173601 (2013)], but is not stated in its full generality. Here we thoroughly\nexplore this no-go theorem and give the rigorous statement: the no-go theorem\nholds whenever the unknown phase shift is split between both arms of the\ninterferometer, but remarkably does not hold when only one arm has the unknown\nphase shift. In the latter scenario, we provide an explicit measurement\nstrategy that beats the SNL.

Our method is\nbased on spectroscopic interrogation of quantum defects in macroscopic\nsolid-state crystals . When a WIMP scatters in a crystal, the induced nuclear\nrecoil creates a tell-tale damage cluster, localized to within about 50 nm,\nwith an orientation to the damage trail that correlates well with the direction\nof the recoil and hence the incoming WIMP. This damage cluster induces strain\nin the crystal, shifting the energy levels of nearby quantum defects. These\nlevel shifts can be measured optically (or through paramagnetic resonance)\nmaking it possible to detect the strain environment around the defect in a\nsolid sample. As a specific example, we consider nitrogen vacancy centers in\ndiamond, for which high defect densities and nanoscale localization of\nindividual defects have been demonstrated. To localize the millimeter-scale\nregion of a nuclear recoil within the crystal due to a potential dark matter\nevent, we can use conventional WIMP detection techniques such as the collection\nof ionization/scintillation. Once an event is identified, the quantum defects\nin the vicinity of the event can be interrogated to map the strain environment,\nthus determining the direction of the recoil. In principle, this approach\nshould be able to identify the recoil direction with an efficiency greater than\n70% at a false positive rate less than 5% for 10 keV recoil energies. If\nsuccessful, this method would allow for directional detection of WIMP-induced\nnuclear recoils at solid state densities, enabling probes of WIMP parameter\nspace below the solar neutrino floor. This technique could also potentially be\napplied to identify the direction of particles such as neutrons whose low\nscattering cross-section requires detectors with a large target mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 May 2017 03:41:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Rajendran", "Surjeet", ""], ["Zobrist", "Nicholas", ""], ["Sushkov", "Alexander O.", ""], ["Walsworth", "Ronald", ""], ["Lukin", "Mikhail", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09768", "submitter": "Kouji Nakamura", "authors": "Kouji Nakamura and Masa-Katsu Fujimoto", "title": "Extension of the input-output relation for a Michelson interferometer to\n  arbitrary coherent-state light sources: --- Gravitational-wave detector and\n  weak-value amplification ---", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure; (v2) 17 pages, 1 figures, some explanations and\n  Sec.III.C are added, abstract is modified; (v3) style is changed: 35 page, 1\n  figure, some duplicated explanations are deleted;", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aop.2018.03.009", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph gr-qc", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An extension of the input-output relation for a conventional Michelson\ninterferometric gravitational-wave detector is carried out to treat an\narbitrary coherent state for the injected optical beam.

We also prove that the Clifford+T\nfragment of the ZX-Calculus represents exactly all the matrices over some\nfinite dimensional extension of the ring of dyadic rationals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 15:38:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Jeandel", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Perdrix", "Simon", ""], ["Vilmart", "Renaud", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.11153", "submitter": "Joao da Providencia", "authors": "Nat\\'alia Bebiano Jo\\~ao da Provid\\^encia and Jo\\~ao Pinheiro da\n  Provid\\^encia", "title": "Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics of bosonic operators", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The spectral analysis of a non-Hermitian unbounded operator appearing in\nquantum physics is our main concern.

Using tools\nfrom group theory and control theory, we classify, in each of these scenarios,\nwhat sets of gates are generated, if an additional gate is added to the set of\nallowed transformations.
