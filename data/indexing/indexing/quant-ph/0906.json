In this paper we\nanalyze the requirements for a classical processing system, designed\nspecifically for the topological cluster state model. We demonstrate that via\nextensive parallelization, the construction of a classical \"front-end\" system\ncapable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is\npossible today.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 03:50:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Sep 2009 05:40:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Devitt", "Simon J.", ""], ["Fowler", "Austin G.", ""], ["Tilma", "Todd", ""], ["Munro", "W.

This analogy opened for\npractical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived\ncorpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles\nPenrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined\nby a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity\ncancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope.

The corpuscle,\nincorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further\nstudy relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual\ncoupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.\nOne of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic\nexternal fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves\nhelically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have\none polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the\nconcept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 20:47:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ekholdt", "Roald", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.0599", "submitter": "Piotr Frackiewicz", "authors": "Piotr Frackiewicz", "title": "The Ultimate Solution to the Quantum Battle of the Sexes game", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/42/36/365305", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the unique solution to the Quantum Battle of the Sexes game.

The refrigerator is based on an Otto cycle where the working medium is an\ninteracting spin system with an energy gap.

In c=1 critical systems (Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids), we find that S_0 is\na simple function of the boson compactification radius. This finding is based\non a field-theoretical analysis of the Dyson-Gaudin gas related to dimer and\nCalogero-Sutherland models. We also performed numerical demonstrations in the\ndimer models and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain. In a massive (crystal) phase, S_0 is\nrelated to the ground-state degeneracy. We also examine this entropy in the\nIsing chain in a transverse field as an example showing a c=1/2 critical point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2009 16:09:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2009 15:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["St\u00e9phan", "Jean-Marie", ""], ["Furukawa", "Shunsuke", ""], ["Misguich", "Gr\u00e9goire", ""], ["Pasquier", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1163", "submitter": "Denis Sych", "authors": "Gerd Leuchs, Ruifang Dong, and Denis Sych", "title": "Triplet-like correlation symmetry of continuous variable entangled\n  states", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures.

A separate strand of the literature has\npursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time\napproximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random\nelement of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting\nmatrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several\nways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the\ncritical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore\nthe number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1\n+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be\nextended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study\nthe symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator\nhas small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only\ncase in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio\nexceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time\napproximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic\napproach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.\n  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express\nmatrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are\nrandom, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the\ntrace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random\npermutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a\nconnection with the character theory of the symmetric group.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2009 11:55:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "Cristopher", ""], ["Russell", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1711", "submitter": "Qing-Hu Chen", "authors": "Ke-Wei Sun and Qing-Hu Chen", "title": "Quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional compass model in a\n  transverse magnetic field", "comments": "8 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The suppression is achieved by altering the\ndynamics of an imperfect quantum memory with the help of a sequence of local\nunitary operations applied to the qudits. Whereas up to now the operations of\nsuch decoupling sequences have been constructed in a deterministic fashion,\nstrategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by\nrandom selection from a suitable set.

It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a\nquantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer\nmust (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution\nof the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and\n(4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria\nare met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss\nvarious existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this\nframework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards\nbuilding a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to\nhelp experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular\nphysical implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 13:14:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2010 15:52:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Perez-Delgado", "Carlos A.", ""], ["Kok", "Pieter", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.4362", "submitter": "Enrique Solano", "authors": "G.

Furthermore, even in the error-free case it is inefficient: its\ncommunication complexity is Theta(1/epsilon) when forcing the attacker's\ninformation below epsilon, even if only a single key bit is generated.\nPotentially, the problem can be solved by privacy amplification of relativistic\n- or non-signaling - secrecy.

Shuttling and separation\nof ion strings have been the foremost issues in linear-trap arrangements and\nsome prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion\nmotion to two dimensions (2D). While junctions require complex trap structures,\nsmall extensions to the 1D motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap\narrangements. Here, control of the extended field in a planar, linear chip trap\nis used to shuttle ions in 2D. With this approach, the order of ions in a\nstring is deterministically reversed. Optimized potentials are theoretically\nderived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out\nadiabatically. The control over individual ion positions in a linear trap\npresents a new tool for ion-trap quantum computing. The method is also expected\nto work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have\napplications for sympathetic cooling of an ion string.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2009 19:57:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2009 20:25:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2009 15:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Splatt", "F.", ""], ["Harlander", "M.", ""], ["Brownnutt", "M.", ""], ["Z\u00e4hringer", "F.", ""], ["Blatt", "R.", ""], ["H\u00e4nsel", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.5337", "submitter": "Shigeru Ajisaka", "authors": "S.
