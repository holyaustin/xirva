One can quantify the deviation from\nsuch a relation by introducing the internal energy shift as the difference\nbetween the internal energy of the system and the corresponding value for scale\ninvariant gases. We discuss general thermodynamic properties associated to the\nscale invariance, provide criteria for which the internal energy shift density\nis a bounded function of temperature. We then study the internal energy shift\nand deviations from the energy-pressure proportionality in low dimensional\nmodels of gases interpolating between the ideal Bose and the ideal Fermi gases,\nfocusing on the Lieb-Liniger model in 1d and on the anyonic gas in 2d. In 1d\nthe internal energy shift is determined from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz\nintegral equations and an explicit relation for it is given at high\ntemperature. Our results show that the internal energy shift is positive, it\nvanishes in the two limits of zero and infinite coupling (respectively the\nideal Bose and the Tonks Girardeau gas) and it has a maximum at a finite,\ntemperature depending, value of the coupling. Remarkably, at fixed coupling the\nenergy shift density saturates to a finite value for infinite temperature. In\n2d we consider systems of Abelian anyons and non Abelian Chern-Simons\nparticles: as it can be seen also directly from a study of the virial\ncoefficients, in the usually considered hard-core limit the internal energy\nshift vanishes and the energy is just proportional to the pressure, with the\nproportionality constant being simply the area of the system. Soft-core\nboundary conditions at coincident points for the two-body wavefunction\nintroduce a length scale, and induce a non-vanishing internal energy shift.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 20:00:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 13:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mancarella", "Francesco", ""], ["Mussardo", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Trombettoni", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0056", "submitter": "Matteo G.

On the other hand, the same problem is\ndecidable for nondeterministic QFAs on general alphabets.

To this end I apply Constructor\nTheory's new mode of explanation to provide an exact formulation of the\nappearance of design, of no-design laws, and of the logic of self-reproduction\nand natural selection, within fundamental physics. I conclude that\nself-reproduction, replication and natural selection are possible under\nno-design laws, the only non-trivial condition being that they allow digital\ninformation to be physically instantiated. This has an exact characterisation\nin the constructor theory of information. I also show that under no-design laws\nan accurate replicator requires the existence of a \"vehicle\" constituting,\ntogether with the replicator, a self-reproducer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 16:22:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 17:38:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Marletto", "Chiara", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0689", "submitter": "\\.Iskender Yal\\c{c}{\\i}nkaya", "authors": "\\.I.

This fact provides a motivation to study the ensemble of\nnon-hermitian unimodular matrices $A$, with all entries of the same modulus and\nrandom phases and the ensemble of quantum states $\\rho$, such that all their\ndiagonal entries are equal to $1/N$. Such a state is contradiagonal with\nrespect to the computational basis, in sense that among all unitary equivalent\nstates it maximizes the entropy copied to the environment due to the coarse\ngraining process. The first four moments of the squared singular values of the\nunimodular ensemble are derived, based on which we conjecture a connection to a\nrecently studied combinatorial object called the \"Borel triangle\". This allows\nus to find exactly the mean von Neumann entropy for random phase density\nmatrices and the average entanglement for the corresponding ensemble of\nbipartite pure states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2014 09:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lakshminarayan", "Arul", ""], ["Pucha\u0142a", "Zbigniew", ""], ["\u017byczkowski", "Karol", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1184", "submitter": "{\\L}ukasz Pawela", "authors": "\\L.

In the case of ideal\nmonitoring these states are pure, and the set of states for a given monitoring\nforms a basis (which is overcomplete in general) for the system.

In\nparticular we prove that for linear Gaussian quantum systems, if the feedback\ncontrol is assumed to be strong compared to the decoherence of the pointer\nbasis, then the system can be stabilized in one of the pointer basis states\nwith a fidelity close to one (the infidelity varies inversely with the control\nstrength). Moreover, if the aim of the feedback is to maximize the fidelity of\nthe unconditioned system state with a pure state that is one of its conditioned\nstates, then the optimal unravelling for stabilizing the system in this way is\nthat which induces the pointer basis for the conditioned states. We illustrate\nthese results with a model system: quantum Brownian motion. We show that even\nif the feedback control strength is comparable to the decoherence, the optimal\nunravelling still induces a basis very close to the pointer basis.

This operator can be locally implemented assisted by a maximally\nentangled state of Schmidt rank $\\min\\{d_A^2,d_B\\}$ when $d_A\\le d_B$. We\nfurther show that any multipartite unitary operator $U$ of Schmidt rank three\ncan be controlled by one system or collectively controlled by two systems,\nregardless of the number of systems of $U$. In the scenario of $n$-qubit, we\nconstruct non-controlled $U$ for any odd $n\\ge5$, and prove that $U$ is a\ncontrolled unitary for any even $n\\ge4$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2014 11:35:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Lin", ""], ["Yu", "Li", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5469", "submitter": "Lushuai Cao Dr.", "authors": "Lushuai Cao, Sven Kr\\\"onke, Jan Stockhofe, Peter Schmelcher, Juliette\n  Simonet, Klaus Sengstock, Dirk-S\\\"oren L\\\"uhmann", "title": "Beyond mean-field study of a binary bosonic mixture in a state-dependent\n  honeycomb lattice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

This\neffect is known as single-photon blockade, which is usually analyzed for a\nKerr-type nonlinear cavity parametrically driven by a single-photon process\nassuming single-photon loss mechanisms. We study photon blockade engineering\nvia a squeezed reservoir, i.e., a quantum reservoir, where only two-photon\nabsorption is allowed. Namely, we analyze a lossy nonlinear cavity\nparametrically driven by a two-photon process and allowing two-photon loss\nmechanisms, as described by the master equation derived for a two-photon\nabsorbing reservoir. The nonlinear cavity engineering can be realized by a\nlinear cavity with a tunable two-level system via the Jaynes-Cummings\ninteraction in the dispersive limit. We show that by tuning properly the\nfrequencies of the driving field and the two-level system, the steady state of\nthe cavity field can be the single-photon Fock state or a partially incoherent\nsuperposition of several Fock states with photon numbers, e.g., (0,2), (1,3),\n(0,1,2), or (0,2,4). We observe that an arbitrary initial coherent or\nincoherent superposition of Fock states with an even (odd) number of photons\ncan be changed into a partially incoherent superposition of a few Fock states\nof the same photon-number parity. A general solution for an arbitrary initial\nstate is a weighted mixture of the above two solutions with even and odd photon\nnumbers, where the weights are given by the probabilities of measuring the even\nand odd numbers of photons of the initial cavity field, respectively.

The basic principles of how intelligence acts\nare discussed. The human brain processes involved in decisions are argued to be\nprincipally different from straightforward computer operations. The difference\nlies in the conscious-subconscious duality of the decision making process and\nthe role of emotions that compete with utility optimization. The most general\napproach for characterizing the process of decision making, taking into account\nthe conscious-subconscious duality, uses the framework of functional analysis\nin Hilbert spaces, similarly to that used in the quantum theory of\nmeasurements. This does not imply that the brain is a quantum system, but just\nallows for the simplest and most general extension of classical decision\ntheory. The resulting theory of quantum decision making, based on the rules of\nquantum measurements, solves all paradoxes of classical decision making,\nallowing for quantitative predictions that are in excellent agreement with\nexperiments.

In this paper, we study this\nproblem in detail. We find that the scaling of the estimation precision with\nthe number of systems can always be optimized to the Heisenberg limit, while\nthe time scaling can be quite different from that of estimating an overall\nmultiplicative factor. We derive the generator of local parameter translation\non the unitary evolution operator of the Hamiltonian, and use it to evaluate\nthe estimation precision of the parameter and establish a general upper bound\non the quantum Fisher information. The results indicate that the quantum Fisher\ninformation generally can be divided into two parts: one is quadratic in time,\nwhile the other oscillates with time. When the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian\ndo not depend on the parameter, the quadratic term vanishes, and the quantum\nFisher information will be bounded in this case.

It is shown that each of the mentioned\nnonclassicality aspects can be obtained by appropriately choosing the related\nparameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jul 2014 09:03:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Faghihi", "M J", ""], ["Tavassoly", "M K", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7127", "submitter": "Martin Fraas", "authors": "Martin Fraas", "title": "Adiabatic theorem for a class of quantum stochastic equations", "comments": "Correction of a mistake in Lemma 2, several other minor changes", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive an adiabatic theory for a stochastic differential equation, $\n\\varepsilon\\, \\mathrm{d} X(s) = L_1(s) X(s)\\, \\mathrm{d} s + \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\nL_2(s) X(s) \\, \\mathrm{d} B_s, $ under a condition that instantaneous\nstationary states of $L_1(s)$ are also stationary states of $L_2(s)$.

As an intriguing\nconsequence of the kinetic frustration in the system, this transition can be\neither continuous or first-order, depending on parameters such as lattice depth\nand filling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 14:03:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 13:44:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:28:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Str\u00e4ter", "Christoph", ""], ["Eckardt", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7426", "submitter": "Megan Agnew", "authors": "Francesco Tonolini, Susan Chan, Megan Agnew, Alan Lindsay, Jonathan\n  Leach", "title": "Reconstructing high-dimensional two-photon entangled states via\n  compressive sensing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Accurately establishing the state of large-scale quantum systems is an\nimportant tool in quantum information science; however, the large number of\nunknown parameters hinders the rapid characterisation of such states, and\nreconstruction procedures can become prohibitively time-consuming.

Furthermore, we apply this idea to other quantities, such as the Renyi\nand von Neumann entropies, which are also more reliably calculated directly\nfrom the raw data than from a tomographically reconstructed state. This\nhighlights the relevance of our approach for practical quantum information\napplications that require entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 13:37:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 16:58:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 13:09:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Lawson", "Thomas", ""], ["Pappa", "Anna", ""], ["Bourdoncle", "Boris", ""], ["Kerenidis", "Iordanis", ""], ["Markham", "Damian", ""], ["Diamanti", "Eleni", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8420", "submitter": "Laurin Ostermann", "authors": "Laurin Ostermann, David Plankensteiner, Helmut Ritsch, Claudiu Genes", "title": "Protected subspace Ramsey spectroscopy", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\nnumerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an\nextensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model.
