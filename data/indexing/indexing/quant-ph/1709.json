Contextuality--the denial of a notion of classical\nphysical reality--has emerged as a promising hypothesis.\n  Magic states are quantum resources critical for practically achieving\nuniversal quantum computation. They exhibit the standard form of contextuality\nthat is known to enable probabilistic advantages in a variety of computational\nand communicational tasks. Strong contextuality is an extremal form of\ncontextuality describing systems that exhibit logically paradoxical behaviour.\n  Here, we consider special magic states that deterministically enable quantum\ncomputation. After introducing number-theoretic techniques for constructing\nexotic quantum paradoxes, we present large classes of strongly contextual magic\nstates that enable deterministic implementation of gates from the Clifford\nhierarchy.

Finally, the proposed method is experimentally\ndemonstrated to obtain high secure random number generation rates of 15.07\nGbits/s in off-line configuration and can potentially achieve 6 Gbits/s by\nreal-time post-processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Sep 2017 08:45:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2019 01:45:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Bingjie", ""], ["Chen", "Ziyang", ""], ["Li", "Zhengyu", ""], ["Yang", "Jie", ""], ["Su", "Qi", ""], ["Huang", "Wei", ""], ["Zhang", "Yichen", ""], ["Guo", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00693", "submitter": "Wim Casteels", "authors": "Wim Casteels and Ryan M.

Through studying instances of QAOA\ncircuits, we show the expected result that as the treewidth of the quantum\ncircuit's line graph decreases, TN contraction becomes significantly more\nefficient than simulating the whole Hilbert space.

Maximally entangled states\nare orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a\nmeasurement in the Bell basis.

Based on this framework, we propose three hardware-efficient bosonic\nQEC codes that are suitable for $\\chi^{(2)}$-interaction based quantum\ncomputation: the $\\chi^{(2)}$ parity-check code, the $\\chi^{(2)}$ embedded\nerror-correcting code, and the $\\chi^{(2)}$ binomial code, all of which detect\nphoton-loss or photon-gain errors by means of photon-number parity measurements\nand then correct them via $\\chi^{(2)}$ Hamiltonian evolutions and linear-optics\ntransformations. Our symmetry-operator framework provides a systematic\nprocedure for finding QEC codes that are not stabilizer codes. The $\\chi^{(2)}$\nbinomial code is of special interest because, with $m\\le N$ identified from\nchannel monitoring, it can correct $m$-photon loss errors, $m$-photon gain\nerrors, and $(m-1)$th-order dephasing errors using logical qudits that are\nencoded in $O(N)$ photons. In comparison, other bosonic QEC codes require\n$O(N^2)$ photons to correct the same degree of bosonic errors. Such improved\nphoton-efficiency underscores the additional error-correction power that can be\nprovided by channel monitoring. We develop quantum Hamming bounds for\nphoton-loss errors in the code subspaces associated with the $\\chi^{(2)}$\nparity-check code and the $\\chi^{(2)}$ embedded error-correcting code, and we\nprove that these codes saturate their respective bounds. Our $\\chi^{(2)}$ QEC\ncodes exhibit hardware efficiency in that they address the principal error\nmechanisms and exploit the available physical interactions of the underlying\nhardware, thus reducing the physical resources required for implementing their\nencoding, decoding, and error-correction operations, and their universal\nencoded-basis gate sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 16:46:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Niu", "Murphy Yuezhen", ""], ["Chuang", "Isaac L.", ""], ["Shapiro", "Jeffrey H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05364", "submitter": "Konstantin Zhdanov", "authors": "Konstantin Zhdanov", "title": "An improvement of D-MORPH method for finding quantum optimal control", "comments": "This is an English translation of the article originally published in\n  Russian", "journal-ref": "Mezdunarodnyj naucno-issledovatel'skij zurnal [International\n  Research Journal]. 2016.

During the last ten years the problem of the\norigin of life has become an innovative research subject approached by many\nauthors. The essay is divided in to three parts: the first deals with the\nproblem of life from a philosophical and biological perspective. The second\npresents the conceptual and methodological basis of the essay which is founded\non the Information Theory and the Quantum Theory. This basis is then used, in\nthe third part, to discuss the different arguments and conjectures of a quantum\norigin of life. There are many philosophical views on the problem of life, two\nof which are especially important at the moment: reductive physicalism and\nbiosystemic emergentism. From a scientific perspective, all the theories and\nexperimental evidences put forward by Biology can be summed up in to two main\nresearch themes: the RNA world and the vesicular theory. The RNA world, from a\nphysicalist point of view, maintains that replication is the essence of life\nwhile the vesicular theory, founded on biosystemic grounds, believes the\nessence of life can be found in cellular metabolism. This essay uses the\nInformation Theory to discard the idea of a spontaneous emergency of life\nthrough replication. Understanding the nature and basis of quantum mechanics is\nfundamental in order to be able to comprehend the advantages of using quantum\ncomputation to be able increase the probabilities of existence of auto\nreplicative structures. Different arguments are set forth such as the inherence\nof quantum mechanics to the origin of life. Finally, in order to try to resolve\nthe question of auto replication, three scientific propositions are put\nforward: Q-life, the quantum combinatory library and the role of algorithms in\nthe origin of genetic language.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 11:34:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Quemada", "Juan Campos", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05975", "submitter": "Robin Schmidt R.S.", "authors": "Robin Schmidt and Stefan Scheel", "title": "Radiative heat transfer between spatially nonlocally responding\n  dielectric objects", "comments": "20 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1361-6455/aa9f58", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We calculate numerically the heat transfer rate between a spatially\ndispersive sphere and a half-space.

We find that\nthe root-mean-square (rms) quadrupole Rabi frequency reduces quickly but the\nquadrupole oscillator strength varies slowly with increasing radial distance.\nWe show that the enhancement factors of the rms Rabi frequency and the\noscillator strength do not depend on any characteristics of the internal atomic\nstates except for the atomic transition frequency. The enhancement factor of\nthe oscillator strength can be significant even when the atom is far away from\nthe fiber. We show that, in the case where the atom is positioned on the fiber\nsurface, the oscillator strength for the quasicircularly polarized fundamental\nmode HE$_{11}$ has a local minimum at the fiber radius $a\\simeq 107$ nm, and is\nlarger than that for quasicircularly polarized higher-order hybrid modes, TE\nmodes, and TM modes in the region $a<498.2$ nm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 02:07:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kien", "Fam Le", ""], ["Ray", "Tridib", ""], ["Nieddu", "Thomas", ""], ["Busch", "Thomas", ""], ["Chormaic", "Sile Nic", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06703", "submitter": "Huan-Yu Ku", "authors": "Huan-Yu Ku, Shin-Liang Chen, Costantino Budroni, Adam Miranowicz,\n  Yueh-Nan Chen and Franco Nori", "title": "Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: Its geometric quantification and\n  witness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used for generating\nquantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime,\nwhere the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of\nions in the trap, giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous\nproposals for performing gates faster than this natural \"speed limit\" of the\ntrap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser\npulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along\ntrajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical\nphase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust\nto this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement\ngeneration for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single\noscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter\nthan the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits.\nThe method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields\na gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for\nexample, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are\npossible at the price of higher laser intensity. The method requires only a\nsingle amplitude-shaped pulse and one pair of beams derived from a\ncontinuous-wave laser, and offers the prospect of combining the unrivalled\ncoherence properties, operation fidelities and optical connectivity of\ntrapped-ion qubits with the sub-microsecond logic speeds usually associated\nwith solid state devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:19:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:50:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00e4fer", "V.

Recently it was\nshown that the quantum Rabi model, which describes a two-level atom coupled to\na single model cavity field, presents quantum phase transitions from a normal\nphase to a superradiate phase when the ratio between the frequency of the two\nlevel atom and the frequency of the cavity field extends to infinity. In this\nwork, we study quantum phase transitions in the quantum Rabi model from the\nfidelity susceptibility perspective. We found that the fidelity susceptibility\nand the generalized adiabatic susceptibility present universal finite size\nscaling behaviors near the quantum critical point of the Rabi model if the\nratio between frequency of the two level atom and frequency of the cavity field\nis finite. From the finite size scaling analysis of the fidelity\nsusceptibility, we found that the adiabatic dimension of the fidelity\nsusceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility of fourth order in\nthe Rabi model are $4/3$ and $2$, respectively. Meanwhile the correlation\nlength critical exponent and the dynamical critical exponent in the quantum\ncritical point of the Rabi model are found to be $3/2$ and $1/3$ respectively.\nSince the fidelity susceptibility and the generalized adiabatic susceptibility\nare the moments of the quantum noise spectrum which is directly measurable by\nexperiments in linear response regime, the scaling behavior of the fidelity\nsusceptibility in the Rabi model could be tested experimentally. The simple\nstructure of the quantum Rabi model paves the way for experimentally observing\nthe universal scaling behavior of the fidelity susceptibility at a quantum\nphase transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Sep 2017 00:31:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Bo-Bo", ""], ["Lv", "Xiao-Chen", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.07118", "submitter": "Aihui Zhou", "authors": "Aihui Zhou", "title": "A Mathematical Aspect of Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.chem-ph math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem plays a fundamental role in density functional\ntheory, which has become a basic tool for the study of electronic structure of\nmatter.

In this context, Volker\nStrassen, striving to understand the complexity of matrix multiplication,\nintroduced in 1986 the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. Essentially, the\nasymptotic restriction problem for a family of tensors $X$, closed under direct\nsum and tensor product, reduces to finding all maps from $X$ to the reals that\nare monotone under restriction, normalised on diagonal tensors, additive under\ndirect sum and multiplicative under tensor product, which Strassen named\nspectral points. Strassen created the support functionals, which are spectral\npoints for oblique tensors, a strict subfamily of all tensors.\n  Universal spectral points are spectral points for the family of all tensors.\nThe construction of nontrivial universal spectral points has been an open\nproblem for more than thirty years. We construct for the first time a family of\nnontrivial universal spectral points over the complex numbers, using quantum\nentropy and covariants: the quantum functionals.

An excited atom traverses a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer (MZI) under a special combination of pre- and post-selection. In\nthe first experiment, photons emitted by the superposed atom, after being hit\nby two laser beams, are individually counted. Despite the interaction having\ndefinitely taken place, the numbers of photons emitted from each arm of the MZI\nare predicted, at the ensemble level, to be different from those expected with\nstandard stimulated emission. In the second experiment, the atom spontaneously\nemits a photon while still in the MZI. This photon later serves as a strong\nmeasurement of the atom's energy upon hitting a photographic plate. The\nexperiment is repeated to enable an interference effect of the emitted photons.\nInterestingly, the latter gives the appearance that the photons have been\nemitted by the atom from a position much farther from the two MZI arms L and R,\nas if in a \"phantom arm\" R'.

In the present work, however, we consider systems\nwith a finite density of either fractons or their dipolar bound states, with a\nfocus on the $U(1)$ fracton models. We study some of the phases in which\nemergent fractonic matter can exist, thereby initiating the study of the\n\"condensed matter\" of fractons. We begin by considering a system with a finite\ndensity of fractons, which we show can exhibit microemulsion physics, in which\nfractons form small-scale clusters emulsed in a phase dominated by long-range\nrepulsion. We then move on to study systems with a finite density of mobile\ndipoles, which have phases analogous to many conventional condensed matter\nphases. We focus on two major examples: Fermi liquids and quantum Hall phases.\nA finite density of fermionic dipoles will form a Fermi surface and enter a\nFermi liquid phase.

Assuming now that, simultaneously to\nBob's measurement, Alice measures the first spin, we show that either energy is\nnot conserved, - implausible - or the projection postulate doesn't apply, and\nthat there is signalling. An explicit measurement model shows that energy is\nconserved (as expected), but that the spin chain energy increase is not\nprovided by the measurement apparatus(es), that the projection postulate is not\nalways valid - illustrating the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem - and that\nthere is signalling, indeed. The signalling is due to the non-local interaction\nHamiltonian. This raises the question of a suitable quantum information\ninspired model of such non-local Hamiltonians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 16:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gisin", "Nicolas", ""], ["Cruzeiro", "Emmanuel Zambrini", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10479", "submitter": "Dmitry Savin", "authors": "Dmitry V.
