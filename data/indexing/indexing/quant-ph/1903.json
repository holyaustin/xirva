This transmitter generates a pair of entangled microwave signals\nand transmits one of them through free space, where the signal is measured\nusing a simple and rudimentary receiver.\n  At the heart of the transmitter is a device called a Josephson parametric\namplifier (JPA), which generates a pair of entangled signals called two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum (TMSV) at 6.1445 GHz and 7.5376 GHz.

The two\nmeasurement results are correlated in order to distinguish signal from noise.\n  We compare our QTMS radar to a classical radar setup using conventional\ncomponents, which we call a two-mode noise radar (TMN radar), and find that\nthere is a significant gain when both systems broadcast signals at -82 dBm.\nThis is shown via a comparison of receiver operator characteristic (ROC)\ncurves.

We find that even an exceedingly small spontaneous decay from exited\nmolecular states can spoil the BIC. In this paper, we show how to circumvent\nthe detrimental effect of spontaneous emission by making use of vacuum-induced\ncoherence (VIC) which results in the cancellation or suppression of spontaneous\nemission. VIC occurs due to the destructive interference between two\nspontaneous decay pathways. An essential condition for VIC is the\nnon-orthogonality of the transition dipole moments associated with the decays.\nFurthermore, the interference between decay pathways requires that the spacing\nbetween the two decaying states must be comparable to or smaller than the\nsquare root of the product of the two spontaneous linewidths. We demonstrate\nthat these conditions can be fulfilled by microwave dressing of two\nappropriately chosen molecular excited states, opening a promising prospect for\nthe experimental realization of BIC of cold atoms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 13:14:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Naskar", "Somnath", ""], ["Sardar", "Dibyendu", ""], ["Deb", "Bimalendu", ""], ["Agarwal", "G.

The direct experimental determination of\nsuch an extremely small error is very challenging by standard quantum-process\ntomography. Instead, the method of randomized benchmarking, which uses a random\nsequence of Clifford gates, has become a standard tool for determination of the\naverage gate error as the decay constant in the exponentially decaying\nfidelity. In this paper, the task for determining a tiny error is addressed by\nsequentially repeating the \\emph{same} gate multiple times, which leads to the\ncoherent amplification of the error, until it reaches large enough values to be\nmeasured reliably. If the transition probability is $p=1-\\epsilon$ with\n$\\epsilon \\ll 1$ in the single process, then classical intuition dictates that\nthe probability after $N$ passes should be $P_N \\approx 1 - N \\epsilon$.\nHowever, this classical expectation is misleading because it neglects\ninterference effects. This paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis based\non the SU(2) symmetry of the qubit propagator, resulting in explicit analytic\nrelations that link the $N$-pass propagator to the single-pass one in terms of\nChebyshev polynomials. In particular, the relations suggest that in some\nspecial cases the $N$-pass transition probability degrades as $P_N =\n1-N^2\\epsilon$, i.e. dramatically faster than the classical probability\nestimate.

First, the action of the\nbipolar pulse is robust to long-timescale linear-dynamical distortions in the\nflux-control line, facilitating tuneup and ensuring atomic repeatability.\nSecond, the flux symmetry of the transmon Hamiltonian makes the conditional\nphase and the single-qubit phase of the pulsed qubit first-order insensitive to\nlow-frequency flux noise, increasing fidelity. By harnessing destructive\ninterference to minimize leakage, the bipolar pulse can approach the speed\nlimit set by the exchange coupling.

In\nevery parameter-estimation experiment, the final measurement or the\npostprocessing incurs some cost. Postselection can improve the rate of Fisher\ninformation (the average information learned about an unknown parameter from an\nexperimental trial) to cost. This improvement, we show, stems from the\nnegativity of a quasiprobability distribution, a quantum extension of a\nprobability distribution. In a classical theory, in which all observables\ncommute, our quasiprobability distribution can be expressed as real and\nnonnegative. In a quantum-mechanically noncommuting theory, nonclassicality\nmanifests in negative or nonreal quasiprobabilities. The distribution's\nnonclassically negative values enable postselected experiments to outperform\neven postselection-free experiments whose input states and final measurements\nare optimized: Postselected quantum experiments can yield anomalously large\ninformation-cost rates.

However, phase\ntransitions in these systems generically exhibit an effectively classical\nequilibrium behavior in spite of their non-equilibrium origin. In this paper,\nwe show that multicritical points in such systems lead to a rich and genuinely\nnon-equilibrium behavior. Specifically, we investigate a driven-dissipative\nmodel of interacting bosons that possesses two distinct phase transitions: one\nfrom a high- to a low-density phase---reminiscent of a liquid-gas\ntransition---and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition\nis described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or\nmicroscopic) $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. They, however, coalesce at a\nmulticritical point, giving rise to a non-equilibrium model of coupled\nIsing-like order parameters described by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry. Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair\nof non-equilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance\ncritical behavior of the system. We elucidate various exotic features of these\nNEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance at\ncriticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in\ncomplex-valued critical exponents and spiraling phase boundaries, and it is\nalso accompanied by a complex Liouvillian gap even close to the phase\ntransition. As direct evidence of the non-equilibrium nature of the NEFPs, we\nshow that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales,\nleading to an effective temperature that becomes \"hotter\" and \"hotter\" at\nlonger and longer wavelengths. Finally, we argue that this non-equilibrium\nbehavior can be observed in cavity arrays with cross-Kerr nonlinearities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:03:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "Jeremy T.", ""], ["Gorshkov", "Alexey V.", ""], ["Foss-Feig", "Michael", ""], ["Maghrebi", "Mohammad F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.02577", "submitter": "Dimitry Yankelev", "authors": "Dimitry Yankelev, Chen Avinadav, Nir Davidson, Ofer Firstenberg", "title": "Multiport Atom Interferometry for Inertial Sensing", "comments": "D.Y. and C.A. contributed equally.

Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic\nquantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum \"magic\" or\nnon-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with\nodd dimension $d$, it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner\nfunction can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this\nobservation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely\npositive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show\nthat they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we\nintroduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels,\ncalled the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that\nthese measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of\nquantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of\nsynthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for\nsimulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by\nthe mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can\noutperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on\nchannel robustness. Finally, we explore the threshold of non-stabilizerness for\nbasic quantum circuits under depolarizing noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:59:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Oct 2019 09:49:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""], ["Su", "Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.04500", "submitter": "Jacob Biamonte D", "authors": "Jacob Biamonte", "title": "Universal Variational Quantum Computation", "comments": "12 pages, RevTeX", "journal-ref": "Physical Review A 103, L030401 (2021)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.103.L030401", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Variational quantum algorithms dominate contemporary gate-based quantum\nenhanced optimisation, eigenvalue estimation and machine learning.

Following on from similar results for the `one\nhot' method of encoding discrete variables [Hadfield et. al. Algorithms 12.2\n(2019): 34] I also demonstrate that it is possible to construct two body mixer\nterms which do not leave the logical subspace, an important consideration for\noptimising using the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA). I additionally\ndiscuss how, since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be\nferromagnetic and therefore could in principle be much stronger than\nanti-ferromagnetic couplers, application specific quantum annealers for\ndiscrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I\ncompare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the\ndomain wall and one hot encodings on two graphs which are relevant for quantum\nannealing, the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph. For every case I examine I\nfind a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared\nto one hot, but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the\nproblem. For encoding some problems, I find an advantage similar to the one\nfound by embedding in a Pegasus graph compared to embedding in a chimera graph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2019 17:21:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2019 17:02:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2019 14:23:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2019 14:52:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Chancellor", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05069", "submitter": "Alberto Hern\\'andez-M\\'inguez", "authors": "A.

We provide a general construction equipped\nwith a simple stochastic sampling scheme that does not depend explicitly on a\nnumber of terms that we extend to approximate projectors within a subspace.\nThis theory then allows one to generalize to the correction of some logical\nerrors in the code space, correction of some physical unencoded Hamiltonians\nwithout engineered symmetries, and corrections derived from approximate\nsymmetries. In this work, we develop the theory of the method and demonstrate\nit on a simple example with the perfect $[[5,1,3]]$ code, which exhibits a\npseudo-threshold of $p \\approx 0.50$ under a single qubit depolarizing channel\napplied to all qubits. We also provide a demonstration under the application of\na logical operation and performance on an unencoded hydrogen molecule, which\nexhibits a significant improvement over the entire range of possible errors\nincurred under a depolarizing channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Mar 2019 01:29:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["McClean", "Jarrod R.", ""], ["Jiang", "Zhang", ""], ["Rubin", "Nicholas C.", ""], ["Babbush", "Ryan", ""], ["Neven", "Hartmut", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05796", "submitter": "Eyuri Wakakuwa", "authors": "Eyuri Wakakuwa and Yoshifumi Nakata", "title": "One-Shot Randomized and Nonrandomized Partial Decoupling", "comments": "55 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a task that we call partial decoupling, in which a bipartite\nquantum state is transformed by a unitary operation on one of the two\nsubsystems and then is subject to the action of a quantum channel.

This paper finds\nexpressions for the non-trivial soft charges of such dressed operators.\nHowever, a large amount of flexibility in the dressing indicates that the soft\ncharges, and other asymptotic observables, are not inherently correlated with\ndetails of the charge or matter distribution.

A dressing can be chosen, perturbatively, so\nthat the asymptotic observables are independent of details of the distribution,\nbesides its total electric or Poincar\\'e charges. This provides an approach to\ndescribing localization of information in gauge theories or gravity, and thus\nsubsystems, that avoids problems associated with nonlocality of operator\nsubalgebras.

These may be the key\nresource for experimental violations of causal inequalities and have been\nrecently identified as resources for concrete information-theoretic tasks.\nHere, we take a step forward by deriving a complete operational framework for\ncausal nonseparability as a resource. Our first contribution is a formal\ndefinition of quantum control of causal orders, a stronger form of causal\nnonseparability (with the celebrated quantum switch as best-known example)\nwhere the causal orders of events for a target system are coherently controlled\nby a control system. We then build a resource theory -- for both generic causal\nnonseparability and quantum control of causal orders -- with a\nphysically-motivated class of free operations, based on process-matrix\nconcatenations. We present the framework explicitly in the mindset with a\ncontrol register. However, our machinery is versatile, being applicable also to\nscenarios with a target register alone. Moreover, an important subclass of our\noperations not only is free with respect to causal nonseparability and quantum\ncontrol of causal orders but also preserves the very causal structure of causal\nprocesses. Hence, our treatment contains, as a built-in feature, the basis of a\nresource theory of quantum causal networks too. As applications, first, we\nestablish a sufficient condition for pure-process free convertibility. This\nimposes a hierarchy of quantum control of causal orders with the quantum switch\nat the top. Second, we prove that causal-nonseparability distillation exists,\ni.e. we show how to convert multiple copies of a process with arbitrarily\nlittle causal nonseparability into fewer copies of a quantum switch.

The resources are conceptualized as\nprobabilistic processes from the setting variables to the outcome variables\nhaving a particular causal structure, namely, one wherein the wings are only\nconnected by a common cause. We term them \"common-cause boxes\". We define the\ndistinction between classical and nonclassical resources in terms of whether or\nnot a classical causal model can explain the correlations. One can then\nquantify the relative nonclassicality of resources by considering their\ninterconvertibility relative to the set of operations that can be implemented\nusing a classical common cause (which correspond to local operations and shared\nrandomness). We prove that the set of free operations forms a polytope, which\nin turn allows us to derive an efficient algorithm for deciding whether one\nresource can be converted to another. We moreover define two distinct monotones\nwith simple closed-form expressions in the two-party binary-setting\nbinary-outcome scenario, and use these to reveal various properties of the\npre-order of resources, including a lower bound on the cardinality of any\ncomplete set of monotones. In particular, we show that the information\ncontained in the degrees of violation of facet-defining Bell inequalities is\nnot sufficient for quantifying nonclassicality, even though it is sufficient\nfor witnessing nonclassicality.

I argue that unitary evolution is consistent with both quantum\nmeasurements and the apparent classicality at the macroscopic level.

As a\nconsequence, Quantum Theory turns out to be consistent with a definite\nfour-dimensional spacetime, even if this may consist of superpositions of\ndifferent geometries. But the block universe subject to global consistency\ngains a new flavor, which for an observer experiencing the flow of time appears\nas \"superdeterministic\" or \"retrocausal\", although this does not manifest\nitself in observations in a way which would allow the violation of causality.\nHowever, the block universe view offers another interpretation of this\nbehavior, which makes more sense, and removes the tension with causality. Such\na block universe subject to global consistency appears thus as being\npost-determined. Here \"post-determined\" means that for an observer the block\nuniverse appears as not being completely determined from the beginning, but\neach new quantum observation eliminates some of the possible block universe\nsolutions consistent with the previous observations.

This behavior is observed both\nin the classical high-power regime and in the quantum single-photon regime,\npossibly suggesting a viable technique to dynamically decouple TLSs from a\nqubit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 10:12:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2019 06:33:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Oct 2019 13:20:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Matityahu", "Shlomi", ""], ["Schmidt", "Hartmut", ""], ["Bilmes", "Alexander", ""], ["Shnirman", "Alexander", ""], ["Weiss", "Georg", ""], ["Ustinov", "Alexey V.", ""], ["Schechter", "Moshe", ""], ["Lisenfeld", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.07932", "submitter": "Olga V.

Starting from a\ntheoretical description we derive a scheme for photon emission from an emitter\ncoupled to a birefringent cavity that exceeds hitherto anticipated limitations.\nBased on a recent study and experimental investigation of the intra-cavity\ncoupling of orthogonal polarisation modes in birefringent cavities, we now\ndecouple the emitter and the photon prior to emission from the cavity mode.\nEffectively, this is \"hiding\" the emitter from the photon in the cavity to\nsuppress re-excitation, increasing the overall emission through the cavity\nmirrors. In doing so we show that tailored cavity birefringence can offer\nsignificant advantages and that these are practically achievable within the\nbounds of present-day technology. It is found that birefringence can mitigate\nthe tradeoff between stronger emitter-cavity coupling and efficient photon\nextraction. This allows for longer cavities to be constructed without a loss of\nperformance -- a significant result for applications where dielectric mirrors\ninterfere with any trapping fields confining the emitter. We then generalise\nour model to consider a variety of equivalent schemes. For instance, detuning a\npair of ground states in a three-level emitter coupled to a cavity in a\nLambda-system is shown to provide the same enhancement, and it can be combined\nwith a birefringent cavity to further increase performance. Additionally, it is\nfound that when directly connecting multiple ground states of the emitter to\nform a chain of coupled states, the extraction efficiency approaches its\nfundamental upper limit.

In this paper, we present explicitly the idea of a quantum\naccelerator which contains the full stack of the layers of an accelerator. Such\na stack starts at the highest level describing the target application of the\naccelerator. The next layer abstracts the quantum logic outlining the algorithm\nthat is to be executed on the quantum accelerator. In our case, the logic is\nexpressed in the universal quantum-classical hybrid computation language\ndeveloped in the group, called OpenQL, which visualised the quantum processor\nas a computational accelerator. The OpenQL compiler translates the program to a\ncommon assembly language, called cQASM, which can be executed on a quantum\nsimulator. The cQASM represents the instruction set that can be executed by the\nmicro-architecture implemented in the quantum accelerator. In a subsequent\nstep, the compiler can convert the cQASM to generate the eQASM, which is\nexecutable on a particular experimental device incorporating the\nplatform-specific parameters.

We find that a single-number metric describing\nthe fidelity of individual gates is a useful but imperfect guide. Our compiler\nuses this subsystem and maps complete circuits onto the machine using a beam\nsearch-based heuristic that will scale as processor and program sizes grow. To\nevaluate the whole compilation process, we compiled and executed adder\ncircuits, then calculated the KL-divergence (a measure of the distance between\ntwo probability distributions). For a circuit within the capabilities of the\nhardware, our compilation increases estimated success probability and reduces\nKL-divergence relative to an error-oblivious placement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:43:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nishio", "Shin", ""], ["Pan", "Yulu", ""], ["Satoh", "Takahiko", ""], ["Amano", "Hideharu", ""], ["Van Meter", "Rodney", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.10967", "submitter": "Alexander  Tagantsev K", "authors": "A.

Thus, bosonic quantum error correction (QEC) is essential. Most bosonic\nQEC schemes encode a finite-dimensional logical qubit or qudit into noisy\nbosonic oscillator modes. In this case, however, the infinite-dimensional\nbosonic nature of the physical system is lost at the error-corrected logical\nlevel. On the other hand, there are several proposals for encoding an\noscillator mode into many noisy oscillator modes. However, these\noscillator-into-oscillators encoding schemes are in the class of Gaussian\nquantum error correction. Therefore, these codes cannot correct practically\nrelevant Gaussian errors due to the established no-go theorems which state that\nGaussian errors cannot be corrected by using only Gaussian resources. Here, we\ncircumvent these no-go results and show that it is possible to correct Gaussian\nerrors by using Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as non-Gaussian\nresources. In particular, we propose a non-Gaussian oscillator-into-oscillators\ncode, the two-mode GKP-repetition code, and demonstrate that it can correct\nadditive Gaussian noise errors. In addition, we generalize the two-mode\nGKP-repetition code to an even broader class of non-Gaussian oscillator codes,\nnamely, GKP-stabilizer codes. Specifically, we show that there exists a highly\nhardware-efficient GKP-stabilizer code, the GKP-two-mode-squeezing code, that\ncan quadratically suppress additive Gaussian noise errors in both the position\nand momentum quadratures up to a small logarithmic correction. Moreover, for\nany GKP-stabilizer code, we show that logical Gaussian operations can be\nreadily implemented by using only physical Gaussian operations. We also show\nthat our oscillator codes can correct practically relevant excitation loss and\nthermal noise errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:59:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 12:21:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:56:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Noh", "Kyungjoo", ""], ["Girvin", "S.

We show that the resourceful ({\\em daemonic}) states can be partitioned\ninto at most nine irreducible subsets. The sets can be classified by a rank\nakin to the Schmidt rank for entanglement theory. Moreover, we show that there\nexists a natural monotone, called the wickedness, which quantifies the\nmultilevel resource content of the states. The present resource theory is shown\nto share deep connections with the resource theory of thermodynamics. In\nparticular, the nine irreducible sets are found to be characterized by well\ndefined temperatures which, however, are not monotonic in the wickedness. This\nresult, as we demonstrate, is found to have dramatic consequences for\nLandauer's erasure principle. Our analysis therefore settles a longstanding\ndebate surrounding the identity of Maxwell's demons and the operational\nsignificance of other related fundamental thermodynamic entities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2019 17:24:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2019 08:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Landi", "Gabriel T.", ""], ["Guarnieri", "Giacomo", ""], ["Morris", "Benjamin", ""], ["Goold", "John", ""], ["Adesso", "Gerardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.12630", "submitter": "Alessio Avella", "authors": "Elena Losero, Ivano Ruo Berchera, Alice Meda, Alessio Avella, Olga\n  Sambataro and Marco Genovese", "title": "Quantum differential ghost microscopy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.
