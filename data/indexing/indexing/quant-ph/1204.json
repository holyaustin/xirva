In the present paper we reobtain these states by\na rather different method. Then, using the nonlinear coherent states approach\nand based on a simple manner by which the representation of two-mode charge\ncoherent states is introduced, we generalize the bosonic creation and\nannihilation operators to the $f$-deformed ladder operators and construct a new\nclass of $f$-deformed charge coherent states. Unlike the (linear) pair coherent\nstates, our presented structure has the potentiality to generate a large class\nof pair coherent states with various nonclassicality signs and physical\nproperties which are of interest. Along this purpose, we use a few well-known\nnonlinearity functions associated with particular quantum systems as some\nphysical appearances of our presented formalism. After introducing the explicit\nform of the above correlated states in two-mode Fock-space, several\nnonclassicality features of the corresponding states (as well as the two-mode\nlinear charge coherent states) are numerically investigated by calculating\nquadrature squeezing, Mandel parameter, second-order correlation function,\nsecond-order correlation function between the two modes and Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality. Also, the oscillatory behaviour of the photon count and the\nquasi-probability (Husimi) function of the associated states will be discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 10:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mortazavi", "M", ""], ["Tavassoly", "M K", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.2675", "submitter": "Mohammad Javad Faghihi", "authors": "M J Faghihi and M K Tavassoly", "title": "Dynamics of entropy and nonclassical properties of the state of a\n  $\\Lambda$-type three-level atom interacting with a single-mode cavity field\n  with intensity-dependent coupling in a Kerr medium", "comments": "18 pages, 7 Figures", "journal-ref": "J.

During the last few years, cluster\nexpansion methods have provided a microscopic, quantum theory to study the\nspectral diffusion of a central spin. These methods have proven to be very\naccurate and efficient for problems of nuclear-induced electron spin\ndecoherence in which hyperfine interactions with the central electron spin are\nmuch stronger than dipolar interactions among the nuclei. We provide an\nin-depth study of central spin decoherence for a canonical scale-invariant\nall-dipolar spin system. We show how cluster methods may be adapted to treat\nthis problem in which central and bath spin interactions are of comparable\nstrength. Our extensive numerical work shows that a properly modified cluster\ntheory is convergent for this problem even as simple perturbative arguments\nbegin to break down. By treating clusters in the presence of energy detunings\ndue to the long-range (diagonal) dipolar interactions of the surrounding\nenvironment and carefully averaging the effects over different spin states, we\nfind that the nontrivial flip-flop dynamics among the spins becomes effectively\nlocalized by disorder in the energy splittings of the spins. This localization\neffect allows for a robust calculation of the spin echo signal in a dipolarly\ncoupled bath of spins of the same kind, while considering clusters of no more\nthan 6 spins.

However,\nfurther progress suffers from the lack of compatibility between these different\ncomponents. Ultimately, one aims for a versatile source of single photons and\nphoton pairs in order to overcome this hurdle of incompatibility.

In addition, it should be able to bridge different\nwavelength regimes to make implementations compatible.

It is common to introduce tomographic concepts\nstarting with the Schrodinger-Dirac picture of quantum mechanics on Hilbert\nspaces. In this picture states are a primary concept and observables are\nderived from them. On the other hand, the Heisenberg picture,which has evolved\nin the $C^\\star-$algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, starts with the\nalgebra of observables and introduce states as a derived concept. The\nequivalence between these two pictures amounts essentially, to the\nGelfand-Naimark-Segal construction. In this construction, the abstract $%\nC^\\star-$algebra is realized as an algebra of operators acting on a constructed\nHilbert space. The representation one defines may be reducible or irreducible,\nbut in either case it allows to identify an unitary group associated with the\n$C^\\star-$algebra by means of its invertible elements. In this picture both\nstates and observables are appropriate functions on the group, it follows that\nalso quantum tomograms are strictly related with appropriate functions\n(positive-type)on the group. In this paper we present, by means of very simple\nexamples, the tomographic description emerging from the set of ideas connected\nwith the $C^\\star-$algebra picture of quantum mechanics. In particular, the\ntomographic probability distributions are introduced for finite and compact\ngroups and an autonomous criterion to recognize a given probability\ndistribution as a tomogram of quantum state is formulated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Apr 2012 23:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ibort", "A.", ""], ["Manko", "V.

Beable-guided\nquantum theories (BGQT) are generalisations of quantum theory, inspired by\nBell's concept of beables. They modify the quantum probabilities for some\nspecified set of fundamental events, histories, or other elements of\nquasiclassical reality by probability laws that depend on the realised\nconfiguration of beables. For example, they may define an additional\nprobability weight factor for a beable configuration, independent of the\nquantum dynamics.\n  BGQT can be fitted to observational data to provide foils against which to\ncompare explanations based on standard quantum theory. For example, a BGQT\ncould, in principle, characterise the effects attributed to dark energy or dark\nmatter, or any other deviation from the predictions of standard quantum\ndynamics, without introducing extra fields or a cosmological constant. The\ncomplexity of the beable-guided theory would then parametrise how far we are\nfrom a standard quantum explanation.\n  Less conservatively, we give reasons for taking suitably simple beable-guided\nquantum theories as serious phenomenological theories in their own right. Among\nthese are that cosmological models defined by BGQT might in fact fit the\nempirical data better than any standard quantum explanation, and that BGQT\nsuggest potentially interesting non-standard ways of coupling quantum matter to\ngravity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 15:41:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2018 03:04:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kent", "Adrian", "", "Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations, DAMTP,\n  University of Cambridge and Perimeter Institute"]]}, {"id": "1204.5989", "submitter": "Miloslav Znojil", "authors": "Miloslav Znojil", "title": "Crypto-unitary forms of quantum evolution operators", "comments": "15 pp", "journal-ref": "Int.

As an alternative\nthat avoids the mathematical difficulties facing the approach of Jordan and\nPaul A. M. Dirac (1927), John von Neumann (1927a) developed the modern Hilbert\nspace formalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we focus on Jordan and von\nNeumann. Central to the formalisms of both are expressions for conditional\nprobabilities of finding some value for one quantity given the value of\nanother. Beyond that Jordan and von Neumann had very different views about the\nappropriate formulation of problems in quantum mechanics. For Jordan, unable to\nlet go of the analogy to classical mechanics, the solution of such problems\nrequired the identication of sets of canonically conjugate variables, i.e., p's\nand q's. For von Neumann, not constrained by the analogy to classical\nmechanics, it required only the identication of a maximal set of commuting\noperators with simultaneous eigenstates. He had no need for p's and q's. Jordan\nand von Neumann also stated the characteristic new rules for probabilities in\nquantum mechanics somewhat differently. Jordan (1927b) was the first to state\nthose rules in full generality. Von Neumann (1927a) rephrased them and, in a\nsubsequent paper (von Neumann, 1927b), sought to derive them from more basic\nconsiderations. In this paper we reconstruct the central arguments of these\n1927 papers by Jordan and von Neumann and of a paper on Jordan's approach by\nHilbert, von Neumann, and Nordheim (1928).
