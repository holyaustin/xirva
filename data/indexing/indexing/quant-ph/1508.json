By black box computations, she unitarily sends it\ninto the output state that, for each possible setting, encodes the\ncorresponding solution, acquired by the final measurement. We show that we can\nascribe to the final measurement the selection of any part -- say the R-th part\n-- of the random outcome of the initial measurement. This projects the input\nstate to Alice on a state of lower entropy where she knows a corresponding part\nof the problem setting. The quantum algorithm is a sum over classical histories\nin each of which Alice, knowing in advance one of the R-th parts of the\nsetting, performs the black box computations still required to identify the\nsolution. Given an oracle problem and a value of R, this retrocausality model\nprovides the number of black box computations required to solve it. Conversely,\ngiven a known quantum algorithm, it yields the value of R that explains its\nspeed up. R = 1/2 always yields the number of black box computations required\nby an existing quantum algorithm and the order of magnitude of the number\nrequired by optimal one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2015 15:31:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2015 21:51:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Castagnoli", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.00458", "submitter": "Anna Jen\\v{c}ov\\'a", "authors": "Anna Jencova", "title": "On the convex structure of process POVMs", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": "J.

First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the\ndensity of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect\nof gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to\ninflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities.\nHowever, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is\nhomogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the\nfoundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the\nsymmetry of the quantum state. Second, Boltzmann brains are random agglomerates\nof particles that, by extreme coincidence, form functioning brains. Unlikely as\nthese coincidences are, they seem to be predicted to occur in a quantum\nuniverse as vacuum fluctuations if the universe continues to exist for an\ninfinite (or just very long) time, in fact to occur over and over, even forming\nthe majority of all brains in the history of the universe.

This achievement is however jeopardized by the detrimental effects\nof the environment surrounding any quantum system, so that finding strategies\nto protect quantum resources is essential. Non-Markovian and structured\nenvironments are useful tools to this aim. Here we show how a simple\nenvironmental architecture made of two coupled lossy cavities enables a switch\nbetween Markovian and non-Markovian regimes for the dynamics of a qubit\nembedded in one of the cavity. Furthermore, qubit coherence can be indefinitely\npreserved if the cavity without qubit is perfect.

However, the laws of physics that emerge at the\nmacroscopic level are fully deterministic. Here, it is shown that the relation\nbetween quantum statistics and deterministic dynamics can be explained in terms\nof ergodic averages over complex valued probabilities, where the fundamental\ncausality of motion is expressed by an action that appears as the phase of the\ncomplex probability multiplied with the fundamental constant hbar. Importantly,\nclassical physics emerges as an approximation of this more fundamental theory\nof motion, indicating that the assumption of a classical reality described by\ndifferential geometry is merely an artefact of an extrapolation from the\nobservation of macroscopic dynamics to a fictitious level of precision that\ndoes not exist within our actual experience of the world around us. It is\ntherefore possible to completely replace the classical concepts of trajectories\nwith the more fundamental concept of action phase probabilities as a\nuniversally valid description of the deterministic causality of motion that is\nobserved in the physical world.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 00:09:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 02:12:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 20 Apr 2016 01:42:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hofmann", "Holger F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02785", "submitter": "Anurag Mishra", "authors": "Anurag Mishra, Tameem Albash and Daniel Lidar", "title": "Performance of two different quantum annealing correction codes", "comments": "6 pages main text, 1 page appendix, 23 figures. v2 - Updated\n  manuscript to match published version", "journal-ref": "Quantum Information Processing, vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 609-636, Dec.\n  2015", "doi": "10.1007/s11128-015-1201-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving optimization problems,\nbut like all other quantum information processing methods, it requires error\ncorrection to ensure scalability.

We\nreconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function, an important hallmark of\nnonclassicality, and verify an entanglement depth (minimum number of mutually\nentangled atoms) of 2910(190) out of 3100 atoms. This is the first time a\nnegative Wigner function or the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms have\nbeen attained in an ensemble containing more than a few particles. While the\nachieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for\nentanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should\nallow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex\nSchrodinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More\ngenerally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for\nentanglement generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a\nsingle photon can drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 20:12:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["McConnell", "Robert", ""], ["Zhang", "Hao", ""], ["Hu", "Jiazhong", ""], ["Cuk", "Senka", ""], ["Vuletic", "Vladan", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.03074", "submitter": "Lukas Gruending", "authors": "Gia Dvali, Cesar Gomez, Lukas Gruending, Tehseen Rug", "title": "Towards a Quantum Theory of Solitons", "comments": "Matches version published at Nuclear Physics B", "journal-ref": "Nucl.Phys.

In the\nstrong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two\ndifferent kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\\tau$'s\nand light $\\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian)\ntopological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map\nthe two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and\nlight $\\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the\nappearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological\ngapped phase is suggested for another density regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 21:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Soni", "Medha", "", "CNRS, Toulouse"], ["Troyer", "Matthias", "", "ETH-Zurich"], ["Poilblanc", "Didier", "", "CNRS, Toulouse"]]}, {"id": "1508.04164", "submitter": "Yao-Lung Leo Fang", "authors": "Yao-Lung L.

Here this appealing idea is\nconsidered to analyze both classical and quantum interference, thus providing\nan alternative and more intuitive framework to understand the time-evolution of\nwaves, either in terms of the flow of energy (for mechanical waves, sound\nwaves, electromagnetic waves, for instance) or, analogously, the flow of\nprobability (quantum waves), respectively. Furthermore, this procedure also\nsupplies a more robust explanation of interference phenomena, which currently\nis only based on the superposition principle. That is, while this principle\nonly describes how different waves combine and what effects these combinations\nmay lead to, flow lines provide a more precise explanation on how the energy or\nprobability propagate in space before, during and after the combination of such\nwaves, without dealing with them separately (i.e., the combination or\nsuperposition is taken as a whole). In this sense, concepts such as\nconstructive and destructive interference, typically associated with the\nsuperposition principle, physically correspond to more or less dense swarms of\n(energy or probability) flow lines, respectively. A direct consequence of this\ndescription is that, when considering the distribution of electromagnetic\nenergy flow lines behind two slits, each one covered by a differently oriented\npolarizer, it is naturally found that external observers' information on the\nslit crossed by single photons (understood as energy parcels) is totally\nirrelevant for the existence of interference fringes, in striking contrast with\nwhat is commonly stated and taught.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 07:31:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Davidovic", "M.", ""], ["Sanz", "A.

In his seminal work, John\nBell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can\nreproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local\nrealist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an\ninequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to\nquantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the\nfundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades,\nnumerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because\nof experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional\nassumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in\nloopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such\nadditional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's\ninequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of\nhigh-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin\nreadout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use\nof fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation\nof 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials\ntesting the CHSH-Bell inequality $S \\leq 2$ and find $S = 2.42 \\pm 0.20$.

In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:39:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 10:26:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bienfait", "A.", ""], ["Pla", "J.

This is because the\nuncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total\nenergy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath.\nHowever, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via\ncentral forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal\nequilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann\ndistribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all\nenergy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to\nthe environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes\npredicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong\ncoupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard\nthermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such\nas stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is\nknown that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian\ncharacter. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the\nthermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum\noptomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary\nsystem which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the\nnon-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if\nwe use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the\ndifferent modes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:53:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Triana", "Johan F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06221", "submitter": "Shih-Yuin Lin", "authors": "Shih-Yuin Lin, Chung-Hsien Chou, Bei-Lok Hu", "title": "Entanglement Dynamics of Detectors in an Einstein Cylinder", "comments": "32 pages, 13 figures.

Enormous progress has been made in the past decades in developing\nboth classical and quantum approaches to calculate, simulate and experimentally\nprobe the properties of such systems. In this work we use a combination of\nclassical and quantum methods to experimentally explore the properties of an\ninteracting quantum gas by creating experimental realizations of continuous\nmatrix product states - a class of states which has proven extremely powerful\nas a variational ansatz for numerical simulations. By systematically preparing\nand probing these states using a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system\nwe experimentally determine a good approximation to the ground-state wave\nfunction of the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, which describes an interacting Bose\ngas in one dimension. Since the simulated Hamiltonian is encoded in the\nmeasurement observable rather than the controlled quantum system, this approach\nhas the potential to apply to exotic models involving multicomponent\ninteracting fields. Our findings also hint at the possibility of experimentally\nexploring general properties of matrix product states and entanglement theory.\nThe scheme presented here is applicable to a broad range of systems exploiting\nstrong and tunable light-matter interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 12:48:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Eichler", "C.", ""], ["Mlynek", "J.", ""], ["Butscher", "J.", ""], ["Kurpiers", "P.", ""], ["Hammerer", "K.", ""], ["Osborne", "T.

The ionization potential obtained with\nensemble-generalized functionals is found to depend only weakly on the\nparameter value, contrary to common experience with non-generalized hybrids,\nthus eliminating one aspect of the so-called `parameter dilemma' of hybrid\nfunctionals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 12:38:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kraisler", "Eli", ""], ["Schmidt", "Tobias", ""], ["K\u00fcmmel", "Stephan", ""], ["Kronik", "Leeor", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07796", "submitter": "Rainer Kaltenbaek", "authors": "Rainer Kaltenbaek", "title": "Testing quantum physics in space using high-mass matter-wave\n  interferometry", "comments": "4 pages, conference proceedings to appear in Proceedings of 50th\n  Rencontres de Moriond (March 2015), Gravitation: 100 Years after GR", "journal-ref": "Proc. 50th Rencontres de Moriond, pp. 141-144 (2015)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum superposition is central to quantum theory but challenges our\nconcepts of reality and spacetime when applied to macroscopic objects like\nSchr\\\"odinger's cat.
