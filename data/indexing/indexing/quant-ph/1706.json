Here, we discuss how\nentropy production provides a quantification of the irreversibility in open\nquantum systems through the quantum fluctuation theorem. We start by\nintroducing a two-time quantum measurement scheme, in which the dynamical\nevolution between the measurements is described by a completely positive,\ntrace-preserving (CPTP) quantum map (forward process). By inverting the\nmeasurement scheme and applying the time-reversed version of the quantum map,\nwe can study how this backward process differs from the forward one. When the\nCPTP map is unital, we show that the stochastic quantum entropy production is a\nfunction only of the probabilities to get the initial measurement outcomes in\ncorrespondence of the forward and backward processes. For bipartite open\nquantum systems we also prove that the mean value of the stochastic quantum\nentropy production is sub-additive with respect to the bipartition (except for\nproduct states). Hence, we find a method to detect correlations between the\nsubsystems. Our main result is the proposal of an efficient protocol to\ndetermine and reconstruct the characteristic functions of the stochastic\nentropy production for each subsystem. This procedure enables to reconstruct\neven others thermodynamical quantities, such as the work distribution of the\ncomposite system and the corresponding internal energy.

Compared to the standard method not\ninvolving polarization transfer, we find an enhancement of singlet order by\nabout three times. In addition, since the singlet magnetization is contributed\nby the faster relaxing protons, the recycle delay is halved. Thus effectively\nwe observe a sensitivity enhancement by 4.2 times or a reduction in the overall\nexperimental time by a factor of 18. We also discuss a possible extension of\nAC, known as heat-bath algorithmic cooling (HBAC).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 14:08:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 05:58:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Khurana", "Deepak", ""], ["Mahesh", "T.

The 2p times for which these two\nHamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be\noptimized classically for the best performance.

In the context of solid-state qubits,\ntechniques to mitigate the impact of fluctuating electric and magnetic fields\nfrom the environment are well-developed.

Here, we use a nano-electro-mechanical\nsystem (NEMS) to mitigate the effect of thermal phonons on a solid-state\nquantum emitter without changing the system temperature. We study the\nsilicon-vacancy (SiV) colour centre in diamond which has optical and spin\ntransitions that are highly sensitive to phonons. First, we show that its\nelectronic orbitals are highly susceptible to local strain, leading to its high\nsensitivity to phonons.

In this work we investigate\nhow fabrication errors affect the performance of topological codes, using the\nsurface code as the testbed. A known approach to mitigate defective lattices\ninvolves the use of primitive SWAP gates in a long sequence of syndrome\nextraction circuits. Instead, we show that in the presence of fabrication\nerrors the syndrome can be determined using the supercheck operator approach\nand the outcome of the defective gauge stabilizer generators without any\nadditional computational overhead or the use of SWAP gates.

A major challenge to further scalability is\nto find approaches for connecting these systems over long distances and at high\nrates. One approach is to convert the quantum state of a microwave circuit to\noptical photons that can be transmitted over kilometers at room temperature\nwith little loss. Many proposals for electro-optic conversion between microwave\nand optics use optical driving of a weak three-wave mixing nonlinearity to\nconvert the frequency of an excitation. Residual absorption of this optical\npump leads to heating, which is problematic at cryogenic temperatures. Here we\npropose an alternative approach where a nonlinear superconducting circuit is\ndriven to interconvert between microwave-frequency and\nmillimeter-wave-frequency (300 GHz) photons. To understand the potential for\nquantum conversion between microwave and mm-wave photons, we consider the\ndriven four-wave mixing quantum dynamics of nonlinear circuits. In contrast to\nthe linear dynamics of the driven three-wave mixing converters, the proposed\nfour-wave mixing converter has nonlinear decoherence channels that lead to a\nmore complex parameter space of couplings and pump powers that we map out. We\nconsider physical realizations of such converter circuits by deriving\ntheoretically the upper bound on the maximum obtainable nonlinear coupling\nbetween any two modes in a lossless circuit, and synthesizing an optimal\ncircuit based on realistic materials that saturates this bound. Our proposed\ncircuit dissipates less than $10^{-9}$ times the energy of current\nelectro-optic converters per qubit.

By linearizing hydrodynamic equations, we provide exact closed-form\nexpressions for Drude weights, generalized static charge susceptibilities and\ncharge-current correlators valid on hydrodynamic scale, represented as integral\nkernels operating diagonally in the space of mode numbers of thermodynamic\nexcitations. We find that, on hydrodynamic scales, Drude weights manifestly\ndisplay Onsager reciprocal relations even for generic (i.e. non-canonical)\nequilibrium states, and establish a generalized detailed balance condition for\na general quantum integrable model. We present the first exact analytic\nexpressions for the general Drude weights in the Hubbard model, and explain how\nto reconcile different approaches for computing Drude weights from the previous\nliterature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 13:37:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:21:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ilievski", "Enej", ""], ["De Nardis", "Jacopo", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05948", "submitter": "Vladislav Serov", "authors": "Vladislav V.

We have taken into consideration the interactions\nbetween the N and Bi impurity states with the host material based on the band\nanticrossing (BAC) and valence band anticrossing (VBAC) model. The optical gain\ncalculation is based on the density matrix theory. We have considered different\nlattice matched GaNBiAs QW cases and studied their energy dispersion curves,\noptical gain spectrum, maximum optical gain and differential gain; and compared\ntheir performances based on these factors. The thickness and composition of\nthese QWs were varied in order to keep the emission peak fixed at 1.55 $\\mu$m.\nThe well thickness has an effect on the spectral width of the gain curves. On\nthe other hand, a variation in the injection carrier density has different\neffects on the maximum gain and differential gain of QWs of varying\nthicknesses. Among the cases studied, we found that the 6.3 nm thick\nGaN$_3$Bi$_{5.17}$As$_{91.83}$ lattice matched QW was most suited for 1.55\n$\\mu$m (0.8 eV) GaAs-based photonic applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 16:55:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "W.

This strongly suggests the presence of a prethermal plateau in which\ndynamics is governed by an effective, static Hamiltonian for long times, and we\nprovide numerical evidence to support such a statement. Our results are\nrelevant for understanding timescales of both heating and hence new dynamical\nregimes described by effective Hamiltonians in such long-range systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 08:31:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 15:58:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 26 Oct 2017 17:30:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2018 15:46:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ho", "Wen Wei", ""], ["Protopopov", "Ivan", ""], ["Abanin", "Dmitry A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07249", "submitter": "Yuri Golubev", "authors": "A.D.

However, distributing entanglement with high-quality via fiber optic\nroutes could be challenging due to the various decoherence mechanisms in\nfibers. In particular, one of the primary polarization decoherence mechanisms\nin optical fibers is polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which is the\ndistortion of optical pulses by randomly varying birefringences in the system.\nTo mitigate the effect of decoherence in entangled particles, quantum\nentanglement distillation (QED) algorithms have been proposed. One particular\nclass, the recurrence QED algorithms, stands out because it has relatively\nrelaxed requirements on both the size of the quantum circuits involved and on\nthe initial quality of entanglement in particles. However, because the number\nof particles required grows exponentially with the number of rounds of\ndistillation, an efficient recurrence algorithm needs to converge quickly. We\npresent a recurrence QED algorithm designed for photonic qubit pairs affected\nby PMD-degraded channels. Our proposed algorithm achieves the optimal fidelity\nas well as the optimal success probability (conditional on the optimal fidelity\nbeing achieved) in every round of distillation. The attainment of optimal\nfidelity improves the convergence speed of fidelity with respect to the rounds\nof distillation from linear to quadratic, and hence significantly reduces the\nnumber of distillation rounds. Combined with the fact that the optimal success\nprobability is achieved, the proposed algorithm provides an efficient method to\ndistribute entangled states with high fidelity via optic fibers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 19:17:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Aug 2017 02:39:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 3 Nov 2017 16:37:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2018 18:53:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ruan", "Liangzhong", ""], ["Kirby", "Brian T.", ""], ["Brodsky", "Michael", ""], ["Win", "Moe Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07469", "submitter": "Francisco Fern\\'andez Dr.", "authors": "Francisco M.

The extent of the wavefront becomes\nevident only in statistical accumulation of many independent detections, with\nprobability given by the Born rule. Drawing on concepts from quantum optics, we\nanalyze a simple model to reverse-engineer how this behavior can come about in\nterms of wave mechanics alone without a measurement axiom. The model detector\nconsists of many molecules, each of which can be resonantly excited by the\nincoming particle and then emit a detection signature (e.g., localized flash of\nlight). Different molecules have different resonant energies because local\nconditions (proximity of other molecules, Doppler shifts, etc.) vary. The\ndetector is thus a quasi-continuum, and the incoming particle preferentially\nexcites the molecule that it matches most closely in energy. (In actuality,\nmolecules can be so numerous that many could closely match the incoming\nparticle in energy; but in that case only one will be the first, and there will\nbe nothing left for the others by the time the first match resonates and then\nemits. The model does not explicitly take into account the temporal advance of\nthe particle wave packet through the detector medium.) The excited molecule can\nemit a detection signature, but that process competes with fluctuation-driven\ndephasing. We estimate the probability that a given molecule is resonantly\nexcited, and we also estimate the probability that a detection signature is\nproduced before being overwhelmed by fluctuations in the detector medium.

Under this symmetry, correlation functions of all Wilson\nloop operators in the low energy topological quantum field theory (TQFT) are\ninvariant.
