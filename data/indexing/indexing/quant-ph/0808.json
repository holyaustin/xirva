We present a proof of this theorem which is both elementary and\neconomical. Central to our proof is the recognition that a given Wigner\nsymmetry can, by post-multiplication by a unitary symmetry, be taken into\neither the identity or complex conjugation. Our analysis involves a judicious\ninterplay between the effect a given Wigner symmetry has on certain\ntwo-dimensional subspaces and the effect it has on the entire Hilbert space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Aug 2008 06:22:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2008 06:45:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Simon", "R.", ""], ["Mukunda", "N.", ""], ["Chaturvedi", "S.", ""], ["Srinivasan", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0794", "submitter": "Till Weinhold", "authors": "Till J.

A weak coherent state has\nmulti-photon components, which opens up a security loophole to the\nsophisticated eavesdropper. With a small adjustment of the hardware, we prove\nthat the decoy state method can close this loophole and substantially improve\nthe QKD performance. We also propose a few practical decoy state protocols,\nstudy statistical fluctuations and perform experimental demonstrations.\nMoreover, we apply the methods from entanglement distillation protocols based\non two-way classical communication to improve the decoy state QKD performance.\nFurthermore, we study the decoy state methods for other single photon sources,\nsuch as triggering parametric down-conversion (PDC) source.\n  We propose a model and post-processing scheme for the entanglement-based QKD\nwith a PDC source. Although the model is proposed to study the\nentanglement-based QKD, we emphasize that our generic model may also be useful\nfor other non-QKD experiments involving a PDC source. By simulating a real PDC\nexperiment, we show that the entanglement-based QKD can achieve longer maximal\nsecure distance than the single-photon-based QKD schemes.\n  We present a time-shift attack that exploits the efficiency mismatch of two\nsingle photon detectors in a QKD system. This eavesdropping strategy can be\nrealized by current technology. We also discuss counter measures against the\nattack and study the security of a QKD system with efficiency mismatch\ndetectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Aug 2008 01:30:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Xiongfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1389", "submitter": "Faisal Khan", "authors": "Steven A.

Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no\nclassical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable\nresource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including\nquantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We\nfirst investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled\nstates (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical\ngraphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to\ngraphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be\ncharacterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and\nmanipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose\ncodewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation\nconcerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to\ncarry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while\nsimultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that\ntransversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors\nthrough a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost\nall QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits\nfor creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to\nharness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to\nextract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state\nusing local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create\nentangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the\ninput parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2008 17:40:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "Hyeyoun", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1558", "submitter": "Elizabeth Behrman", "authors": "E.C.

For translationally symmetric multipole configurations (analogs\nof the linear Paul trap), we derive analytical expressions for electrode\ngeometry and strength.

In this work we develop a stochastic difference equation\nthat describes the dissipative coupling of the cavity field and the detector.\nThe difference equation is based on non-perturbative treatment of the\ncavity-detector coupling. In spite of being non-integrable due to the coupling\nof the detector with an external reservoir it can be used to derive the exact\nforms of the quantum jump superoperators. When applied to a particular photon\ncounting measurement our theory gives predictions identical with those of the\nSD model which should be considered a non-perturbative and ab-initio result.

An exact\ncalculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried\nout. This shows that there is a mode-matching criterion which determines the\noptimum input and output mode shape. This optimum pulse shape can be modified\nby changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling\nbetween the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of\nlong storage times. The quantum fidelity is calculated both for the coherent\nstate protocol, and for a completely arbitrary input state with a bounded total\nphoton number.

Einstein branded it as spooky action at a\ndistance. A real spooky action at a distance would require a faster than light\ninfluence defined in some hypothetical universally privileged reference frame.\nHere we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical\ninfluences. We performed a Bell test during more than 24 hours between two\nvillages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the\nsource located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed 2-photon\ninterferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the\nEarth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine,\nfor any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of this\nspooky influence. For instance, if such a privileged reference frame exists and\nis such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10^-3 that of the\nspeed of light, then the speed of this spooky influence would have to exceed\nthat of light by at least 4 orders of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Aug 2008 09:14:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Salart", "D.", ""], ["Baas", "A.", ""], ["Branciard", "C.", ""], ["Gisin", "N.", ""], ["Zbinden", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3317", "submitter": "Dejan Dukaric", "authors": "Dejan D.

In contrast to the zero\ntemperature limit, the entanglement of the density matrix projected out of the\nemitted many-body state is different from the entanglement of the reduced\ndensity matrix, detectable by current correlation measurements. We show that\nunder very general conditions the reduced entanglement constitutes a lower\nbound for the projected entanglement. Applying the theory to the recent\nexperiment [Neder et al, Nature 448 333 (2007)] on a fermionic Hanbury Brown\nTwiss two-particle interferometer we find that despite an appreciable\nentanglement production in the experiment, the detectable entanglement is close\nto zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 12:56:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Sep 2009 15:02:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Samuelsson", "P.", ""], ["Neder", "I.", ""], ["Buttiker", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4098", "submitter": "Daniel Bedingham", "authors": "D.

By extending\nthe Schrodinger equation to include stochastic and nonlinear terms the\ndynamical process of quantum state reduction can be represented. A specific\nchoice of modified Schrodinger dynamics is shown to result in stable coherent\nfield states. The two-state system undergoes an induced state reduction to a\ngeneralised current state due to its interaction with the field mode. Numerical\nresults are presented demonstrating state reduction dynamics for an initial\nsuperposition of two current states.
