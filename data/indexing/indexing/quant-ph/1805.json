TFNP includes many natural and\nimportant problems. In the present work we introduce the complexity class of\nTotal Functional QMA (TFQMA), the quantum analog of TFNP. We show that FQMA and\nTFQMA can be defined in such a way that they do not depend on the values of the\ncompleteness and soundness probabilities. In so doing we introduce new notions\nsuch as the eigenbasis and spectrum of a quantum verification procedure which\nare of interest by themselves. We then provide examples of problems that lie in\nTFQMA, coming from areas such as the complexity of k-local Hamiltonians and\npublic key quantum money. In the context of black-box groups, we note that\nGroup Non-Membership, which was known to belong to QMA, in fact belongs to\nTFQMA. We also provide a simple oracle with respect to which we have a\nseparation between FBQP and TFQMA. In the conclusion we discuss the relation\nbetween TFQMA, public key quantum money, and the complexity of quantum states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2018 08:24:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Nov 2019 14:56:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2019 14:34:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 12 Dec 2020 12:04:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Massar", "Serge", ""], ["Santha", "Miklos", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.00675", "submitter": "Guang Hao Low", "authors": "Guang Hao Low and Nathan Wiebe", "title": "Hamiltonian Simulation in the Interaction Picture", "comments": "30 pages, 5 figures. v2: Fix some errors in equations and figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a low-space overhead simulation algorithm based on the truncated\nDyson series for time-dependent quantum dynamics.

A fundamental remaining open question is whether the\nlaws of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics allow the existence a \"coherence\ndistillation machine\", i.e. a machine that, by possibly consuming work, obtains\npure coherent states from mixed states, at a nonzero rate. This question is\nrelated to another fundamental question: Starting from many copies of noisy\nquantum clocks which are (approximately) synchronized with a reference clock,\ncan we distill synchronized clocks in pure states, at a non-zero rate? In this\npaper we study quantities called \"coherence cost\" and \"distillable coherence\",\nwhich determine the rate of conversion of coherence in a standard pure state to\ngeneral mixed states, and vice versa, in the context of quantum thermodynamics.\nWe find that the coherence cost of any state (pure or mixed) is determined by\nits Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), thereby revealing a novel operational\ninterpretation of this central quantity of quantum metrology. On the other\nhand, we show that, surprisingly, distillable coherence is zero for typical\n(full-rank) mixed states. Hence, we establish the impossibility of coherence\ndistillation machines in quantum thermodynamics, which can be compared with the\nimpossibility of perpetual motion machines or cloning machines. To establish\nthis result, we introduce a new additive quantifier of coherence, called the\n\"purity of coherence\", and argue that its relation with QFI is analogous to the\nrelation between the free and total energies in thermodynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2018 03:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Marvian", "Iman", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.02032", "submitter": "Adan Cabello", "authors": "Zhen-Peng Xu, Ad\\'an Cabello", "title": "Necessary and sufficient condition for contextuality from\n  incompatibility", "comments": "7 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This bosonic coherence being a feature of a superradiant state, we\nshall loosely use the term superradiant steady-state to describe it.\n  A finite value of the coupling between the spins and the bosonic mode then\nleads to a long-time limit steady-state whose properties are qualitatively\ncaptured by a simple \"dynamical\" vision in which the coupling strength $V$\nplays the role of a time $t_V$ at which this \"relaxation process\" towards the\ncommon strong coupling superradiant steady-state is interrupted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2018 12:36:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Tschirhart", "Hugo", ""], ["Platini", "Thierry", ""], ["Faribault", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.03514", "submitter": "Stefano Pirandola", "authors": "Carlo Ottaviani, Matthew J.

The first one is an energy dissipation process in a multiple-qubit\nsystem which is initially in a random pure state in an energy shell.

On the other hand, the corresponding rotation\nspeed can be tuned by raising or lowering the two barriers at the same time.\nOur proposal therefore allows for tunability of both the rotation axis and\nrotating speed for a charge qubit via all-electrical control, which may\nfacilitate realization of quantum algorithms in these devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2018 01:57:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2018 15:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Xu-Chen", ""], ["Chan", "Guo Xuan", ""], ["Wang", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.04249", "submitter": "Yi-Chen Zhang", "authors": "Zhengyu Li, Yi-Chen Zhang, Hong Guo", "title": "User-defined quantum key distribution", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides secure keys resistant to\ncode-breaking quantum computers.

A Bell test requires\nspatially distributed entanglement, fast and high-efficiency detection and\nunpredictable measurement settings. Although technology can satisfy the first\ntwo of these requirements, the use of physical devices to choose settings in a\nBell test involves making assumptions about the physics that one aims to test.\nBell himself noted this weakness in using physical setting choices and argued\nthat human `free will' could be used rigorously to ensure unpredictability in\nBell tests. Here we report a set of local-realism tests using human choices,\nwhich avoids assumptions about predictability in physics. We recruited about\n100,000 human participants to play an online video game that incentivizes fast,\nsustained input of unpredictable selections and illustrates Bell-test\nmethodology.

It is largely independent of the momenta\nand masses of the excitations, and of the geometry, dimension and connectedness\nof the entanglement region. The result has a natural quantum information\ntheoretic interpretation as the entanglement of a state where each\nquasi-particle is associated with two qubits representing their presence within\nand without the entanglement region, taking into account quantum\n(in)distinguishability. This applies to any excited state composed of finite\nnumbers of quasi-particles with finite De Broglie wavelengths or finite\nintrinsic correlation length. We derive this result analytically in\none-dimensional massive bosonic and fermionic free field theories and for\nsimple setups in higher dimensions. We provide numerical evidence for the\nharmonic chain and the two-dimensional harmonic lattice in all regimes where\nexcitations have quasi-particle properties.

One common assumption is that the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the\nstatement that P $\\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical\nsimulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse\nthan any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm.

Operator growth is a manifestation of information scrambling and can\nbe diagnosed by out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). However, the behavior of\nOTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly\nunderstood, with some semiclassical and large N models exhibiting exponential\ngrowth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wavefront and other random circuit models\nshowing a diffusively broadened wavefront. In this paper we propose a unified\nphysical picture for scrambling in chaotic local Hamiltonians. We construct a\nrandom time-dependent Hamiltonian model featuring a large N limit where the\nOTOC obeys a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type equation and\nexhibits exponential growth and a sharp wavefront. We show that quantum\nfluctuations manifest as noise (distinct from the randomness of the couplings\nin the underlying Hamiltonian) in the FKPP equation and that the noise-averaged\nOTOC exhibits a cross-over to a diffusively broadened wavefront. At small N we\ndemonstrate that operator growth dynamics, averaged over the random couplings,\ncan be efficiently simulated for all time using matrix product state\ntechniques. To show that time-dependent randomness is not essential to our\nconclusions, we push our previous matrix product operator methods to very large\nsize and show that data for a time-independent Hamiltonian model are also\nconsistent with a diffusively-broadened wavefront.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2018 18:50:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:37:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Shenglong", ""], ["Swingle", "Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.05380", "submitter": "Tabish Qureshi", "authors": "Prabuddha Roy, Tabish Qureshi", "title": "Path Predictability and Quantum Coherence in Multi-Slit Interference", "comments": "Expanded, published version", "journal-ref": "Physica Scripta 94, 095004 (2019)", "doi": "10.1088/1402-4896/ab1cd4", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an asymmetric multislit interference experiment, a quanton is more likely\nto pass through certain slits than some others.

It is shown that the use of a\nthree-partite GHZ state and measurements instead of their EPR counterparts\nallows the experimenter to detect $2/3$ of the times whenever one of the qubits\ninvolved in the measurement is affected by bit-flip noise through the mere\nobservation of unexpected outcomes in the teleportation and superdense coding\nprotocols when compared to the ideal case. It is shown that the use of\npost-selection after the detection of noise leads to an enhancement in the\nefficiency of the protocols. The idea is extended to any protocol using\nentangled states and measurements. Furthermore it is provided a generalization\nin which GHZ states and measurements with an arbitrary amount of qubits are\nused instead of EPR pairs, and remarkably, it is concluded that the optimal\nnumber of qubits is only three.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2018 20:37:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Moreno", "M.

As the\nreconstruction of quasiprobability distributions is possible with the help of\ntomograms accessible in the experiments, tomograms are computed here for both\nfinite and infinite dimensional systems. Finally, a set of controlled quantum\ncommunication (both insecure and secure) schemes with minimum number of\nentangled qubits has been proposed, which is also analyzed over Markovian\nchannels. The optimized controlled secure quantum communication scheme is\nobserved to be reducible to several cryptographic tasks. Using this interesting\nobservation, we obtained the performance of a set of cryptographic schemes over\nnon-Markovian channels, too.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 May 2018 08:12:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Thapliyal", "Kishore", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.07620", "submitter": "Qi Zhong", "authors": "Qi Zhong, Mercedeh Khajavikhan, Demetrios Christodoulides, Ramy\n  El-Ganainy", "title": "Winding around Non-Hermitian Singularities: General Theory and\n  Topological Features", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Non-Hermitian singularities are ubiquitous in non-conservative open systems.\nThese singularities are often points of measure zero in the eigenspectrum of\nthe system which make them difficult to access without careful engineering.\nDespite that, they can remotely induce observable effects when some of the\nsystem's parameters are varied along closed trajectories in the parameter\nspace.

For global vibrations, the\ncurrent exhibits {\\sl anti-resonances} as a function of the chromophore energy\ndifference, which are due to exciton-polaron interference.

Most\nessential property of Bose-Einstein ensemble is a formation, for growing number\nof bosons, of sharp asymmetric shape on the $c_N-T$ characteristics that is\nmore protrusive at the smaller Robin distances. This cusp-like structure is a\nmanifestation of the phase transition to the condensate state.

Here we\nshow thermodynamics as a consequence of information conservation. Our approach\ncan be applied to most general situations, where systems and thermal-baths\ncould be quantum, of arbitrary sizes and even could posses inter-system\ncorrelations. The approach does not rely on an a priori predetermined\ntemperature associated to a thermal bath, which is not meaningful for\nfinite-size cases. Hence, the thermal-baths and systems are not different,\nrather both are treated on an equal footing. This results in a\n\"temperature\"-independent formulation of thermodynamics. We exploit the fact\nthat, for a fix amount of coarse-grained information, measured by the von\nNeumann entropy, any system can be transformed to a state that possesses\nminimal energy, without changing its entropy. This state is known as a\ncompletely passive state, which assumes Boltzmann-Gibb's canonical form with an\nintrinsic temperature. This leads us to introduce the notions of bound and free\nenergy, which we further use to quantify heat and work respectively.

One consequence\nis the observation of quantum recurrences in systems with thousand of\ninteracting particles. The relaxation observed in 1D superfluids is universal\nfor a large class of many-body systems, those where the relevant physics can be\ndescribed by a set of 'long lived' collective modes. The time window where the\n'close to integrable' dynamics can be observed is given by the 'lifetime' of\nthe quasi-particles associated with the collective modes. Based on these\nobservations one can view (in a quantum field theory sense) a many-body quantum\nsystem at T=0 as 'vacuum' and its excitations as the system to experiment with.\nThis viewpoint leads to a new way to build thermal machines from the\nquasi-particles in 1D superfluids.

Far from equilibrium, universality\nis identified through the scaling of the spatiotemporal evolution of the\nsystem, captured by universal exponents and functions.

Therefore, the MDI property of TF-QKD can be understood clearly.\nImportantly, the universal security proof theories can be directly used for the\nTF-QKD, such as BB84, six-state and reference-frame-independent schemes.\nFurthermore, we propose a feasible experimental scheme for the\nproof-of-principle experimental demonstration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 14:32:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2018 02:33:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 17:39:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Hua-Lei", ""], ["Fu", "Yao", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12007", "submitter": "Hua-Lei Yin", "authors": "Hua-Lei Yin and Wei Zhu and Yao Fu", "title": "Phase self-aligned continuous-variable measurement-device-independent\n  quantum key distribution", "comments": "26 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports 9, 49 (2019)", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-36366-4", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Continuous-variable measurement-independent-device quantum key distribution\n(CV-MDI-QKD) can offer high secure key rate at metropolitan distance and remove\nall side channel loopholes of detection as well.

When events are defined with respect to quantum\nsystems however, nothing guarantees that the causal relationship between A and\nB is definite. We propose to associate a causal reference frame corresponding\nto each event, which can be interpreted as an observer-dependent time according\nto which an observer describes the evolution of quantum systems. In the causal\nreference frame of one event, this particular event is always localised, but\nother events can be \"smeared out\" in the future and in the past. We do not\nimpose a predefined causal order between the events, but only require that\ndescriptions from different reference frames obey a global consistency\ncondition. We show that our new formalism is equivalent to the pure process\nmatrix formalism. The latter is known to predict certain multipartite\ncorrelations, which are incompatible with the assumption of a causal ordering\nof the events -- these correlations violate causal inequalities. We show how\nthe causal reference frame description can be used to gain insight into the\nquestion of realisability of such strongly non-causal processes in laboratory\nexperiments.
