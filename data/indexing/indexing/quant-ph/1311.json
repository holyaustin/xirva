Louis de Broglie considers two solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, a singular and physical wave u representing the particle (soliton\nwave) and a regular wave representing probability (statistical wave). We return\nto the idea of two solutions, but in the form of an interpretation of the wave\nfunction based on two different preparations of the quantum system. We\ndemonstrate the necessity of this double interpretation when the particles are\nsubjected to a semi-classical field by studying the convergence of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation when the Planck constant tends to 0. For this\nconvergence, we reexamine not only the foundations of quantum mechanics but\nalso those of classical mechanics, and in particular two important paradox of\nclassical mechanics: the interpretation of the principle of least action and\nthe the Gibbs paradox. We find two very different convergences which depend on\nthe preparation of the quantum particles: particles called indiscerned\n(prepared in the same way and whose initial density is regular, such as atomic\nbeams) and particles called discerned (whose density is singular, such as\ncoherent states). These results are based on the Minplus analysis, a new branch\nof mathematics that we have developed following Maslov, and on the Minplus path\nintegral which is the analog in classical mechanics of the Feynman path\nintegral in quantum mechanics. The indiscerned (or discerned) quantum particles\nconverge to indiscerned (or discerned) classical particles and we deduce that\nthe de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is the correct interpretation for the\nindiscerned quantum particles (wave statistics) and the Schr\\\"odinger\ninterpretation is the correct interpretation for discerned quantum particles\n(wave soliton).

In QEC, information is\nredundantly stored in a large Hilbert space and one or more observables must be\nmonitored to reveal the occurrence of an error, without disturbing the\ninformation encoded in an unknown quantum state. Such observables, typically\nmulti-qubit parities such as <XXXX>, must correspond to a special symmetry\nproperty inherent to the encoding scheme.

So far, however, no fast and repeated\nmonitoring of an error syndrome has been realized. Here, we track the quantum\njumps of a possible error syndrome, the photon number parity of a microwave\ncavity, by mapping this property onto an ancilla qubit. This quantity is just\nthe error syndrome required in a recently proposed scheme for a\nhardware-efficient protected quantum memory using Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states in\na harmonic oscillator.

In contrast to previous work, we account for a\nstochastic turn-on time $t_i$ associated with the leading edge of a pulse\nsignaling one of the qubit states. This model is relevant to spin-qubit\nreadouts based on spin-to-charge conversion and would be generically reached in\nthe limit of large signal-to-noise ratio $r$ for several other physical\nsystems, including fluorescence-based readouts of ion-trap qubits and\nnitrogen-vacancy center spins.

In the\ntheoretical model, we consider two different physical mechanisms responsible\nfor the RF phase noise.

The answer may follow from the observation that in quantum theory,\nunlike in other theories, whenever there is an experiment to measure $A$\nsimultaneously with $B$, another to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to\nmeasure $A$ with $C$, there is always an experiment to measure all of them\nsimultaneously. This property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly\nirrelevant restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which,\nsurprisingly, explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental\nscenarios. An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum\nquantum violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally that\nthe E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the Bell-CHSH\ninequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum theory. For that, we\nuse the result of an independent experiment testing a specific\nnon-contextuality inequality. We perform both experiments: the Bell-CHSH\ninequality experiment on polarization entangled states of pairs of photons in\nStockholm and, to demonstrate independence, the non-contextuality inequality\nexperiment on single photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The\nobserved results provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle\ndetermines the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical\nsuper-quantum violations for either experiment would violate the E principle.\nThis supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental\nlimitation of nature.

We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated.

First, we address the LZ problem when one or both levels decay,\ni.e., $\\veps_j(t) \\to \\veps_j(t)-i \\Gamma_j/2$. We find that if the system\nevolves from an initial time $-T$ to a final time $+T$ such that $|\\veps_1(\\pm\nT)-\\veps_2(\\pm T)|$ is not too large, the LZ survival probability of a state $|\nj \\ra$ can {\\em increase} with increasing decay rate of the other state $|i \\ne\nj \\ra$.

On the\nother hand, if $|\\veps_1(\\pm T)-\\veps_2(\\pm T)| \\to \\infty$ as $T \\to \\infty$,\nthe probability is {\\em independent} of the decay rate. These results are based\non analytic solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equations for two\ncases: (a) the energy levels depend linearly on time, and (b) the energy levels\nare bounded and of the form $\\veps_{1,2}(t) = \\pm \\veps \\tanh (t/{\\cal T})$.\nSecond, we study LZ transitions affected by dephasing by formulating the\nLandau--Zener problem with noise in terms of a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Langevin\nstochastic coupled set of differential equations. The LZ survival probability\nthen becomes a random variable whose probability distribution is shown to\nbehave very differently for long and short dephasing times.

In our scheme a qubit interacts with a\nclassical stochastic field describing environmental noise and is then measured\nafter a given interaction time in order to estimate the characteristic\nparameters of the noise. In particular, we address estimation of the spectral\nparameters of two relevant kinds of non-Gaussian noise: random telegraph noise\nwith Lorentzian spectrum and colored noise with $1/f^{\\alpha}$ spectrum. We\ndiscuss the estimation precision achievable by quantum probes by analyzing in\ndetails the behavior of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a function of\nthe noise and the other parameters. We found that population measurement on the\nqubit is optimal for noise estimation and also evaluate the optimal interaction\ntimes for the quantum probe, i.e. the values maximizing the QFI and the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For random telegraph noise the QFI is inversely\nproportional to the square of the switching rate, meaning that the quantum\nsignal-to-noise ratio is constant and thus the switching rate may be uniformly\nestimated with the same precision in its whole range of variation. For colored\nnoise, the precision achievable in the estimation of ``color'', i.e. of the\nexponent $\\alpha$, strongly depends on the structure of the environment, i.e.\non the number of fluctuators describing the classical environment. For an\nenvironment modeled by a single random fluctuator estimation is more precise\nfor pink noise, i.e. for $\\alpha=1$, whereas by increasing the number of\nfluctuators, the QFI is has two local maxima, with the largest one drifting\ntowards $\\alpha=2$, i.e. brown noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Nov 2013 09:34:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Benedetti", "Claudia", ""], ["Buscemi", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Bordone", "Paolo", ""], ["Paris", "Matteo G.

The application\nof quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome the\nlimitations of the one-time pad encryption, which requires the key to have the\nsame length as the message.

Another implication of our technique is\nthe possibility of using {\\em insecure}\\/ resources.

According to the conventional collapse\nscenario, the coherent twin-peak atomic wavefunction in the beams of the\ninterferometer suffers an instantaneous collapse, at infinite speed, when the\natom is captured by one of the two detectors at the ends of the beams, but it\nremains coherent until that instant. In contrast, according to the\nHellwig-Kraus relativistic collapse scenario, the wavefunction collapses at the\nspeed of light, backward in time along the past light cone of each detector.\nThis leads to a premature collapse, or pre-collapse, which for a beam-to-beam\nseparation of 3 m extends over a time span of 10 ns before arrival at the\ndetectors. Within this time span the paired wavepackets in the two beams will\nbe incoherent. The difference between the coherent wavepackets of the\nconventional scenario and the incoherent wavepackets of the relativistic\nscenario can be tested by probing the atomic beams with a transverse laser beam\ncrossing them near the detectors.

The\nexperiment is performed on a sub-section of the SC lattice with three\nsuperconducting transmon qubits, in which two independent outer code qubits are\njoined to a central syndrome qubit via two linking bus resonators. With\nall-microwave high-fidelity single- and two-qubit nearest-neighbour entangling\ngates, we demonstrate entanglement distributed across the entire sub-section by\ngenerating a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with fidelity\n~94%. Then, via high-fidelity measurement of the syndrome qubit, we\ndeterministically entangle the otherwise un-coupled outer code qubits, in\neither an even or odd parity Bell state, conditioned on the syndrome state.\nFinally, to fully characterize this parity readout, we develop a new\nmeasurement tomography protocol to obtain a fidelity metric (90% and 91%). Our\nresults reveal a straightforward path for expanding superconducting circuits\ntowards larger networks for the SC and eventually a primitive logical qubit\nimplementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 15:20:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chow", "Jerry M.", ""], ["Gambetta", "Jay M.", ""], ["Magesan", "Easwar", ""], ["Srinivasan", "Srikanth J.", ""], ["Cross", "Andrew W.", ""], ["Abraham", "David W.", ""], ["Masluk", "Nicholas A.", ""], ["Johnson", "B.

One\npromising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in\nthe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit\nstates are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum\ninformation. They are the basis of the quantum repetition code prototypical of\nmore sophisticated schemes required for quantum computation. Using a\nthree-qubit Toffoli gate, this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct\neither bit- or phase-flip errors. Despite observing the expected behavior, the\noverall fidelity is low because of decoherence. A superior implementation of\ncQED replaces the transmission-line resonator with a three-dimensional box\nmode, increasing lifetimes by an order of magnitude.

In recently discovered quantum LDPC code families with finite\nrates the number of distinct classes of such extended defects is exponentially\nlarge, corresponding to extensive ground state entropy of these codes.\n  Here, the transition can be driven by the entropy of the extended defects, a\nmechanism distinct from that in the local spin models where the number of\ndefect types (domain walls) is always finite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 20:50:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 00:44:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kovalev", "Alexey A.", ""], ["Pryadko", "Leonid P.", ""]]}]
