The underlying goal\nis to improve our understanding of the concept of thermal equilibrium in\nquantum systems. First, I investigated the role played by observables and\nmeasurements in the emergence of thermal behaviour. This led to a new notion of\nthermal equilibrium which is specific for a given observable, rather than for\nthe whole state of the system. The equilibrium picture that emerges is a\ngeneralization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested in the\nstate of the system but only in the outcome of the measurement process. I\ninvestigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches\nfor the emergence of thermal behaviour in isolated quantum systems: the\nEigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study some\nequilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization\nphenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show\nthat we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the\nequilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the\nprocess led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the\ninteracting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the\n\"Concentration of Measure\" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of\nthe basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used\nto explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous\nphenomenon, at the macroscopic scale.

Assuming\nthat the atoms are independent, such a clock would benefit from a $\\sqrt{N}$\nenhancement in its stability, associated with the improved signal-to-noise\nratio of a large atom number $N$. An interesting question, however, is what\ntype of atomic interactions might affect the clock dynamics, and whether these\ninteractions are deleterious or could even be beneficial. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effect of dipole-dipole interactions, in which atoms excited\nduring the clock protocol emit and re-absorb photons. Taking a simple system\nconsisting of a 1D atomic array, we find that dipole-dipole interactions in\nfact result in an open quantum system exhibiting critical dynamics, as a set of\ncollective excitations acquires a decay rate approaching zero in the\nthermodynamic limit due to subradiance. A first consequence is that the decay\nof atomic excited population at long times exhibits a slow power-law behavior,\ninstead of the exponential expected for non-interacting atoms. We also find\nthat excitations among the atoms exhibit fermionic spatial correlations at long\ntimes, due to the microscopic properties of the multi-excitation subradiant\nstates. Interestingly, these properties cannot be captured by mean-field\ndynamics, suggesting the strongly interacting nature of this system. We finally\ncharacterize the time-dependent frequency shift in the atomic frequency\nmeasurement, and find that it is dominated by the interaction energy of\nsubradiant states at long times. Furthermore, we show that the decay of the\nclock signal displays at long times a non-exponential behavior, which might be\nuseful to improve the uncertainty limit with which the atomic frequency can be\nresolved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2018 09:52:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 17:13:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Henriet", "Lo\u00efc", ""], ["Douglas", "James S.", ""], ["Chang", "Darrick E.", ""], ["Albrecht", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.01143", "submitter": "Matteo Carlesso", "authors": "J.

Unlike many\nimplementations in homogeneously broadened media, these systems exhibit\ninhomogeneous broadening of their optical and spin transitions typical of\nsolid-state materials. We observe EIT lineshapes typical of atomic gases,\nincluding a crossover into the regime of Autler-Townes splitting, but with the\nsubstitution of the inhomogeneous widths for the homogeneous values. We obtain\nquantitative agreement between experiment and theory for the width of the\ntransparency feature over a range of optical powers and inhomogeneous\nlinewidths. We discuss regimes over which analytical and numerical treatments\ncapture the behavior. As solid-state systems become increasingly important for\nscalable and integratable quantum optical and photonic devices, it is vital to\nunderstand the effects of the inhomogeneous broadening that is ubiquitous in\nthese systems.

We consider the one-shot problem of distilling\npure coherence from a single instance of a given resource state. Specifically,\nwe determine the distillable coherence with a given fidelity under incoherent\noperations (IO) through a generalisation of the Winter-Yang protocol. This is\ncompared to the distillable coherence under maximal incoherent operations (MIO)\nand dephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO), which can be cast as a\nsemidefinite programme, that has been presented previously by Regula et al.\n[PRL 121, 010401 (2018)]. Our results are given in terms of a smoothed\nmin-relative entropy distance from the incoherent set of states, and a variant\nof the hypothesis-testing relative entropy distance, respectively. The one-shot\ndistillable coherence is also related to one-shot randomness extraction.\n  Moreover, from the one-shot formulas under IO, MIO, DIO, we can recover the\noptimal distillable rate in the many-copy asymptotics, yielding the relative\nentropy of coherence. These results can be compared with previous work by some\nof the present authors [Zhao et al., PRL 120, 070403 (2018)] on one-shot\ncoherence formation under IO, MIO, DIO and also SIO.

In\ncontrast to solid-state realizations, in ultracold atoms spin relaxation and\nthe decoherence from external sources is largely suppressed. As a consequence,\nonce the spin current is turned off by manipulating the internal spin degrees\nof freedom of the Fermi system, the nonequilibrium spin population remains\nconstant. Thus one can directly count the number of spins in each reservoir to\ninvestigate the full counting statistics of spin flips, which is notoriously\nchallenging in solid state devices. Moreover, using Ramsey interferometry, the\ndynamical impurity response can be measured. Since the impurity interacts with\na many-body environment that is out of equilibrium, our setup provides a way to\nrealize the non-equilibrium orthogonality catastrophe. Here, even for spin\nreservoirs initially prepared in a zero-temperature state, the Ramsey response\nexhibits an exponential decay, which is in contrast to the conventional\npower-law decay of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe.

And we\nshow that due to the competition between the unconventional interrogation-time\nquadratic phase accumulation and the exponential dephasing processes, the\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which is the optimal input state in\nnoiseless scenarios, leads to vanishing quantum Fisher information in the\nlarge-$N$ regime. Then our assessments are further extended to generic MWI\nschemes for quantum sensing with entangled states and under decoherence.\nFinally, a quantum error-correction logical GHZ state is tentatively analyzed,\nwhich could have the potential to recover the Heisenberg scaling and improve\nthe sensitivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Aug 2018 11:19:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 14:58:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Mar 2019 14:38:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Che", "Yanming", ""], ["Liu", "Jing", ""], ["Lu", "Xiao-Ming", ""], ["Wang", "Xiaoguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.04636", "submitter": "Anahit Gogyan", "authors": "Anahit Gogyan, Yuri Malakyan", "title": "Deterministic quantum state transfer between remote atoms with\n  photon-number superposition states", "comments": "Submitted to Phys.

In\ncontrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and\ndecrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

Rigorous lower and upper bounds are constructed for the\nSchr\\\"odinger energy levels of the hydrogen atom, $E_{\\ell,n}(\\varkappa)$, for\nall $\\ell\\in\\{0,1,2,...\\}$ and $n >\\ell$. The energy levels\n$E_{0,1}(\\varkappa)$, $E_{0,2}(\\varkappa)$, and $E_{1,2}(\\varkappa)$ are also\ncomputed numerically and plotted versus $\\varkappa^{-1}$. It is found that the\nBLTP theory predicts a non-relativistic correction to the splitting of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ line in addition to its well-known relativistic fine-structure\nsplitting. Under the assumption, that this splitting doesn't go away in a\nrelativistic calculation, it is argued that present-day precision measurements\nof the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line suggest that $\\varkappa^{-1}$ must be smaller than\n$\\approx 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Finite proton size effects are found not to\nmodify this conclusion. As a consequence, the electrostatic field energy of an\nelementary point charge, although finite in BLTP electrodynamics, is much\nlarger than the empirical rest energy of an electron. If, as assumed in all\n`renormalized theories' of the electron, the empirical rest mass of a physical\nelectron is the sum of its bare rest mass plus its electrostatic field energy\n($/c^2$), then in BLTP electrodynamics the electron has to be assigned a\nnegative bare rest mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Aug 2018 20:02:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2019 13:55:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Carley", "Holly K.", ""], ["Kiessling", "Michael K. -H.", ""], ["Perlick", "Volker", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.07555", "submitter": "Abhijeet Alase", "authors": "Emilio Cobanera, Abhijeet Alase, Gerardo Ortiz, and Lorenza Viola", "title": "Generalization of Bloch's theorem for arbitrary boundary conditions:\n  Interfaces and topological surface band structure", "comments": "20+9 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We treat the drives non-perturbatively using\nFloquet theory, and find that the interference of the two drives can strongly\nalter the system dynamics even in the regime where the rotating wave\napproximation applies.

This suggests that\nthere could be a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty\nPrinciple or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary\nparticles with $M < M_{P}$ and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the\npresence of $n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$ exceeding\nthe Planck length $R_P$, one expects $R_S \\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R_P < R <\nR_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may be restored in some\ncircumstances because the {\\it effective} Compton wavelength of a particle\ndepends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is\nspherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \\propto M^{-1}$, as in the\n$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the\nPlanck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black\nhole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function of a particle is\nasymmetric and has a scale $R_E$ in the extra dimensions, then $R_C \\propto\nM^{-1/(1+n)}$, so that the duality between $R_C$ and $R_S$ is preserved. In\nthis case, the effective Planck length is increased even more but the Planck\nmass is unchanged, so that TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes\ncannot be generated in collider experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions\ncould still have consequences for the detectability of black hole evaporations\nand the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.\nThough phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results\nare shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional\nuncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Aug 2018 09:18:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Lake", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Carr", "Bernard", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.08429", "submitter": "Ines Dutra", "authors": "Carla Silva, In\\^es Dutra, Marcus S.

We quantify\nthe effectiveness of our control by numerically computing the quantum Lyapunov\nexponent over a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate that adaptive\nmeasurement techniques can control the onset of chaos in the system, pushing\nthe quantum-classical boundary further into the quantum regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2018 12:45:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:39:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Eastman", "Jessica K.", ""], ["Szigeti", "Stuart S.", ""], ["Hope", "Joseph J.", ""], ["Carvalho", "Andr\u00e9 R.
