We find that transient chaos, besides\nbeing a physically meaningful phenomenon by itself, provides a resolution.\nUsing the method of quantum state diffusion to simulate the system dynamics\nsubject to continuous homodyne detection, we uncover transient chaos associated\nwith quantum trajectories. The transient behavior is consistent with chaos in\nthe classical limit, while the long term evolution of the quantum system is\nregular. Transient chaos thus serves as a bridge for the quantum-classical\ntransition (QCT). Strikingly, as the system transitions from the quantum to the\nclassical regime, the average chaotic transient lifetime increases dramatically\n(faster than the Ehrenfest time characterizing the QCT for isolated quantum\nsystems). We develop a physical theory to explain the scaling law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 22:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Guanglei", ""], ["Lai", "Ying-Cheng", ""], ["Grebogi", "Celso", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.00045", "submitter": "James Lim", "authors": "James Lim, David J.

We shed light on the power of detection\nof the cohomological obstruction by showing that it is not a complete invariant\nfor strong contextuality even under symmetry and connectedness restrictions on\nthe measurement cover, disproving a previous conjecture. We generalise\nobstructions to higher cohomology groups and show that they give rise to a\nrefinement of the notion of cohomological contextuality: different \"levels\" of\ncontextuality are organised in a hierarchy of logical implications. Finally, we\npresent an alternative description of the first cohomology group in terms of\ntorsors, resulting in a new interpretation of the cohomological obstructions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 11:14:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Car\u00f9", "Giovanni", "", "University of Oxford"]]}, {"id": "1701.00661", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Masanao Ozawa", "title": "Operational Meanings of Orders of Observables Defined through Quantum\n  Set Theories with Different Conditionals", "comments": "In Proceedings QPL 2016, arXiv:1701.00242", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 236, 2017, pp. 127-144", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.236.9", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In quantum logic there is well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary\noperation for conditional.

For $^{87}$Rb\natoms, with $N=10^{6}$, for example, the intereference would occur at a Compton\nfrequency of $\\sim$ $2 \\times 10^{31}$ Hz. Under this scheme, the signal is\nfound to depend critically on the parity of $N$. We present two variants of the\nprotocol. Under Protocol A, the fringes are narrowed by a factor of $N$ for one\nparity, while for the other parity the signal is zero. Under Protocol B, the\nfringes are narrowed by a factor of $N$ for one parity, and by a factor of\n$\\sqrt{N}$ for the other parity. Both protocols can be modified in a manner\nthat reverses the behavior of the signals for the two parities. Over repeated\nmeasurements under which the probability of being even or odd is equal, the\naveraged sensitivity is smaller than the HL by a factor of $\\sim$ $\\sqrt{2}$\nfor both versions of the protocol. We show that when the SC interferometer is\nconfigured as an accelerometer, the effective two-photon wave vector is\nenhanced by a factor of $N$, leading to the same degree of enhancement in\nsensitivity. We also show that such a mesoscopic single object can be used to\nincrease the effective base frequency of an atomic clock by a factor of $N$,\nwith a sensitivity that is equivalent to the HL, within a factor of $\\sim$\n$\\sqrt{2}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 05:07:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 08:29:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 05:50:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 15:44:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 24 May 2017 01:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 22:00:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 09:10:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 04:44:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2018 14:18:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sarkar", "Resham", ""], ["Fang", "Renpeng", ""], ["Shahriar", "Selim M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.01228", "submitter": "Nicolas Cherroret", "authors": "Nicolas Cherroret, Pierre-Philippe Cr\\'epin, Romaint Gu\\'erout, Astrid\n  Lambrecht, Serge Reynaud", "title": "Casimir-Polder force fluctuations as spatial probes of dissipation in\n  metals", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "EPL, 117 (2017) 63001", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/117/63001", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the spatial fluctuations of the Casimir-Polder force experienced by\nan atom or a small sphere moved above a metallic plate at fixed separation\ndistance.

Quantum tomography\n(QT) is the standard tool for diagnosing quantum states, process, and readout\ndevices by providing complete information. However, QT is limited since it is\nexpensive to not only implement experimentally, but also requires heavy\nclassical post-processing of data. In this dissertation, we introduce new\nmethods for QT that are more efficient to implement and robust to noise and\nerrors, thereby making QT a more practical tool for current quantum information\nexperiments.\n  The crucial detail that makes these new, efficient, and robust methods\npossible is prior information about the quantum system. This prior information\nis prompted by the goals of most experiments in quantum information, which\nrequire pure states, unitary processes, and rank-1 POVM operators. Therefore,\nmost experiments are designed to operate near this ideal regime. We show that\nwhen this is the case, QT can be accomplished with significantly fewer\nresources, and produce a robust estimate in the presence of noise and errors.\nMoreover, the estimate is also robust if the state is not exactly pure, the\nprocess is not exactly unitary, or the POVM is not exactly rank-1. Such\ncompelling methods are only made possible by the positivity constraint on\nquantum states, processes, and POVMs. This requirement is an inherent feature\nof quantum mechanics, but has powerful consequences to QT.\n  Since QT is necessarily an experimental tool, we discuss a test of these new\nmethods in an experimental setting.

Although\nthis definition has the advantage to be valid for fully quantum inputs and\ntasks, its interpretation for classical tasks remained rather obscure. Also,\nthe link between this new notion and other notions of information cost for\nquantum protocols that had previously appeared in the literature was not clear,\nif existent at all.\n  We settle both these issues: for quantum communication with classical inputs,\nwe provide an alternate characterization of QIC in terms of information about\nthe input registers, avoiding any reference to the notion of a purification of\nthe classical input state. We provide an exact operational interpretation of\nthis alternative characterization as the sum of the cost of transmitting\ninformation about the classical inputs and the cost of forgetting information\nabout these inputs. To obtain this characterization, we prove a general lemma,\nthe Information Flow Lemma, assessing exactly the transfer of information in\ngeneral interactive quantum processes. Furthermore, we clarify the link between\nQIC and IC of classical protocols by simulating quantumly classical protocols.\n  Finally, we apply these concepts to argue that any quantum protocol that does\nnot forget information solves Disjointness on n-bits in Omega (n)\ncommunication, completely losing the quadratic quantum speedup. This provides a\nspecific sense in which forgetting information is a necessary feature of\ninteractive quantum protocols. We also apply these concepts to prove that QIC\nat zero-error is exactly n for the Inner Product function, and n (1 - o(1)) for\na random Boolean function on n+n bits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 04:40:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lauriere", "Mathieu", ""], ["Touchette", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02092", "submitter": "Abdurahman \\c{C}etin", "authors": "A. \\c{C}etin", "title": "Exact Energy Levels and Eigenfunctions of an Electron on a Nanosphere\n  Under the Radial Magnetic Field", "comments": "4 Pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physb.2017.08.030", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The exact energy levels and wave functions of an electron free to move on a\nsphere under the radial magnetic field is found.

Optimal estimation allows one to\nachieve the most precise parameter estimates, but requires accurate knowledge\nof the model. Any inevitable uncertainty in the model parameters may heavily\ndegrade the quality of the estimate. It is therefore desired to make the\nestimation process robust to such uncertainties. Robust estimation was\npreviously studied for a varying phase, where the goal was to estimate the\nphase at some time in the past, using the measurement results from both before\nand after that time within a fixed time interval up to current time. Here, we\nconsider a robust guaranteed-cost filter yielding robust estimates of a varying\nphase in real time, where the current phase is estimated using only past\nmeasurements. Our filter minimizes the largest (worst-case) variance in the\nallowable range of the uncertain model parameter(s) and this determines its\nguaranteed cost. It outperforms in the worst case the optimal Kalman filter\ndesigned for the model with no uncertainty, that corresponds to the center of\nthe possible range of the uncertain parameter(s). Moreover, unlike the Kalman\nfilter, our filter in the worst case always performs better than the best\nachievable variance for heterodyne measurements, that we consider as the\ntolerable threshold for our system.

K. Burgarth et al., Nat.

In\nthis subspace even full controllability can be achieved, although the\ncontrollability over the system before the projection is very poor since the\ncontrol Hamiltonians commute with each other. We can also think of the\nopposite: any Hamiltonians of a quantum system, which are in general\nnoncommutative with each other, can be made commutative by embedding them in an\nextended Hilbert space, and thus the dynamics in the extended space becomes\ntrivial and simple. This idea of making noncommutative Hamiltonians commutative\nis called \"Hamiltonian purification.\" The original noncommutative Hamiltonians\nare recovered by projecting the system back onto the original Hilbert space\nthrough frequent measurements. Here we generalize this idea to open-system\ndynamics by presenting a simple construction to make Lindbladians, as well as\nHamiltonians, commutative on a larger space with an auxiliary system. We show\nthat the original dynamics can be recovered through frequently measuring the\nauxiliary system in a non-selective way. Moreover, we provide a universal pair\nof Lindbladians which describes an \"accessible\" open quantum system for generic\nsystem sizes. This allows us to conclude that through a series of frequent\nnon-selective measurements a nonaccessible open quantum system generally\nbecomes accessible.

Here we review\nrecent progress in the field with the development of methods including Centroid\nMolecular Dynamics (CMD), Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) and\nThermostatted RPMD (TRPMD). We show how these methods have recently been\nobtained from `Matsubara dynamics', a form of semiclassical dynamics which\nconserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. We also rederive t->0+ quantum\ntransition-state theory (QTST) in the Matsubara dynamics formalism showing that\nMatsubara-TST, like RPMD-TST, is equivalent to QTST.

In both cases, the upper bound is based\non a convex decomposition of the state into 'useful' and 'useless' quantum\nstates. By 'useful', we mean a state whose distillable entanglement is\nnon-negative and equal to its coherent information (and thus given by a\nsingle-letter, tractable formula).

We prove that in\nboth settings the distillable entanglement is convex on such decompositions.\nHence, an upper bound on the distillable entanglement is obtained from the\ncontributions of the useful states alone, being equal to the convex combination\nof their coherent informations. Optimizing over all such decompositions of the\ninput state yields our upper bound. The useful and useless states are given by\ndegradable and antidegradable states in the one-way LOCC setting, and by\nmaximally correlated and PPT states in the two-way LOCC setting, respectively.\nWe also illustrate how our method can be extended to quantum channels.\n  Interpreting our upper bound as a convex roof extension, we show that it\nreduces to a particularly simple, non-convex optimization problem for the\nclasses of isotropic states and Werner states. In the one-way LOCC setting,\nthis non-convex optimization yields an upper bound on the quantum capacity of\nthe qubit depolarizing channel that is strictly tighter than previously known\nbounds for large values of the depolarizing parameter.

Our main contribution is the analysis of a natural measurement\nmodel for this task: We assume that data is obtained by sending pure states\ninto the channel and measuring expectation values on the output. Neither\nancillary systems nor coherent operations across multiple channel uses are\nrequired. Most previous results on compressed process reconstruction reduce the\nproblem to quantum state tomography on the channel's Choi matrix.

It combines the variational quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) solution of the electronic part with the path integral (PI)\nformalism for the quantum nuclear dynamics. On the one hand, the PI molecular\ndynamics includes nuclear quantum effects by adding a set of fictitious\nclassical particles (beads) aimed at reproducing nuclear quantum fluctuations\nvia a harmonic kinetic term. On the other hand, variational QMC can provide\nBorn-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces with a precision comparable to\nthe most advanced post Hartree-Fock approaches, and with a favorable scaling\nwith the system size. To deal with the intrinsic QMC noise, we generalize the\nPI molecular dynamics using a Langevin thermostat correlated according to the\ncovariance matrix of QMC nuclear forces. The variational parameters of the QMC\nwave function are evolved during the nuclear dynamics, such that the BO\npotential energy surface is unbiased. Statistical errors on the wave function\nparameters are reduced by resorting to bead grouping average, which we show to\nbe accurate and well controlled. Our general algorithm relies on a Trotter\nbreakup between the dynamics driven by ionic forces and the one set by the\nharmonic interbead couplings. The latter is exactly integrated even in presence\nof the Langevin thermostat, thanks to the mapping onto an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. This framework turns out to be very efficient also in the case of\ndeterministic ionic forces. The new implementation is validated on the Zundel\nion by direct comparison with standard PI Langevin dynamics calculations made\nwith a coupled cluster potential energy surface.

As an\napplication, we find new spectral intertwining operators for the Hamiltonians\nof the hydrogen atom and the Rosen--Morse potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jan 2017 14:44:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 May 2017 00:55:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 02:04:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Houri", "Tsuyoshi", ""], ["Sakamoto", "Makoto", ""], ["Tatsumi", "Kentaro", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.04327", "submitter": "Ryuhei Mori", "authors": "Ryuhei Mori", "title": "Better Protocol for XOR Game using Communication Protocol and Nonlocal\n  Boxes", "comments": "21 pages + the title page", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Buhrman showed that an efficient communication protocol implies a reliable\nXOR game protocol.

In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques. Using a real data set,\nwe investigate the performance of a quantum annealer in solving the molecular\nsimilarity problem. We provide experimental evidence that common practices for\nembedding can be replaced by new alternatives which mitigate some of the\nhardware limitations and enhance its performance. Common practices for\nembedding include minimizing either the number of qubits or the chain length,\nand determining the strength of ferromagnetic couplers empirically. We show\nthat current criteria for selecting an embedding do not improve the hardware's\nperformance for the molecular similarity problem. Furthermore, we use a\ntheoretical approach to determine the strength of ferromagnetic couplers.

We apply this \"tensor network state\ncorrespondence\"---a correspondence between quantum many-body states mediated by\ntensor networks as we describe---to the multi-scale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of ground states of one\ndimensional (1D) quantum many-body systems. Since the MERA is a 2D hyperbolic\ntensor network (the extra dimension is identified as the length scale of the 1D\nsystem), the two quantum many-body states obtained from the MERA, via tensor\nnetwork state correspondence, are seen to live in the bulk and on the boundary\nof a discrete hyperbolic geometry. The bulk state so obtained from a MERA\nexhibits interesting features, some of which caricature known features of the\nholographic correspondence of String theory. We show how (i) the bulk state\nadmits a description in terms of \"holographic screens\", (ii) the conformal\nfield theory data associated with a critical ground state can be obtained from\nthe corresponding bulk state, in particular, how pointlike boundary operators\nare identified with extended bulk operators. (iii) We also present numerical\nresults to illustrate that bulk states, dual to ground states of several\ncritical spin chains, have exponentially decaying correlations, and that the\nbulk correlation length generally decreases with increase in central charge for\nthese spin chains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 17:27:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 14:20:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sukhwinder", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.04789", "submitter": "Antonia Karamatskou", "authors": "Antonia Karamatskou and Robin Santra", "title": "Time-dependent configuration-interaction-singles calculation of the\n  $5p$-subshell two-photon ionization cross section in xenon", "comments": "11 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.95.013415", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.atom-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The $5p$ two-photon ionization cross section of xenon in the photon-energy\nrange below the one-photon ionization threshold is calculated within the\ntime-dependent configuration-interaction-singles (TDCIS) method.

Understanding the physical aspects of the representative\nartificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the\napplications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here,\nwe study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a\nfocus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the\nentanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary\ndimensions and bipartition geometry.

We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys\nvolume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the\ncompletely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no\nuniversal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type\nlevel statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is\ncapable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model\nHamiltonian with long-range interaction.

Under the\npremise that the the allowed probabilistic models satisfy the No Signalling\nprinciple, Foulis and Randall defined the unique possible way to compose two\ncontextuality scenarios. When composing strictly-more than two test spaces,\nhowever, a variety of possible composition methods have been conceived.\nNevertheless, all these formally-distinct composition methods appear to give\nrise to observationally equivalent scenarios, in the sense that the different\ncompositions all allow precisely the same sets of classical and quantum\nprobabilistic models.

The\ninformation of a tilt in one of the mirrors of a modified Sagnac interferometer\nis carried by the phase difference between the counter propagating laser beams.\nUsing a small misalignment of the interferometer, orthogonal to the plane of\nthe tilt, a bimodal (or two-fringe) pattern is induced in the beam's transverse\npower distribution. By tracking the mean of such a distribution, using a split\ndetector, a sensitive measurement of the phase is performed. With 1.2 mW of\ncontinuous-wave laser power, the technique has a shot noise limited sensitivity\nof 56 frad/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$, and a measured noise floor of 200\nfrad/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ for tilt frequencies above 2 Hz. A tilt of 200 frad\ncorresponds to a differential displacement of 4.0 fm in our setup. The novelty\nof the protocol relies on signal amplification due to the misalignment, and on\ngood performance at low frequencies.

Spins naturally have magnetic dipoles, so\nalternating current (AC) magnetic fields are frequently used to drive spin\ntransitions and perform quantum gates. These fields can be difficult to\nspatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such\nas AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin\nqubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be\ndriven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by\ndemonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P\nand $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their\ndonor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field\ncontrol since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale. This leads\nto lower power requirements, higher qubit densities, and faster gate times. We\nalso show that this form of control allows for driving nuclear spin qubits at\neither their resonance frequency or the first subharmonic of that frequency,\nthus reducing device bandwidth requirements. Interestingly, as we relax the\nbandwidth requirements, we demonstrate that the computational Hilbert space is\nexpanded to include double quantum transitions, making it feasible to use all\nfour nuclear spin states to implement nuclear-spin-based qudits in Si:As.

This \\emph{suggests} the survival of entanglement in the high\ntemperature limit for different temperatures of the baths which is essentially\na consequence of the non-equilibrium nature of the asymptotic stationary state.\nAn out of equilibrium setup with small detuning and large $|T_1- T_2|$ produces\nnon-vanishing steady-state coherence and entanglement in the high temperature\nlimit of the baths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 16:37:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 13:55:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Boyanovsky", "Daniel", ""], ["Jasnow", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08773", "submitter": "Jogundas Armaitis", "authors": "J.

For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants.

We argue that physical space, and space-time, are\nemergent features of the Universe, which arise as a result of dynamical\ncollapse of the wave function. The starting point for this argument is the\nobservation that classical time is external to quantum theory, and there ought\nto exist an equivalent reformulation which does not refer to classical time. We\npropose such a reformulation, based on a non-commutative special relativity. In\nthe spirit of Trace Dynamics, the reformulation is arrived at, as a statistical\nthermodynamics of an underlying classical dynamics in which matter and\nnon-commuting space-time degrees of freedom are matrices obeying arbitrary\ncommutation relations. Inevitable statistical fluctuations around equilibrium\ncan explain the emergence of classical matter fields and classical space-time,\nin the limit in which the universe is dominated by macroscopic objects. The\nunderlying non-commutative structure of space-time also helps understand better\nthe peculiar nature of quantum non-locality, where the effect of wave-function\ncollapse in entangled systems is felt across space-like separations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:08:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Tejinder P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.09144", "submitter": "Wellison Peixoto Bastos", "authors": "Fabricio Toscano, Wellison P.

In a generic case, we observe the growth of the OTOC\ndensity to be linear in time. We prove that this density in general, locally\ninteracting, non-integrable quantum spin and fermionic dynamical systems\nexhibits growth that is at most polynomial in time---a phenomenon, which we\nterm weak quantum chaos.
