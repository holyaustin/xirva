After the fast decay of most\nof the fluorescence, we detect a very slow decay, with time constants as long\nas 100 times the natural lifetime of the excited state of individual atoms.\nThis subradiant time constant scales linearly with the cooperativity parameter,\ncorresponding to the on-resonance optical depth of the sample, and is\nindependent of the laser detuning, as expected from a coupled-dipole model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 11:13:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 12:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 12:20:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 14:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Guerin", "William", "", "INLN"], ["Ara\u00fajo", "Michelle O.", "", "INLN, FUP"], ["Kaiser", "Robin", "", "INLN"]]}, {"id": "1509.00246", "submitter": "Boye Buyens", "authors": "Boye Buyens, Jutho Haegeman, Henri Verschelde, Frank Verstraete, Karel\n  Van Acoleyen", "title": "Confinement and string breaking for QED$_2$ in the Hamiltonian picture", "comments": "More consistent notation to indicate site-dependence for MPS and some\n  tiny corrections; matching its published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In spite of the fact that, the system seems to be\ncomplicated, under initial conditions which may be prepared for the atoms\n(coherent superposition of their ground and upper states) and the field\n(coherent state), the explicit form of the state vector of the entire system is\nanalytically obtained. Then, the entanglement dynamics between different\nsubsystems (i.e. \"field-two atoms\", \"atom-(field+atom)\" and \"atom-atom\") are\nevaluated through appropriate measures like von Neumann entropy, tangle and\nconcurrence. In addition, the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, deformed\nKerr medium, detuning parameter, deformed Stark shift and multi-photon process\non the considered entanglement measures are numerically analyzed, in detail. It\nis shown that the degree of entanglement between subsystems can be controlled\nby selecting the evolved parameters, suitably. Briefly, the Kerr medium highly\ndecreases the amount of different considered measures of entanglement,\nespecially for two-photon transition. This destructive effect preserves even\nwhen all other parameters are present, too. Furthermore, we find that the\nso-called entanglement sudden death and birth can occur in the atom-atom\nentanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 07:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Baghshahi", "H.

In the regime where the\nsemiclassical mean-field theory predicts bistability, the exact steady-state\ndensity matrix is known to be unique, being a statistical mixture of two\nstates: in particular, no static hysteresis cycle of the excited population\noccurs as a function of the driving intensity. Here, we predict that in the\nquantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when\nsweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a\nfunction of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior\nqualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis\npower-law in the slow sweep limit defines a characteristic time, which depends\ndramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning\nbetween the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the\ncharacteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters\ndue to multiphotonic resonances. We show that the dynamic hysteresis for the\nconsidered class of driven-dissipative systems is due to a non-adiabatic\nresponse region with connections to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for quenched\nphase transitions. We also consider the case of two coupled driven-dissipative\nnonlinear resonators, showing that dynamic hysteresis and power-law behavior\noccur also in presence of correlations between resonators.

Compared with\nsqueezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features\nthat arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity\nand polarization of the guided modes. We use a first principles stochastic\nmaster equation to model the squeezing as function of time in the presence of\ndecoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological squeezing of ~5\ndB is achievable with current technology for ~2500 atoms trapped 180 nm from\nthe surface of a nanofiber with radius a=225 nm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 03:40:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 22:05:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 18:41:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Qi", "Xiaodong", ""], ["Baragiola", "Ben Q.", ""], ["Jessen", "Poul S.", ""], ["Deutsch", "Ivan H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.02629", "submitter": "Hendra Nurdin", "authors": "O.

We\nprovide explicit prescriptions to characterize the most reliable states\nmaximizing the average skew information, and elucidate the role of state\npurity, separability and correlations in the classification of optimal probes.\nOur results can help in the identification of useful resources for sensing,\nestimation and discrimination applications when complete knowledge of the\ninteraction mechanism realizing the local transformation is unavailable, and\naccess to pure entangled probes is technologically limited.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 21:13:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 14:28:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Farace", "Alessandro", ""], ["De Pasquale", "Antonella", ""], ["Adesso", "Gerardo", ""], ["Giovannetti", "Vittorio", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.04341", "submitter": "Evgenii Glushkov", "authors": "Evgenii Glushkov, Anastasiia Glushkova and V.

Exploiting a connection with\nthe theory of matrix algebras, we derive two structural properties shared by\nall hMPS, namely: a) there exist local operators which annihilate all hMPS of a\ngiven bond dimension; and b) there exist local operators which, when applied\nover any hMPS of a given bond dimension, decouple (cut) the particles where\nthey act from the spin chain while at the same time join (glue) the two loose\nends back again into a hMPS.

We illustrate the versatility of our system by\nstudying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field\nwith up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions,\nand for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the\nanisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement\nwith ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly\nanisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a\nmeasurable influence.

This assumes that the\nclassical motions for given initial data are unique. In fluid turbulence\nnon-uniqueness due to \"roughness\" of the advecting velocity field is known to\nlead to stochastic motion of classical particles. Vanishingly small random\nperturbations are magnified by Richardson diffusion in a \"nearly rough\"\nvelocity field so that motion remains stochastic as the noise disappears, or\nclassical spontaneous stochasticity, . Analogies between stochastic particle\nmotion in turbulence and quantum evolution suggest that there should be quantum\nspontaneous stochasticity (QSS).

The limit of the position density is\nnon-deterministic, with equal probabilities of the particle following either of\ntwo, non-unique classical solutions and with \"Richardson-like\" spreading of the\nwave-packet.

We wish instead to take\nadvantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate \"quantumness\" in the\nsystem-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued\nby us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the\nbath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal\nquasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest\nby the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively).

By contrast, AZE-based control is useful\nfor fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling\nof quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom\ncoupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows\nto drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the\nmediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to\nachieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the\nconventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness.

In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of\nideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we\npresent a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and\nsome of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of\nenergy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables.\nBuilding on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe\nthermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an\nexternal bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from\nstudies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench\nas a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results\nof numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review\nexplores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic\nthermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of\nthermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems,\nand the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum\nchaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian\neigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles.\nWe then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal\nenergy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review,\nwe briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of\nintegrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated.

Here we provide a\nquantitative definition of the variance of quantum coherent fluctuations (the\nquantum variance) of any observable on generic quantum states. The quantum\nvariance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the\nposition of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any\nobservable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space.\nThe quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference\nbetween the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the\nobservable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound\nto most widely accepted estimators of \"quantumness\" of observables (both as a\nfeature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and\nthe quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an\nextended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum\ncorrelations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body\nsystems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending\ntherefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to\nthe mixed-state context. Hence the quantum variance paves the way to the\nmeasurement of macroscopic quantum coherence and quantum correlations in most\ncomplex quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 19:35:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 07:21:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fr\u00e9rot", "Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e", ""], ["Roscilde", "Tommaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.06763", "submitter": "Philippe Faist", "authors": "Philippe Faist and Renato Renner", "title": "Practical, Reliable Error Bars in Quantum Tomography", "comments": "Journal version; 4+13 pages, 3+6 figures, 1 table.

We further show that when the\nlow-energy inelastic collision between two ultracold atoms is suppressed by\nthis effect, the real part of the elastic scattering length between the atoms\nis still possible to be much larger than the range of inter-atomic\ninteraction.In addition, when open scattering channels are coupled to two bound\nstates, with the help of the Fano effect, independent control of the elastic\nand inelastic scattering amplitudes of two ultracold atoms can be achieved.\nPossible experimental realizations of our scheme are also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 17:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Jie", "Jianwen", ""], ["Zhang", "Yawen", ""], ["Zhang", "Peng", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07456", "submitter": "Alexander Streltsov", "authors": "Alexander Streltsov, Swapan Rana, Manabendra Nath Bera, Maciej\n  Lewenstein", "title": "Towards resource theory of coherence in distributed scenarios", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in Physical Review X", "journal-ref": "Phys.

One example for such an abstraction can be\nfound in the distance lab paradigm: if two separated parties are connected via\na classical channel, it is notoriously difficult to characterize all possible\noperations these parties can perform. This class of operations is widely known\nas local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Surprisingly, the\nsituation becomes comparably simple if the more general class of separable\noperations is considered, a finding which has been extensively used in quantum\ninformation theory for many years. Here, we propose a related approach for the\nresource theory of quantum coherence, where two distant parties can only\nperform measurements which do not create coherence and can communicate their\noutcomes via a classical channel. We call this class local incoherent\noperations and classical communication (LICC). While the characterization of\nthis class is also difficult in general, we show that the larger class of\nseparable incoherent operations (SI) has a simple mathematical form, yet still\npreserving the main features of LICC.

This\nresult represents a significant advance in non-Hermitian optics by bridging a\nfirm connection with the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where\nnovel phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by\n(anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 14:29:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Peng", ""], ["Cao", "Wanxia", ""], ["Shen", "Ce", ""], ["Qu", "Weizhi", ""], ["Wen", "Jianming", ""], ["Jiang", "Liang", ""], ["Xiao", "Yanhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07766", "submitter": "Or Sattath", "authors": "Or Sattath, Siddhardh C.

Frustration-free Hamiltonians, in turn, play a\ncentral role for constructing and understanding new phases of matter in quantum\nmany-body physics. Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known\nto be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly\ndesirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at\nleast, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion - a\nsufficient condition - under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be\nfrustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory\nto the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a\nfully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the\nHamiltonian's interaction graph which, as a statistical mechanics problem, is\nof interest in its own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local\nHamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of\nspin glass physics which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT\ntransition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural\nconjectures for when such bounds will be tight, as well as to a novel notion of\nuniversality for these computer science problems. Besides providing concrete\nalgorithms leading to detailed and quantitative insights, this underscores the\npower of marrying classical statistical mechanics with quantum computation and\ncomplexity theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:51:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 May 2016 11:39:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sattath", "Or", ""], ["Morampudi", "Siddhardh C.", ""], ["Laumann", "Christopher R.", ""], ["Moessner", "Roderich", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07767", "submitter": "Igor Pikovski", "authors": "Igor Pikovski, Magdalena Zych, Fabio Costa, \\v{C}aslav Brukner", "title": "Brief reply to \"Can gravity account for the emergence of classicality?\"", "comments": "1 page", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "gr-qc quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a series of comments, Bonder et al. criticized our work on decoherence due\nto time dilation [Nature Physics 11, 668-672 (2015)].

Understanding gradual weak measurements\nrequires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the\ncollapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs.

In contrast very few results for\nbipartite systems whose subsystems are of arbitrary dimensions, are known. This\nis because a rich variety of (algebraic or geometric) structure is exhibited by\ndifferent sets of orthogonal states owing to which it is difficult to associate\nsome common property underlying them all, i.e., a common property that would\nplay a crucial role in the local distinguishability of these states.

I show that if the $i$-th party (where $i=A,B$) can\ninitiate a $1$-LOCC protocol to perfectly distinguish among a set of orthogonal\nbipartite states, then the information of the existence of such a $1$-LOCC\nprotocol lies in a subspace of $d_i \\times d_i$ hermitian matrices, denoted by\n$\\Tb^{(i)}$, and that the method to extract this information (of the existence\nof this $1$-LOCC protocol) from $\\Tb^{(i)}$ depends on the value of $dim\n\\Tb^{(i)}$. In this way one can give sweeping results for the $1$-LOCC\n(in)distinguishability of all sets of orthogonal bipartite states corresponding\nto certain values of $dim \\Tb^{(i)}$.

Then, we decompose a generic quantum\noperation into three basic operations, namely, unitary, appending and dismissal\noperations, and show that the cohering power of any quantum operation is upper\nbounded by the corresponding unitary operation. Furthermore, we compare\ncohering power and generalized cohering power of quantum operations for\ndifferent measures of coherence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 10:09:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2015 03:30:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 09:42:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 02:42:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 04:05:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 08:11:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 14:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bu", "Kaifeng", ""], ["Kumar", "Asutosh", ""], ["Zhang", "Lin", ""], ["Wu", "Junde", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09123", "submitter": "Fabian Furrer", "authors": "Fabian Furrer, Christian Schaffner and Stephanie Wehner", "title": "Continuous-Variable Protocols in the Noisy-Storage Model", "comments": "15 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the first protocol for oblivious transfer that can be implemented\nwith an optical continuous-variable system, and prove its security in the\nnoisy-storage model.
