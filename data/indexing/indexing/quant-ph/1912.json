Using\nquantum reduction maps, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between\nthree approaches to relational quantum dynamics: 1) relational observables in\nthe clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantization, 2) Page and Wootters' (PW)\nSchr\\\"odinger picture formalism, and 3) the relational Heisenberg picture\nobtained via symmetry reduction. Constituting three faces of the same dynamics,\nwe call this equivalence the trinity. We develop a quantization procedure for\nrelational Dirac observables using covariant POVMs which encompass non-ideal\nclocks. The quantum reduction maps reveal this procedure as the quantum analog\nof gauge-invariantly extending gauge-fixed quantities. We establish algebraic\nproperties of these relational observables. We extend a recent clock-neutral\napproach to changing temporal reference frames, transforming relational\nobservables and states, and demonstrate a clock dependent temporal nonlocality\neffect. We show that Kucha\\v{r}'s criticism, alleging that the conditional\nprobabilities of the PW formalism violate the constraint, is incorrect. They\nare a quantum analog of a gauge-fixed description of a gauge-invariant quantity\nand equivalent to the manifestly gauge-invariant evaluation of relational\nobservables in the physical inner product. The trinity furthermore resolves a\npreviously reported normalization ambiguity and clarifies the role of\nentanglement in the PW formalism. The trinity finally permits us to resolve\nKucha\\v{r}'s criticism that the PW formalism yields wrong propagators by\nshowing how conditional probabilities of relational observables give the\ncorrect transition probabilities. Unlike previous proposals, our resolution\ndoes not invoke approximations, ideal clocks or ancilla systems, is manifestly\ngauge-invariant, and easily extends to an arbitrary number of conditionings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 19:00:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Jul 2020 08:38:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2021 03:49:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hoehn", "Philipp A.", ""], ["Smith", "Alexander R.

The upper bound of expected queries as well as the optimal parameters\nare derived. Compared with Yoder's algorithm, the query complexity of our\nalgorithm indeed achieves the optimal scaling in $\\lambda$ for quantum search,\nwhich reconfirms the practicality of the fixed-point method. In addition, our\nalgorithm also does not contain randomness, and compared with the existing\ndeterministic algorithm, the query complexity can be reduced by about 1/3. Our\nwork provides an new idea for the research on fixed-point and trial-and-error\nquantum search.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Dec 2019 02:28:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Tan", ""], ["Zhang", "Shuo", ""], ["Fu", "Xiang-Qun", ""], ["Wang", "Xiang", ""], ["Wang", "Yang", ""], ["Lin", "Jie", ""], ["Bao", "Wan-Su", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.01807", "submitter": "Tao Li", "authors": "Tao Li, Le-Min Lai, Shao-Ming Fei and Zhi-Xi Wang", "title": "Mutually unbiased measurement based entanglement witnesses", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": "Int.

Non-initiator determinants (i.e. determinants whose population is\nbelow the initiator threshold) are subject to a systematic {\\em undersampling}\nbias, which in large systems leads to a bias in the energy when an insufficient\nnumber of walkers is used. We show that the acceptance probability ($p_{acc}$),\nthat a non-initiator determinant has its spawns accepted, can be used to unbias\nthe initiator bias, in a simple and accurate manner, by reducing the applied\nshift to the non-initiator proportionately to $p_{acc}$.

As a consequence of the critical\nslowing down, its state cannot follow local equilibrium, and its evolution\nbecomes non-adiabatic near the critical point. In the simplest approximation,\nthat stage can be regarded as \"impulse\" where the state of the system remains\nunchanged. It leads to the correct KZM scaling laws. However, such \"freeze-out\"\nmight suggest that the coherence length of the nascent order parameter remains\nunchanged as the critical region is traversed. By contrast, the original\ncausality-based discussion emphasized the role of the {\\it sonic horizon}:\ndomains of the broken symmetry phase can expand with a velocity limited by the\nspeed of the relevant sound. This effect was demonstrated in the quantum Ising\nchain where the dynamical exponent $z=1$ and quasiparticles excited by the\ntransition have a fixed speed of sound. To elucidate the role of the sonic\nhorizon, in this paper we study two systems with $z>1$ where the speed of sound\nis no longer fixed, and the fastest excited quasiparticles set the size of the\nsonic horizon. Their effective speed decays with the increasing transition\ntime. In the extreme case, the dynamical exponent $z$ can diverge such as in\nthe Griffiths region of the random Ising chain where localization of excited\nquasiparticles freezes the growth of the correlation range when the critical\nregion is traversed. Of particular interest is an example with $z<1$ -- the\nlong-range extended Ising chain, where there is no upper limit to the velocity\nof excited quasiparticles with small momenta.

We found two\nmain factors that determine the modification of the reaction rate: the relative\nshifts of the energy levels induced by the coupling and the mixing of the\nground and excited states of molecular vibration in the ground state of the\nhybrid molecule-plus-cavity system through which the Franck-Condon factor\nbetween the initial and final states of the transition is altered. The former\nis the dominant factor if the molecule-cavity coupling strengths for the\nreactant and product states differ significantly from each other and gives rise\nto an increase in the reaction rate over a wide range of system's parameters.\nThe latter dominates if the coupling strengths and energy levels of the\nreactant and product states are close to each other and it leads to a decrease\nin the reaction rate. The effect of the mixing of molecular vibrational states\non the reaction rate is, however, suppressed in a system containing a large\nnumber of molecules due to the collective nature of the resulting polariton,\nand thus should be observed in a system containing a small number of molecules.\nIn contrast, the effect of the relative shifts of the energy levels should be\nessentially independent of the number of molecules coupled to the cavity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Dec 2019 02:08:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jan 2020 07:56:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2020 03:04:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Phuc", "Nguyen Thanh", ""], ["Trung", "Pham Quang", ""], ["Ishizaki", "Akihito", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.02977", "submitter": "Mark Saffman", "authors": "M.

He proposed\nto differentiate quantum and classical phenomena and entanglement not by their\nrespective nonlocality and locality, as is common, but by the discreteness of\nquantum phenomena vs. the continuity of classical phenomena, supplemented by\nBohr's complementarity in the case of quantum phenomena. As I argue here,\nhowever, the question may not be that of \"eliminating the issue of quantum\nnonlocality\" but instead of illuminating this issue, a task that can, I also\nargue, be pursued by relating quantum nonlocality to other key features of\nquantum phenomena. I suggest that the following features of quantum phenomena\nand quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical phenomena and\nclassical physics--(1) the irreducible role of measuring instruments in\ndefining quantum phenomena; (2) discreteness; (3) complementarity; (4)\nentanglement; (5) quantum nonlocality; and (6) the irreducibly probabilistic\nnature of quantum predictions--are all interconnected in defining quantum\nphenomena and distinguishing them from classical ones, so that it is difficult\nto give an unconditional priority to any one of them. To argue this case, I\nconsider quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics from a nonrealist or, in terms\nadopted here, \"reality-without-realism\" (RWR) perspective.

Given two arbitrary tensor-product quantum states (TPQS)\n$\\rho_{\\pm} = \\rho_{\\pm}^{(1)} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\rho_{\\pm}^{(N)}$,\ndetermining the joint $N$-system measurement to optimally distinguish between\nthe two states is a hard problem. Thus, there is great interest in identifying\nlocal measurement schemes that are optimal or close-to-optimal. In this work,\nwe focus on distinguishing between two general TPQS. We begin by generalizing\nprevious work by Acin et al. (Phys. Rev. A 71, 032338) to show that a locally\ngreedy (LG) scheme using Bayesian updating can optimally distinguish between\ntwo states that can be written as tensor products of arbitrary pure states.\nThen, we show that even in the limit of large $N$ the same algorithm cannot\ndistinguish tensor products of mixed states with vanishing error probability.\nThis poor asymptotic behavior occurs because the Helstrom measurement becomes\ntrivial for sufficiently biased priors. Based on this, we introduce a modified\nlocally greedy (MLG) scheme with strictly better performance.\n  In the second part of this work, we compare these simple local schemes with a\ngeneral dynamic programming (DP) approach that finds the optimal series of\nlocal measurements to distinguish the two states. When the subsystems are\nnon-identical, we demonstrate that the ordering of the systems affects\nperformance and we extend the DP technique to determine the optimal ordering\nadaptively. Finally, in contrast to the binary optimal collective measurement,\nwe show that adaptive protocols on sufficiently large (e.g., qutrit) subsystems\nmust contain non-binary measurements to be optimal.

The theorem states through an experimentally testable\ninequality that the predictions of quantum mechanics for the Bell's\npolarization states of two entangled particles cannot be reproduced by any\nstatistical model of hidden variables that shares certain intuitive features.\nIn this paper, we show, however, that the proof of the Bell's theorem involves\na subtle, though crucial, assumption that is not required by fundamental\nphysical principles and, hence, it is not necessarily fulfilled in the\nexperimental setup that tests the inequality. In fact, this assumption can\nneither be properly implemented within the standard framework of quantum\nmechanics. Namely, the proof of the theorem assumes that there exists a\npreferred absolute frame of reference, supposedly provided by the lab, which\nenables to compare the orientation of the polarization measurement devices for\nsuccessive realizations of the experiment and, hence, to define jointly their\nresponse functions over the space of hypothetical hidden configurations for all\ntheir possible alternative settings. We notice, however, that only the relative\norientation between the two measurement devices in every single realization of\nthe experiment is a properly defined physical degree of freedom, while their\nglobal rigid orientation is a spurious gauge degree of freedom.

The aim of this investigation is the\noptimization of cold-atom experiments in terms of reducing the dead time for\nquantum sensing using atom interferometry. We develop a calibration method to\nimprove the precision in pressure measurements via the ion current in SIPs. Our\nmethod is based on a careful analysis of the gas conductance and pumping in\norder to reliably link the pressure readings at the SIP with the actual\npressure in the vacuum (science) chamber. Our results are in agreement with the\nexistence of essentially two pumping regimes determined by the pressure level\nin the system. In particular, we find our results in agreement with the\nwell-known fact that for a given applied voltage, at low pressures, the\ndischarge current efficiently sputters pumping material from the pump's\nelectrodes. This process sets the leading pumping mechanism in this limit. At\nhigh pressures, the discharge current drops and the pumping is mainly performed\nby the already sputtered material.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Dec 2019 13:56:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Jean-Marc", ""], ["Bade", "Satyanarayana", ""], ["Dubosclard", "William", ""], ["Khan", "Murtaza Ali", ""], ["Kim", "Seungjin", ""], ["Garraway", "Barry M.", ""], ["Alzar", "Carlos L.

Various constructions of monotones appear in many\ndifferent concrete resource theories. How general are these constructions? What\nare the necessary conditions on a resource theory for a given construction to\nbe applicable? To answer these questions, we introduce a broad scheme for\nconstructing monotones. It involves finding an order-preserving map from the\npreorder of resources of interest to a distinct preorder for which nontrivial\nmonotones are previously known or can be more easily constructed; these\nmonotones are then pulled back through the map. In one of the two main classes\nwe study, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of sets of\nresources, where the order relation is set inclusion, such that monotones can\nbe defined via maximizing or minimizing the value of a function within these\nsets. In the other class, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of\ntuples of resources, and one pulls back monotones that measure the amount of\ndistinguishability of the different elements of the tuple (hence its\ninformation content). Monotones based on contractions arise naturally in the\nlatter class, and, more surprisingly, so do weight and robustness measures.

The model implements a\nminimum length and a minimum linear momentum, and recovers both the generalised\nuncertainty principle (GUP) and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) within\na single formalism. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of these\nresults for particles with extrinsic and intrinsic angular momentum, and obtain\ngeneralisations of the canonical ${\\rm so(3)}$ and ${\\rm su(2)}$ algebras. We\nfind that, although ${\\rm SO(3)}$ symmetry is preserved on three-dimensional\nslices of an enlarged phase space, individual subcomponents of the generalised\ngenerators obey nontrivial subalgebras.

The value of the new\nparameter, $\\beta \\simeq \\hbar \\times 10^{-61}$, is determined by the ratio of\nthe dark energy density to the Planck density. Here, we assume the former to be\nof the order of the Planck length and the latter to be of the order of the de\nSitter momentum $\\sim \\hbar\\sqrt{\\Lambda}$, where $\\Lambda$ is the cosmological\nconstant. In the smeared-space model, $\\hbar$ and $\\beta$ are interpreted as\nthe quantisation scales for matter and geometry, respectively, and a quantum\nstate vector is associated with the spatial background. We show that this also\ngives rise to a rescaled Lie algebra for generalised spin operators, together\nwith associated subalgebras that are analogous to those for orbital angular\nmomentum. Remarkably, consistency of the algebraic structure requires the\nquantum state associated with a flat background to be fermionic, with spin\neigenvalues $\\pm \\beta/2$.

They transform the evolution operator into a form\nimplementable on a quantum device, while incurring an error---the Trotter\nerror. The Trotter error can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the\nTrotter number. However, this increases the length of the quantum circuits\nrequired, which may be impractical. It is therefore desirable to find methods\nof reducing the Trotter error through alternate means. The Trotter error is\ndependent on the order in which individual term unitaries are applied. Due to\nthe factorial growth in the number of possible orderings with respect to the\nnumber of terms, finding an optimal strategy for ordering Trotter sequences is\ndifficult. In this paper, we propose three ordering strategies, and assess\ntheir impact on the Trotter error incurred. Initially, we exhaustively examine\nthe possible orderings for molecular hydrogen in a STO-3G basis. We demonstrate\nhow the optimal ordering scheme depends on the compatibility graph of the\nHamiltonian, and show how it varies with increasing bond length. We then use 44\nmolecular Hamiltonians to evaluate two strategies based on coloring their\nincompatibility graphs, while considering the properties of the obtained\ncolorings. We find that the Trotter error for most systems involving heavy\natoms, using a reference magnitude ordering, is less than 1 kcal/mol. Relative\nto this, the difference between ordering schemes can be substantial, being\napproximately on the order of millihartrees.

Recent methods have shown how to efficiently estimate\nHamiltonians in principle, but they are poorly conditioned and can only\ncharacterize the system up to a scalar factor, making them difficult to use in\npractice. In this work we present a Bayesian methodology, called Bayesian\nHamiltonian Learning (BHL), that addresses both of these issues by making use\nof any or all, of the following: well-characterised experimental control of\nHamiltonian couplings, the preparation of multiple states, and the availability\nof any prior information for the Hamiltonian. Importantly, BHL can be used\nonline as an adaptive measurement protocol, updating estimates and their\ncorresponding uncertainties as experimental data become available. In addition,\nwe show that multiple input states and control fields enable BHL to reconstruct\nHamiltonians that are neither generic nor spatially local.

In\nparticular, we consider two heavy electrons interacting with a two-dimensional\nlattice crystal in a magnetic field, and show that when the impurity-bath\nsystem is rotated at the cyclotron frequency, impurities behave as anyons as a\nconsequence of the angular momentum exchange between the impurities and the\nbath.

We can\ndetermine this wedge, which we call a CFT wedge, by computing a\ndistinguishability measure. We find that CFT wedges defined by the fidelity or\nBures distance as a distinguishability measure, coincide perfectly with shadows\nof entanglement wedges in AdS/CFT. We confirm this agreement between CFT wedges\nand entanglement wedges for two dimensional holographic CFTs where the\nsubsystem is chosen to be an interval or double intervals, as well as higher\ndimensional CFTs with a round ball subsystem. On the other hand if we consider\na free scalar CFT, we find that there are no sharp CFT wedges. This shows that\nsharp entanglement wedges emerge only for holographic CFTs owing to the large N\nfactorization. We also generalize our analysis to a time-dependent example and\nto a holographic boundary conformal field theory (AdS/BCFT). Finally we study\nother distinguishability measures to define CFT wedges.

The\nProjected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) formalism allows us to locally encode the\nmain properties of the models (like topological order, symmetries and their\ninterplay) in the tensors. We have used that encoding to classify, construct\nand detect some classes of symmetry-enriched topological phases in 2D PEPS. For\nthat purpose, we have studied what the allowed freedom in the tensors\ngenerating the same tensor network state is. These results are the so-called\n'fundamental theorems' and they give the necessary knowledge to properly study\nsymmetries (actions that leave the states invariant). We focus our study on the\nfamily of PEPS describing quantum double models of $G$, the so-called\n$G$-injective PEPS, and on global on-site symmetries coming from a finite group\n$Q$: as a result of the classification we have a finite number of phases\nclosely related to the theory of group extensions. We also provide the maps\nthat appear in group extension theory with physical meaning and we characterize\ntheir actions on the ground subspace and on the anyons. We construct a\nrepresentative of each class of our classification. Moreover, we connect our\nconstruction with an interesting physical phenomenon, the so-called anyon\ncondensation, which describes topological phase transitions. We have also\nproposed a family of gauge invariant quantities and their corresponding order\nparameters (in the form of expectation values of a local operator in 2D) to\ndetect the corresponding quantum phases, in particular their symmetry\nfractionalization patterns.

The first\ninvestigations concerned single photons, squeezed states, twin beams and EPR\nstates, that involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The\nstudy of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more\nand more complex and rich situations, involving many modes, either spatial,\ntemporal, frequency, or polarization modes. Actually, each mode of the\nelectromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of\nfreedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to\ncouple different modes, and thus to build in a controlled way a quantum network\nin which the nodes are optical modes and that is endowed with a strong\nmultipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks are easily reconfigurable\nand subject only to weak decoherence. They open indeed many promising\nperspectives for optical communications and computation.\n  Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two\nmodes is another mode. This means that a \"modal superposition principle\" exists\nhand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The\npurpose of the present review is to show the interest of considering these two\naspects of multimode quantum light in a global way.

Such a post-selection,\nwhich is also called a measurement-based NLA, requires a cut-off to produce a\nnormalisable filter function. Increasing the cut-off with respect to the\nreceived signals results in a more faithful emulation of the NLA and nearly\nGaussian output statistics at the cost of discarding more data. While recent\nworks have shown the benefits of post-selection via an asymptotic security\nanalysis, we undertake the first investigation of such a post-selection\nutilising a composable security proof in the realistic finite-size regime,\nwhere this trade-off is extremely relevant. We show that this form of\npost-selection can improve the secure range of a CV-QKD over lossy thermal\nchannels if the finite block size is sufficiently large and that the optimal\nvalue for the filter cut-off is typically in the non-Gaussian regime. The\nrelatively modest improvement in the finite-size regime as compared to the\nasymptotic case highlights the need for new tools to prove the security of\nnon-Gaussian cryptographic protocols. These results also represent a\nquantitative assessment of a measurement-based NLA with an entangled-state\ninput in both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2019 04:29:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseinidehaj", "Nedasadat", ""], ["Lance", "Andrew M.", ""], ["Symul", "Thomas", ""], ["Walk", "Nathan", ""], ["Ralph", "Timothy C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.09642", "submitter": "Xiaosong Ma", "authors": "Peiyu Zhang, Xiaodong Zheng, Renyou Ge, Liangliang Lu, Qi Chen1,\n  Fangchao Qu, Labao Zhang, Xinlun Cai, Yanqing Lu, Shining Zhu, Peiheng Wu,\n  Xiao-Song Ma", "title": "Integrated relay server for measurement-device-independent quantum key\n  distribution", "comments": "13 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security stemming from the laws of\nquantum physics.

Here we report the\nfirst experimental observation of EQPTs and DQPTs in a quantum spin chain via\nquench dynamics of OTOC on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator. We\nobserve that the quench dynamics of both the order parameter and the two-body\ncorrelation function cannot detect the DQPTs, but the OTOC can unambiguously\ndetect the DQPTs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the long-time average value of\nthe OTOC in quantum quench signals the equilibrium quantum critical point and\nordered quantum phases, thus one can measure the EQPTs from the non-equilibrium\nquantum quench dynamics.

Structurally, twisting leads to large\nperiodic supercell structures, which in turn can support intriguing strongly\ncorrelated behaviour. Here, we propose a highly tunable scheme to synthetically\nemulate twisted bilayer systems with ultracold atoms trapped in an optical\nlattice. In our scheme, neither a physical bilayer nor twist is directly\nrealized. Instead, two synthetic layers are produced exploiting\ncoherently-coupled internal atomic states, and a supercell structure is\ngenerated \\emph{via} a spatially-dependent Raman coupling. To illustrate this\nconcept, we focus on a synthetic square bilayer lattice and show that it leads\nto tunable quasi-flatbands and Dirac cone spectra under certain magic supercell\nperiodicities. The appearance of these features are explained using a\nperturbative analysis. Our proposal can be implemented using available\nstate-of-the-art experimental techniques, and opens the route towards the\ncontrolled study of strongly-correlated flat band accompanied by hybridization\nphysics akin to magic angle bilayer graphene in cold atom quantum simulators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 21:23:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2020 18:19:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Salamon", "Tymoteusz", ""], ["Celi", "Alessio", ""], ["Chhajlany", "Ravindra W.", ""], ["Fr\u00e9rot", "Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e", ""], ["Lewenstein", "Maciej", ""], ["Tarruell", "Leticia", ""], ["Rakshit", "Debraj", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.12770", "submitter": "Luis Fernando Mora Eng.", "authors": "Luis Fernando Mora Mora", "title": "A Link Between Relativistic Rest Energy and Fractionary Momentum\n  Operators of Order 1/2", "comments": "The yukawa term forcing was a mistake", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The solution of a causal fractionary wave equation in an infinite potential\nwell was obtained.

We also investigate the\ndynamics of the fidelity and entanglement entropy for several initial states.\nThe results clearly show that the scar states are trapped in a perfectly\nperiodic orbit in the Hilbert subspace and never thermalize, whereas other\ngeneric states do rapidly. To our knowledge, our model is the first explicit\nexample of disordered quantum many-body scarred model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:36:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 May 2020 10:54:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Shibata", "Naoyuki", ""], ["Yoshioka", "Nobuyuki", ""], ["Katsura", "Hosho", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13492", "submitter": "Wenjie Ji", "authors": "Wenjie Ji, Xiao-Gang Wen", "title": "Categorical symmetry and non-invertible anomaly in symmetry-breaking and\n  topological phase transitions", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this paper, we show that the critical point\nalso has a dual symmetry - a $(n-1)$-symmetry described by a higher group when\n$G$ is Abelian or an algebraic $(n-1)$-symmetry beyond higher group when $G$ is\nnon-Abelian. In fact, any $G$-symmetric system can be viewed as a boundary of\n$G$-gauge theory in one higher dimension. The conservation of gauge charge and\ngauge flux in the bulk $G$-gauge theory gives rise to the symmetry and the dual\nsymmetry respectively. So any $G$-symmetric system actually has a larger\nsymmetry called categorical symmetry, which is a combination of the symmetry\nand the dual symmetry. However, part (and only part) of the categorical\nsymmetry must be spontaneously broken in any gapped phase of the system, but\nthere exists a gapless state where the categorical symmetry is not\nspontaneously broken. Such a gapless state corresponds to the usual critical\npoint of Landau symmetry breaking transition. The above results remain valid\neven if we expand the notion of symmetry to include higher symmetries and\nalgebraic higher symmetries. Thus our result also applies to critical points\nfor transitions between topological phases of matter. In particular, we show\nthat there can be several critical points for the transition from the 3+1D\n$Z_2$ gauge theory to a trivial phase. The critical point from Higgs\ncondensation has a categorical symmetry formed by a $Z_2$ 0-symmetry and its\ndual - a $Z_2$ 2-symmetry, while the critical point of the confinement\ntransition has a categorical symmetry formed by a $Z_2$ 1-symmetry and its dual\n- another $Z_2$ 1-symmetry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:46:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2020 02:42:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2020 13:25:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2020 22:09:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Wenjie", ""], ["Wen", "Xiao-Gang", ""]]}]
