So far\nthe chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in\nspecific models. In this paper we propose a unified description of the\nexponential growth and ballistic butterfly spreading of OTOCs across different\nsystems using a newly formulated \"quantum hydrodynamics,\" which is valid at\nfinite $\\hbar$ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic\nfew-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a\n\"hydrodynamic cloud,\" and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a\nshift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields\ncorrelation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered\ncorrelation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads\nto chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting\nphenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and\nmomentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping\nphenomenon may be considered as a \"smoking gun\" for the hydrodynamic origin of\nthe chaotic mode. We also discuss the possibility that such a hydrodynamic\ndescription could be a hallmark of maximally chaotic systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 19:00:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 Jun 2018 09:38:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:49:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Blake", "Mike", ""], ["Lee", "Hyunseok", ""], ["Liu", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.00042", "submitter": "Soonwon Choi", "authors": "Soonwon Choi, Norman Y.

The\ninterplay between topological order and the breaking of global symmetry is\ndescribed by the non-zero temperature statistical mechanics of classical XY\nmodels in dimension $D=3$; such models also describe the zero temperature\nquantum phases of bosons with short-range interactions on the square lattice at\ninteger filling. The topological state is again characterized by the expulsion\nof certain defects, in a state with fluctuating symmetry-breaking order, along\nwith the presence of emergent gauge fields. The phase diagrams of the $Z_2$\ngauge theory and the XY models are obtained by embedding them in U(1) gauge\ntheories, and by studying their Higgs and confining phases. These ideas are\nthen applied to the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice. A SU(2)\ngauge theory describes the fluctuations of spin-density-wave order, and its\nphase diagram is presented by analogy to the XY models. We obtain a class of\nzero temperature metallic states with fluctuating spin-density wave order,\ntopological order associated with defect expulsion, deconfined emergent gauge\nfields, reconstructed Fermi surfaces (with `chargon' or electron-like\nquasiparticles), but no broken symmetry.

Emphasis has been put here first to\nshow what types of nonlinear interactions do exist, and what physical\ninterpretations follow each. The standard quadratic interactions between light\nand mechanical motion is expressed as the product of cavity light intensity and\nsquared mirror position. However, there exists a non-standard quadratic\noptomechanical interaction as well, which assumes a mathematically different\nform and appears as the squared product of field and mirror momenta. This\nnon-standard type of quadratic interaction originates from two corrections: the\nmomentum exchange and conservation among mirror and field, as well as\nrelativistic corrections due to different mechanisms. Both these types of\nnon-standard interactions become relevant when the ratio of mechanical to\noptical frequency is no longer negligible. Next, we turn to the solution\ntechnique of such interactions, and introduce a formal higher-order operator\nmethod to tackle the nonlinear evolution of quantum systems. This enables one\nto accurately study any type of quantum nonlinear interaction using the\nanalysis tools of linear algebra. In order to employ the analytical power of\nhigher-order operator method, one first needs to identify a closed Lie algebra,\nwhich should satisfy closedness property under commutation either exactly or\napproximately, and is referred to as the basis.

From the quantum theoretical point of view, there is a\nprobability for the electron to emit photons, with a certain emission power,\nduring its movement from the slits to the screen. According to the Copenhagen\ninterpretation we found that the emission power is strictly zero because the\nelectron moves as a free particle after it leaves the slit and before reach the\nscreen. Then, there is no emission of photons. On the other hand, in the case\nof the BdB interpretation, we obtain a general formula for the emission power,\nfrom which we can make two predictions: one is for the case of an ensemble,\nthat is, a statistical prediction that coincides, as it was to hope, with the\nprediction of the interpretation of Copenhagen: zero emission. The other is for\nthe case of an individual event, that is, an electron that follows a\ntrajectory, and this concept exists in the BdB interpretation, and the result,\nfor a concrete real experiment, is a very tiny but not a zero value. We give an\nidea of the type of spectrum that could be found. This effect, if measured,\nwould constitute an indirect test in favor of the existence of Bohmian\ntrajectories. Therefore, far from contradicting Copenhagen's interpretation,\nBdB's interpretation, besides reproducing their same results, also says\nsomething about the sub-quantum world so, instead of looking directly for the\ntrajectories of the electrons we can try to measure their emitted radiation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Jan 2018 21:50:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 Apr 2018 16:01:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 20:54:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Santini", "E.

In\nquantum theory, $t$ is a parameter, in contrast to the observable $r$. This\ndiscrepancy suggests that there exists a more elaborate formalization of time,\nwhich encapsulates both perspectives. Such a formalization is proposed in this\npaper. The evolution is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in\n\\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated each time an event occurs. Sequential\ntime $n$ is separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances\nbetween events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$,\nin which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal relations. The\nevolution of the wave function is described in terms of the parameter $\\sigma$\nthat interpolates between sequential times $n$.

The\nDirac equation follows as a `square root' of the stationary state equation from\nthe condition that $\\tilde{\\sigma}>0$, which follows from the directed nature\nof $n$. The formalism thus implies that all observable objects have non-zero\nrest mass, including elementary fermions.

We illustrate the error correction\nscheme for single-mode and two-mode unitaries implemented by spatial\ncontinuous-variable cluster states. We show that there is no resource advantage\nto error correcting multimode unitaries implemented by spatial cluster states.\nHowever, the generalization to multimode unitaries implemented by temporal\ncontinuous-variable cluster states shows significant practical advantages since\nit costs only a finite number of optical elements (squeezer, beam splitter,\netc).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:39:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Daiqin", ""], ["Weedbrook", "Christian", ""], ["Br\u00e1dler", "Kamil", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.03508", "submitter": "Mark Van Raamsdonk", "authors": "Jim Bryan, Samuel Leutheusser, Zinovy Reichstein, and Mark Van\n  Raamsdonk", "title": "Locally Maximally Entangled States of Multipart Quantum Systems", "comments": "50 pages, 6 figures, v2: comments added in introduction and section\n  3.3, v3: references added", "journal-ref": "Quantum 3, 115 (2019)", "doi": "10.22331/q-2019-01-06-115", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph hep-th", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  For a multipart quantum system, a locally maximally entangled (LME) state is\none where each elementary subsystem is maximally entangled with its complement.\nThis paper is a sequel to arXiv:1708.01645, which gives necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a system to admit LME states in terms of its\nsubsystem dimensions $(d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_n)$, and computes the dimension of\nthe space ${\\cal H}_{LME}/K$ of LME states up to local unitary transformations\nfor all non-empty cases.

Two scenarios are investigated: Case 1,\nhow a two-level system changes the pulse shapes of two input photons\npropagating in a single input channel; and Case 2, how a two-level system\nresponds to two counter-propagating photons. By means of a transfer function\napproach, the steady-state output field states for both cases are derived\nanalytically. In Example 1, a two-photon input state of Gaussian pulse shape is\nused to excite a two-level atom. The simulation demonstrates that in the time\ndomain the atom tends to stretch out the two photons. Moreover, the striking\ndifference between the joint probability distribution of the output two-photon\nstate and that of the input two-photon state occurs exactly under the setting\nwhen the two-level atom is most efficiently excited. In Example 2, a two-photon\ninput state of rising exponential pulse shape is used to excite a two-level\natom. Strong anti-correlation of the output two-photon state is observed, which\nis absent in Example 1 for the Gaussian pulse shape. Such difference indicates\nthat different pulse shapes give rise to drastically different frequency\nentanglement of the output two-photon state. Example 3 is used to illustrate\nCase 2, where two counter-propagating single photons of rising exponential\npulse shapes are input to a two-level atom. The frequency-dependent\nHong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference phenomenon is observed. The simulation\nresults base on the analytic forms of output two-photon states are consistent\nwith those based on quantum master or filter equations [43,11].

This proves\nthe \"games quantum PCP conjecture\" of Fitzsimons and the second author\n(ITCS'15), albeit under randomized reductions. The core component in our\nreduction is a construction of a family of two-player games for testing\n$n$-qubit maximally entangled states. For any integer $n\\geq2$, we give a test\nin which questions from the verifier are $O(\\log n)$ bits long, and answers are\n$\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\\log n)$ bits long.

The\nconstruction is based on the classical plane-vs-point test for multivariate\nlow-degree polynomials of Raz and Safra (STOC'97). We extend the classical test\nto the quantum regime by executing independent copies of the test in the\ngeneralized Pauli $X$ and $Z$ bases over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q$ is a\nsufficiently large prime power, and combine the two through a test for the\nPauli twisted commutation relations.

However,\nexploitation of hBN in scalable, on-chip nanophotonic circuits, quantum\ninformation processing and cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments\nrequires robust techniques for the fabrication of monolithic optical\nresonators. In this letter, we design and engineer high quality photonic\ncrystal cavities from hBN.

This article provides a summary of this phenomenon and\ndiscusses some of its implications for atomic systems. Transitioning from the\ndomain of photons to atoms opens new perspectives on fundamental concepts, such\nas the classification of entanglement of identical particles. It aids in the\ndesign of novel probes of quantities such as entanglement entropy by combining\nwell established tools of AMO physics - unity single-atom detection, tunable\ninteractions, and scalability - with the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.\nFurthermore, it is now possible for established protocols in the photon\ncommunity, such as measurement-induced entanglement, to be employed in atomic\nexperiments that possess deterministic single-particle production and\ndetection. Hence, the realization of the HOM effect with atoms represents a\nproductive union of central ideas in quantum control of atoms and photons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 06:17:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Aug 2018 19:55:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kaufman", "A.

In this paper, we find a set\nof physically meaningful assumptions such that any physical theory satisfying\nthese assumptions must embed into the category of finite-dimensional\nC*-algebras. These assumptions were originally introduced in the setting of\neffectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and\nquantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation, this\nmotivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory.\n  In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with\nthe framework of generalized probabilistic theories and instead use effect\ntheories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present.\nThe lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of\npure maps. A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition of a\ncompression and a filter. These maps satisfy particular universal properties\nand respectively correspond to `forgetting' and `measuring' the validity of an\neffect.\n  We define a pure effect theory (PET) to be an effect theory where the pure\nmaps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions are adjoint. We show\nthat any convex finite-dimensional PET must embed into the category of\nEuclidean Jordan algebras.

It was shown that the\nperformance gap between the quantum limit and that of ideal continuum\nimage-plane direct detection is the largest for highly sub-Rayleigh separation\nof the objects, and that a pre-detection mode sorting could attain the quantum\nlimit. Here we extend this to a more general problem of estimating the length\nof an incoherently radiating extended (line) object. We find, as expected by\nthe Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated photon\nvanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection.\nConversely, for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this\nnormalized FI does not decrease with decreasing object length, similar to the\ntwo point object case. However, unlike in the two-object problem, the FI per\nphoton of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length\ngreatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of\ninformation provided by photons emanating from near the center of the object\nabout its length. We evaluate the quantum Fisher information per unit\nintegrated photons and find that the HG mode sorter exactly achieves this limit\nat all values of the object length. Further, a simple binary mode sorter\nmaintains the advantage of the full mode sorter at highly sub-Rayleigh length.\nIn addition to this FI analysis, we quantify improvement in terms of the actual\nmean squared error of the length estimate. Finally, we consider the effect of\nimperfect mode sorting, and show that the performance improvement over direct\ndetection is robust over a range of sub-Rayleigh lengths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jan 2018 23:44:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dutton", "Zachary", ""], ["Kerviche", "Ronan", ""], ["Ashok", "Amit", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.06655", "submitter": "Daniel Huber", "authors": "Daniel Huber, Marcus Reindl, Saimon Filipe Covre da Silva, Christian\n  Schimpf, Javier Martin-Sanchez, Huiying Huang, Giovanni Piredda, Johannes\n  Edlinger, Armando Rastelli, Rinaldo Trotta", "title": "Strain-Tunable GaAs Quantum dot: A Nearly Dephasing-Free Source of\n  Entangled Photon Pairs on Demand", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

We then show how to use this result to find\nanalytical expressions for the nonlocal correlations for arbitrary but fixed\nparticle numbers $N$ including finite-size corrections. Neglecting the latter\nin the thermodynamic limit provides an expansion in the quantum degeneracy\nparameter $N\\lambda_T/L$.

If it is a\nquestioning on scholastic philosophy and a study of contrafactual logic that\nled Specker to his demonstration with Kochen, it was a criticism of von\nNeumann's \"proof\" that led John Bell to the result. A misinterpretation of this\nfamous \"proof\" will lead them to diametrically opposite conclusions.

Another approach, initiated by Robert Spekkens, generalizes the\nconcept to any type of experimental procedure. This new form of \"universal\"\ncontextuality has been raised as a criterion of non-classicality, i.e. of\nweirdness.

We also derive a EPR-steering criteria, with which the EPR\nsteerability of the maximally entangled states are checked.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jan 2018 08:38:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Huaixin", ""], ["Guo", "Zhihua", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.09947", "submitter": "Bo-Sture K.

Then,\non very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad\nequation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,\nas well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of\ncurvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes\nby the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths.\nTherefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur\nwithout altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify\nall scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the\ncase in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show\nthat this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the\npower spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the\nenvironment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but\ndeteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not\nonly of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical\nobservations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2018 06:15:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Jerome", ""], ["Vennin", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.09958", "submitter": "David Hurst", "authors": "D.L.

However, the time scales and system\nsizes accessible to QMD are typically limited to picoseconds and a few hundred\natoms. These constraints arise due to expensive self-consistent ground-state\nelectronic structure calculations that can often scale cubically with the\nnumber of atoms. Linearly scaling methods depend on computing the density\nmatrix P from the Hamiltonian matrix H by exploiting the sparsity in both\nmatrices. The second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm is an O(N)\nalgorithm that computes P with a sequence of 40-50 matrix-matrix\nmultiplications. In this paper, we present task-based implementations of a\nrecently developed data-parallel graph-based approach to the SP2 algorithm,\nG-SP2. We represent the density matrix P as an undirected graph and use graph\npartitioning techniques to divide the computation into smaller independent\ntasks. The partitions thus obtained are generally not of equal size and give\nrise to undesirable load imbalances in standard MPI-based implementations. This\nload-balancing challenge can be mitigated by dynamically scheduling parallel\ncomputations at runtime using task-based programming models. We develop\ntask-based implementations of the data-parallel G-SP2 algorithm using both\nIntel's Concurrent Collections (CnC) as well as the Charm++ programming model\nand evaluate these implementations for future use.

The second one provides an indirect measure and\nis based on a noise analysis of different spatial regions of the twin beams in\nthe time domain with a single photodiode.

This system of random\nvariables is a cyclic system of rank 4, formally the same as the system\ndescribing the EPR/Bell paradigm with signaling. Unlike the latter, however,\nthe system describing the double-slit experiment is always noncontextual, i.e.,\nthe context-dependence in it is entirely explainable in terms of direct\ninfluences of contexts (closed-open arrangements of the slits) upon the\nmarginal distributions of the random variables involved. The analysis presented\nis entirely within the framework of abstract classical probability theory (with\ncontextually labeled random variables). The only physical constraint used in\nthe analysis is that a particle cannot pass through a closed slit. The\nnoncontextuality of the double-slit system does not generalize to systems\ndescribing experiments with more than two slits: in an abstract triple-slit\nsystem, almost any set of observable detection probabilities is compatible with\nboth a contextual scenario and a noncontextual scenario of the particle passing\nthough various combinations of open and closed slits (although the issue of\nphysical realizability of these scenarios remains open).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 18:30:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2018 18:28:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Mar 2018 19:49:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:20:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Dzhafarov", "Ehtibar N.", ""], ["Kujala", "Janne V.", ""]]}]
