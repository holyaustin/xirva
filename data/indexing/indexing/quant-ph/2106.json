Recently, some purely quantum machine learning models were proposed\nsuch as the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) to perform\nclassification on quantum data. However, all of the existing QML models rely on\ncentralized solutions that cannot scale well for large-scale and distributed\nquantum networks. Hence, it is apropos to consider more practical quantum\nfederated learning (QFL) solutions tailored towards emerging quantum network\narchitectures. Indeed, developing QFL frameworks for quantum networks is\ncritical given the fragile nature of computing qubits and the difficulty of\ntransferring them. On top of its practical momentousness, QFL allows for\ndistributed quantum learning by leveraging existing wireless communication\ninfrastructure. This paper proposes the first fully quantum federated learning\nframework that can operate over quantum data and, thus, share the learning of\nquantum circuit parameters in a decentralized manner. First, given the lack of\nexisting quantum federated datasets in the literature, the proposed framework\nbegins by generating the first quantum federated dataset, with a hierarchical\ndata format, for distributed quantum networks. Then, clients sharing QCNN\nmodels are fed with the quantum data to perform a classification task.\nSubsequently, the server aggregates the learnable quantum circuit parameters\nfrom clients and performs federated averaging. Extensive experiments are\nconducted to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed QFL\nsolution. This work is the first to combine Google's TensorFlow Federated and\nTensorFlow Quantum in a practical implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2021 12:19:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chehimi", "Mahdi", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.00019", "submitter": "Asier Pi\\~neiro Orioli", "authors": "A.

However, many envisioned applications in quantum\nsimulation and computation require richer coupling graphs including nonlocal\ninteractions, which notably feature in mappings of hard optimization problems\nonto frustrated spin systems and in models of information scrambling in black\nholes. Here, we report on the realization of programmable nonlocal interactions\nin an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, where photons carry\ninformation between distant atomic spins. By programming the\ndistance-dependence of interactions, we access effective geometries where the\ndimensionality, topology, and metric are entirely distinct from the physical\narrangement of atoms. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular\nladder, a Moebius strip with sign-changing interactions, and a treelike\ngeometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity. The tree graph constitutes a\ntoy model of holographic duality, where the quantum system may be viewed as\nlying on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from\nmeasured spin correlations. Our work opens broader prospects for simulating\nfrustrated magnets and topological phases, investigating quantum optimization\nalgorithms, and engineering new entangled resource states for sensing and\ncomputation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2021 03:00:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Periwal", "Avikar", ""], ["Cooper", "Eric S.", ""], ["Kunkel", "Philipp", ""], ["Wienand", "Julian F.", ""], ["Davis", "Emily J.", ""], ["Schleier-Smith", "Monika", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.04137", "submitter": "Shumpei Masuda", "authors": "S.

We first experimentally validate our ancilla-assisted\ntwo point measurement scheme, and then apply it to i) experimentally verify\nthat fluctuation theorems are robust against projective measurements, a\ntheoretical prediction which was not validated so far, ii) experimentally\nverify the so called heat engine fluctuation relation, by implementing a SWAP\nquantum heat engine. iii) experimentally verify that the heat engine\nfluctuation relation continues to hold in presence of intermediate\nmeasurements, by implementing the design at the basis of the so called\nquantum-measurement-cooling concept. For both engines, we report the measured\naverage heat and work exchanged and single out their operation mode. Our\nexperiments constitute the experimental basis for the understanding of the\nnon-equilibrium energetics of quantum computation and for the implementation of\nenergy management devices on quantum processors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2021 14:16:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Solfanelli", "Andrea", ""], ["Santini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Campisi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.04402", "submitter": "St\\'ephane Virally", "authors": "St\\'ephane Virally, Patrick Cusson, Denis V.

The second type is intensity\ninterferometry, which relies on Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type measurements. At\noptical frequencies, where direct phase measurements are impossible, amplitude\ninterferometry has an effective numerical aperture that is limited by the\ndistance from which photons can coherently interfere. Intensity interferometry,\non the other hand, correlates only photon fluxes and can thus support much\nlarger numerical apertures, but suffers from a reduced signal due to the low\naverage photon number per mode in thermal light.

In order to better take advantage of\navailable quantum resources and obtain the maximum possible sensitivity, it is\nnecessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different possible\nconfigurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide\napplicability, we focus on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in\na parameter of interest through a resonance shift. We compare their fundamental\nsensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) based on the\nestimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode\nsqueezed state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity\nresults from an interplay between the QCRB and the transfer function of the\nsystem. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian lineshape a\nphase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the\nparameter space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper\nslopes, such as higher order Butterworth lineshapes. Furthermore, such an\ninterplay results in conditions under which the phase-based scheme provides a\nhigher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of\nquantum enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor\non the degree of quantum enhancement and show that for certain conditions\nprobing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity than probing\nwith a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized\nintensity-difference and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the\nfundamental sensitivity limits even in the presence of external losses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:23:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Dowran", "Mohammadjavad", ""], ["Woodworth", "Timothy S.", ""], ["Kumar", "Ashok", ""], ["Marino", "Alberto M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.07768", "submitter": "Xiaoqing Zhong", "authors": "Xiaoqing Zhong, Wenyuan Wang, Reem Mandil, Hoi-Kwong Lo and Li Qian", "title": "Experiment on scalable multi-user twin-field quantum key distribution\n  network", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures and 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Twin-field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) systems have shown great promise\nfor implementing practical long-distance secure quantum communication due to\nits measurement-device-independent nature and its ability to offer\nfundamentally superior rate-loss scaling than point-to-point QKD systems.

Severe self-heating was observed at deep-cryogenic\nambient temperatures, resulting in a channel temperature rise exceeding 50 K\nand having an impact detectable at a distance of up to 30 um from the device.\nBy extracting the thermal resistance from measured data at different\ntemperatures, it was shown that a simple model is able to accurately predict\nchannel temperatures over the full ambient temperature range from\ndeep-cryogenic to room temperature. The results and modeling presented in this\nwork contribute towards the full self-heating-aware IC design-flow required for\nthe reliable design and operation of cryo-CMOS circuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 08:58:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hart", "P.

Due to their coupling, the\ncavity modes inherit finite nonlinearity from the transmons. In this work, we\ntheoretically and experimentally investigate how an off-resonant drive on the\ntransmon ancilla modifies the nonlinearities of cavity modes in qualitatively\ndifferent ways, depending on the interrelation among cavity-transmon detuning,\ndrive-transmon detuning and transmon anharmonicity. For a cavity-transmon\ndetuning that is smaller than or comparable to the drive-transmon detuning and\ntransmon anharmonicity, the off-resonant transmon drive can induce multiphoton\nresonances among cavity and transmon excitations that strongly modify cavity\nnonlinearities as drive parameters vary. For a large cavity-transmon detuning,\nthe drive induces cavity-photon-number-dependent ac Stark shifts of transmon\nlevels that translate into effective cavity nonlinearities. In the regime of\nweak transmon-cavity coupling, the cavity Kerr nonlinearity relates to the\nthird-order nonlinear susceptibility function $\\chi^{(3)}$ of the driven\nancilla. This susceptibility function provides a numerically efficient way of\ncomputing the cavity Kerr particularly for systems with many cavity modes\ncontrolled by a single transmon. It also serves as a diagnostic tool for\nidentifying undesired drive-induced multiphoton resonance processes. Lastly, we\nshow that by judiciously choosing the drive amplitude, a single off-resonant\ntransmon drive can be used to cancel the cavity self-Kerr nonlinearity or the\ninter-cavity cross-Kerr.

Thus, the\ndevelopment of quantum applications also incorporates the workflow lifecycle.\nIn this chapter, we analyze the software artifacts usually comprising a quantum\napplication and present their corresponding lifecycles.

The quantum\nsubroutine can be implemented with shallow circuits and, by incorporating error\nmitigation, reduce the Monte Carlo variance by orders of magnitude even when\nthe circuit noise is significant. As such, the proposed quantum algorithm is\napplicable to near-term noisy quantum hardware.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 02:45:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2021 03:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yongdan", ""], ["Lu", "Bing-Nan", ""], ["Li", "Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.09907", "submitter": "Imin Chen", "authors": "Imin Chen and David Sun", "title": "The dihedral hidden subgroup problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give an exposition of the hidden subgroup problem for dihedral groups from\nthe point of view of the standard hidden subgroup quantum algorithm for finite\ngroups.

We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled\nphase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain, while competing single-particle or\ninteracting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the\nsingle-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an\nentanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the\ncompetition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics\nincreases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent\nobservables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state\ndynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative\ndynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian\ncontribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In\naddition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the\nentanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition.\nComplementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent\ndynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the\nentanglement transition also occurs in this second model.

The theory is based on the ansatz that\na condensate arises in the transistor gate well as a displaced ground state,\nthat is, one that undergoes dipole oscillation in the well. That gate atoms\nremain condensed and oscillating is shown to be a consequence of the cooling\ninduced by the emission of a matterwave into the vacuum.

We make use\nof a low-finesse ring cavity to enhance the atom-photon interaction and obtain\nan in-fiber retrieval efficiency of 44%. Harnessing dipole interaction between\ntwo Rydberg levels, we may either create a sequence of multiple single photons\nor nothing, conditioned on the initial qubit state. We achieve a single-shot\nmeasurement fidelity of 93.2% in 4.8 us.

Results from two rich case studies\nindicate that machine learning is able to reliably reveal intricate topological\nphase boundaries and can hence be a powerful tool to discover novel topological\nmatter afforded by the time dimension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2021 01:08:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Nannan", ""], ["Gong", "Jiangbin", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.11488", "submitter": "Cihan Kurter", "authors": "C.

For\nthe standard notion of coherent control, we identify the information-theoretic\nresource for controlling an arbitrary quantum channel on a $d$-dimensional\nsystem: specifically, the resource is an extended quantum channel acting as the\noriginal channel on a $d$-dimensional sector of a $(d+1)$-dimensional system.\nUsing this resource, arbitrary controlled channels can be built with a\nuniversal circuit architecture. We then extend the standard notion of control\nto more general notions, including control of multiple channels with possibly\ndifferent input and output systems. Finally, we develop a theoretical\nframework, called supermaps on routed channels, which provides a compact\nrepresentation of coherent control as an operation performed on the extended\nchannels, and highlights the way the operation acts on different sectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2021 15:23:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Vanrietvelde", "Augustin", ""], ["Chiribella", "Giulio", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.12468", "submitter": "Valery Milner", "authors": "P.

Given that we use a gaussian\napproximation, near criticality the numerical results agree with a free field\ntheory calculation. To go beyond the gaussian approximation we use general\nscaling arguments that imply that, as we approach the critical point\n$t\\rightarrow t_c$, there is a non-analytic behavior in the complexity $c_2(t)$\nof the form $|c_2(t) - c_2(t_c)| \\sim |t-t_c|^{\\nu d}$, up to possible\nlogarithmic corrections. Here $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions and $\\nu$\nis the usual critical exponent for the correlation length\n$\\xi\\sim|t-t_c|^{-\\nu}$. As a check, for $d=2$ this agrees with the numerical\ncomputation if we use the gaussian critical exponent $\\nu=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nFinally, using AdS/CFT methods, we study higher dimensional examples and\nconfirm this scaling argument with non-gaussian exponent $\\nu$ for strongly\ninteracting theories that have a gravity dual.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2021 20:15:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:22:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sood", "Uday", ""], ["Kruczenski", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.12651", "submitter": "Fernando Parisio", "authors": "L.

The\ncalibration results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed force sensor\ndesign. Theoretical model and simulations further validate the presented\nsensing principle. The proposed prototype benefits from the main advantages of\noptical sensors, such as their predisposition to miniaturization, small cable\nsizes and weights, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and safe operation\nin hazard environments.

Vibronic coupling across the entire vibrational\nspectrum, including high-frequency modes, needs to be accounted for to ensure\nquantitatively correct description of optical spectra, where dynamic\nlocalization effects modulate the intensity of vibrational sidebands and\nmultimode mixing shifts the absorption peaks. Furthermore, we show that\nhigh-frequency modes can support long-lived oscillations in multidimensional\nnonlinear spectra, which are not obtained in a coarse-grained description of\nthe electron-vibrational coupling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jun 2021 17:14:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Caycedo-Soler", "F.", ""], ["Mattioni", "A.", ""], ["Lim", "J.", ""], ["Renger", "T.", ""], ["Huelga", "S.

Most\npractical approaches require determining and measuring a suitable entanglement\nwitness which provides some level of information about the entanglement\nstructure of the probed state. A fundamental quantity of quantum metrology is\nthe quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a rigorous witness of\nmultipartite entanglement that can be evaluated from linear response functions\nfor certain states. In this work, we explore measuring the QFI of molecular\nexciton states of the first-excitation subspace from spectroscopy. In\nparticular, we utilize the fact that the linear response of a pure state\nsubject to a weak electric field over all possible driving frequencies encodes\nthe variance of the collective dipole moment in the probed state, which is a\nvalid measure for QFI. The systems that are investigated include the molecular\ndimer, $N$-site linear aggregate with nearest-neighbor coupling, and $N$-site\ncircular aggregate, all modeled as a collection of interacting qubits. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the variance of the collective dipole moment in\nthe brightest dipole-allowed eigenstate is the maximum QFI. The optical\nresponse of a thermally equilibrated state in the first-excitation subspace is\nalso a valid QFI. Theoretical predictions of the measured QFI for realistic\nlinear dye aggregates as a function of temperature and energetic disorder due\nto static variations of the host matrix show that 2- to 3-partite entanglement\nis realizable.

There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type;\nthere is no \"the\" tensor product. Distinctly different tensor product operators\ncan be associated with different parts of a multipartite system without\ndifficulty. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables\nis tensor product operator dependent. The same state in the target state space\ncan be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable\nwith respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished\nrelative to the others; the unitary operator used to construct a Bell state\nfrom a pair of |0>'s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime\nexample. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type\nis given by composition with a unitary operator. There is an equivalence\nbetween change of tensor product operator and change of basis in the target\nspace.
