As a consequence, besides the existence of classical\neffects due to the interaction between particle and boundary, there will be a\nquantum contribution to the motion of the particle whose magnitude depends on\nhow fast the transition between the different vacuum states occurs. Here this\nissue is revisited and a smooth transition with a controllable switching time\nbetween the vacuum states of the system is implemented. Dispersions of the\nparticle velocity in both, zero and finite temperature regimes are examined.\nMore than just generalizing previous results for specific configurations, new\neffects are unveiled. Particularly, it is shown that the well known vacuum\ndominance reported to occur arbitrarily near the wall is a consequence of\nassumed idealizations. The use of a controllable switching enable us to\nconclude that thermal effects can be as important as or even stronger than\nvacuum effects arbitrarily near the wall. Additionally, the residual effect\npredicted to occur in the late time regime was here shown to be linked to the\nduration of the transition. In this sense, such effect is understood to be a\nsort of particle energy exchanging due to the vacuum state transition.\nFurthermore, in certain arrangements a sort of cooling effect over the motion\nof the particle can occur, i.e., the kinetic energy of the particle is lessen\nby a certain amount due to subvacuum quantum fluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:17:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 18:29:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["De Lorenci", "V.

In this thesis, we develop an\napproach to the study of such theories purely in terms of the behaviour of\ntheir processes, as described mathematically through the language of category\ntheory. This extends a framework for quantum processes known as categorical\nquantum mechanics (CQM) due to Abramsky and Coecke.\n  We first consider categorical frameworks for operational theories. We\nintroduce a notion of such theory, based on those of Chiribella, D'Ariano and\nPerinotti (CDP), but more general than the probabilistic ones typically\nconsidered. We establish a correspondence between these and what we call\n\"operational categories\", using features introduced by Jacobs et al. in\neffectus theory, an area of categorical logic to which we provide an\noperational interpretation. We then see how to pass to a broader category of\n\"super-causal\" processes, allowing for the powerful diagrammatic features of\nCQM.\n  Next we study operational theories themselves. We survey numerous principles\nthat a theory may satisfy, treating them in a basic diagrammatic setting, and\nrelating notions from probabilistic theories, CQM and effectus theory. We\nprovide a new description of superpositions in the category of pure quantum\nprocesses, using this to give an abstract construction of the category of\nHilbert spaces and linear maps.\n  Finally, we reconstruct finite-dimensional quantum theory itself. More\nbroadly, we give a recipe for recovering a class of generalised quantum\ntheories, before instantiating it with operational principles inspired by an\nearlier reconstruction due to CDP.

PEP can\nbe considered from two viewpoints. On the one hand, it asserts that particles\nwith half-integer spin (fermions) are described by antisymmetric wave\nfunctions, and particles with integer spin (bosons) are described by symmetric\nwave functions. This is the so-called spin-statistics connection (SSC). As we\nwill discuss, the physical reasons why SSC exists are still unknown. On the\nother hand, according to PEP, the permutation symmetry of the total wave\nfunctions can be only of two types: symmetric or antisymmetric, both belong to\none-dimensional representations of the permutation group, all other types of\npermutation symmetry are forbidden; whereas the solution of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation may have any permutation symmetry. It is demonstrated that the proof\nin some widespread textbooks on quantum mechanics that only symmetric and\nantisymmetric states (one-dimensional representations of the permutation group)\ncan exist is wrong. However, the scenarios, in which an arbitrary permutation\nsymmetry (degenerate permutation states) is permitted lead to contradictions\nwith the concepts of particle identity and their independence. Thus, the\nexistence in our nature particles only in nondegenerate permutation states\n(symmetric and antisymmetric) is not accidental and so-called symmetrization\npostulate may not be considered as a postulate, since all other symmetry\noptions for the total wave function may not be realized.

Here, we report the study of atomically thin crystals of the vdw\nmagnet CrI$_3$ down to individual monolayers using scanning single-spin\nmagnetometry, and demonstrate quantitative, nanoscale imaging of magnetisation,\nlocalised defects and magnetic domains. We determine the magnetisation of\nCrI$_3$ monolayers to be $\\approx16~\\mu_B/$nm$^2$ and find comparable values in\nsamples with odd numbers of layers, whereas the magnetisation vanishes when the\nnumber of layers is even. We also establish that this inscrutable even-odd\neffect is intimately connected to the material structure, and that structural\nmodifications can induce switching between ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic\ninterlayer ordering. Besides revealing new aspects of magnetism in atomically\nthin CrI$_3$ crystals, these results demonstrate the power of single-spin\nscanning magnetometry for the study of magnetism in 2D vdw magnets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2019 19:00:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Thiel", "Lucas", ""], ["Wang", "Zhe", ""], ["Tschudin", "M\u00e4rta A.", ""], ["Rohner", "Dominik", ""], ["Guti\u00e9rrez-Lezama", "Ignacio", ""], ["Ubrig", "Nicolas", ""], ["Gibertini", "Marco", ""], ["Giannini", "Enrico", ""], ["Morpurgo", "Alberto F.", ""], ["Maletinsky", "Patrick", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01414", "submitter": "Tankut Can", "authors": "Tankut Can, Vadim Oganesyan, Dror Orgad, Sarang Gopalakrishnan", "title": "Spectral gaps and mid-gap states in random quantum master equations", "comments": "5+13 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

I show that the leading order correction to the ground state energy\nfor more than two bosons is accurately described by the lowest order three-body\nforce in effective field theory that arises due to the off-shell structure of\nthe two-body interaction. For natural two-body interactions with a\nshort-distance repulsive core and an attractive tail, the emergent three-body\ninteraction is repulsive and, therefore, three bosons do not form any bound\nstates. This situation is analogous to the two-dimensional repulsive Bose gas,\nwhen treated using the lowest-order contact interaction, where the scattering\namplitude exhibits an unphysical Landau pole. The avoidance of this state in\nthe three-boson problem proceeds in a way that parallels the two-dimensional\ncase. These results pave the way for the experimental realisation of\none-dimensional Bose gases with pure three-body interactions using ultracold\natomic gases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 11:20:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2019 03:13:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Valiente", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01667", "submitter": "Christian de Ronde", "authors": "Christian de Ronde and C\\'esar Massri", "title": "Against the Tyranny of Pure States in Quantum Theory", "comments": "12 pages.

Ever since the first realization of such a hybrid\nquantum nanophotonic, heating rates of the atomic motion observed in various\nexperimental settings have typically been exceeding those in comparable\nfree-space optical microtraps by about three orders of magnitude. This\nexcessive heating is a roadblock for the implementation of certain protocols\nand devices. Its origin has so far remained elusive and, at the typical\natom-surface separations of less than an optical wavelength encountered in\nnanophotonic traps, numerous effects may potentially contribute to atom\nheating. Here, we theoretically describe the effect of mechanical vibrations of\nwaveguides on guided light fields and provide a general theory of\nparticle-phonon interaction in nanophotonic traps. We test our theory by\napplying it to the case of laser-cooled cesium atoms in nanofiber-based\ntwo-color optical traps. We find excellent quantitative agreement between the\npredicted heating rates and experimentally measured values. Our theory predicts\nthat, in this setting, the dominant heating process stems from the\noptomechanical coupling of the optically trapped atoms to the continuum of\nthermally occupied flexural mechanical modes of the waveguide structure.

We also show that our new technique\nconverges to the asymptotic state of HBAC and that the cooling algorithm can be\nefficiently implemented; however, the saturation could require exponentially\nmany iterations and remains impractical. This brings HBAC to the realm of\nfeasibility and makes it a viable option for realistic application in quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2019 15:26:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Jun 2019 04:34:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Raeisi", "Sadegh", ""], ["Kieferov\u00e1", "M\u00e1ria", ""], ["Mosca", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.04515", "submitter": "Federico Carollo", "authors": "Federico Carollo, Edward Gillman, Hendrik Weimer, and Igor Lesanovsky", "title": "Quantum contact process", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this new context, one finds that this correspondence continues\nwith the Kodaira's classification of elliptic singular fibers. The Seifert\nfibered toroidal manifold $\\Sigma'$, at the boundary of the singular fiber\n$\\tilde {E_8}$, allows possible models of quantum computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2019 09:09:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Planat", "Michel", ""], ["Aschheim", "Raymond", ""], ["Amaral", "Marcelo M.", ""], ["Irwin", "Klee", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.04803", "submitter": "Olivier Giraud", "authors": "N.

However, the consequences of the\nexistence of a classical (critical) phase transition on the corresponding\nquantum state has been mostly ignored. This is particularly interesting since\nthe classical partition function exhibits non-analytic behavior at the critical\npoint and such behavior could have important consequences on the quantum side.\nIn this paper, we consider this problem for an important example of Kitaev\ntoric code model which has been shown to correspond to the two-dimensional (2D)\nIsing model though a duality transformation. Through such duality\ntransformation, it is shown that the temperature on the classical side is\nmapped to bit-flip noise on the quantum side. It is then shown that a\ntransition from a coherent superposition of a given quantum state to a\nnon-coherent mixture corresponds exactly to paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase\ntransition in the Ising model. To identify such a transition further, we define\nan order parameter to characterize the decoherency of such a mixture and show\nthat it behaves similar to the order parameter (magnetization) of 2D Ising\nmodel, a behavior that is interpreted as a robust coherency in the toric code\nmodel. Furthermore, we consider other properties of the noisy toric code model\nexactly at the critical point. We show that there is a relative stability to\nnoise for the toric code state at the critical noise which is revealed by a\nrelative reduction in susceptibility to noise.

Surprisingly, a recently proposed protocol, called twin-field\n(TF) QKD can beat linear bound with no need of quantum repeaters. Here, we\npresent the first implementation of TF-QKD protocol and demonstrate its\nadvantage of beating linear bound at the channel distance of 300 km. In our\nexperiment, a modified TF-QKD protocol which does not assume phase\npost-selection is considered, and thus higher key rate than the original one is\nexpected. After well controlling the phase evolution of the twin fields\ntravelling hundreds of kilometers of optical fibres, the implemented system\nachieves high-visibility single-photon interference, and allows stable and\nhigh-rate measurement-device-independent QKD. Our experimental demonstration\nand results confirm the feasibility of the TF-QKD protocol and its prominent\nsuperiority in long distance key distribution services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2019 04:02:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shuang", ""], ["He", "De-Yong", ""], ["Yin", "Zhen-Qiang", ""], ["Lu", "Feng-Yu", ""], ["Cui", "Chao-Han", ""], ["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Zhou", "Zheng", ""], ["Guo", "Guang-Can", ""], ["Han", "Zheng-Fu", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06888", "submitter": "James Stokes", "authors": "James Stokes and John Terilla", "title": "Probabilistic Modeling with Matrix Product States", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/e21121236", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Inspired by the possibility that generative models based on quantum circuits\ncan provide a useful inductive bias for sequence modeling tasks, we propose an\nefficient training algorithm for a subset of classically simulable quantum\ncircuit models.

We address the question of the extension of these\nlanguages beyond pure quantum mechanics, in order to reason on mixed states and\ngeneral quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps.

We introduce a new construction, the discard construction, which\ntransforms any dagger-symmetric monoidal category into a symmetric monoidal\ncategory equipped with a discard map. Roughly speaking this construction\nconsists in making any isometry causal. Using this construction we provide an\nextension for several graphical languages that we prove to be complete for\ngeneral quantum operations.

These\ninclude non-local games, tasks with quantum communication between players and\nreferee, and simulating bipartite unitaries or communication channels.

A major hurdle for\nscalability in superconducting systems is the so called wiring problem, where\nqubits internal to a chip-set become inaccessible for external control/readout\nlines. Current approaches resort to intricate and exotic 3D wiring and\npackaging technology which is a significant engineering challenge to realize,\nwhile maintaining qubit fidelity.

The method how we prove these results draws\nattention to the fact that theorem for states can be achieved by considering\nthe states as quantum channels and using theorems for channels and different\nkind of positive maps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:23:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Dec 2019 07:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lovas", "Attila", ""], ["Andai", "Attila", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.08473", "submitter": "Xiao-Ye Xu", "authors": "Xiao-Ye Xu, Wei-Wei Pan, Qin-Qin Wang, Jan Dziewior, Lukas Knips,\n  Yaron Kedem, Kai Sun, Jin-Shi Xu, Yong-Jian Han, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo\n  and Lev Vaidman", "title": "Measurements of nonlocal variables and demonstration of the failure of\n  the product rule for a pre- and postselected pair of photons", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures, to be published in PRL", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Although still in the shape of a\nproof of concept, one can already observe that this seminal idea is able to\nsubstantially simplify the complexity of this peculiar, and important, problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:57:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sellier", "Jean Michel", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.08606", "submitter": "Yoan Emery", "authors": "Yoan Emery, Marcos Marino and Massimiliano Ronzani", "title": "Resonances and PT symmetry in quantum curves", "comments": "clarifications and references added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/JHEP04(2020)150", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th math-ph math.MP math.SP quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In the correspondence between spectral problems and topological strings, it\nis natural to consider complex values for the string theory moduli.

Hence, we conclude that finite temperature is the main source of\ndecoherence in such junctions and we demonstrate the possibility to entangle\nthe condensate motion with the ion vibrational state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:07:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 31 Mar 2019 14:50:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 21:12:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ebgha", "Mostafa R.", ""], ["Saeidian", "Shahpoor", ""], ["Schmelcher", "Peter", ""], ["Negretti", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09607", "submitter": "Peter Millington", "authors": "Clare Burrage, Christian K\\\"ading, Peter Millington, Ji\\v{r}\\'i\n  Min\\'a\\v{r}", "title": "Influence functionals, decoherence and conformally coupled scalars", "comments": "9 pages, JPCS format.

This\ncelebrated phenomenon is emblematic of the special nature of randomness in\nquantum physics. The times at which the jumps occur are reputed to be\nfundamentally unpredictable. However, certain classical phenomena, like\ntsunamis, while unpredictable in the long term, may possess a degree of\npredictability in the short term, and in some cases it may be possible to\nprevent a disaster by detecting an advance warning signal. Can there be,\ndespite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a\nquantum jump is about to occur or not? In this dissertation, we answer this\nquestion affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the completed jump\nfrom the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial atom can be\ntracked, as it follows its predictable \"flight,\" by monitoring the population\nof an auxiliary level coupled to the ground state. Furthermore, the\nexperimental results demonstrate that the jump when completed is continuous,\ncoherent, and deterministic. Exploiting these features, we catch and reverse a\nquantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. This\nreal-time intervention is based on a particular lull period in the population\nof the auxiliary level, which serves as our advance warning signal.
