For both cases, $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$ shows a peculiar behavior:\nWhen $p=0$, $C_g$ is an erasure channel with erasure probability $1-\\lambda$,\nso $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$ is zero for $\\lambda \\leq 1/2$. However, for any $p>0$, no\nmatter how small, $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$ is positive, though it may be extremely small,\nfor all $\\lambda >0$. Despite the simplicity of these models we still lack an\nintuitive understanding of the nonadditivity of $Q^{(1)}(B_g)$ and the\npositivity of $Q^{(1)}(C_g)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2020 20:58:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Siddhu", "Vikesh", ""], ["Griffiths", "Robert B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.00603", "submitter": "Yufan Li", "authors": "Yufan Li, Xiaoying Xu, Shu-Ping Lee, and C.

An intuitive way to represent the (in)compatibility\nrelations among a set of measurements is via a hypergraph representing their\njoint measurability structure: its vertices represent measurements and its\nhyperedges represent (all and only) subsets of compatible measurements.\nProjective measurements in quantum theory realize (all and only) joint\nmeasurability structures that are graphs.

A plausible prior distribution for the metric\nfluctuations in a Bayesian framework is introduced. Using this distribution, we\ncalculate the decoherence functional acting on the field by integrating out the\nmetric fluctuations around flat space. Our approach can be interpreted as a\nformulation of Euclidean version of stochastic gravity in the language of\nestimation theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2020 06:23:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 03:14:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2021 02:41:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:24:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gokler", "Can", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.02222", "submitter": "Jan Wiersig", "authors": "Jan Wiersig", "title": "Robustness of exceptional-point-based sensors against parametric noise:\n  The role of Hamiltonian and Liouvillian degeneracies", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

By leveraging tools from\nKrein stability theory in indefinite inner-product spaces, we introduce an\nindicator of stability phase transitions, which naturally extends the notion of\nphase rigidity from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics to the bosonic setting. As\na paradigmatic example, we fully characterize the stability phase diagram of a\nbosonic analogue to the Kitaev-Majorana chain under a wide class of boundary\nconditions. In particular, we establish a connection between phase-dependent\ntransport properties and the onset of instability, and argue that stable\nregions in parameter space become of measure zero in the thermodynamic limit.\nOur analysis also reveals that boundary conditions that support Majorana zero\nmodes in the fermionic Kitaev chain are precisely the same that support\nstability in the bosonic chain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 19:30:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:42:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Flynn", "Vincent P.", ""], ["Cobanera", "Emilio", ""], ["Viola", "Lorenza", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.03413", "submitter": "Anthony Rizzi", "authors": "Anthony Rizzi", "title": "A Simple Approach To Measurement in Quantum Mechanics", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple way, accessible to undergraduates, is given to understand\nmeasurements in quantum mechanics.

In this paper, we consider the simplest\nscenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel\nwith a coherent-state binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) modulation. The two BPSK\nstates can be mapped conceptually to two non-orthogonal states of a qubit,\ndescribed by an inner product that is a function of the mean photon number per\npulse. Using this map, we derive an explicit construction of the quantum\ncircuit of a joint-detection receiver based on a recent idea of\n\"belief-propagation with quantum messages\" (BPQM) (arXiv:1607.04833). We\nquantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs\noptimal pulse-by-pulse detection, which represents the best \"classical\"\napproach. We analyze the scheme rigorously and show that it achieves the\nquantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating 8 (BPSK)\ncodewords of a length-5 binary linear code with a tree factor graph. Our result\nsuggests that a BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity of this\nBPSK-modulated pure-loss channel.

While the amount of entanglement produced by the deterministic\nsequence is fully independent of the initial states considered, the optimized\nsequences achieve in general higher average values of entanglement that do\nhowever depend on the initial state parameters. Our proposed sequence and\noptimization algorithm are especially useful in cases where the initial state\nis not fully known or entanglement has to be generated in a universal manner\nfor a range of initial states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2020 12:19:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 22:22:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gratsea", "Aikaterini", ""], ["Metz", "Friederike", ""], ["Busch", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.07151", "submitter": "Peng-Bo Li", "authors": "Peng-Bo Li, Yuan Zhou, Wei-Bo Gao, and Franco Nori", "title": "Enhancing spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions using linear resources\n  in a hybrid quantum system", "comments": "8 + 14 pages, and 4 + 10 figures, accepted for publication in PRL", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The question arises whether there might be some deeper\nreality hidden beneath quantum mechanics, to be described by a more fundamental\ntheory that can always predict the outcome of each measurement with certainty,\nthis paper by using the QCPB attempts to answer this question. As a result of\nthe QCPB theory, we geometrically propose an equality called quantum\ngeomertainty relation (QGR) to modify the uncertainty relation based on the\nfundamental theory QCPB to positively give a complete description of reality\nthat predicts the outcome of each measurement with certainty, meanwhile, the\nuncertainty relation is just a derivation from this quantum geometric certainty\nequality. It deals with the measurement in quantum equality for different\nmanifolds equipped with various mathematical or physical structure.\nAccordingly, the environment joins the physical process, by taking environment\nvariable as a geometric structure function in the QCPB into consideration, it\nhas naturally solved the environment problem for the measurements. We\ndemonstrate that entanglement term exists between the observable and the\nenvironment.

High fidelity state preparation of both internal and motional states\nof the ions has been demonstrated, and the internal states have been employed\nto store and manipulate qubit information. Furthermore, strong dipolar\ninteractions can be realised between ions in Rydberg states and be explored for\ninvestigating correlated many-body systems. By laser coupling to Rydberg\nstates, the polarisability of the ions can be both enhanced and tuned.

It is then natural to ask, can we harness the power of quantum noise\nthat is beneficial to quantum computing? An important current direction for\nquantum computing is its application to machine learning, such as\nclassification problems. One outstanding problem in machine learning for\nclassification is its sensitivity to adversarial examples. These are small,\nundetectable perturbations from the original data where the perturbed data is\ncompletely misclassified in otherwise extremely accurate classifiers. They can\nalso be considered as `worst-case' perturbations by unknown noise sources. We\nshow that by taking advantage of depolarisation noise in quantum circuits for\nclassification, a robustness bound against adversaries can be derived where the\nrobustness improves with increasing noise. This robustness property is\nintimately connected with an important security concept called differential\nprivacy which can be extended to quantum differential privacy. For the\nprotection of quantum data, this is the first quantum protocol that can be used\nagainst the most general adversaries. Furthermore, we show how the robustness\nin the classical case can be sensitive to the details of the classification\nmodel, but in the quantum case the details of classification model are absent,\nthus also providing a potential quantum advantage for classical data that is\nindependent of quantum speedups.

It has been\nrecently proposed a way to engineer quantum states using a SQUID charge qubit\ninside a cavity with a controllable interaction between the cavity field and\nthe charge qubit. The key ingredients to engineer these quantum states are a\ntunable gate voltage and a classical magnetic field applied to SQUID. Some\nmodels including these ingredients and using some appropriate approximations\nwhich allow for the linearization of the interaction and nonclassical states of\nthe field were generated. Since decoherence is known to affect quantum effects\nuninterruptedly and decoherence process are works even when the quantum state\nis being formed, therefore, it is interesting to envisage processes through\nwhich quantum superpositions are generated as fast as possible. The decoherence\neffect has been studied and quantified in the context of cavity QED where it is\nshown that the more quantum is the superposition, more rapidly the\nenvironmental effects occur during the process of creating the quantum state.\nIn the latter reference, we have succeeded in linearizing the Hamiltonian\nthrough the application of an appropriate unitary transformation and for\ncertain values of the parameters involved, we have showed that it is possible\nto obtain specific Hamiltonians.

We demonstrate how, given any unitary modular\ntensor category (UMTC) and symmetry fractionalization class for a global\nsymmetry group $G$, one can define a (3+1)D topologically invariant path\nintegral in terms of a state sum for a $G$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT)\nstate.

We present concrete algorithms that can be used to\ncompute anomaly indicators in general. Our approach applies to general symmetry\ngroups, including anyon-permuting and anti-unitary symmetries. In addition to\nproviding a general way to compute the anomaly, our result also shows, by\nexplicit construction, that every symmetry fractionalization class for any UMTC\ncan be realized at the surface of a (3+1)D SPT state.

The second\npart applies the solutions of the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian to the\nstudy of non-Gaussianity. We compute the non-Gaussian character of an\noptomechanical state as a function of the parameters in the Hamiltonian, and\ninvestigate the interplay between the non-Gaussianity, the strength of the\nnonlinear coupling and the strength of the single-mode mechanical squeezing\nterm. We find that the strength and form of the nonlinear coupling strongly\nimpacts the non-Gaussianity, and that its relationship with the squeezing term\nis highly complex. The third part concerns the use of nonlinear optomechanical\nsystems as quantum sensors. We derive a general expression of the quantum\nFisher information given the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian and\ndemonstrate its applicability through three concrete examples: estimating the\nstrength of a nonlinear light--matter coupling, the strength of a\ntime-modulated mechanical displacement, and the strength of a single-mode\nmechanical squeezing parameter, all of which are modulated at resonance.

Here, we address the question of whether error-uncorrected\nnoisy quantum computers can provide computational advantage over classical\ncomputers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one\ndimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of\nnoise on the computational power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random quantum circuits via matrix\nproduct operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power of the 1D\nnoisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The\nlatter metric is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO\nsimulation. We numerically demonstrate that for the two-qubit gate error rates\nwe considered, there exists a characteristic system size above which adding\nmore qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical\nMPO simulation of 1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the\ncharacteristic system size, there is an optimal circuit depth, independent of\nthe system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most\nimportantly, the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a\nconstant that depends only on the gate error rate, not on the system size. We\nalso provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of the maximum achievable\nMPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained\nscaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase\nexponentially in the system size above a certain characteristic system size, it\ndoes increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases, possibly making\nclassical simulation practically not feasible even with state-of-the-art\nsupercomputers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 23:55:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2020 20:22:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2020 02:44:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Noh", "Kyungjoo", ""], ["Jiang", "Liang", ""], ["Fefferman", "Bill", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13190", "submitter": "Nuno Dias", "authors": "Nuno Costa Dias, Maurice de Gosson, Joao Nuno Prata", "title": "Partial Traces and the Geometry of Entanglement; Sufficient Conditions\n  for the Separability of Gaussian States", "comments": "41 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP math.SG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The notion of partial trace of a density operator is essential for the\nunderstanding of the entanglement and separability properties of quantum\nstates.

To investigate energetic processes in proteins, we have analyzed the\nsystem of generalized Davydov equations that govern the quantum dynamics of\nmultiple amide I exciton quanta propagating along the hydrogen-bonded peptide\ngroups in $\\alpha$-helices. Computational simulations have confirmed the\ngeneration of moving Davydov solitons by applied pulses of amide I energy for\nprotein $\\alpha$-helices of varying length. The stability and mobility of these\nsolitons depended on the uniformity of dipole-dipole coupling between amide I\noscillators, and the isotropy of the exciton-phonon interaction. Davydov\nsolitons were also able to quantum tunnel through massive barriers, or to\nquantum interfere at collision sites. The results presented here support a\nnontrivial role of quantum effects in biological systems that lies beyond the\nmechanistic support of covalent bonds as binding agents of macromolecular\nstructures. Quantum tunneling and interference of Davydov solitons provide\ncatalytically active macromolecular protein complexes with a physical mechanism\nallowing highly efficient transport, delivery, and utilization of free energy,\nbesides the evolutionary mandate of biological order that supports the\nexistence of such genuine quantum phenomena, and may indeed demarcate the\nquantum boundaries of life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 16:56:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Georgiev", "Danko D.", ""], ["Glazebrook", "James F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13816", "submitter": "Da-Wu Xiao", "authors": "Da-Wu Xiao, Wen-Hui Hu, Yunfeng Cai and Nan Zhao", "title": "Magnetic Noise Enabled Biocompass", "comments": "13 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
