Our first theorem shows that for a $k$-player free game $G$ with\nentangled value $\\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \\epsilon$, the $n$-fold repetition of\n$G$ has entangled value $\\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\\otimes n})$ at most $(1 -\n\\epsilon^{3/2})^{\\Omega(n/sk^4)}$, where $s$ is the answer length of any\nplayer. In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the\nclassical value of two-player free games is $\\mathrm{val}(G^{\\otimes n}) \\leq\n(1 - \\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This\nsuggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and\nclassical free games under parallel repetition.\n  Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the\nplayers can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the\nrepeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 -\n\\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent\non $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \\geq 1$ such\nthat $\\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\\otimes n}) \\geq \\mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$.\n  Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols\nand quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP\n2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel\nrepetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol\nby Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed\nsearch problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than\nwere previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel\nrepetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for\ngames involving quantum outputs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2014 23:55:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2015 04:57:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "Kai-Min", ""], ["Wu", "Xiaodi", ""], ["Yuen", "Henry", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00054", "submitter": "Michele Schiavina", "authors": "Ivan Contreras, Elisa Ercolessi and Michele Schiavina", "title": "On the geometry of mixed states and the Fisher information tensor", "comments": "27 pages; Accepted Manuscript", "journal-ref": "J.

We show that every CP instrument on\nan atomic von Neumann algebra has the NEP, extending the well-known result for\ntype I factors. Moreover, we show that every CP instrument on an injective von\nNeumann algebra is approximated by CP instruments with the NEP. The concept of\nposterior states is also discussed to show that the NEP is equivalent to the\nexistence of a strongly measurable family of posterior states for every normal\nstate. Two examples of CP instruments without the NEP are obtained from this\nresult. It is thus concluded that in local quantum physics not every CP\ninstrument represents a measuring process, but in most of physically relevant\ncases every CP instrument can be realized by a measuring process within\narbitrary error limits, as every approximately finite dimensional (AFD) von\nNeumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is injective. To conclude the\npaper, the concept of local measurement in algebraic quantum field theory is\nexamined in our framework.

The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial)\nsolution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an\noptimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure\nquantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel\nas a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent\nstates, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the\nconcave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output\nstates corresponding to the Gaussian input are \"the least chaotic\", majorizing\nall the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the\ngauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special\nrole. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was\nsolved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the\nadditivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of\ninformation quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel,\nsuch as $(1\\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\\'enyi output\nentropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum\nGaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not\nvalid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the\ngauge-covariant Gaussian channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jan 2015 08:59:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jan 2015 09:32:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 12:57:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Holevo", "A.

We present here the\nextended Bloch model and use it to investigate the nature of quantum spin and\nits relation to our Euclidean space.

Hence, spin entities have to be considered as genuine\nnon-spatial entities. We also show, however, that specific vectors can be\nidentified in the Blochean theater that are isomorphic to the Euclidean space\ndirections, and therefore representative of them, and that spin eigenstates\nalways have a predetermined orientation with respect to them. We use the\ndetails of our results to put forward a new view of realism, that we call\n'multiplex realism', providing a specific framework with which to interpret the\nhuman observations and understanding of the component parts of the world.\nElements of reality can be represented in different theaters, one being our\ncustomary Euclidean space, and another one the quantum realm, revealed to us\nthrough our sophisticated experiments, whose elements of reality, in the\nquantum jargon, are the eigenvalues and eigenstates.

We show that the existence of a pressure gradient force in the\nfluid description does not violate Ehrenfest's theorem since its expectation\nvalue is zero.

This is made\npossible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from\nthe slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where\ndown-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave\ntraveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to\nmake clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more\nintuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also\nany confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed\nchoice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time\ncommunication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the\nTransactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI)\nfor a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice\nexperiment.

Therefore, optimal\nsensitivity in many-particle quantum interferometry can only be achieved by\nchoosing a suitable detection scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 04:15:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ra", "Young-Sik", ""], ["Tichy", "Malte C.", ""], ["Lim", "Hyang-Tag", ""], ["Kwon", "Osung", ""], ["Mintert", "Florian", ""], ["Buchleitner", "Andreas", ""], ["Kim", "Yoon-Ho", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02545", "submitter": "Junde Wu", "authors": "Sunho Kim, Junde Wu", "title": "The Decomposition Properties of Quantum Discord", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Commun.

The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but\nwe also review two more recent results in this area.

A major objective for such interfaces\nis high fidelity storage and retrieval of a photon in a collective quantum\nstate of many atoms. This requires long-lived collective superposition states,\nwhich is typically achieved with immobilized atoms. Thermal atomic vapors,\nwhich present a simple and scalable resource, have, so far, only been used for\ncontinuous variable processing or for discrete variable processing on short\ntime scales where atomic motion is negligible. We develop a theory based on the\nconcept of motional averaging to enable room temperature discrete variable\nquantum memories and coherent single photon sources. We show that by choosing\nthe interaction time so that atoms kept under spin protecting conditions can\ncross the light beam several times during the interaction combined with\nsuitable spectral filtering, we erase the \"which atom\" information and obtain\nan efficient and homogenous coupling between all atoms and the light. Heralded\nsingle excitations can thus be created and stored as collective spinwaves,\nwhich can later be read out to produce coherent single photons in a scalable\nfashion. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to scalable quantum\nmemories with a proof-of-principle experiment with room temperature atoms\ncontained in microcells with spin protecting coating, placed inside an optical\ncavity.

Intuitively, one considers given\nmeasurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory, if\ntheir simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by\nthe theory itself. In the mathematical language of quantum theory, measurements\nare described by POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and given POVMs are\nby definition incompatible if they cannot be obtained via coarse-graining from\na single common POVM; this notion generalizes noncommutativity of projective\nmeasurements. In quantum theory, incompatibility can be regarded as a resource\nnecessary for manifesting phenomena such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)\nBell inequality violations or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering which do\nnot have classical explanation. We define operational ways of quantifying this\nresource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the\nmeasurements compatible, i.e., useless as a resource. In analogy to\nentanglement measures, we generalize this idea by introducing the concept of\nincompatibility measure, which is monotone in local operations. In this paper,\nwe restrict our consideration to binary measurements, which are already\nsufficient to explicitly demonstrate nontrivial features of the theory. In\nparticular, we construct a family of incompatibility monotones operationally\nquantifying violations of certain scaled versions of the CHSH Bell inequality,\nprove that they can be computed via a semidefinite program, and show how the\nnoise-based quantities arise as special cases. We also determine maximal\nviolations of the new inequalities, demonstrating how Tsirelson's bound appears\nas a special case.

Similarly, when simply\nconcerned with the dynamics of a closed quantum system, there is no second law\nbecause the Von Neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations.\nHere we are mainly concerned with the latter problem and we show that it can be\nresolved by attributing a minimal amount of resources to the measurement of\ntime.

For the numerical analysis an initial peaked Gaussian\nstate in the volume will be chosen.

In particular, we show theoretically an unprecedented improvement\nin transport efficiency for increasing maze size with respect to purely quantum\nand classical approaches. In addition, we investigate experimentally these\nhybrid transport phenomena, by mapping the maze problem in an integrated\nwaveguide array, probed by coherent light, hence successfully testing our\ntheoretical results. These achievements may lead towards future bio-inspired\nphotonics technologies for more efficient transport and computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 15:17:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Caruso", "Filippo", ""], ["Crespi", "Andrea", ""], ["Ciriolo", "Anna Gabriella", ""], ["Sciarrino", "Fabio", ""], ["Osellame", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06453", "submitter": "Marius Schulte", "authors": "Marius Schulte, Niels L\\\"orch, Ian D.

However,\nprogress towards the development of a comparable understanding in long-range\ninteracting models, in particular out-of-equilibrium, remains limited. In a\nrecent work, we proposed a semiclassical numerical method to study spin models,\nthe discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA), and demonstrated its\ncapability to correctly capture the dynamics of one- and two-point correlations\nin one dimensional (1D) systems. Here we go one step forward and use the DTWA\nmethod to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and\ndifferent types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical\nmethods are generally unreliable.

Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an\nadditional \"coin space\" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time\nevolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints.\nThis means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a\nlimit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case.

The non-signalling theorem\nmediates the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and the theory of\nspecial relativity. However, as a 'no-go' theorem there exist two opposing\ninterpretations of the non-signalling constraint: foundational and operational.\nConcerning Bell's theorem, we argue that Bell employed both interpretations at\ndifferent times. Bell finally pursued an explicitly operational position on\nnon-signalling which is often associated with ontological quantum theory, e.g.,\nde Broglie-Bohm theory. This position we refer to as \"effective\nnon-signalling\". By contrast, associated with orthodox quantum mechanics is the\nfoundational position referred to here as \"axiomatic non-signalling\". In search\nof a decisive communication-theoretic criterion for differentiating between\n\"axiomatic\" and \"effective\" non-signalling, we employ the operational framework\noffered by Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. We find that an\neffective non-signalling theorem represents two sub-theorems, which we call (1)\nnon-transfer-control (NTC) theorem, and (2) non-signification-control (NSC)\ntheorem. Employing NTC and NSC theorems, we report that effective, instead of\naxiomatic, non-signalling is entirely sufficient for prohibiting nonlocal\ncommunication.

We also demonstrate\nthat the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of\nstate-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its\nperformance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved understanding\nof the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system performance, which is\nrequired for future customization of MDI-QKD. Given that our system can be\noperated outside the laboratory over deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD\nis a promising approach to information-theoretic secure key distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 23:03:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Valivarthi", "Raju", ""], ["Lucio-Martinez", "Itzel", ""], ["Chan", "Philip", ""], ["Rubenok", "Allison", ""], ["John", "Caleb", ""], ["Korchinski", "Daniel", ""], ["Duffin", "Cooper", ""], ["Marsili", "Francesco", ""], ["Verma", "Varun", ""], ["Shaw", "Mathew D.", ""], ["Stern", "Jeffrey A.", ""], ["Nam", "Sae Woo", ""], ["Oblak", "Daniel", ""], ["Zhou", "Qiang", ""], ["Slater", "Joshua A.", ""], ["Tittel", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.07317", "submitter": "Lixin He", "authors": "S.-J.
