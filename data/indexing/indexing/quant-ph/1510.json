Unfortunately,\nClifford operations are precisely the ones available through braiding and\nmeasurement in systems supporting non-Abelian Majorana zero modes, which are\notherwise an excellent candidate for topologically protected quantum\ncomputation. In order to move beyond the classically simulable subspace, an\nadditional phase gate is required. This phase gate allows the system to violate\nthe Bell-like CHSH inequality that would constrain a local hidden variable\ntheory. In this article, we both demonstrate the procedure for measuring Bell\nviolations in Majorana systems and introduce a new type of phase gate for the\nalready existing semiconductor-based Majorana wire systems.

We provide a solution to these two problems by showing that\nthere exists a generic equivalence between a finite spatial resolution of the\nmeasurement apparatus and the exclusion of high-energy degrees of freedom from\nthe definition of the observed system. This equivalence allows for an epistemic\ninterpretation of the standard quantum formalism describing nonrelativistic\nlocalized systems and their correlations, hence a clarification of the origin\nof the finite measures of entanglement between such systems. Chapter 3 presents\na recent theoretical framework that predicts the existence of correlations with\nindefinite causal order.

These approaches come with specific hardware\nrequirements that are typically different than that of a universal gate-based\nquantum computer. We have previously proposed a non-gate-model approach called\nthe single-excitation subspace (SES) method, which requires a complete graph of\nsuperconducting qubits. Like any approach lacking error correction, the SES\nmethod is not scalable, but it often leads to algorithms with constant depth,\nallowing it to outperform the gate model in a wide variety of applications. A\nchallenge of the SES method is that it requires a physical qubit for every\nbasis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costs\nfor algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla would\ndouble the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by\nleaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in the\ncomputational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES\nregister holding ``data\" with one or more ancilla qubits. This enables a hybrid\nform of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the\ndata, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas,\nand controlled-unitaries act between.

We first present, based on the work of Abramsky and Brandenburger, how\nsheaves, defined over certain posets of physically meaningful contexts, give a\nnatural setting for capturing and analysing important quantum mechanical\nphenomena, such as quantum non-locality and contextuality. We also describe how\nthis setting naturally leads to a three level hierarchy of quantum\ncontextuality: weak contextuality, logical non-locality and strong\ncontextuality. We use these insights in order to classify certain multipartite\nentangled states. Almost all of these turn out to be at least logically\nnon-local, and a number of them even turn out to be strongly contextual. We\nfurther extend this result by showing that all n-qubit entangled states, with\nthe exception of tensor products of single-qubit and bipartite\nmaximally-entangled states, are logically non-local. Our proof is constructive:\ngiven any n-qubit state, we present an algorithm which produces n+2 local\nobservables witnessing its logical non-locality.

We then show that the language of the Topos Approach is as least as\nexpressive, in logical terms, as traditional quantum logic.

The mechanism for this\nenhancement of power output is identified as a gentle balance between quantum\nand classical contributions to the local heat flow, such that the total heat\nflow is directed along the shortest paths and dissipation is minimized.\nStrongly related to the spatial network structure of the exciton transfer\ncomplex, this mechanism elucidates how energy flows in photosyntetic excitonic\ncomplexes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Oct 2015 09:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dubi", "Yonatan", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.03045", "submitter": "Ashutosh  Rai", "authors": "Andris Ambainis, Dmitry Kravchenko, and Ashutosh Rai", "title": "Optimal Classical Random Access Codes Using Single d-level Systems", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, in the letter [Phys.

An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three\nslit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in\nterms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.\nThis is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the\ninterference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who\nasked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit\nexperiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of\nquantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope\nof determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer\nfrom pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two\nproposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density\nCubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible\ninterference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of\nZyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage\nover quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a\nwell-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite\nthis, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient\nto uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is\nwell-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all\norders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,\nbut to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order\ninterference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference\ntherefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 20:13:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:21:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Ciar\u00e1n M.", ""], ["Selby", "John H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.03875", "submitter": "Zohar Nussinov", "authors": "Zohar Nussinov", "title": "A one parameter fit for glassy dynamics as a corollary of the\n  equilibrium liquid to solid transition", "comments": "30 pages, 3 figures, 1 table; to appear in Philosophical Magazine", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.soft quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We apply microcanonical ensemble considerations to suggest that, whenever it\nmay thermalize, a general disorder-free many-body Hamiltonian of a typical\natomic system has solid-like eigenstates at low energies and fluid-type (and\ngaseous, plasma) eigenstates associated with energy densities exceeding those\npresent in the melting (and, respectively, higher energy) transition(s).

In particular,\nwhen located on the string, ground-state atoms can make a transition to excited\nstates only if they are polarizable parallel to the string, whereas ground\nstate atoms polarizable only perpendicular to the string are stable as if they\nwere in a vacuum, even if they are immersed in a thermal bath. Our results\nsuggest that the influence of a cosmic string is very similar to that of a\nreflecting boundary in Minkowski spacetime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 23:31:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Huabing", ""], ["Yu", "Hongwei", ""], ["Zhou", "Wenting", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.04746", "submitter": "Nan Zhao", "authors": "Xing Xiao and Nan Zhao", "title": "Proposal for Observing Dynamic Jahn-Teller Effect of Single Solid-State\n  Defects", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) widely exists in polyatomic systems including\norganic molecules, nano-magnets, and solid-state defects.

The\npresent paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a\nhistory of how the laser was invented.

A more specific,\nquantum theoretic, version, \"laser light is in a coherent state\", is simply\nwrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be\ndescribed by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in\nspace. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are\nneeded: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable\nintensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a\nquantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up\nto $\\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a\nlight bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable\nto \"coherence\", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to\nmy knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics\nsense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only\nsimple description of a laser beam.

Here, exact analytical expressions for nonequilibrium\nspin-spin correlation functions are derived for a specific model of spins\ncoupled to bosons. The spatial structure of the coupling between spins and\nbosons is completely arbitrary, and thus the solution can be applied to systems\nin any number of dimensions. The explicit and nonperturbative inclusion of the\nbosons enables the study of entanglement generation (in the form of spin\nsqueezing) even when the bosons are driven strongly and near-resonantly, and\nthus provides a quantitative view of the breakdown of adiabatic elimination\nthat inevitably occurs as one pushes towards the fastest entanglement\ngeneration possible. The solution also helps elucidate the effect of finite\ntemperature on spin squeezing. The model considered is relevant to a variety of\natomic, molecular, and optical systems, such as atoms in cavities or trapped\nions. As an explicit example, the results are used to quantify phonon effects\nin trapped ion quantum simulators, which are expected to become increasingly\nimportant as these experiments push towards larger numbers of ions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 20:03:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Dylewsky", "D.", ""], ["Freericks", "J.

However, direct comparison\nbetween measured error rates and thresholds is complicated by the fact that\nbenchmarking estimates average error rates while thresholds reflect worst-case\nbehavior when a gate is used as part of a large computation. These two measures\nof error can differ by orders of magnitude in the regime of interest. Here we\nfacilitate comparison between the experimentally accessible average error rates\nand the worst-case quantities that arise in current threshold theorems by\nderiving relations between the two for a variety of physical noise sources. Our\nresults indicate that it is coherent errors that lead to an enormous mismatch\nbetween average and worst case, and we quantify how well these errors must be\ncontrolled to ensure fair comparison between average error probabilities and\nfault-tolerance thresholds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 20:17:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2016 17:38:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kueng", "Richard", ""], ["Long", "David M.", ""], ["Doherty", "Andrew C.", ""], ["Flammia", "Steven T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.05655", "submitter": "Markku P.

However, decoherence\ntends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider\ntwo coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled\nand measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements\ncan provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of\nmeasurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy.\nHowever, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating\nbetween the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi\noscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless\ncarefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for\nefficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We\nfind, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi\noscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are\nsufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the\nunknown frequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger.

The model is shown to display\npumping of weights between setup-defined basis states, with a single winner\nrandomly selected and the rest collapsing to zero. Environmental decoherence\nhas no role in the scenario. Through stochastic modelling, based on Pearle's\n\"gambler's ruin\" scheme, outcome probabilities are shown to obey Born's rule\nunder a no-drift or \"fair-game\" condition.

We propose an answer to this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue\nformulation of non-relativistic stochastic mechanics for a spinless particle\nwith the following hypothesis: a spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass\n$m$ continuously undergoes a driven steady-state oscillation of\n`zitterbewegung' (\\emph{zbw}) frequency,\n$\\omega_{c}=\\left(1/\\hbar\\right)mc^{2}$, in its instantaneous mean forward (and\nbackward) translational rest frame. With this hypothesis we show that, in the\nlab frame, \\emph{S} arises from imposing the constraint of conservative\ndiffusions on the time-symmetrized steady-state phase of the \\emph{zbw}\nparticle, satisfies the required quantization condition, and evolves in time by\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations (when generalized to describe a\nstatistical ensemble of \\emph{zbw} particles). From the mathematical\nequivalence of Schr\\\"odinger's equation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung\nequations plus the quantization condition, Schr\\\"odinger wave functions for a\nspinless particle (in and excluding external fields) are thereby recovered.

We\nthen numerically calculate the Casimir energy between a metallic (gold) sphere\nand a dielectric (fused silica) lamellar grating at room temperature, and\nexplore its dependence on the sphere radius, grating-sphere separation, and\nlateral displacement. We quantitatively investigate the geometrical dependence\nof the interaction, which is sensitive to the grating height and filling\nfactor, and show how the sphere can be used as a local sensor of the Casimir\nforce geometric features. To this purpose we mostly concentrate on separations\nand sphere radii of the same order of the grating parameters (here of the order\nof one micrometer). We also investigate the lateral component of the Casimir\nforce, resulting from the absence of translational invariance. We compare our\nresults with those obtained within the proximity force approximation (PFA).\nWhen applied to the sphere only, PFA overestimates the strength of the\nattractive interaction, and we find that the discrepancy is larger in the\nsphere-grating than in the sphere-plane geometry. On the other hand, when PFA\nis applied to both sphere and grating, it provides a better estimate of the\nexact results, simply because the effect of a single grating is underestimated,\nthus leading to a partial compensation of errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2015 09:15:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 23:02:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Messina", "Riccardo", ""], ["Neto", "Paulo A.

Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs\nwas previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid\nqubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the\nnuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding\nof the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.\n  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which\n(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in\nmultiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath\nand (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and\nclassical-field decoherence.

Working in the limit of a short interaction\ntime, we find that the inclusion of the antiresonant terms to the coupling\nHamiltonian leads the system to relax to a state which is not the ground state\nof the system. This effect occurs passively by just presence of the\nantiresonant terms and is explained in terms of the time-energy uncertainty\nprinciple for the simple reason that at a very short interaction time, the\nuncertainty in the energy is of order of the energy of a single excitation,\nthereby leading to a distribution of the population among the zero, singly and\ndoubly excited states. The population distribution, correlations and\nentanglement are shown to be substantially depend on whether the modes decay\nindependently or collectively to an exterior reservoir. In particular, when the\nmodes decay independently with equal rates, entanglement with the complete\ndistinguishability of the modes is observed. The modes can be made mutually\ncoherent if they decay with unequal rates. However, the visibility in the\nsingle-photon interference cannot exceed $50\\%$. When the modes experience\ncollective damping, they are indistinguishable even if decay with equal rates\nand the visibility can, in principle, be as large as unity. We find that this\nfeature derives from the decay of the system to a pure entangled state rather\nthan the expected mixed state. When the modes decay with equal rates, the\nsteady-state values of the density matrix elements are found dependent on their\ninitial values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:15:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 10:42:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bougouffa", "Smail", ""], ["Ficek", "Zbigniew", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09164", "submitter": "Cornelia Spee", "authors": "C.

Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state\nwhich can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In\nthe multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the\nMaximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is\nrequired. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of\nthis set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on\nthe other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via\nLOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states\nand derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states. Here, we consider the\nnon-generic 4-qubit states and analyze their properties regarding local\ntransformations. We prove that most SLOCC classes show a similar behavior as\nthe generic states, however we also identify three classes with very distinct\nproperties. The first consists of the GHZ and W class, where any state can be\ntransformed into some other state non-trivially. In particular, there exists no\nisolation. On the other hand, there also exist classes where all states are\nisolated.
