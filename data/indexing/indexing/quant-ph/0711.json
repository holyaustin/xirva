As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes\npropagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition\nwhere we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together\nwith the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution \"plasmonic\".\nThe remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call \"photonic\". The\nCasimir energy contains two main contributions, one coming from the plasmonic,\nthe other from the photonic modes. Surprisingly we find that the plasmonic\ncontribution to the Casimir energy becomes repulsive for intermediate and large\nmirror separations. Alternatively, we discuss the common surface plasmon\ndefintion, which includes only evanescent waves, where this effect is not\nfound. We show that, in contrast to an intuitive expectation, for both\ndefinitions the Casimir energy is the sum of two very large contributions which\nnearly cancel each other.

The experimental\nresults are well described by Quantum Mechanics theory and a Local Realistic\nHidden Variables model which was specially developed for NMR. That is why we\nrefer to this experiment as a {\\it simulation} of the Bell's inequality\nviolation. Our result shows explicitly how both theories can be compatible to\neach other due the detection loophole.

In order to define\nthese over a Hilbert space we must restrict to a base of finite, yet unbounded\nconfigurations. We show that QCA always admit a two-layered block\nrepresentation, and hence the inverse QCA is again a QCA. This is a striking\nresult since the property does not hold for classical one-dimensional cellular\nautomata as defined over such finite configurations. As an example we discuss a\nbijective cellular automata which becomes non-local as a QCA, in a rare case of\nreversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization. We\nargue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be\nconsidered to be reversible in a physical sense. Note that the same two-layered\nblock representation result applies also over infinite configurations, as was\npreviously shown for one-dimensional systems in the more elaborate formalism of\noperators algebras [9]. Here the proof is made simpler and self-contained,\nmoreover we discuss a counterexample QCA in higher dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 18:20:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Arrighi", "Pablo", ""], ["Nesme", "Vincent", ""], ["Werner", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3519", "submitter": "Pulak Ranjan Giri", "authors": "Pulak Ranjan Giri, S.

The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that\nthere ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer\nto a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies\nthat quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.\nStandard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear\ntheory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas\nbased on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation\nand derive a non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of\nthe wave-function.

In this\npaper our main aim is to provide an objective interpretation of quantum\nmechanics which allows us to discuss the meaning of physical reality according\nto the theory. For this specific propose we present the concept of 'faculty' in\nplace of the concept of 'entity'. Within our theory of faculties, we continue\nto discuss and interpret two paradigmatic experiments of quantum mechanics such\nas the double-slit and Schrodinger's cat.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 14:44:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["de Ronde", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4770", "submitter": "Alberto Montina", "authors": "Alberto Montina", "title": "Exponential complexity and ontological theories of quantum mechanics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

We provide the first proof that the number of continuous variables\ncan not be smaller than 2N-2, N being the Hilbert space dimension. Thus, any\nontological Markovian theory of quantum mechanics requires a number of\nvariables which grows exponentially with the physical size.
