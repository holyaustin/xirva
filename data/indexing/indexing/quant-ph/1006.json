The von Neumann entropy is a special case of a more general class of\nentropies called Renyi entropies. Using Euclidean gravity, Fursaev computed the\nentanglement Renyi entropies (EREs) of an arbitrary spatial region in an\narbitrary holographic field theory, and thereby derived the RT formula.

We remedy this situation in\nthe case of two-dimensional CFTs, considering regions consisting of one or two\nintervals. For a single interval, the EREs are known for a general CFT; we\nreproduce them using gravity. For two intervals, the RT formula predicts a\nphase transition in the entanglement entropy as a function of their separation,\nand that the mutual information between the intervals vanishes for separations\nlarger than the phase transition point. By computing EREs using gravity and CFT\ntechniques, we find evidence supporting both predictions.

In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key\ncan be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum\nparticles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used\nby Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum\nmechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum\ncryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very\neavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both\npractical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on\noperational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -\nthat information gain about one observable must cause disturbance to another,\nincompatible one?\n  Here we resolve this problem by using another striking feature of quantum\nworld - contextuality. It is a strong version of incompatibility manifested in\nthe famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial concept is the use of a new\nclass of families of bipartite probability distributions . We show that if two\npersons share systems which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox and, in\naddition, exhibit perfect correlations, then they can extract secure key, even\nif they do not trust the quantum devices. This is the first operational\nprotocol that directly implements the fundamental feature of Nature: the\ninformation gain vs. disturbance trade-off.\n  For sake of proof we exhibit a new Bell's inequality which is interesting in\nitself.

The metamaterials are modeled as two dimensional arrays of\ndomains with varying permittivity and permeability. In the case of two\nsemi-infinite bodies with flat boundaries, the patterned structure of the\nmaterial properties is found to cause the normal Casimir-Lifshitz force to\ndevelop an oscillatory behavior when the distance between the two bodies is\ncomparable to the wavelength of the patterned features in the metamaterials.\nThe non-uniformity also leads to the emergence of lateral Casimir-Lifshitz\nforces, which tend to strengthen as the gap size becomes smaller. Our results\nsuggest that the recent studies on Casimir-Lifshitz forces between\nmetamaterials, which have been performed with the aim of examining the\npossibility of observing the repulsive force, should be revisited to include\nthe effect of the patterned structure at the wavelength of several hundred\nnanometers that coincides with the relevant gap size in the experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 20:38:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 10:03:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Azari", "Arash", ""], ["Miri", "MirFaez", ""], ["Golestanian", "Ramin", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1394", "submitter": "Eduardo Martin-Martinez", "authors": "E.

In general, physical cross section\nreduction increases velocities, either by lifting the heavy mass valleys, or\nsignificantly changing the curvature of the bands.

The\ncharacteristic features of the low temperature phase is a large self-formed\ninhomogeneity of the order-parameter distribution near the critical point\nK_{c}(g) where the critical temperature T_{c} of the ordering transition\nvanishes. Near the quantum critical point, the typical value of the order\nparameter vanishes exponentially, B_{0}\\propto e^{-C/(K-K_{c}(g))}.\n  In the disordered regime, realized at K<K_{c}(g) we find actually two\ndistinct phases characterized by different behavior of relaxation rates. The\nfirst phase exists in an intermediate range of K^{*}(g)<K<K_{c}(g).

In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement.
