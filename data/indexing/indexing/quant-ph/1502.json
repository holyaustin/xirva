By the order effect we\nmean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the\norder of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility:\nadjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The\nfirst one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of\nsome observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The\nsecond one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$\nmeasurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s.\nHeuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is\ncomplementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important\nclass of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures\n(POVMs), this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a\nseparated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both\nobservables $A$ and $B.$ However, the additional constraint in the form of\nseparated reproducibility of the $B-A-B$ type makes this coexistence\nimpossible. Mathematically, this paper is about the operator algebra for\neffects composing POVMs. The problem under consideration was motivated by\nattempts to apply the quantum formalism outside of physics, especially, in\ncognitive psychology and psychophysics. However, it is also important for\nfoundations of quantum physics as a part of the problem about the structure of\nsequential quantum measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2015 16:15:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Basieva", "Irina", ""], ["Khrennikov", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00160", "submitter": "Christian Schneider", "authors": "C.

Problems such as\nwhen quantum advantage exists, and if existing, how much it could be, are at a\ncentral position of these studies. In a broad class of scenarios, there are,\nimplicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved, who share a state, and\nthe correlation in this shared state is the key factor to the efficiency under\nconcern. In these scenarios, the shared \\emph{entanglement} or \\emph{discord}\nis usually what accounts for quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a\nfundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a\nbranch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more\nplayers. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the chance for any player\nto win the game depends only on the ending correlation. We show that in a\ncertain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can further\nincrease her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever first uses a\nquantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The\nequilibrium is fair to both players and, as a shared correlation, it does not\ncontain any discord, yet a quantum advantage still exists.

Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a\nwell-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes.\nIt is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal\nreconstruction technique known as \"compressed sensing\" has been ported to\nquantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can\nbe achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly\nenhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed\nsensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special\nproperty of quantum mechanics itself---that the mathematical objects that\ndescribe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative\neigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is\nunderstood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information\nobtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a\nnew sense of \"informational completeness.\" This has important consequences on\nthe efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to\nconstruct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and\nmodeling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical\ntool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms\ndeveloped to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert\nspace. While we mainly present our results in the context of quantum\ntomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix\nrecovery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 16:27:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 16:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 17:08:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kalev", "Amir", ""], ["Kosut", "Robert L.", ""], ["Deutsch", "Ivan H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00554", "submitter": "Pavel Lougovski", "authors": "P.

The famous paradoxes of quantum\ntheory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the\nprincipal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The\nKoopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions\nunderlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step\nforward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of\nclassical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but\nequivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a\nquantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of\nKvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space\nfoundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and\nBell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An\nimportant new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that\nentanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures\nof quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of\nnon-separability.

Consequently, we\ntransfer the conjecture to the Fourier transform of the Wigner function, that\nis, the chord function. We show that all the relevant consequences of the usual\nconjecture require only information contained within a small (Planck) volume\naround the origin of the phase space of chords: translations in ordinary phase\nspace. Loci of complete orthogonality between a given eigenstate and its nearby\ntranslation are quite elusive for the Wigner function, but our local conjecture\nstipulates that their pattern should be universal for ergodic eigenstates of\nthe same Hamiltonian lying within a classically narrow energy range. Our\nfindings are supported by numerical evidence in a Hamiltonian exhibiting soft\nchaos.

Upon injection of\ntwo photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance\nfluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit\ntransition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by\ninterference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite\nwaveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite\nwaveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by\nstimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered\nhere), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very\nlong time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the\ntransmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched. On the\nother hand, upon resonant driving, incoherently reflected photons are mostly\ndistributed within the photonic band gap and several sharp side peaks. These\nfeatures can be explained by considering the poles of the single particle Green\nfunction in the Markovian regime combined with the time delay.

Moreover,\nsince energy-momentum is the source of gravity, we argue that energy-momentum\nis necessarily conserved for a large class of non-unitary systems with gravity.\nFinally, we explicitly calculate the Lindblad operators for non-unitary Hawking\nradiation and show that they conserve energy-momentum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 15:30:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 13:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Nikolic", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04349", "submitter": "J\\\"urgen Eschner", "authors": "Nicolas Piro and J\\\"urgen Eschner", "title": "Single photon absorption by a single atom: from heralded absorption to\n  polarization state mapping", "comments": "to appear as a book chapter in a compilation \"Engineering the\n  Atom-Photon Interaction\" published by Springer in 2015, edited by A.\n  Predojevic and M.

As an experimentally controlled process, it is a key\ntool for the realization of quantum technologies. In particular, in an\natom/photon based quantum network scenario, in which localized atomic particles\nare used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as\ncarriers of quantum information between distant nodes, controlling both\nemission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for\nquantum coherent state mapping between the two entities. Most experimental\nefforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon\nemission by single trapped atoms, and the implementation of quantum networking\nprotocols using this interaction. In this chapter, we describe experimental\nefforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped\nions. We describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled\nphoton pairs, generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, are\ncoupled to a single ion. First the source is operated to generate heralded\nsingle photons, and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of\nthe pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed. We\nthen show how polarization control in the process is established, leading to\nthe manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption\nprocess. Finally, we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is\nharnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network, such as entanglement\ndistribution among distant nodes of the network, and we demonstrate a specific\nprotocol for heralded, high-fidelity photon-to-atom quantum state transfer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 19:16:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 16:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Piro", "Nicolas", ""], ["Eschner", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04350", "submitter": "P.

A question readily accessible to atomic systems is\nrelated to the speed of propagation of matter-waves as a function of the\nlattice geometry. To address this issue, we have investigated theoretically the\nquantum transport of non-interacting and weakly-interacting ultracold fermionic\natoms in several 2D optical lattice geometries. We find that the triangular\nlattice has a higher propagation velocity compared to the square lattice,\ndespite supporting longer paths. The body-centered square lattice has even\nlonger paths, nonetheless the propagation velocity is yet faster. This apparent\nparadox arises from the mixing of the momentum states which leads to different\ngroup velocities in quantum systems.

Our aim in this paper is to fill up this gap, at least\npartially, by verifying the laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum\nfidelity in a $2D$ case.

A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a\nwire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom\nand two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an\natom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires.\nTo this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism\nfor three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the\ninteraction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In\nthat case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by\nthree- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by\nan analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom\ngeometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem. But it\nis not so hard to investigate the three-body corrections to the interaction\nbetween an anisotropic atom or nanoparticle and a pair of parallel conducting\ncylinders, and show that the three-body effects are very small and do not\naffect the Casimir-Polder repulsion at large distances between the cylinders.\nFinally, we consider whether such highly anisotropic atoms needed for repulsion\nare practically realizable.

In the first approach,\nthe wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended\n\"catalytic state\". Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can\norganize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the\nterms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation.\nGoing to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov\napproximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture\nand to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to\ntrack different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the\nmulti-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\\times\nn$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an\narbitrary $l$-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state\ncase for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS\nreproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also\nworks in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation\nfails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error\n(measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices)\nof PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making\nPCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the\nerror of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system\nevolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent\nequations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The\ntime complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the\nnumber of orbitals in use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 19:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Zhang", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06957", "submitter": "George Chechin M.", "authors": "G.

The\nground state of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate has been proven to be 100%\ncondensed in the limit of infinite particle number and constant interaction\nparameter [Lieb and Seiringer, Phys.

The\nmeaning of this result is that properties of the condensate, noticeably its\nenergy and density, converge to those obtained by minimizing the\nGross-Pitaevskii energy functional. This naturally raises the question whether\ncorrelations are of any importance in this limit. Here, we demonstrate both\nanalytically and numerically that even in the infinite particle limit many-body\ncorrelations can lead to a substantial modification of the \\textit{variance} of\nany operator compared to that expected from the Gross-Pitaevskii result. The\nstrong deviation of the variance stems from its explicit dependence on terms of\nthe reduced two-body density matrix which otherwise do not contribute to the\nenergy and density in this limit. This makes the variance a sensitive probe of\nmany-body correlations even when the energy and density of the system have\nalready converged to the Gross-Pitaevskii result. We use the center-of-mass\nposition operator to exemplify this persistence of correlations.

Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that\nquantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy\ntransfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property\nthat expresses a stronger-than-entanglement form of correlation, exists between\ndifferent pairs of chromophores in the FMO complex when modeling the EET by the\nhierarchically coupled equations of motion method. We compare the results for\nnonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In\nparticular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by\ndifferent initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only\nexists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and\nprobably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural\nhabitat. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement behave quite\ndifferently in this system. In particular, for localized initial states,\nnonlocality only exists on a very short time scale and then drops to zero in an\nabrupt manner. As already known from previous studies, quantum entanglement\nbetween chromophore pairs on the other hand is oscillating and exponentially\ndecaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore\npopulation dynamics. The abrupt disappearance of nonlocality in the presence of\nnonvanishing entanglement is a phenomenon we call nonlocality sudden death; a\nstriking manifestation of the difference between these two types of\ncorrelations in quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 09:50:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 14:29:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 12:48:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bengtson", "Charlotta", ""], ["Stenrup", "Michael", ""], ["Sj\u00f6qvist", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07849", "submitter": "Rishi Patel", "authors": "Rishi N.

Owing to its ability to completely resist decoherence and the lack of\nrestraint in terms of the total engineering time, our proposal is suitable for\nmultitask quantum-state engineering program. Therefore, this proposal is not\nonly useful for achieving the quantum-state engineering program experimentally,\nit also helps us build both a quantum simulation and quantum information\nequipment in reality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 16:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "S.

Math. Phys. 340(2):575, 2015] recently established\na lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) of\ntripartite quantum states $ABC$ in terms of the fidelity of recovery (FoR),\ni.e. the maximal fidelity of the state $ABC$ with a state reconstructed from\nits marginal $BC$ by acting only on the $C$ system. The FoR measures quantum\ncorrelations by the local recoverability of global states and has many\nproperties similar to the CQMI. Here we generalize the FoR and show that the\nresulting measure is multiplicative by utilizing semi-definite programming\nduality. This allows us to simplify an operational proof by Brandao et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115(5):050501, 2015] of the above-mentioned lower bound that\nis based on quantum state redistribution. In particular, in contrast to the\nprevious approaches, our proof does not rely on de Finetti reductions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 17:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Berta", "Mario", ""], ["Tomamichel", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07977", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "Mario Berta, Kaushik P.
