Here I show that their arguments make illegitimate\nappeal to non-symmetric, i.e. permutation-non-invariant, quantities, and that\ntherefore their conclusions do not go through. However, I show that\nalternative, symmetric quantities may be found to do the required work.

Although for low numbers of particles the\ndecoherence may be ignored, for large $N$ the presence of noise heavily alters\nthe form of both optimal states and measurements attaining the ultimate\nresolution. However, the established bounds are then typically achievable with\nuse of techniques natural to current experiments.

Our analysis is based on the approach we have\npreviously applied to individual decision makers, which we now generalize to\nthe case of decision makers that are members of a society. The approach employs\nthe mathematical techniques that are common in quantum theory, justifying our\nnaming as Quantum Decision Theory. However, we do not assume that decision\nmakers are quantum objects. The techniques of quantum theory are needed only\nfor defining the prospect probabilities taking into account such hidden\nvariables as behavioral biases and other subconscious feelings. The approach\ndescribes an agent's choice as a probabilistic event occurring with a\nprobability that is the sum of a utility factor and of an attraction factor.\nThe attraction factor embodies subjective and unconscious dimensions in the\nmind of the decision maker. We show that the typical aggregate amplitude of the\nattraction factor is $1/4$, and it can be either positive or negative depending\non the relative attraction of the competing choices. The most efficient way of\nvarying the decision makers choice is realized by influencing the attraction\nfactor. This can be done in two ways. One method is to arrange in a special\nmanner the payoff weights, which induces the required changes of the values of\nattraction factors.

Our understanding of quantum mechanics has\nalready enabled important applications in biology, including positron emission\ntomography (PET) with entangled photons, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, and bio-magnetic imaging with superconducting\nquantum interference devices (SQUIDs).

The process approach provides a\ndynamical completion of NRQM.

An\ninterpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us\nto reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature\nthermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we\npresent three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit\nquantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without\nuncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously\nprove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum\nmapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial\ndimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum\nsystem also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be\nprepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions.\nThis mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between\nsimulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one\nand introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time\nrequired to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a\nquantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a\nquadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical\nsimulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic;\ninstead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the\ncorresponding quantum system.

We argue that the\ntheory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what\nextent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the\ndefinition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and\nthen show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely\nbounded norm condition between operator spaces. From this we show that very\nhigh min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always\n(approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors\ncalled randomness condensers. We phrase the definition of condensers as a\nbounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a\ncompletely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we\nthen find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well\nstudied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore,\nusing the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any\ncondenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum\nstrategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks\non the condenser. Hence, we get for every quantum-proof condenser (which\nincludes in particular quantum-proof extractors) a Bell inequality that can not\nbe violated by quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2014 19:59:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 16:29:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 May 2017 17:26:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Berta", "Mario", ""], ["Fawzi", "Omar", ""], ["Scholz", "Volkher B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.3585", "submitter": "Grant Salton", "authors": "Ning Bao, Patrick Hayden, Grant Salton, Nathaniel Thomas", "title": "Universal Quantum Computation by Scattering in the Fermi-Hubbard Model", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures.

No-signaling\nboxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and wirings are local\noperations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means that, no matter how\nnon-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be\nclosed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature\nis to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial\nexamples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way\nto study wirings. In particular, given a set of no-signaling boxes, we do not\nknow a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings. In this paper,\nwe propose the first general method to construct such closed sets of non-local\ncorrelations. We show that a well-known measure of correlation, called maximal\ncorrelation, when appropriately defined for non-local correlations, is\nmonotonically decreasing under wirings.\n  This establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic\nboxes from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of\nnon-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some\nmathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of\nmaximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and\nprovide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity\nribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 07:47:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Oct 2014 10:32:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 13:37:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Beigi", "Salman", ""], ["Gohari", "Amin", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.3675", "submitter": "Julien Laurat", "authors": "K.

As the GFR and GCB around the cavity resonance are relatively\nimmune to the saturation effects, the rapid read out of single electron spins\ncan be carried out with coherent state and other statistically fluctuating\nlight fields. This also shows that high speed quantum entangling gates, robust\nagainst input power variations, can be built exploiting these linear effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:56:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 11:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "C.

Here, a simple\nderivation of these URs is presented based on a single classical inequality\nfrom estimation theory, a Cram\\'er-Rao-like bound. The Heisenberg-Robertson UR\nis then obtained by using the Born rule and the Schr\\\"odinger equation. This\nallows a clear separtion of the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics from\nthe Hilbert space structure and the dynamical law. It also simplifies the\ninterpretation of the bound. In addition, the Heisenberg-Robertson UR is\ntightened for mixed states by replacing one variance by the so-called quantum\nFisher information. Thermal states of Hamiltonians with evenly-gapped energy\nlevels are shown to saturate the tighter bound for natural choices of the\noperators. This example is further extended to Gaussian states of a harmonic\noscillator. For many-qubit systems, we illustrate the interplay between\nentanglement and the structure of the operators that saturate the UR with\nspin-squeezed states and Dicke states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 20:25:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 15:32:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 11:16:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Fr\u00f6wis", "Florian", ""], ["Schmied", "Roman", ""], ["Gisin", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.4454", "submitter": "Fabio Revuelta Ph.D.", "authors": "F.

This article provides an overview of\nepistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical\ntheory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and\ndiscrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction\ncalled classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all\nknown epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic\nstructure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to\nan arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a\nkind of quasi-quantization scheme; \"quasi\" because it generally only yields a\ntheory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and\nmeasurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and\nbecause in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is\na distortion of such a subset.

To\ndisplay the mathematical form of equations of quantum theory used to describe\nexperiments, we make explicit the knobs by which the devices of an experiment\nare arranged and adjusted. A quantum description comes in two parts: (1) a\nstatement of results of an experiment, expressed by probabilities of detections\nas functions of knob settings, and (2) an explanation of how we think these\nresults come about, expressed by linear operators, also as functions of knob\nsettings. Because quantum mechanics separates the two parts of any description,\nit is known that between the statements of results and the explanations lurks a\nlogical gap: given any statement of results one has a choice of explanations.\n  Here we work out some consequences of this openness to choice.

In addition to its\nfundamental interest, teleportation has been recognized as an important element\nin long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum networks and\nmeasurement-based quantum computation. There have been numerous demonstrations\nof teleportation in different physical systems such as photons, atoms, ions,\nelectrons, and superconducting circuits. Yet, all the previous experiments were\nlimited to teleportation of one degree of freedom (DoF) only. However, a single\nquantum particle can naturally possess various DoFs -- internal and external --\nand with coherent coupling among them. A fundamental open challenge is to\nsimultaneously teleport multiple DoFs, which is necessary to fully describe a\nquantum particle, thereby truly teleporting it intactly. Here, we demonstrate\nthe first teleportation of the composite quantum states of a single photon\nencoded in both the spin and orbital angular momentum. We develop a method to\nproject and discriminate hyper-entangled Bell states exploiting probabilistic\nquantum non-demolition measurement, which can be extended to more DoFs. We\nverify the teleportation for both spin-orbit product states and hybrid\nentangled state, and achieve a teleportation fidelity ranging from 0.57 to\n0.68, above the classical limit.

When the particles have equal mass\nand their circulatory motions are aligned but out of phase, part of the\nmagnetic force is equal but opposite the Coulomb force. This raises a\npossibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to\nthe magnetic force of classical electrodynamics. It is further shown that\nnon-relativistic relative motion between the particles leads to modulation of\nthe magnetic force with spatial period equal to the de Broglie wavelength.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2014 06:39:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 21:42:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 04:49:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2016 03:15:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2019 16:51:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 14:06:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Dec 2014 20:00:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 19:37:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 14:50:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 07:54:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 04:47:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 03:19:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sun, 17 Jan 2016 08:24:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lush", "David C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8282", "submitter": "Charles-Edouard Bardyn", "authors": "Charles-Edouard Bardyn, Torsten Karzig, Gil Refael, Timothy C.

The concept of quantumness of correlations between the\nobservables of a system is based on incommensurability of the correlations with\nthe predictions of some local hidden variable (LHV) theory. However, the\nconcept of quantumness of mutual information does not invoke the LHV theory\nexplicitly. In this paper, by invoking explicitly the local hidden variable\ntheory, a measure of quantumness of mutual information, $Q_{LHV}$, for a system\nof two spin-1/2 particles is proposed. It is based on finding the difference\nbetween the quantum and classical mutual informations in which the classical\nmutual information corresponds to the joint probability of the eigenvalues of\nthe spins each along a specified direction. The proposed measure circumvents\nthe need of optimization when the Bloch vector of each spin is non-zero; the\noptimization is needed but can be performed analytically exactly when the Bloch\nvector of each spin vanishes and is simplified when the Bloch vector of only\none of the spins is zero. In essence, the proposed measure is identical with\nthe measurement induced disturbance when the Bloch vector of each of the spins\nis non-zero. However, whereas the measurement induced disturbance is non-unique\nwhen the Bloch vector of one or both the spins is zero, the proposed measure\neven then determines the quantumness of mutual information unambiguously. The\n$Q_{LHV}$ is identical with the symmetric discord if the Bloch vector of each\nspin vanishes. It is same as the quantum discord if the Bloch vector of only\none spin is zero and if the state in question possesses certain additional\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 06:25:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Puri", "R.

In this framework, class\n$A$ of crypto-protocols reduces to protocol class $B$ in a scenario $X$, if for\nevery instance $a$ of $A$, there is an instance $b$ of $B$ and a secure\ntransformation $X$ that reproduces $a$ given $b$, such that the security of $b$\nguarantees the security of $a$. Here we employ this reductive framework to\nstudy the relationship between security in quantum key distribution (QKD) and\nquantum secure direct communication (QSDC). We show that replacing the\nstreaming of independent qubits in a QKD scheme by block encoding and\ntransmission (permuting the order of particles block by block) of qubits, we\ncan construct a QSDC scheme. This forms the basis for the \\textit{block\nreduction} from a QSDC class of protocols to a QKD class of protocols, whereby\nif the latter is secure, then so is the former. Conversely, given a secure QSDC\nprotocol, we can of course construct a secure QKD scheme by transmitting a\nrandom key as the direct message. Then the QKD class of protocols is secure,\nassuming the security of the QSDC class which it is built from. We refer to\nthis method of deduction of security for this class of QKD protocols, as\n\\textit{key reduction}. Finally, we propose an orthogonal-state-based\ndeterministic key distribution (KD) protocol which is secure in some local\npost-quantum theories.

However, for the important platform offered by spins\nof donor atoms in cryogenically-cooled silicon,decoherence mechanisms of\n$^{29}$Si proximate nuclear spins are not yet well understood.The reason is\npartly because proximate spins lie within a so-called \"frozen core\" region\nwhere the donor electronic hyperfine interaction strongly suppresses nuclear\ndynamics. We investigate the decoherence of a central proximate nuclear qubit\narising from quantum spin baths outside, as well as inside, the frozen core\naround the donor electron. We consider the effect of a very large nuclear spin\nbath comprising many ($\\gtrsim 10^8$) weakly contributing pairs outside the\nfrozen core. We also propose that there may be an important contribution from a\nfew (of order $100$) symmetrically sited nuclear spin pairs (\"equivalent\npairs\"), which were not previously considered as their effect is negligible\noutside the frozen core. If equivalent pairs represent a measurable source of\ndecoherence, nuclear coherence decays could provide sensitive probes of the\nsymmetries of electronic wavefunctions. For the phosphorus donor system, we\nobtain $T_{2n}$ values of order 1 second for both the \"far bath\" and\n\"equivalent pair\" models, confirming the suitability of proximate nuclei in\nsilicon as very long-lived spin qubits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 19:00:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 10:31:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 09:49:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2015 10:28:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Guichard", "R.", ""], ["Balian", "S.
