Local availability of mathematics\nassigns separate mathematical universes, U_{x}, to each space time point, x.\nThe mathematics available to an observer, O_{x}, at x is contained in U_{x}.\nNumber scaling is based on extending the choice freedom of vector space bases\nin gauge theories to choice freedom of underlying number systems. Scaling\narises in the description, in U_{x}, of mathematical systems in U_{y}.

This article uses a\nbehavioristic approach to argue, that an observer in a universe like this has\nto rely on local interactions to learn about its properties and behavior. Such\nan observer is fundamentally restricted in his ability to understand and\nstructurally reconstruct the individual local physical universe. We argue, that\nthis reconstruction based on dynamically available information is the defining\nprocess of observation in quantum theory. The observer-centric view of the\nglobal quantum dynamics is shown to be non-unitary and non-linear in general,\neven if the universe itself evolves unitarily. Interactions with massless free\nparticles are found to have great influence on observation, because of their\nspecial role in the light-cone structure of an Einstein-local universe. For a\nspecific scattering process with a photon of unknown state, the observed\noutcome can be subjectively random and follow the Born statistic, while the\noutput state is really determined by the photon polarization.

It is thus a\nlong-standing scientific dream to measure the dynamics of two bound correlated\nelectrons in the quantum regime. Quantum wave packets were previously observed\nfor single-active electrons on their natural attosecond timescales. However, at\nleast two active electrons and a nucleus are required to address the quantum\nthree-body problem. This situation is realized in the helium atom, but direct\ntime-resolved observation of two-electron wave-packet motion remained an\nunaccomplished challenge. Here, we measure a 1.2-femtosecond quantum beating\namong low-lying doubly-excited states in helium to evidence a correlated\ntwo-electron wave packet. Our experimental method combines attosecond\ntransient-absorption spectroscopy at unprecedented high spectral resolution (20\nmeV near 60 eV) with an intensity-tuneable visible laser field to couple the\nquantum states from the perturbative to the strong-coupling regime. This\nmulti-dimensional transient-coupling scheme reveals an inversion of the\ncharacteristic Fano line shapes for a range of doubly-excited states. Employing\nFano-type autoionization as a natural quantum interferometer, a dynamical phase\nshift by laser coupling to the N=2 continuum is postulated and experimentally\nquantified. This phase maps a transition from effectively\nsingle-active-electron to two-electron dynamics as the electron-electron\ninteraction increases in lower-lying quantum states. In the future, such\nexperiments will provide benchmark data for testing dynamical few-body quantum\ntheory.

The computation of discord is mostly confined to two-qubit\nsystems for which an analytical calculational scheme is available. The\nutilization of quantum correlations in quantum information-based applications\nis limited by the problem of decoherence, i.e., the loss of coherence due to\nthe inevitable interaction of a quantum system with its environment. The\ndynamics of quantum correlations due to decoherence may be studied in the Kraus\noperator formalism for different types of quantum channels representing\nsystem-environment interactions. In this review, we describe the salient\nfeatures of the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations in a two-qubit\nsystem under Markovian (memoryless) time evolution. The two-qubit state\nconsidered is described by the reduced density matrix obtained from the ground\nstate of a spin model. The models considered include the transverse-field XY\nmodel in one dimension, a special case of which is the transverse-field Ising\nmodel, and the $XXZ$ spin chain. The quantum channels studied include the\namplitude damping, bit-flip, bit-phase-flip and phase-flip channels. The Kraus\noperator formalism is briefly introduced and the origins of different types of\ndynamics discussed. One can identify appropriate quantities associated with the\ndynamics of quantum correlations which provide signatures of quantum phase\ntransitions in the spin models.

Collective cavity\ncooling of molecules is a promising method that does not rely on molecular\nenergy level and thus can be applied to all molecules in principle. However,\nthe initial lack of cold molecules leads to the difficulty in its experimental\nimplementation. We show that efficient collective sympathetic cooling of\nmolecules to sub-mK temperatures using a large ensemble of atoms within a\ncavity is feasible. This approach is a new type of sympathetic cooling which\ndoes not rely on direct collisions between atoms and molecules, but utilizes\nthermalization via their mutual interaction with a cavity field. Two important\nmechanisms are identified. This include: (1) giant enhancement of cavity\noptical field from the efficient scattering of the pump light by the atoms; (2)\ncavity-mediated collective interaction between the atoms and the molecules. We\nshow an optimal cavity detuning for maximizing cooling, which is dependent on\nthe atom and molecule numbers. We determine a threshold for the molecular pump\nstrength and show that it is independent of molecule number when the number of\natoms is much greater than the molecules. This can be reduced by orders of\nmagnitude when compared to cavity cooling of single molecular species only.\nUsing this new sympathetic cavity cooling technique, cooling molecules to\nsub-mK within a high-Q cavity could be within reach of experimental\ndemonstration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2012 06:05:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 May 2012 03:29:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Guangjiong", ""], ["Wang", "Chang", ""], ["Zhang", "Weiping", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.1883", "submitter": "Per Kaer", "authors": "P.

At low temperature an asymmetry in the quantum dot decay rate is\nobserved, leading to a faster decay when the quantum dot has a larger energy\nthan to the cavity.

As a main new ingredient we introduce the superposed\nmulti-optimization (SMO) method, which allows an efficient optimization of\nexponentially many MPS of different length at different sites all in one step.\nHereby the algorithm becomes protected against position dependent effects as\ncaused by spontaneously broken translational invariance. So far, these have\nbeen a major obstacle to convergence for the iMPS algorithm if no prior\nknowledge of the systems translational symmetry was accessible. Further, we\ninvestigate some more general methods to speed up calculations and improve\nconvergence, which might be partially interesting in a much broader context,\ntoo. As a more special problem, we also look into translational invariant\nstates close to an invariance braking phase transition and show how to avoid\nconvergence into wrong local minima for such systems. Finally, we apply the new\nmethods to polar bosons with long-range interactions. We calculate several\ndetailed Devil's Staircases with the corresponding phase diagrams and\ninvestigate some supersolid properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2012 19:23:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 16:56:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Nebendahl", "V.", ""], ["D\u00fcr", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.2675", "submitter": "Yasunori Nomura", "authors": "Yasunori Nomura", "title": "Quantum Mechanics, Gravity, and the Multiverse", "comments": "18 pages, 6 figures.

Small means that\nwe only lower-bound the gap with an inverse-exponential function of the input\nlength, or with an even smaller function. Using the protocol of Blier and Tapp\n[arXiv:0709.0738], we show that in this case the proof system has the same\nexpressive power as non-deterministic exponential time (NEXP). Since\nsingle-proof QMA proof systems, with the same bound on the gap, have expressive\npower at most exponential time (EXP), we get a separation between single and\nmulti-prover proof systems in the 'small-gap setting', under the assumption\nthat EXP is not equal to NEXP. This implies, among others, the nonexistence of\ncertain operators called disentanglers (defined by Aaronson et al.\n[arXiv:0804.0802]), with good approximation parameters.\n  We also show that in this setting the proof system has the same expressive\npower if we restrict the verifier to be able to perform only Bell-measurements,\ni.e., using a BellQMA verifier. This is not known to hold in the usual setting,\nwhen the gap is bounded by an inverse-polynomial function of the input length.\nTo show this we use the protocol of Chen and Drucker [arXiv:1011.0716].

Geometric\nmeasure of quantum discord is another measure of quantum correlations.\nRecently, the geometric quantum discord for multipartite states has been\nintroduced by Jianwei Xu [arxiv:quant/ph.1205.0330]. Motivated from the recent\nstudy [Ann.

The dynamics of QD and GQD is investigated under\namplitude damping, phase damping, depolarizing and flipping channels. It is\nseen that the quantum discord vanishes for p>0.75 in case of three-qubit GHZ\nstates and for p>0.5 for six qubit GHZ states. This implies that multipartite\nstates are more fragile to decoherence for higher values of N. Surprisingly, a\nrapid sudden death of discord occurs in case of phase flip channel. However,\nfor bit flip channel, no sudden death happens for the six-qubit states. On the\nother hand, depolarizing channel heavily influences the QD and GQD as compared\nto the amplitude damping channel. It means that the depolarizing channel has\nthe most destructive influence on the discords for multipartite states. From\nthe perspective of accelerated observers, it is seen that effect of environment\non QD and GQD is much stronger than that of the acceleration of non-inertial\nframes. The degradation of QD and GQD happens due to Unruh effect. Furthermore,\nQD exhibits more robustness than GQD when the multipartite systems are exposed\nto environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2012 18:43:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ramzan", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.3139", "submitter": "Alexander Moroz", "authors": "Alexander Moroz", "title": "Comment on \"Integrability of the Rabi model\"", "comments": "1 page, 1 figure - a couple of text typos corrected; no change in\n  formulas", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In his recent letter, Braak suggested that a regular spectrum of the Rabi\nmodel was given by the zeros of a transcendental function $G_\\pm(x)$ (cf Eqs.\n(3)-(5) of Ref.

For example, the amplitude for entering a spatial region during a\ngiven time interval is typically defined by summing over all paths between\ngiven initial and final points but restricting them to pass through the region\nat any time. We argue that there is, however, under very general conditions, a\nsignificant complication in such constructions. This is the fact that the\nconcrete implementation of the restrictions on paths over an interval of time\ncorresponds, in an operator language, to sharp monitoring at every moment of\ntime in the given time interval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno\neffect - the continual monitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace\nprevents its state from leaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral\namplitudes defined in this seemingly obvious way have physically and\nintuitively unreasonable properties and in particular, no sensible classical\nlimit. In this paper we describe this frequently-occurring but\nlittle-appreciated phenomenon in some detail, showing clearly the connection\nwith the quantum Zeno effect. We then show that it may be avoided by\nimplementing the restriction on paths in the path integral in a \"softer\" way.\nThe resulting amplitudes then involve a new coarse graining parameter, which\nmay be taken to be a timescale \\epsilon, describing the softening of the\nrestrictions on the paths.

Such a finding reinforces the Dirac's prediction that UR \"`in\ntheir present form will not survive in the physics of future\"'. The noted\nfacets of UR motivate reconsiderations of associated debates on QMS. Mainly one\nreveals that, properly, UR have not any essential connection with genuine\ndescriptions of QMS.

This paper follows a\ndifferent direction in which double negation does hold. The algebraic notions\nof effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics form the\ncornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of\nthe form X -> 1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as\npredicates. Predicates are identified in many different situations, and capture\nfor instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a probabilistic setting,\nidempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in a\nC*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states\nand effects plays an important role. It appears here in the form of an\nadjunction, where we use maps 1 -> X as states. For such a state s and a\npredicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born\nrule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from\nthe literature. Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically\nin terms of `instruments', using L\\\"uders rule in the quantum case. These\ninstruments are special maps associated with predicates (more generally, with\ntests), which perform the act of measurement and may have a side-effect that\ndisturbs the system under observation.

This paper reviews the orthodox, or Dirac-von Neumann\ninterpretation, and makes explicit that Hilbert space describes propositions\nabout measurement results. Kets are defined as conditional clauses referring to\nmeasurements in a formal language. It is seen that these clauses are elements\nof a Hilbert space, such that addition is logical disjunction, the dual space\nconsists of consequent clauses, and the inner product is a set of statements in\nthe subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth values for\ncorresponding future tense statements when the initial state is actually\nprepared and the final state is to be measured. The mathematical structure of\nquantum mechanics is formulated in terms of discrete measurement results at\nfinite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a substantive,\nor background, space-time continuum. A continuum of kets, |x> for x in R^3, is\nconstructed from linear combinations of kets in a finite basis. The inner\nproduct can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Discrete\nposition functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions in such a\nway that differential operators are defined. It is shown that the choice of\nbasis has no effect on underlying physics (quantum covariance). The Dirac delta\nhas a representation as a smooth function. Operators do not in general have an\nintegral form. The Schroedinger equation is shown from the requirements of the\nprobability interpretation. It is remarked that a formal construction of qed\navoiding divergence problems has been completed using finite dimensional\nHilbert space. I conclude that quantum mechanics makes statements about the\nworld with clear physical meaning, such that space is emergent from particle\ninteractions and has no fundamental role.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 14:11:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 09:10:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Francis", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4616", "submitter": "Haifeng Li", "authors": "Haifeng Li and Jiushu Shao", "title": "Derivation of exact master equation with stochastic description: Models\n  in quantum optics", "comments": "24", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The methodology of stochastic description for dissipation, a generic scheme\nto decouple the interaction between two subsystems, is applied to the study of\ndissipative dynamics in quantum optics.

For some of these techniques, the\nnumber of terms in the series K plays the lead role in the computational cost\nof the calculation, and is therefore often a limiting factor in simulating open\nquantum system dynamics. We present an open source MATLAB program called\nBATHFIT 1, whose input is any spectral distribution functions J(w) or bath\nresponse function, and whose output attempts to be the set of parameters\n{p_k,w_k}_k=1^K such that for a given value of K, the series {\\Sigma}_k^k p_k\ne^{O_k t} is as close as possible to a(t). This should allow the user to\nrepresent a(t) as accurately as possible with as few parameters as possible.\nThe program executes non-linear least squares fitting, and for a very wide\nvariety of spectral distribution functions, competent starting parameters are\nused for these fits. For most forms of J(w), these starting parameters, and the\nexact a(t) corresponding to the given J(w), are calculated using the recent\nPade decomposition technique - therefore this program can also be used to\nmerely implement the Pade decomposition for these spectral distribution\nfunctions; and it can also be used just to efficiently and accurately calculate\na(t) for any given J(w) . The program also gives the J(w) corresponding to a\ngiven a(t), which may allow one to assess the quality (in the w-domain) of a\nrepresentation of a(t) being used. Finally, the program can calculate the\ndiscretized influence functional coefficients for any J(w), and this is\ncomputed very efficiently for most forms of J(w) by implementing the recent\ntechnique published in [Quantum Physics Letters (2012) 1 (1) pg. 35].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 16:32:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 27 May 2012 15:50:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dattani", "Nikesh S.", ""], ["Wilkins", "David M.", ""], ["Pollock", "Felix A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4652", "submitter": "Israel Michael Sigal", "authors": "Ioannis Anapolitanos, Israel Michael Sigal", "title": "Long Range Behaviour of van der Waals Force", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP math.SP physics.chem-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove van der Waals - London's law of decay of the van der Waals force for\na collection of neutral atoms at large separation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2012 22:20:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Aug 2013 20:43:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Anapolitanos", "Ioannis", ""], ["Sigal", "Israel Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4669", "submitter": "Jan Sperling", "authors": "J.

We explore features in the concurrence indicative of\nretardation and show how these features evolve depending on the initial state\nof the system, distance between the atoms and the number of modes to which the\natoms are coupled. In particular, we consider the short-time and the long time\ndynamics for both the multi- and sub-wavelength distances between the atoms. It\nis found that the retardation effects can qualitatively modify the entanglement\ndynamics of the atoms not only at multi- but also at sub-wavelength distances.\nWe follow the temporal evolution of the concurrence and find that at short\ntimes of the evolution the retardation induces periodic sudden changes of\nentanglement. To analyze where the entanglement lies in the space spanned by\nthe state vectors of the system, we introduce the collective Dicke states of\nthe atomic system that explicitly account for the sudden changes as a periodic\nexcitation of the atomic system to the maximally entangled symmetric state. At\nlong times, the retardation gives rise to periodic beats in the concurrence\nthat resemble the phenomenon of collapses and revivals in the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel.

Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments,\nwhere attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at\nwell-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a\nphase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a\n\"clock\" to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not\ncorrespond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization.\nInstead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement\ninduced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics.

It\narises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between Coulomb continuum\nstates.
