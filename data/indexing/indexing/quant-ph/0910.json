We investigate\ndifferent patterns of site-dependent interaction couplings, singling out two\ngeneral settings: Patterns that allow for perfect long-distance entanglement\n(LDE) in the ground state of the system, namely such that the end-to-end\nentanglement remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and patterns of quasi\nlong-distance entanglement (QLDE) in the ground state of the system, namely,\nsuch such that the end-to-end entanglement vanishes with a very slow power-law\ndecay as the length of the spin chain is increased. We discuss physical\nrealizations of these models in ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in\noptical lattices. We show how, using either suitably engineered super-lattice\nstructures or exploiting the presence of edge impurities in lattices with\nsingle periodicity, it is possible to realize models endowed with nonvanishing\nLDE or QLDE. We then study how to realize models that optimize the robustness\nof QLDE at finite temperature and in the presence of imperfections using\nsuitably engineered arrays of coupled optical cavities. We finally introduce\nLDE-based schemes of long-distance quantum teleportation in linear arrays of\ncoupled cavities and show that they allow for high-fidelity and high success\nrates even at moderately high temperatures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2009 20:13:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 Oct 2009 00:15:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 21 Nov 2009 09:45:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Giampaolo", "Salvatore M.", ""], ["Illuminati", "Fabrizio", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0050", "submitter": "Rosario Lo Franco", "authors": "Bruno Bellomo, Rosario Lo Franco, Sabrina Maniscalco, and Giuseppe\n  Compagno", "title": "Two-qubit entanglement dynamics for two different non-Markovian\n  environments", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Applications\nwhich illustrate these new methods focus on single and double qubits (quantum\ngates) whereby the environment is modeled either within the Lindblad equation\nor a bath of bosons (spin-boson model).

In the present contribution a simple but effective\ntheoretical framework is introduced to clarify the connections between a purely\nmechanical description and the thermodynamic characterization of the\nequilibrium state of an isolated quantum system. A salient feature of our\napproach is the very transparent distinction between the statistical aspects\nand the dynamical aspects in the description of isolated quantum systems. Like\nin the classical statistical mechanics, the equilibrium distribution of any\nproperty is identified on the basis of the time evolution of the considered\nsystem. As a consequence equilibrium properties of quantum system appear to\ndepend on the details of the initial state due to the abundance of constants of\nthe motion in the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics. On the other hand the study of the\nprobability distributions of some functions, such as the entropy or the\nequilibrium state of a subsystem, in statistical ensembles of pure states\nreveals the crucial role of typicality as the bridge between macroscopic\nthermodynamics and microscopic quantum dynamics. We shall consider two\nparticular ensembles: the random pure state ensemble and the fixed expectation\nenergy ensemble. The relation between the introduced ensembles, the properties\nof a given isolated system, and the standard quantum statistical description\nare discussed throughout the presentation.

The\nconventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along\neigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. By contrast, discrete\nadiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of\nparameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be\nrealized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an\nadiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design\nprinciple of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's\nquasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to\nrealize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic\nalgorithms. It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an\nanholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v>, which is\navailable to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time\nsteps. In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v> for the\nqualitatively different, i.e., power or exponential, running time steps are\nshown to be qualitatively different.

The implication of\nsuch critical spectral behavior for the Floquet eigenstate statistics is\nstudied in this work. Following the methodologies for understanding the fractal\nbehavior of energy eigenstates of time-independent systems on the Anderson\ntransition point, we analyze the distribution profile, the mean value, and the\nvariance of the logarithm of the inverse participation ratio of the Floquet\neigenstates associated with multifractal Floquet spectra. The results show that\nthe Floquet eigenstates also display fractal behavior, but with features\nmarkedly different from those in time-independent Anderson-transition models.\nThis motivated us to propose a new type of random unitary matrix ensemble,\ncalled \"power-law random banded unitary matrix\" ensemble, to illuminate the\nFloquet eigenstate statistics of critical driven systems. The results based on\nthe proposed random matrix model are consistent with those obtained from our\ndynamical examples with or without time-reversal symmetry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2009 02:18:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 08:19:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bandyopadhyay", "Jayendra N.", ""], ["Wang", "Jiao", ""], ["Gong", "Jiangbin", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4459", "submitter": "Rico Rueedi", "authors": "Herv\\'e Kunz, Rico Rueedi", "title": "Ground state energy of large atoms and quantum dots", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures; submitted to Physical Review Letters", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We determine the ground state energy of atoms and quantum dots whose number N\nof electrons is large.

It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.\n  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the\nsymmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the\nuniverse are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not\neven in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term\nparticle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be\ndefined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state\nbecomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of\nparticles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by\nphysicists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Oct 2009 11:22:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Jan 2010 11:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Lubberdink", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4649", "submitter": "Noah Graham", "authors": "Noah Graham, Alexander Shpunt, Thorsten Emig, Sahand Jamal Rahi,\n  Robert L.

We present\nan inequality that must be satisfied when the system is driven out by such a\ntrial Hamiltonian.

The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based\non physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the\npossibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional\ngate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate\nto what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the\nnumber of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we\nrelate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal\ncomputation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit\noptimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an\nefficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which\nhas monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained\nsolutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary\noperator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial\ngate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a\nseries of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time\ncomplexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which\nis understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity\nfor the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the\nstatement above.
