Nevertheless, we gain insight into\nthis feature by drawing an analogy between the double slit experiment and a\ntime reversed fire alarm. Much as closing the slit increases probability of a\nfuture detection, ruling out fire drill scenarios, having heard the fire alarm,\nincreases probability of a past fire (using Bayesian inference). Classically,\nBayesian inference is associated with computing probabilities of past events.\nWe therefore identify this feature of the double slit experiment with a time\nreversed thermodynamic arrow. We believe that much of the enigma of quantum\nmechanics is simply due to some variation of time's arrow. In further support\nof this, we employ a plausible formulation of the thermodynamic arrow to derive\nan uncertainty in classical mechanics that is reminiscent of quantum\nuncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Aug 2009 04:47:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Apr 2010 20:31:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Halabi", "Tarek", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1195", "submitter": "Petr Nicolaevich Bibikov", "authors": "P.

The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in\nmathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to\nLindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete\ncharacterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive\nsemi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,\nis there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find\nit's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it\nis asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental\nobservations.\n  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also\ngive an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite\nprogramming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that\nresolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations\nis tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for\nMarkovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our\nalgorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P\ndoes equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a\nCPT map has a master equation description.\n  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for\ncurrent quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales\nefficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master\nequation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.\n  Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related\nlong-standing open problem in probability theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2009 15:51:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Sep 2011 12:46:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cubitt", "Toby S.", ""], ["Eisert", "Jens", ""], ["Wolf", "Michael M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2134", "submitter": "Ignacio Garcia-Mata", "authors": "B.

In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is\nsuppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy\nincreases.

This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the\nmeasurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating\nstates could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all\ntheir possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of\nprobabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays\nthe role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this\ndescription is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the \"quantum\nangle\", emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of\nthe quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock\nstates crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the\nquantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then\nwe consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make\ndichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far\napart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical\ndescriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles\nfrom each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side\ncollector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference\nresult, we find \"population oscillations\" in the distributions of the deviated\nparticles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions\nof population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three\nindependent condensates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 18:53:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2009 16:20:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Apr 2010 18:54:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 26 May 2010 18:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Mullin", "W.

The essential step is the construction of\nan antilinear operator that we call {\\em comb} in reference to the {\\em\nhairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits\n(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\\CC)$, which\nimplies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by\nconstruction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it\nis detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the\npresence of a {\\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary\ntransformations.
