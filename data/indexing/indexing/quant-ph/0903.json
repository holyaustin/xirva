Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful\nfor cases where L does not depend on Delta. The complexity of our method has a\nlogarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost\napplies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given\nand each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution\ntimes incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications\nof this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In\nparticular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic\nspeed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart\nimplemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 21:17:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2009 22:09:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Boixo", "S.", ""], ["Knill", "E.", ""], ["Somma", "R.

We use the PDX to derive the usual scattering wave\nfunctions and the arrival time distribution function. This method gives a\ndirect and geometrically appealing account of known results (but also points\nthe way to how they can be extended to more general complex potentials). We use\nthese results to carry out a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time\nproblem, taking advantage of a recently demonstrated connection between pulsed\nmeasurements and complex potentials. We obtain very simple and plausible\nexpressions for the class operators (describing the amplitudes for crossing the\norigin during intervals of time) and show that decoherence of histories is\nobtained for a wide class of initial states (such as simple wave packets and\nsuperpositions of wave packets). We find that the decoherent histories approach\ngives results with a sensible classical limit that are fully compatible with\nstandard results on the arrival time problem. We also find some interesting\nconnections between backflow and decoherence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2009 12:06:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Halliwell", "J.

We show that in this\nintegrable system with two degrees of freedom, for any initial condition close\nto the unstable point, the classical dynamics is controlled by a singularity of\nthe focus-focus type.

Here we report the hyperpolarization of 29Si in n-doped silicon\ncrystals, with doping concentrations in the range of 1-3 x 10^17 /cc. In this\nregime exchange interactions between donors become extremely important. The\nsign of the enhancement in our experiments and its frequency dependence suggest\nthat the 29Si spins are directly polarized by donor electrons via an Overhauser\nmechanism within exchange-coupled donor clusters. The exchange interaction\nbetween donors only needs to be larger than the silicon hyperfine interaction\n(typically much smaller than the donor hyperfine coupling) to enable this\nOverhauser mechanism. Nuclear polarization enhancement is observed for a range\nof donor clusters in which the exchange energy is comparable to the donor\nhyperfine interaction. The DNP dynamics are characterized by a single\nexponential time constant that depends on the microwave power, indicating that\nthe Overhauser mechanism is the rate-limiting step. Since only about 2 % of the\nsilicon nuclei are located within one Bohr radius of the donor electron,\nnuclear spin diffusion is important in transferring the polarization to all the\nspins. However, the spin-diffusion time is much shorter than the Overhauser\ntime due to the relatively weak silicon hyperfine coupling strength.

Next, we also study the\nfollowing uniqueness problem: If $na=nb=c$ for some positive integer $n\\geq 2$,\nthen under what conditions $a=b$ hold? We prove that if $c$ is a sharp element\nof $E$ and $a|b$, then $a=b$.

At larger times the dynamics of the junction is\ngoverned by fast Rabi oscillations between the descrete quasiparticle levels.\nWe predict that a selftrapped BEC state will be destroyed by these Rabi\noscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2009 13:25:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2009 20:17:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2009 18:03:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2009 15:31:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Martinez", "Mauricio Trujillo", ""], ["Posazhennikova", "Anna", ""], ["Kroha", "Johann", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.5466", "submitter": "Ashley Montanaro", "authors": "Ashley Montanaro", "title": "Symmetric functions of qubits in an unknown basis", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures; v2: improved results, essentially published\n  version", "journal-ref": "Phys.
