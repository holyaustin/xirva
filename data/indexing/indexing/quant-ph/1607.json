According to the handedness of this rotation, its \\emph{longitudinal}\nspin angular momentum density is either parallel or antiparallel to the\npropagation of light. However, there are also light waves that are not simply\nplane and carry an electric field that rotates around an axis perpendicular to\nthe propagation direction, thus yielding \\emph{transverse} spin angular\nmomentum density. Electric field configurations of this kind have been\nsuggestively dubbed \"photonic wheels\". It has been recently shown that photonic\nwheels are commonplace in optics as they occur in electromagnetic fields\nconfined by waveguides, in strongly focused beams, in plasmonic and evanescent\nwaves. In this work we establish a general theory of electromagnetic waves\n{propagating along a well defined direction, which carry} transverse spin\nangular momentum density. We show that depending on the shape of {these waves,\nthe} spin density may be either perpendicular to the \\emph{mean} linear\nmomentum (globally transverse spin) or to the linear momentum \\emph{density}\n(locally transverse spin). We find that the latter case generically occurs only\nfor non-diffracting beams, such as the Bessel beams.

Our approach is based on the Maxwell wave\nequation, and complements previous studies based on an effective Hamiltonian.\nThe analysis shows that for slowly moving and weakly reflective membranes the\ndynamics can be approximated by unitary, first-order-in-time evolution given by\nan effective Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like equation with a Hamiltonian that does not\ndepend on the membrane speed. This approximate theory is the one typically\nadopted in cavity optomechanics and we develop a criterion for its validity.\nHowever, in more general situations the full second-order wave equation\npredicts light dynamics which do not conserve energy, giving rise to parametric\namplification (or reduction) that is forbidden under first order dynamics and\ncan be considered to be the classical counterpart of the dynamical Casimir\neffect. The case of a membrane moving at constant velocity can be mapped onto\nthe Landau-Zener problem but with additional terms responsible for field\namplification. Furthermore, the nature of the adiabatic regime is rather\ndifferent from the ordinary Schr\\\"odinger case, since mode amplitudes need not\nbe constant even when there are no transitions between them.

In a double-slit experiment, when do photons decide to\ntravel by one way or by two ways? Delayed choice experiments seem to indicate\nthat, strangely, it is possible to change the decision of the photons until the\nvery last moment before they are detected. This led Wheeler to his famous\nsentence: No elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a\nregistered phenomenon, brought to a close by an irreversible act of\namplification. Nevertheless some authors wrote that backward in time effects\nwere needed to explain these results. I will show that in delayed choice\nexperiments involving only one particle, a simple explanation is possible\nwithout invoking any backward in time effect. Delayed choice experiments\ninvolving entangled particles such as the so called quantum eraser can also be\nexplained without invoking any backward in time effect but I will argue that\nthese experiments cannot be accounted for so simply because they rise the whole\nproblem of knowing what a measurement and a collapse are. A previously\npresented interpretation, Convivial Solipsism, is a natural framework for\ngiving a simple explanation of these delayed choice experiments with entangled\nparticles.

Such a code is denoted by the triple\n$(n,m,p)$. It is known that $n<4^m$ for all QRACs and $n<2^m$ for classical\nRACs. These bounds are also known to be tight, as explicit constructions exist\nfor $n=4^m-1$ and $n=2^m-1$ for quantum and classical codes respectively. We\ngeneralize (Q)RACs to a scheme encoding $n$ $d$-levels into $m$ (qu)-$d$-levels\nsuch that any $d$-level can be recovered with the probability for every wrong\noutcome value being less than $\\frac{1}{d}$. We construct explicit solutions\nfor all $n\\leq \\frac{d^{2m}-1}{d-1}$. For $d=2$, the constructions coincide\nwith those previously known. We show that the (Q)RACs are $d$-parity-oblivious,\ngeneralizing ordinary parity-obliviousness. We further investigate optimization\nof the success probabilities. For $d=2$, we use the measure operators of the\npreviously best known solutions, but improve the encoding states to give a\nhigher success probability.

For\nseveral different $(n,2,p)$ QRACs, we see the same trade-off, as the best $p$\nvalues are obtained when the number of bits that can be obtained simultaneously\nis as small as possible.

We show that the negativity spectrum is universal and\ndepends only on the central charge of the CFT, similarly to the entanglement\nspectrum. The precise form of the negativity spectrum depends on whether the\ntwo intervals are in a pure or mixed state, and in both cases, a dependence on\nthe sign of the eigenvalues is found. This dependence is weak for bulk\neigenvalues, whereas it is strong at the spectrum edges.

Such a\ndescription is needed if we wish to consider finite sized autonomous quantum\nmachines requiring no external control. The extent of the back-reaction has\nimplications on how small the device can be, on the length of time the device\ncan run, and is required if we want to understand what a fully quantum\nmechanical treatment of an observer would look like. Here, we consider the\nimplementation of a unitary by a finite sized device which we call the\n\"Quasi-Ideal clock\", and show that the back-reaction on it can be made\nexponentially small in the device's dimension with only a linear increase in\nenergy. As a result, an autonomous quantum machine need only be of modest size\nand or energy. We are also able to solve a long-standing open problem by using\na finite sized quantum clock to approximate the continuous evolution of an\nIdealised clock. The result has implications on the equivalence of different\nparadigms of quantum thermodynamics, some which allow external control and some\nwhich only allow autonomous thermal machines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2016 17:33:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 23:49:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 21:00:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 00:22:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Woods", "Mischa P.", ""], ["Silva", "Ralph", ""], ["Oppenheim", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04599", "submitter": "Carlo Cafaro", "authors": "Carlo Cafaro, Sean Alan Ali, and Adom Giffin", "title": "On the violation of Bell's inequality for all non-product quantum states", "comments": "12 pages, no figures.

We focus in particular\non the Kitaev chains with long-range pairings and on the quantum Ising chain\nwith long-range antiferromagnetic coupling (both having a power-law decay with\nexponent \\alpha). By studying the dynamic correlation functions, we find that\nfor every finite \\alpha two different behaviours can be identified, one typical\nof short-range systems and the other connected with locality violation. The\nlatter behaviour is shown related also with the known power-law decay tails\npreviously observed in the static correlation functions, and originated by\nmodes, having in general energies far from the minima of the spectrum, where\nparticular singularities develop as a consequence of the long-rangedness of the\nsystem. We refer to these modes as to \"singular\" modes, and as to \"singular\ndynamics\" to their dynamics. For the Kitaev model they are manifest, at finite\n\\alpha, in derivatives of the quasiparticle energy, the order of the derivative\nat which the singularity occurs increasing with \\alpha. The features of the\nsingular modes and their physical consequences are clarified by studying an\neffective theory for them and by a critical comparison of the results from this\ntheory with the lattice ones. Moreover, a numerical study of the effects of the\nsingular modes on the time evolution after various types of global quenches is\nperformed.

It is then revealed that, for a pair of simultaneously\nmeasurable observables, the QJP distribution reduces to their unique standard\njoint-probability distribution, whereas for a non-commuting pair there exists\nan inherent indefiniteness in the choice, admitting a multitude of candidates\nthat may equally be used for describing their joint behaviour. In the course of\nour argument, we find that the QJP distributions furnish the space of operators\nwith their characteristic geometric structures such that the orthogonal\nprojections and inner products of observables can, respectively, be given\nstatistical interpretations as `conditionings' and `correlations'.

On one hand, it allows to investigate fundamental processes\nof the non-linear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a\nperiodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward\nefficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave\nfunctions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A\nkey feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of\nHHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron\nionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other.\nHere, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave\nfunctions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction\nband. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual\nlattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of\nlocalization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate\nHHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and\nnarrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for\nnarrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to\nharmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to\nHHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy.

Here, these theories are\nconsidered on a square spatial lattice and the fundamental degrees of freedom\nare defined on pairs of links from the direct lattice and its dual,\nrespectively. This provides a natural lattice construction for\ntopologically-massive gauge theories, which are invariant under parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry. After defining the building blocks of the doubled\ntheories, paying special attention to the realization of gauge transformations\non quantum states, we examine the dynamics in the group space of a single\ncross, which is spanned by a single link and its dual. The dynamics is governed\nby the single-cross electric Hamiltonian and admits a simple quantum mechanical\nanalogy to the problem of a charged particle moving on a discrete space\naffected by an abstract electromagnetic potential. Such a particle might\naccumulate a phase shift equivalent to an Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is\nmanifested in the doubled theory in terms of a nontrivial ground-state\ndegeneracy on a single cross. We discuss several examples of these doubled\ntheories with different gauge groups including the cyclic group\n$\\mathbb{Z}(k)\\subset U(1)$, the symmetric group $S_3\\subset O(2)$, the binary\ndihedral (or quaternion) group $\\bar{D}_2\\subset SU(2)$, and the finite group\n$\\Delta(27)\\subset SU(3)$. In each case the spectrum of the single-cross\nelectric Hamiltonian is determined exactly. We examine the nature of the\nlow-lying excited states in the full Hilbert space, and emphasize the role of\nthe center symmetry for the confinement of charges. Whether the investigated\ndoubled models admit a non-Abelian topological state which allows for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation will be addressed in a future publication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2016 16:18:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 15:58:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Caspar", "Stephan", ""], ["Mesterh\u00e1zy", "David", ""], ["Olesen", "Therkel Z.", ""], ["Vlasii", "Nadiia D.", ""], ["Wiese", "Uwe-Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.08838", "submitter": "Maaneli Derakhshani", "authors": "Maaneli Derakhshani", "title": "A Suggested Answer To Wallstrom's Criticism: Zitterbewegung Stochastic\n  Mechanics II", "comments": "68 pages, no figures, LaTeX", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The \"zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics\" (ZSM) answer to Wallstrom's\ncriticism, introduced in the companion paper [1], is extended to many\nparticles.

It represents the quantum version\nof the famous flying arrow Zeno paradox. Here, we study how temporal\nstochasticity in the system observation (or driving) affects the survival\nprobability of the system in the subspace. In particular, we introduce a strong\nand a weak Zeno regime for which we quantify the confinement by providing an\nanalytical expression for this survival probability. We investigate several\ndissipative and coherent protocols to confine the dynamics, and show that they\ncan be successfully adapted to the stochastic version. In the weak Zeno regime\nthe dynamics within the subspace effectively acts as an additional source of\nstochasticity in the confinement protocol. Our analytical predictions are\nnumerically tested and verified on a paradigmatic spin chain. As practical\nimplications different coherent and dissipative confinement protocols allow to\nchoose a trade-off between a probabilistic scheme with high fidelity (compared\nto perfect subspace dynamics) and a deterministic one with a slightly lower\nfidelity, which is a step towards better control in future quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 17:32:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00fcller", "Matthias M.", ""], ["Gherardini", "Stefano", ""], ["Caruso", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.08879", "submitter": "Jose Navarro-Salas", "authors": "I.
