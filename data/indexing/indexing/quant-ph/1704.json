While bearing\nstriking similarities to Rydberg atoms, fundamentally new insights may be\nobtained for Rydberg excitons, as the crystal environment gives easy optical\naccess to many states within an exciton multiplet. Here we study experimentally\nand theoretically the scaling of several characteristic parameters of Rydberg\nexcitons with $n$. From absorption spectra in magnetic field we find for the\nfirst crossing of levels with adjacent principal quantum numbers a $B_r \\propto\nn^{-4}$ dependence of the resonance field strength, $B_r$, due to the dominant\nparamagnetic term unlike in the atomic case where the diamagnetic contribution\nis decisive. By contrast, in electric field we find scaling laws just like for\nRydberg atoms. The resonance electric field strength scales as $E_r \\propto\nn^{-5}$. We observe anticrossings of the states belonging to multiplets with\ndifferent principal quantum numbers. The energy splittings at the avoided\ncrossings scale as $n^{-4}$ which we relate to the crystal specific deviation\nof the exciton Hamiltonian from the hydrogen model. We observe the exciton\npolarizability in the electric field to scale as $n^7$. In magnetic field the\ncrossover field strength from a hydrogen-like exciton to a magnetoexciton\ndominated by electron and hole Landau level quantization scales as $n^{-3}$.\nThe ionization voltages demonstrate a $n^{-4}$ scaling as for atoms. The width\nof the absorption lines remains constant before dissociation for high enough\n$n$, while for small $n \\lesssim 12$ an exponential increase with the field is\nfound.

The Kochen-Specker theorem rules out models of quantum theory that\nsatisfy a particular assumption of context-independence: that sharp\nmeasurements are assigned outcomes both deterministically and independently of\ntheir context. This notion of noncontextuality is not suited to a direct\nexperimental test because realistic measurements always have some degree of\nunsharpness due to noise. However, a generalized notion of noncontextuality has\nbeen proposed that is applicable to any experimental procedure, including\nunsharp measurements, but also preparations as well, and for which a quantum\nno-go result still holds. According to this notion, the model need only specify\na probability distribution over the outcomes of a measurement in a\ncontext-independent way, rather than specifying a particular outcome. It also\nimplies novel constraints of context-independence for the representation of\npreparations. In this article, we describe a general technique for translating\nproofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem into inequality constraints on realistic\nexperimental statistics, the violation of which witnesses the impossibility of\na noncontextual model. We focus on algebraic state-independent proofs, using\nthe Peres-Mermin square as our illustrative example.

We carry out a theoretical\nanalysis of this coupling in the case of a quantum point contact (QPC). First\nwe derive the noise power spectrum from the Hamiltonian without making the\nMarkovian approximation, and obtain numerical results that reproduce the\nexperimental data.

To this end, we present a detailed analysis of the\nreal-space RG for discrete-time quantum walks on fractal networks and show how\ndeep insights into the analytic structure as well as generic results about the\nlong-time behavior can be extracted. The RG-flow for such a walk on a dual\nSierpinski gasket and a Migdal-Kadanoff hierarchical network is obtained\nexplicitly from elementary algebraic manipulations, after transforming the\nunitary evolution equation into Laplace space. Unlike for classical random\nwalks, we find that the long-time asymptotics for the quantum walk requires\nconsideration of a diverging number of Laplace-poles, which we demonstrate\nexactly for the closed form solution available for the walk on a 1d-loop. In\nparticular, we calculate the probability of the walk to overlap with its\nstarting position, which oscillates with a period that scales as\n$N^{d_{w}^{Q}/d_{f}}$ with system size $N$. While the largest Jacobian\neigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$ of the RG-flow merely reproduces the fractal\ndimension, $d_{f}=\\log_{2}\\lambda_{1}$, the asymptotic analysis shows that the\nsecond Jacobian eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}$ becomes essential to determine the\ndimension of the quantum walk via\n$d_{w}^{Q}=\\log_{2}\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}}$. We trace this fact to\ndelicate cancellations caused by unitarity. We obtain identical relations for\nother networks, although the details of the RG-analysis may exhibit\nsurprisingly distinct features. Thus, our conclusions -- which trivially\nreproduce those for regular lattices with translational invariance with\n$d_{f}=d$ and $d_{w}^{Q}=1$ -- appear to be quite general and likely apply to\nnetworks beyond those studied here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 21:59:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 20:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Boettcher", "Stefan", "", "Emory U"], ["Li", "Shanshan", "", "Emory U"]]}, {"id": "1704.04705", "submitter": "Markus P.

We overcome this lack of information by relying\non concepts inspired by Compressed Sensing (CS), exploiting the fact that the\nsought state - in many applications of quantum information - is close to a pure\nstate (and thus has low rank). Additionally, we increase the system dimension\nby adding an ancilla that couples to information evolving in the system,\nthereby providing more measurements, enabling the recovery of the original\nquantum state from a single-observable measurements.

However, different figures of merit are also\npossible, and a particularly well-suited one is the classical capacity per unit\ncost, which quantifies the maximal amount of information that can be\ntransmitted per unit cost.

The needed computations are organized as measurement\npatterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model.

Since a one-way quantum\ncomputation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally\nnondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to\nguarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)\nis a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a\ndependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve\ndeterminism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to\nsimplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and\nPauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement\ncalculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these\nrules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.\nMoreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing\nmany ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a\nnew scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow\nor gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.\nFurthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for\ngeometries with flow.

The generation and control of such states by\nengineering the dipolar interactions between atoms can enable new tools for\natomic-based technologies. Atom-atom interactions in free space are limited in\nrange, since the amplitude of the radiated field decreases inversely with\ndistance. When the field is confined to one dimension it enables infinite-range\ninteractions. This has been observed for atoms in an optical cavity, but\nremains to be proven in one-dimensional waveguides, where the extent of the\ninteractions is not limited by the cavity size. Here we present the first\nreport of infinite-range interactions between macroscopically separated atomic\ndipoles mediated by an optical waveguide. This is evidenced by the collective\nradiative decay of a single photon distributed between distant atoms. We use\ncold $^{87}$Rb atoms in the vicinity of a single-mode optical nanofiber (ONF)\nthat coherently exchange evanescently coupled photons through the ONF mode. In\nparticular, we observe super-radiance of a few atoms separated by hundreds of\nresonant wavelengths. This effect is not possible for atoms separated by more\nthan a wavelength interacting through free space. The same platform allows us\nto measure sub-radiance, a rarely observed effect, presenting a novel tool for\nquantum optics.

In this paper we show, through a\nmolecular-orbital-theoretic calculation of double quantum dots influenced by a\ncharged impurity, that the relative charge noise for a system under the barrier\ncontrol not only is smaller than that for the tilt control, but actually\ndecreases as a function of an increasing exchange interaction. This is\nunderstood as a combined consequence of the greatly suppressed detuning noise\nwhen the two dots are symmetrically operated, as well as an enhancement of the\ninter-dot hopping energy of an electron when the barrier is lowered which in\nturn reduces the relative charge noise at large exchange interaction values. We\nhave also studied the response of the qubit to charged impurities at different\nlocations, and found that the improvement of barrier control is least for\nimpurities equidistant from the two dots due to the small detuning noise they\ncause, but is otherwise significant along other directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 05:19:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:15:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Xu-Chen", ""], ["Wang", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07976", "submitter": "Hiromichi Ohno", "authors": "Hiromichi Ohno", "title": "Unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum walks II", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study investigated the unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional\nquantum walks.

Specifically, the controllable transmon qubit can alternatively\ninteract with one of the two NVEs, which results in the production of $N$\nparticle entangled states. Arbitrary $N$ particle entangled states, NOON\nstates, N-dimensional entangled states and entangled coherent states are\ndemonstrated. Realistic imperfections and decoherence effects are analyzed via\nnumerical simulation. Since no cavity photons or excited levels of the NV\ncenter are populated during the whole process, our scheme is insensitive to\ncavity decay and spontaneous emission of the NVE. The idea provides a scalable\nway to realize NVEs-circuit cavity quantum information processing with current\ntechnology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 17:51:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:49:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Dec 2017 16:03:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Wanjun", ""], ["Yang", "Zhenbiao", ""], ["Zhong", "Zhirong", ""]]}]
