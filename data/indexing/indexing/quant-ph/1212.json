The algorithm runs in\nO(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive\nerror. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary\nmatrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to\nquantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a\ncentral role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their\nrecent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had\nto talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems.\n  In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an\nidea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a\nbetter approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated\ncolumns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate\nthe probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome\ninvolving multiple photons \"bunched\" in the same mode---at least as well as\nthat probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of\ncourse, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper\nbound on the probabilities of \"bunched\" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture\nof Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest.\n  Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the\nspecial case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we\ngeneralize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct\n\"complex eps-biased sets,\" then use those sets to derandomize even our\ngeneralization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again\nfor nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general\nA remains an outstanding problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 22:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 23:06:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Aaronson", "Scott", ""], ["Hance", "Travis", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0033", "submitter": "Zhiliang Yuan", "authors": "K.

The standard\nquantum process tomography (SQPT) has the unique property that it can be\napplied without introducing any additional quantum resources. In present work,\nwe shall focus on the following two topics about the SQPT. At first, in the\nSQPT protocol for a $d$-dimensional system, one should encounter a problem in\nsolving of a set of $d^4$ linear equations in order to get the matrix\ncontaining the complete information about the unknown quantum channel. Until\nnow, the general form of the solution is unknown. And a long existed conviction\nis that the solutions are not unique. Here, we shall develop a self-consistent\nscheme, in which bounded linear operators are presented by vectors, to\nconstruct the set of linear equations. With the famous Cramer's rule for the\nset of linear equations, we are able to give the general form of the solution\nand prove that it is unique. In second, the central idea of the SQPT is to\nprepare a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the\nquantum state tomography (QST). Letting the inputs and the measurements be\nprepared by two sets of the rank-one positive-operator-valued measures [POVMs],\nwhere each POVM is supposed to be linearly independent and informationally\ncomplete (IC), we observe that SQPT now is equivalent to deciding a unknown\nstate with a set of product IC-POVM in the $d^2$-dimensional Hilbert space.\nFollowing the general linear state tomography theory, we show that the product\nsymmetric IC-POVM should minimize the mean-square Hilbert-Schmidt distance\nbetween the estimator and the true states. So, an optimal SQPT can be realized\nby preparing both the inputs and the measurements as the symmetric IC-POVM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 12:51:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Xiaohua", "Wu", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0107", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts, Stan Bundervoet, Marek Czachor, Bart D'Hooghe, Liane\n  Gabora, Philip Polk and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "On the Foundations of the Theory of Evolution", "comments": "11 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": "In D.

We suggest that the starting point\nof evolution theory cannot be limited to actual variation whereupon is\nselected, but to variation in the potential of entities according to the\ncontext. We therefore develop a formalism, referred to as Context driven\nActualization of Potential (CAP), which handles potentiality and describes the\nevolution of entities as an actualization of potential through a reiterated\ninteraction with the context. As in quantum mechanics, lack of knowledge of the\nentity, its context, or the interaction between context and entity leads to\ndifferent forms of indeterminism in relation to the state of the entity. This\nindeterminism generates a non-Kolmogorovian distribution of probabilities that\nis different from the classical distribution of chance described by Darwinian\nevolution theory, which stems from a 'actuality focused', i.e. materialistic,\nview of nature. We also present a quantum evolution game that highlights the\nmain differences arising from our new perspective and shows that it is more\nfundamental to consider evolution in general, and biological evolution in\nspecific, as a process of actualization of potential induced by context, for\nwhich its material reduction is only a special case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 13:04:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Bundervoet", "Stan", ""], ["Czachor", "Marek", ""], ["D'Hooghe", "Bart", ""], ["Gabora", "Liane", ""], ["Polk", "Philip", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0109", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts, Jan Broekaert, Marek Czachor, Maciej Kuna, Barry\n  Sinervo and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "Quantum Structure in Competing Lizard Communities", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": "Ecological Modelling, 281, pp. 38-51, 2014", "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.02.009", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Almost two decades of research on applications of the mathematical formalism\nof quantum theory as a modeling tool in domains different from the micro-world\nhas given rise to many successful applications in situations related to human\nbehavior and thought, more specifically in cognitive processes of\ndecision-making and the ways concepts are combined into sentences.

It is very known that the\ntemperature inside the bubble depends on the radius, during the collapse, the\ntemperature can reach thousands of Kelvins and that the light would be emitted\nby radiation of the ionized gas inside the bubble. So, studies show that in\ncertain cases neither an imploding shock nor a plasma has been observed and the\ntemperature is not high enough to explain the spectrum observed. The Single\nBubble SonoLuminescence remains a subject of study. For this study we consider\nthe bubble as a box where the free particles (particularly electrons) stemming\nfrom the molecules dissociation, are are trapped and confined within the\nbubble. The confinement allows the particles to acquire some energy during the\ncollapse which they lose in the form of light and also to be considered to bind\nto the bubble as an electron is bound to the nucleus in an atom. So, with\nregard to the bubble the energy of the particles can be considered to quantify,\nand with the quantum theory, by putting some hypotheses, their energy is\ndetermined well. The energy is physically acceptable that if the bubble is\nspherical. This necessary condition of a spherical bubble of the model is\nobserved experimentally in the collapse phase but not in the afterbounce phase\nof the bubble, explain why the bubble emits of light in the collapse but not in\nthe phase of the afterbounces where she can be smaller, and constitute a\nvalidation of the Single Bubble SonoLuminescence of particles model.

Here, we propose a scheme for entangling two given\nphotons based on this effect. We consider a linear-optics set-up with an\nabsorber medium whose two-photon absorption rate $\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ exceeds the\none-photon loss rate $\\xi_{1\\gamma}$. In order to reach an error probability\n$P_{\\rm error}$, we need $\\xi_{1\\gamma}/\\xi_{2\\gamma}<2P_{\\rm error}^2/\\pi^2$,\nwhich is a factor of 64 better than previous approaches (e.g., by Franson et\nal). Since typical media have $\\xi_{2\\gamma}<\\xi_{1\\gamma}$, we discuss three\nmechanisms for enhancing two-photon absorption as compared to one-photon loss.\nThe first mechanism again employs the quantum Zeno effect via self-interference\neffects when sending two photons repeatedly through the same absorber. The\nsecond mechanism is based on coherent excitations of many atoms and exploits\nthe fact that $\\xi_{2\\gamma}$ scales with the number of excitations but\n$\\xi_{1\\gamma}$ does not.

This method\nis called the method of quantum hydrodynamics, because natural for of the\nquantum mechanics rewritten in terms of material fields of observable\nquantities in three dimensional space is the set of equations, which look like\nthe hydrodynamics equations. It can be shown that from the quantum\nhydrodynamics equations can be derived macroscopic non-linear Schrodinger\nequation. Most famous non-linear Schrodinger equation is the Gross-Pitaevskii\n(GP) equation, which contains nonlinearity of the third degree. There are\ngeneralizations of the GP equation. New term appears in the GP equation at\naccount of the three-particle interaction. This term contains nonlinearity of\nthe fifth degree. At more detailed account of the two particle interaction we\ncome to the nonlocal non-linear Schrodinger equation. This equation contains\nspatial derivatives of the order parameter in the non-linear terms caused by\nthe interaction. In this terminology the GP equation corresponds to the first\norder by the interaction radius. For the BEC of the neutral particles with\nanisotropic long-range dipole-dipole interaction the generalization of the GP\nequation was also suggested.

Great strides in the control of quantum\ninformation have already been made experimentally using this idea.

This approach is first\nillustrated for the class of quantum field states known as continuous\nmatrix-product states (cMPS). As a simple example of the path-integral\nrepresentation we show that the state of a dynamically evolving quantum field\nadmits a natural representation as a cMPS. A completeness argument is also\nprovided that shows that all states in Fock space admit a cMPS representation\nwhen the number of variational parameters tends to infinity. Beyond this, we\nobtain a well-behaved field limit of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in\ntwo dimensions that provide an abstract class of quantum field states with\nnatural symmetries. We demonstrate how symmetries of the physical field state\nare encoded within the dynamics of an auxiliary field system of one dimension\nless.

We also show that, for a driving-field frequency fulfilling another\nresonance condition and for higher strengths of the driving field, even a\nthree-photon blockade can occur but less clearly than in the case of single-\nand two-photon blockades. We demonstrate how various photon blockades can be\nidentified by analyzing photon-number correlations, coherence and entropic\nproperties, Wigner functions, and spectra of squeezing. We show that two- and\nthree-photon blockades can, in principle, be observed in various cavity and\ncircuit quantum electrodynamical systems for which the standard single-photon\nblockade was observed without the need of using higher-order driving\ninteractions or Kerr media exhibiting higher-order nonlinear susceptibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2012 14:36:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 21:26:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Miranowicz", "Adam", ""], ["Paprzycka", "Malgorzata", ""], ["Liu", "Yu-xi", ""], ["Bajer", "Jiri", ""], ["Nori", "Franco", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.4382", "submitter": "Sebastian W\\\"uster", "authors": "S.

How does chaos manifest itself in the quantum world? In this spirit,\nwe study the dynamical generation of entanglement as a signature of chaos in a\nsystem of periodically kicked coupled-tops, where chaos and entanglement arise\nfrom the same physical mechanism. The long-time entanglement as a function of\nthe position of an initially localized wave packet very closely correlates with\nthe classical phase space surface of section - it is nearly uniform in the\nchaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the regular islands. The\nuniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the random state conjecture.\nAs classically chaotic dynamics take localized distributions in phase space to\nrandom distributions, quantized versions take localized coherent states to\npseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random states are highly entangled,\nwith an average value near that of the maximally entangled state. Continuing on\nour journey to find the footprints of chaos in the quantum world, we explore\nquantum signatures of classical chaos by studying the rate of information gain\nin quantum tomography. We find an increase in the rate of information gain and\nhence higher fidelities in the process when the Floquet maps employed increase\nin chaoticity. We make predictions for the information gain using random matrix\ntheory in the fully chaotic regime and show a remarkable agreement between the\ntwo.

In particular, we present a general method for constructing\ntemporal probabilities in tunneling systems that (i) defines `classical' time\nobservables for quantum systems and (ii) applies to relativistic particles\ninteracting through quantum fields. We show that the relevant probabilities are\ndefined in terms of specific correlations functions of the quantum field\nassociated with tunneling particles. We construct a probability distribution\nwith respect to the time of particle detection that contains all information\nabout the temporal aspects of the tunneling process. In specific cases, this\nprobability distribution leads to the definition of a delay time that, for\nparity-symmetric potentials, reduces to the phase time of Bohm and Wigner. We\napply our results to piecewise constant potentials, by deriving the appropriate\njunction conditions on the points of discontinuity.
