In this paper, we study security of an ITS\nauthentication scheme proposed by Wegman & Carter, in the case of partially\nknown authentication key.

The partial knowledge of the attacker is\nmeasured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and\nthe uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct\nproofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the\ninformation-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability\nas used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the\nauthentication procedure has a failure probability $\\epsilon$ and the\nauthentication key has an $\\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under\nITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic\nmessage-tag pair is only bounded by $\\epsilon+|\\mT|\\epsilon'$, where $|\\mT|$ is\nthe size of the set of tags.

On\nthe other hand, quantum theory also predicts that environmental coupling\nproduces the opposite effect of spreading the wave function into a mixed state.\nStudying the effect of these two competing processes, as the ratio of their\nstrengths is varied, on the distribution of a quantum state is of fundamental\ninterest in any setting, but especially so in the mechanical realm. A key\nissue, however, is that a fundamental study of such physics can not entail an a\npriori assumption of the projection postulate itself, and Bayesian inference\nmay therefore not be employed to observe the quantum state. In this theoretical\nwork we propose a feasible way to perform such a fundamental test with a\nmechanical wave function in the energy eigenbasis. The scheme is based on an\noptomechanical setup wherein optical fields provide a direct probe of the\nenergy variance of the mechanical wave function. Such an energy variance probe\nis unprecedented in any type of system.

However,\nsimulations of such theories, compared to simulations of condensed matter\nphysics, must satisfy extra restrictions, such as local gauge and Lorentz\ninvariance. In this paper we discuss these special requirements, and present a\nnew method for quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories using ultracold\natoms. This method allows to include local gauge invariance as a fundamental\nsymmetry of the atomic Hamiltonian, arising from natural atomic interactions\nand conservation laws (and not as a property of a low energy sector). This\nallows us to implement elementary gauge invariant interactions for three\nlattice gauge theories: compact QED (U(1)), SU(N) and Z_N, which can be used to\nbuild quantum simulators in 1+1 dimensions. We also present a new loop method,\nwhich uses the elementary interactions as building blocks in the effective\nconstruction of quantum simulations for d+1 dimensional lattice gauge theories\n(d>1), without having to use Gauss's law as a constraint, as in previous\nproposals. We discuss in detail the quantum simulation of 2+1 dimensional\ncompact QED and provide a numerical proof of principle. The simplicity of the\nalready gauge invariant elementary interactions of this model suggests it may\nbe useful for future experimental realizations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 19:37:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 13:38:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 09:05:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zohar", "Erez", ""], ["Cirac", "J.

In the\nmost favorable scenario, this form of electron spectroscopy can induce magnetic\nsublevel transitions which are commonly probed using circularly polarized\nphoton beams.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 11:02:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2013 11:42:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 14:13:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "J.", ""], ["Lloyd", "S.

As\nbefore, there is no clear answer to this question even for the one-dimensional\ncompleted scattering (OCS). In this paper we show that this seemingly simple\nquestion stands alongside with such fundamental problems of quantum mechanics\n(QM) as the Schrodinger's-cat and and EPR-Bohm paradoxes. Their common feature\nis that the states of a scattered particle, a radioactive atom and electron\nEPR-pair represent pure {\\it micro-cat} states. It is widely accepted that the\nEPR-Bohm paradox implies the non-existence of local hidden variables (LHVs),\nthe cat paradox represents a macro-objectification problem and the tunneling\ntime is an observer-dependent quantity whose definitions must be 'operational'.\nAt the same time, according to the probabilistic approach (Accardi, Khrennikov,\nPhilipp, Hess {\\it et al.}) to Bell's inequality that underlies the EPR-Bohm\nexperiments, its experimental violation means simply that it contains\nprobability distributions associated with mutually incompatible statistical\ndata. We argue that this approach must be extended onto micro-cat states\nbecause they describe, too, mutually incompatible statistical data. The current\npractice to interpret the squared modulus of a micro-cat state as the\nprobability density should be recognized as erroneous. It is this practice that\nmakes QM incompatible with classical physical theories and, thereby, makes the\nmicro-world 'unspeakable'. The known 'operational' tunneling-time concepts,\nelaborated in line with this practice, are logically inconsistent.

At these points,\nthe eigenvalues of two states are equal and the corresponding eigenfunctions\nare linearly dependent.

Controlling the system by a parameter, the eigenvalues\navoid crossing in energy near an exceptional point under the influence of\nRe$(\\omega)$ in a similar manner as it is well known from discrete states.\nIm$(\\omega)$ however leads to width bifurcation and finally (when the system is\ncoupled to one channel, i.e. to a common continuum of scattering\nwavefunctions), to a splitting of the system into two parts with different\ncharacteristic time scales. Physically, the system is stabilized by this\nsplitting since the lifetimes of most ($N-1$) states are longer than before\nwhile that of only one state is shorter. In the cross section the short-lived\nstate appears as a background term in high-resolution experiments.

As many good CWS codes have been found by starting from a chosen S,\nthis ensures that when trying to find CWS codes with certain permutation\nsymmetry, the choice of S with the same symmetry will suffice. A key step for\nthis result is a new canonical representation for CWS codes, which is given in\nterms of a unique decomposition as union stabilizer codes. For CWS codes, so\nfar mainly the standard form (G,C) has been considered, where G is a graph\nstate. We analyze the symmetry of the corresponding graph of G, which in\ngeneral cannot possess the same permutation symmetry as Q.
