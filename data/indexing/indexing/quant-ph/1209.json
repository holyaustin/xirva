The main subject of the paper is an analysis of the correlation\nfemtoscopy when the source size is as small as the order of the uncertainty\nlimit. It is about 1 fm for the current high energy experiments. Then the\nstandard femtoscopy model of random sources is inapplicable. The uncertainty\nprinciple leads to the partial indistinguishability and coherence of closely\nlocated emitters that affect the observed femtoscopy scales. In thermal systems\nthe role of corresponding coherent length is taken by the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength that also defines the size of a single emitter. The formalism of\npartially coherent phases in the amplitudes of closely located individual\nemitters is used for the quantitative analysis. The general approach is\nillustrated analytically for the case of the Gaussian approximation for\nemitting sources. A reduction of the interferometry radii and a suppression of\nthe Bose-Einstein correlation functions for small sources due to the\nuncertainty principle are found. There is a positive correlation between the\nsource size and the intercept of the correlation function. The peculiarities of\nthe non-femtoscopic correlations caused by minijets and fluctuations of the\ninitial states of the systems formed in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions are also\nanalyzed.

We first show the existence of\ntopological edge states, in an ultra-cold gas trapped in a 2D optical lattice\nand subjected to a synthetic magnetic field. The remarkable robustness of the\nedge states is verified for a variety of external confining potentials. Then,\nwe describe a specific laser probe, made from two lasers in Laguerre-Gaussian\nmodes, which captures unambiguous signatures of these edge states. In\nparticular, the resulting Bragg spectra provide the dispersion relation of the\nedge states, establishing their chiral nature. In order to make the Bragg\nsignal experimentally detectable, we introduce a \"shelving method\", which\nsimultaneously transfers angular momentum and changes the internal atomic\nstate. This scheme allows to directly visualize the selected edge states on a\ndark background, offering an instructive view on topological insulating phases,\nnot accessible in solid-state experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2012 16:22:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 18:29:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Goldman", "Nathan", ""], ["Beugnon", "Jerome", ""], ["Gerbier", "Fabrice", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.2062", "submitter": "Andreas Weichselbaum", "authors": "Andreas Weichselbaum", "title": "Tensor networks and the numerical renormalization group", "comments": "20 pages, 11 figures (adapted from habilitation thesis)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.86.245124", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.str-el quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group (NRG) has evolved as\na systematic and transparent setting for the cal- culation of thermodynamical\nquantities at arbitrary temperatures within the NRG framework.

In this paper we\ninvestigate the extent to which these are universal quantities for a given\ntheory, and to which they distinguish different theories, by comparing the\nentanglement spectra of the massless Dirac fermion and the compact free boson\nin two dimensions. We show that the calculation of Renyi entropies via the\nreplica trick for any orbifold theory includes a sum over orbifold twists on\nall cycles. In a modular-invariant theory of fermions, this amounts to a sum\nover spin structures. The result is that the Renyi entropies respect the\nstandard Bose-Fermi duality. Next, we investigate the entanglement spectrum for\nthe Dirac fermion without a sum over spin structures, and for the compact boson\nat the self-dual radius. These are not equivalent theories; nonetheless, we\nfind that (1) their second Renyi entropies agree for any number of intervals,\n(2) their full entanglement spectra agree for two intervals, and (3) the\nspectrum generically disagrees otherwise. These results follow from the\nequality of the partition functions of the two theories on any Riemann surface\nwith imaginary period matrix. We also exhibit a map between the operators of\nthe theories that preserves scaling dimensions (but not spins), as well as OPEs\nand correlators of operators placed on the real line.

In\nparticular, a geometric measure of asymmetric discord [Dakic et al., Phys.

The optimal member of $\\Omega$ is just specially\nmeasured original state both for the CQ and CC discords. This implies that this\nmeasure is equal to quantum deficit of post-measurement purity. We discuss some\ngeneral relations between the CC discords and explain why an analytical formula\nfor the CC discord, contrary to the CQ discord, can hardly be found even for a\ngeneral two-qubit state. Instead of such exact formula, we find simple\nanalytical measurement-based upper bounds for the CC discord which, as we show,\nare very efficient in the case of two qubits and may serve as independent\nindicators of two-party quantum correlations. In particular, we propose an\nadaptive upper bound, which corresponds to the optimal states induced by\nsingle-party measurements: optimal measurement on one of the parties determines\nan optimal measurement on the other party. We discuss how to refine the\nadaptive upper bound by nonoptimal single-party measurements and by an\niterative procedure which usually rapidly converges to the CC discord.

In a Cayley graph, the distance between two vertices\ncorresponds to the optimal circuit size. The lower bound for the diameter of\nCayley graphs is also a lower bound for the worst case for any algorithm that\nuses the corresponding gate library.

To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform.

Here we\ndemonstrate these principles by generating and fully characterizing an\nentangled pair of photons that never coexisted. Using entanglement swapping\nbetween two temporally separated photon pairs we entangle one photon from the\nfirst pair with another photon from the second pair. The first photon was\ndetected even before the other was created.

In sharp contrast, an entangled state with Schmidt number at least $d$ is\nalways needed for distinguishing such two states by separable POVMs. As an\napplication, we show that the entanglement cost of distinguishing a $d\\otimes\nd$ maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement must be a maximally\nentangled state for $d=2$,which implies that teleportation is optimal; and in\ngeneral, it could be chosen as $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log d}{d})$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2012 12:17:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 16:58:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Nengkun", ""], ["Duan", "Runyao", ""], ["Ying", "Mingsheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4247", "submitter": "Masamitsu Bando", "authors": "Masamitsu Bando, Tsubasa Ichikawa, Yasushi Kondo and Mikio Nakahara", "title": "Concatenated composite pulses compensating simultaneous systematic\n  errors", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

In conjunction with a Markov approximation, the\nintegro-differential equation is then used to generate a hierarchy of\napproximations, in which the zeroth order is the adiabatic-elimination\napproximation. It works well with a proper choice of interaction picture; the\nprocedure suggests criteria for optimizing this choice. The first-order\napproximation in the hierarchy provides significant improvements over standard\nadiabatic elimination, without much increase in complexity, and is furthermore\nnot so sensitive to the choice of interaction picture. We illustrate these\npoints with several examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 16:50:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 02:47:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Paulisch", "Vanessa", ""], ["Han", "Rui", ""], ["Ng", "Hui Khoon", ""], ["Englert", "Berthold-Georg", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6569", "submitter": "Berthold-Georg Englert", "authors": "Rui Han, Hui Khoon Ng, and Berthold-Georg Englert", "title": "Raman transitions without adiabatic elimination: A simple and accurate\n  treatment", "comments": "17 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

In the present article we consider the\nproblem of optimization of such signals. The optimization that we describe here\nis that of the superoscillation yield, the ratio of the energy in the\nsuperoscillations to the total energy of the signal, given the range and\nfrequency of the superoscillations. The constrained optimization leads to a\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem, which is solved numerically. It is noteworthy\nthat it is possible to increase further the superoscillation yield at the cost\nof slightly deforming the oscillatory part of the signal, while keeping the\naverage frequency. We show, how this can be done gradually, which enables a\ntrade-off between the distortion and the yield. We show how to apply this\napproach to non-trivial domains, and explain how to generalize this to higher\ndimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2012 15:16:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Mar 2013 20:13:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 18:36:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Katzav", "Eytan", ""], ["Schwartz", "Moshe", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6588", "submitter": "Tomaz Prosen", "authors": "Tomaz Prosen", "title": "Generic examples of PT-symmetric qubit (spin 1/2) Liouvillians", "comments": "In press as Brief Report in Phys.

It can decide whether individual\nreported field-enhancement-factor (FEF) values are spuriously large. The paper\ndefines an \"orthodox emission situation\" by a set of ideal experimental,\nphysical and mathematical conditions, and shows how (in these conditions)\noperating values of scaled barrier field (f) can be extracted from\nFowler-Nordheim (FN) and Millikan-Lauritsen (ML) plots. By analyzing historical\nCFE experiments, which are expected to nearly satisfy the orthodoxy conditions,\n\"apparently reasonable\" and \"clearly unreasonable\" experimental ranges for f\nare found. These provide a test for lack of orthodoxy. For illustration, this\ntest is applied to 17 post-1975 CFE data sets, mainly for carbon and\nsemiconductor nanostructures. Some extracted f-value ranges are apparently\nreasonable (including many carbon results), some are clearly unreasonable. It\nis shown that this test applies to any field-emission diode geometry and any\nform of FN or ML plot. It is proved mathematically that, if the extracted\nf-value range is \"unreasonably high\", then FEF-values extracted by the usual\nliterature method are spuriously large. Probably, all new field-emitter\nmaterials should be tested in this way. Appropriate data-analysis theory needs\ndeveloping for non-orthodox emitters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 19:04:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Forbes", "Richard G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6625", "submitter": "Stephan Hoyer", "authors": "Stephan Hoyer and K.
