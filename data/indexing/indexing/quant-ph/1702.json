Such an apparently irreversible process is known as spin\ndiffusion and it can lead the system back to \"equilibrium\". Even so, a unitary\nquantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial\ncondition. Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol\nreverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial\nnon-equilibrium state at time $t$. As a matter of fact, the reversal is always\nperturbed by small experimental imperfections and/or uncontrolled internal or\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. This limits the amount of signal $M(t)$\nrecovered locally at time $t$. The degradation of $M(t)$ accounts for these\nperturbations, which can also be seen as the sources of decoherence.

It turns out that the overlap of the ground states\nwith translationally invariant product states can be exactly calculated and\nhence the GE can be obtained via further parameter optimization. The QPTs\nexhibited in these models are detected by the energy gap and singular behavior\nof geometric entanglement. In particular, the XzY model exhibits transitions\nfrom the nontrivial SPT phase to a trivial paramagnetic phase.

This\ndescription allows us to calculate the influence of hyperbolic response on\nelectromagnetic fluctuations without explicitly imposing a characteristic size\n(model of nonlocality), leading to formally bounded expressions so long as\nmaterial absorption is included. We then apply this framework to two exemplary\nareas: the optical sum rule for modified spontaneous emission enhancement in a\ngeneral uniaxial medium, and thermal electromagnetic field fluctuations in\nhexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide. We find that while the sum rule\nis satisfied, it does not constrain the enhancement of light-matter\ninteractions in either case.

We exemplify asymmetric broadcasting\nof entanglement using Maximally Entangled Mixed States. We demonstrate the\nvariation of broadcasting range with the amount of entanglement present in the\nresource state as well as with the asymmetry in the cloner. We show that it is\nimpossible to optimally broadcast geometric discord with the help of these\nasymmetric Pauli cloning machines. We also study the problem of $1 \\rightarrow\n3$ broadcasting of entanglement using non-maximally entangled state (NME) as\nthe resource. For this task, we introduce a method we call successive\nbroadcasting which involves application of $1 \\rightarrow 2$ optimal cloning\nmachines multiple times. We compare and contrast the performance of this method\nwith the application of direct $1 \\rightarrow 3$ optimal cloning machines. We\nshow that $1 \\rightarrow 3$ optimal cloner does a better job at broadcasting\nthan the successive application of $1 \\rightarrow 2$ cloners and the successive\nmethod can be beneficial in the absence of $1 \\rightarrow 3$ cloners. We also\nbring out the fundamental difference between the tasks of cloning and\nbroadcasting in the final part of the manuscript. We create examples to show\nthat there exist local unitaries which can be employed to give a better range\nfor broadcasting. Such unitary operations are not only economical, but also\nsurpass the best possible range obtained using existing cloning machines\nenabling broadcasting of lesser entangled states. This result opens up a new\ndirection in exploration of methods to facilitate broadcasting which may\noutperform the standard strategies implemented through cloning transformations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 18:13:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 10:53:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 04:00:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 21:42:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Aditya", ""], ["Chakrabarty", "Indranil", ""], ["Chatterjee", "Sourav", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.02140", "submitter": "Paul Tappenden", "authors": "Paul Tappenden", "title": "Objective Probability and the Mind-Body Relation", "comments": "29 pages, 2 figures, to appear in Studies in History and Philosophy\n  of Modern Physics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.hist-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Objective probability in quantum mechanics is often thought to involve a\nstochastic process whereby an actual future is selected from a range of\npossibilities.

Here we propose a method to generate a new type of quantum entangled\nstates, $(|NN00\\rangle+|00NN\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ called \"double NOON\" states,\nwith a setup of two superconducting flux qutrits and five circuit cavities.\nThis scheme operates essentially by employing a two-photon process, i.e., two\nphotons are simultaneously and separately emitted into two cavities when each\ncoupler qutrit is initially in a higher-energy excited state. As a consequence,\nthe \"double\" NOON state creation needs only $N$+2 operational steps. One\napplication of double NOON states is to get a phase error of $1/(2N)$ in phase\nmeasurement. In comparison, to achieve the same error, a normal NOON state of\nthe form $(|2N,0\\rangle+|0,2N\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ is needed, which requires at\nleast $2N$ operational steps to prepare by using the existing schemes. Our\nnumerical simulation demonstrates that high-fidelity generation of the double\nNOON states with $N\\leq 10$ even for the imperfect devices is feasible with the\npresent circuit QED technique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 02:07:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Qi-Ping", ""], ["Zhu", "Hui-Hao", ""], ["Yu", "Li", ""], ["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["Xiong", "Shao-Jie", ""], ["Liu", "Jin-Ming", ""], ["Yang", "Chui-Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.02697", "submitter": "Sebastian Kish", "authors": "Sebastian P.

We focus on the Ohmic spin-boson and related\nmodels, which describes a single spin-1/2 coupled to an infinite collection of\nharmonic oscillators. The topics are largely drawn from our efforts over the\npast years, but we also present a few novel results. In the first part of this\nreview, we begin with a pedagogical introduction to the real-time dynamics of a\ndissipative spin at both high and low temperatures. We then focus on the driven\ndynamics in the quantum regime beyond the limit of weak spin-bath coupling. In\nthese situations, the non-perturbative stochastic Schroedinger equation method\nis ideally suited to numerically obtain the spin dynamics as it can incorporate\nbias fields $h_z(t)$ of arbitrary time-dependence in the Hamiltonian. We\npresent different recent applications of this method: (i) how topological\nproperties of the spin such as the Berry curvature and the Chern number can be\nmeasured dynamically, and how dissipation affects the topology and the\nmeasurement protocol, (ii) how quantum spin chains can experience\nsynchronization dynamics via coupling to a common bath. In the second part of\nthis review, we discuss quantum engineering of spin-boson and related models in\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), quantum electrical circuits and\ncold-atoms architectures. In different realizations, the Ohmic environment can\nbe represented by a long (microwave) transmission line, a Luttinger liquid, a\none-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, a chain of superconducting Josephson\njunctions. We show that the quantum impurity can be used as a quantum sensor to\ndetect properties of a bath at minimal coupling, and how dissipative spin\ndynamics can lead to new insight in the Mott-Superfluid transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 19:58:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Nov 2017 09:14:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Jul 2018 17:06:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hur", "Karyn Le", ""], ["Henriet", "Lo\u00efc", ""], ["Herviou", "Lo\u00efc", ""], ["Plekhanov", "Kirill", ""], ["Petrescu", "Alexandru", ""], ["Goren", "Tal", ""], ["Schiro", "Marco", ""], ["Mora", "Christophe", ""], ["Orth", "Peter P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.05144", "submitter": "Qiong Chen", "authors": "Q.

For states that do show\nspin-orbit mixing, the spin polarization across the beam is nonuniform\nrendering the spin and orbital degrees of freedom inherently inseparable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 09:28:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 13:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["van Kruining", "Koen", ""], ["Hayrapetyan", "Armen G.", ""], ["G\u00f6tte", "J\u00f6rg B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.05282", "submitter": "Roderich Tumulka", "authors": "Matthias Lienert, S\\\"oren Petrat, Roderich Tumulka", "title": "Multi-Time Wave Functions", "comments": "21 pages LaTeX, 4 figures; written for the proceedings of the\n  conference DICE2016 (Castiglioncello, Italy, 12-16 September 2016)", "journal-ref": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series 880: 012006 (2017)", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/880/1/012006", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In non-relativistic quantum mechanics of $N$ particles in three spatial\ndimensions, the wave function $\\psi(q_1,\\ldots,q_N,t)$ is a function of $3N$\nposition coordinates and one time coordinate.

We unify the results of two approaches. In the first\none, the original system is compared with its copy rotated by the parameter\ndependent dynamics. If the parameter is coupled to the one-body part of the\nHamiltonian the precision of its estimation is known to scale at most as\n$N^{-1}$ (Heisenberg scaling) in terms of the number of elementary subsystems\nused, $N$. The second approach considers fidelity at criticality often leading\nto an apparent super-Heisenberg scaling. However, scaling of time needed to\nensure adiabaticity of the evolution brings back the the Heisenberg limit. We\nillustrate the general theory on a ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain which\nexhibits such super-Heisenberg scaling of fidelity around the critical value of\nthe magnetic field. Even an elementary estimator represented by a single-site\nmagnetization already outperforms the Heisenberg behavior providing the\n$N^{-1.5}$ scaling. In this case Fisher information sets the ultimate scaling\nas $N^{-1.75}$ which can be saturated by measuring magnetization on all sites\nsimultaneously. We discuss universal scaling predictions of the estimation\nprecision offered by such observables, both at zero and finite temperatures,\nand support them with numerical simulations in the model. We provide an\nexperimental proposal of realization of the considered model via mapping the\nsystem to ultra-cold bosons in periodically shaken optical lattice.

The presented nanoguide architecture\npaves the way for the investigation of many-body phenomena and polaritonic\nstates and can be readily extended to more complex geometries for the\nrealization of quantum integrated photonic circuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:38:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["T\u00fcrschmann", "Pierre", ""], ["Rotenberg", "Nir", ""], ["Renger", "Jan", ""], ["Harder", "Irina", ""], ["Lohse", "Olga", ""], ["Utikal", "Tobias", ""], ["G\u00f6tzinger", "Stephan", ""], ["Sandoghdar", "Vahid", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.05927", "submitter": "Colin Benjamin", "authors": "Jishnu Rajendran, Colin Benjamin", "title": "Implementing Parrondo's paradox with two coin quantum walks", "comments": "9 pages, 7 Figures, accepted for publication in Royal Society Open\n  Science", "journal-ref": "R.

Our general theory\ndemonstrates that the detected Raman spectrum originates from an interplay\nbetween nonlinear light generation and propagation. Counter intuitively, at the\nnonlinear generation stage, we show that the Stokes (anti-Stokes) signal at the\nmolecule location depends on the plasmonic enhancements, through the local\ndensity of photon states (LDOS), at the anti-Stokes (Stokes) frequency.\nHowever, when propagating from the vibrating molecule to the far field, the\nStokes (anti-Stokes) emission experiences a plasmonic enhancement at the Stokes\n(anti-Stokes) frequency, as expected. We identify the limits of the commonly\nknown E^4 electric-field rule for Raman signal enhancement near plasmonic\nsurfaces at low pump powers, as well as a different E^8 rule at high pump\npowers, and we clarify the role of the LDOS. Our theory uses a generalized\nquantum master equation where the plasmonic system is treated as an\nenvironmental bath that is described through the photonic Green function of the\nmedium. Therefore, any electrodynamics related physics, such as quenching and\npropagation, are self-consistently included in the model.

However, the superradiant phase collapses by the resonant damping of\nthe oscillator when the atom-field coupling increases to a so-called turning\npoint. As a consequence the system undergoes at this point an additional phase\ntransition from the superradiant phase to a new normal phase of the atomic\npopulation-inversion state. The region of superradiant phase decreases with the\nincrease of photon-phonon coupling. It shrinks to zero at a critical value of\nthe coupling and a direct atomic population transfer appears between two\natom-levels.

Also,\ntolerance of ambiguity is found to be related to divergent thinking. In this\nstudy, we approach the problem of creativity from a theoretical physics\nstandpoint.

Repeated intervention\nof external stimulus (analogous to a measurement) is responsible for such\njumps.

We suggest that this collection of nodes form a system which is likely\nto be governed by quantum physics and specify the transformations which could\nhelp explain the conceptual jump between states. Our argument, from the point\nof view of physics is that the initial evolution of the creative process is\nidentical, person or field independent.

This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the\ndiscrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be\nviewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of\nsuch equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of\nLagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar\nfunctions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of\nindependent variables. The variational principle involves variations not only\nwith respect to the field variables, but also with respect to the geometry in\nthe space of independent variables. In this paper we consider a quantum\nanalogue of this new variational principle by means of quantum propagators (or\nequivalently Feynman path integrals). In the case of quadratic Lagrangians\nthese can be evaluated in terms of Gaussian integrals. We study also periodic\nreductions of the lattice leading to discrete multi-time dynamical commuting\nmappings, the simplest example of which is the discrete harmonic oscillator,\nwhich surprisingly reveals a rich integrable structure behind it.
