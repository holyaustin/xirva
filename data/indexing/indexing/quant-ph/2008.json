This interplay consequently serves as a potential platform\nfor interdisciplinary studies. To continue this line, we analyze the role of\ndynamical resources in a communication setup, and further apply our analysis to\nthermodynamics. To start with, we study classical communication scenarios\nconstrained by a given resource, in the sense that the information processing\nchannel is unable to supply additional amounts of the resource. We show that\nthe one-shot classical capacity is upper bounded by resource preservability,\nwhich is a measure of the ability to preserve the resource. A lower bound can\nbe further obtained when the resource is asymmetry. As an application,\nunexpectedly, under a recently-studied thermalization model, we found that the\nsmallest bath size needed to thermalize all outputs of a Gibbs-preserving\ncoherence-annihilating channel upper bounds its one-shot classical capacity.\nWhen the channel is coherence non-generating, the upper bound is given by a sum\nof coherence preservability and the bath size of the channel's incoherent\nversion. In this sense, bath sizes can be interpreted as the thermodynamic cost\nof transmitting classical information. This finding provides a dynamical\nanalogue of Landauer's principle, and therefore bridges classical communication\nand thermodynamics. As another implication, we show that, in bipartite\nsettings, classically correlated local baths can admit classical communication\neven when both local systems are completely thermalized. Hence, thermalizations\ncan transmit information by accessing only classical correlation as a resource.\nOur results demonstrate interdisciplinary applications enabled by dynamical\nresource theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2020 06:32:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2020 03:23:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:41:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2021 06:39:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Chung-Yun", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00216", "submitter": "Aneeqa Fatima", "authors": "Aneeqa Fatima and Igor L.

Their theoretical\nunderstanding is hampered by their large Hilbert space and by their intrinsic\nnonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability of many traditional\napproaches. In this work we extend the nonequilibrium bosonic Dynamical Mean\nField Theory (DMFT) to Markovian open quantum systems. Within DMFT, a Lindblad\nmaster equation describing a lattice of dissipative bosonic particles is mapped\nonto an impurity problem describing a single site embedded in its Markovian\nenvironment and coupled to a self-consistent field and to a non-Markovian bath,\nwhere the latter accounts for finite lattice connectivity corrections beyond\nGutzwiller mean-field theory. We develop a non-perturbative approach to solve\nthis bosonic impurity problem, which treats the non-Markovian bath in a\nnon-crossing approximation. As a first application, we address the steady-state\nof a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with two-body losses and incoherent\npump. We show that DMFT captures hopping-induced dissipative processes,\ncompletely missed in Gutzwiller mean-field theory, which crucially determine\nthe properties of the normal phase, including the redistribution of\nsteady-state populations, the suppression of local gain and the emergence of a\nstationary quantum-Zeno regime. We argue that these processes compete with\ncoherent hopping to determine the phase transition towards a non-equilibrium\nsuperfluid, leading to a strong renormalization of the phase boundary at\nfinite-connectivity. We show that this transition occurs as a finite-frequency\ninstability, leading to an oscillating-in-time order parameter, that we connect\nwith a quantum many-body synchronization transition of an array of quantum van\nder Pol oscillators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 10:35:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Apr 2021 10:25:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Scarlatella", "Orazio", ""], ["Clerk", "Aashish A.", ""], ["Fazio", "Rosario", ""], ["Schir\u00f3", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.02612", "submitter": "Lorcan Conlon", "authors": "Lorc\\'an Conlon, Jun Suzuki, Ping Koy Lam, Syed M.

The Holevo bound is an\nasymptotically achievable bound when one allows for any measurement strategy,\nincluding collective measurements on many copies of the probe. In this work we\nintroduce a tighter bound for estimating multiple parameters simultaneously\nwhen performing separable measurements on finite copies of the probe. This\nmakes it more relevant in terms of experimental accessibility. We show that\nthis bound can be efficiently computed by casting it as a semidefinite program.\nWe illustrate our bound with several examples of collective measurements on\nfinite copies of the probe. These results have implications for the necessary\nrequirements to saturate the Holevo bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 12:43:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Jul 2021 23:33:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Conlon", "Lorc\u00e1n", ""], ["Suzuki", "Jun", ""], ["Lam", "Ping Koy", ""], ["Assad", "Syed M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.02623", "submitter": "Takuma Noto", "authors": "Takuma Noto", "title": "Quantum circuit to estimate pi using quantum amplitude estimation", "comments": "15 pages, 10 figures.

In this\npaper we explore the possibility of operating a conjugate homodyne detection\nsystem in \"photon counting\" mode to implement discrete-variable (DV) quantum\nkey distribution (QKD) protocols. A conjugate homodyne detection system, which\nconsists of a beam splitter followed by two optical homodyne detectors, can\nsimultaneously measure a pair of conjugate quadratures X and P of the incoming\nquantum state. In classical electrodynamics, X^2 + P^2 is proportional to the\nenergy (the photon number) of the input light. In quantum optics, X and P do\nnot commute and thus the above photon-number measurement is intrinsically\nnoisy. This suggests that a blind application of the standard security proof\ncould result pessimistic QKD performance. We overcome this obstacle by taking\nadvantage of two special features of the proposed detection scheme. First, the\nfundamental detection noise associated with vacuum fluctuation cannot be\nmanipulated by an external adversary. Second, the ability to reconstruct the\nphoton number statistics at the receiver's end can place additional constraints\non possible attacks from the adversary. As an example, we study the security of\nthe BB84 QKD using conjugate homodyne detection and evaluate its performance\nthrough numerical simulations.

Therefore, the SSC qualitatively appears to\nbe the same as if the continuous Markovian bath would be used. We confirm that\nthe presence of composite system-bath interactions under the rotating-wave\napproximation (RWA) is the necessary condition for the generation of SSC using\nthermal resources in collision models. Remarkably, we show that SSC\nsubstantially increases if the target system interacts collectively with more\nthan one bath element at a time. Already few bath elements collectively\ninteracting with the target system are sufficient to increase SSC at non-zero\ntemperatures at the cost of tolerable lowering the final state purity. From the\nthermodynamic perspective, the SSC generation in our collision models is\ninevitably linked to a non zero power input (and thus heat dissipated to the\nbath) necessary to reach the steady-state, although such energetic cost can be\nlower compared to cases relying on SSC non generating interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2020 09:40:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 01:50:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rom\u00e1n-Ancheyta", "Ricardo", ""], ["Kol\u00e1\u0159", "Michal", ""], ["Guarnieri", "Giacomo", ""], ["Filip", "Radim", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.05234", "submitter": "Stanislav Straupe", "authors": "G.I.

Ever since, there has been an enormous\ninterest in using quantum mechanical systems, known as quantum simulators, to\nmimic specific physical systems. Hitherto, these controllable systems have been\nimplemented on different platforms that rely on trapped atoms, superconducting\ncircuits and photonic arrays. Unfortunately, these platforms do not seem to\nsatisfy, at once, all desirable features of an universal simulator, namely\nlong-lived coherence, full control of system parameters, low losses, and\nscalability. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate robust\nsimulation of quantum transport phenomena using a state-of-art reconfigurable\nelectronic network. To test the robustness and precise control of our platform,\nwe explore the ballistic propagation of a single-excitation wavefunction in an\nordered lattice, and its localization due to disorder. We implement the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model to directly observe the emergence of\ntopologically-protected one-dimensional edge states. Furthermore, we present\nthe realization of the so-called perfect transport protocol, a key milestone\nfor the development of scalable quantum computing and communication. Finally,\nwe show the first simulation of the exciton dynamics in the B800 ring of the\npurple bacteria LH2 complex. The high fidelity of our simulations together with\nthe low decoherence of our device make it a robust, versatile and promising\nplatform for the simulation of quantum transport phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:03:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Quiroz-Ju\u00e1rez", "Mario A.", ""], ["You", "Chenglong", ""], ["Carrillo-Mart\u00ednez", "Javier", ""], ["Montiel-\u00c1lvarez", "Diego", ""], ["Arag\u00f3n", "Jos\u00e9 L.", ""], ["Maga\u00f1a-Loaiza", "Omar S.", ""], ["Le\u00f3n-Montiel", "Roberto de J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.06097", "submitter": "Pradeep Thakur", "authors": "Pradeep Thakur and P.

Both\nlongitudinal and transverse DM vectors are considered. Using numerical DMRG, we\ncompute the one-tangle, two-spin concurrence and the Wigner-Yananse-skew\ninformation. We show that a longitudinal DMI destroys the factorizability\nproperty while a transverse DMI preserves it. We relate the absence of\nfactorizability to the breaking of the $U(1)$ rotation symmetry about the local\nmagnetization axis at each lattice site. Physically, breaking of the symmetry\nmanifests in the existence of a chiral current. Although the longitudinal DMI\ndestroys factorizability, we obtain a `pseudofactorizing' field ($h_{pf}$) at\nwhich entanglement and hence violation of the $U(1)$ symmetry is minimal. Our\ncalculations indicate a phase coherent ground state at $h_{pf}$. An\nentanglement transition (ET) occurs across this field which is characterized by\nan enhanced but finite range of two-spin concurrence in its vicinity in\ncontrast with the diverging range of the concurrence for the ET across the\nfactorizing field ($h_{f}$). We relate the asymmetry to the `frameness' or the\nability for the state to act as a reference frame for some measurement. In\nabsence of longitudinal DMI (or in presence of transverse DMI), at $h_{f}$, the\nsingle site magnetization axis specifies the common $z$-axis for the full\nsystem but not the full Cartesian reference frame due to a lack of phase\nreference. On the other hand, in the presence of a longitudinal DMI, our\nresults indicate that at $h_{pf}$, the local magnetization and the chiral\ncurrent are sufficient to specify the full Cartesian reference frame, with the\nchiral current being the macroscopic quantity to determine the phase reference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:11:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Thakur", "Pradeep", ""], ["Durganandini", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.06138", "submitter": "Armin Khamoshi", "authors": "Armin Khamoshi, Francesco A.

Clogging occurs at all the sites in the left half and lasts for a time\nproportional to its distance from the connection point. In this paper, we use\nvarious different initial conditions and discuss two issues. The first issue is\nthe possibility of clogging in a stationary state. When the electron density in\nthe right half is initially set nonzero, we found that the left half-filled\npart expands for various sets of parameters in the initial condition. This\nmeans that the clogging phenomenon occurs at all the sites in the long-time\nstationary state, and we also discuss its origin. In addition, stationary\nclogging is accompanied by a back current, namely, particle density current\nflows towards the high-density region. We also found spin clogging occurs for\nsome initial conditions, i.e., the vanishing spin current coexists with nonzero\nenergy current. The second issue is the proportionality of spin and charge\ncurrents. We have found two spatio-temporal regions where the current ratio is\nfixed to a nonzero constant.

The recent surge of interest in the dynamics of quantum many-body\nsystems has rejuvenated interest in this phenomenon. Motivated by the\nubiquitous long-range interactions in emerging experimental platforms, it is\nvital to study quantum aging in such settings. In this work, we investigate the\ndynamical universality and aging in the $d$-dimensional $O(N)$ model with the\nlong-range coupling $1/x^{d+\\sigma}$ and in the mean-field limit $N\\to\\infty$\nthat allows an exact treatment. An immediate consequence of long-range coupling\nis the emergence of nonlinear light cones. We focus on the correlation and\nresponse functions, and identify a rich scaling behavior depending on how the\ncorresponding space-time positions are located relative to each other, via a\n\\textit{local light cone}, and to the time of the quench via a global\n\\textit{quench light cone}. We determine the initial-slip exponent that governs\nthe short-time dependence of two-point functions. We highlight the new\nqualitative features of aging due to the long-range coupling, in particular in\nthe region outside the light cones. As an important consequence of long-range\ncoupling, the correlation function decays as $1/x^{d+\\sigma}$ outside the\nquench light cone while increasing polynomially with the total time after\nquench. This is while, for short time differences, the two-time response\nfunction \"equilibrates\" at \\textit{all} distances even outside this light cone.\nOur analytic findings are in excellent agreement with exact numerics, and\nprovide a useful benchmark for modern experimental platforms with long-range\ninteractions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Halimeh", "Jad C.", ""], ["Maghrebi", "Mohammad F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.08585", "submitter": "Rahul Sahay", "authors": "Rahul Sahay, Francisco Machado, Bingtian Ye, Chris R.

We investigate the measurement of gravity when the\npositions of the gravitating masses exhibit significant quantum fluctuations,\nincluding preparation of the massive oscillators in the ground state, or in a\nsqueezed state. We also present a plausible scheme to realize an experiment\nwhere the two oscillators are prepared in a two-mode squeezed motional quantum\nstate that exhibits nonlocal quantum correlations and gravity the same time.\nAlthough the gravity is classical, the experiment will pave the way for testing\ntrue quantum gravity in related experimental arrangements.

Since universal quantum computation cannot be achieved within the\nIsing anyon model by braiding alone, we have introduced an additional\nelementary phase gate to model a non-topological measurement process, which\nrestores universality of the anyon model at the cost of breaking the full\ntopological protection. We model conventional kinds of decoherence processes\nalgorithmically by introducing a controllable noise term to all non-topological\ngate operations. We find that for reasonable levels of decoherence, even the\nhybrid Ising anyon model retains a significant topological advantage over a\nconventional, non-topological, quantum computer. Furthermore, we find that only\nsurprisingly short anyon braids are ever required to be compiled due to the\ngate noise exceeding the intrinsic error of the braid words already for word\nlengths of the order of $100$ elementary braids. We conclude that the future\nfor hybrid topological quantum computation remains promising.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2020 02:44:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Johansen", "Emil G\u00e9netay", ""], ["Simula", "Tapio", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.10795", "submitter": "Ioana Craiciu", "authors": "Ioana Craiciu, Mi Lei, Jake Rochman, John G.

From the\noptical Bloch equations for our five-level double-$\\Lambda$ system, the\ntransmission spectrum is analytically explained by the Fabry-P\\'{e}rot\ninterferometry of temporal spinwaves. Due to small amplitude difference between\nthe two Land\\'{e} factors, each peak splits into two when the external magnetic\nfield is not too weak. This peak splitting can be employed to measure an\nunknown magnetic field without involving magneto-sensitive transitions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:07:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2021 03:15:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Fang", "Ruihuan", ""], ["Han", "Chengyin", ""], ["Jiang", "Xunda", ""], ["Qiu", "Yuxiang", ""], ["Guo", "Yuanyuan", ""], ["Zhao", "Minhua", ""], ["Huang", "Jiahao", ""], ["Lu", "Bo", ""], ["Lee", "Chaohong", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.12565", "submitter": "Vincent Debierre", "authors": "V.

Although it arises\nat relatively short times, the Fermi regime does not take hold in the earliest\nstages of the quantum dynamics. The standard criterion in the literature for\nthe onset time of the Fermi regime is $t_F\\sim1/\\Delta\\omega$, with\n$\\Delta\\omega$ the frequency interval around the resonant transition frequency\n$\\omega_0$ of the system, over which the coupling to the reservoir does not\nvary appreciably. In this work, this criterion is shown to be inappropriate in\ngeneral for broadband reservoirs, where the reservoir coupling spectrum takes\nthe form $R\\left(\\omega\\right)\\propto\\omega^\\eta$, and for which it is found\nthat for $\\eta>1$, the onset time of the Fermi regime is given by\n$t_F\\propto\\left(\\omega_{\\mathrm{X}}/\\omega_0\\right)^{\\eta-1}\\times1/\\omega_0$\nwhere $\\omega_{\\mathrm{X}}$ is the high-frequency cutoff of the reservoir.\nTherefore, the onset of the Fermi regime can take place at times orders of\nmagnitude larger than those predicted by the standard criterion. This\nphenomenon is shown to be related to the excitation of the off-resonant\nfrequencies of the reservoir at short times.

In the current paper we provide a more detailed derivation of the LGQ\nsmoothing equations and address an open question about Bob's optimal\nmeasurement strategy. Specifically, we develop a simple hypothesis that allows\none to approximate the optimal measurement choice for Bob given Alice's\nmeasurement choice. By 'optimal choice' we mean the choice for Bob that will\nmaximize the purity improvement of Alice's smoothed state compared to her\nfiltered state (an estimated state based only on Alice's past measurement\nrecord). The hypothesis, that Bob should choose his measurement so that he\nobserves the back-action on the system from Alice's measurement, seems contrary\nto one's intuition about quantum state smoothing.

In addition to uncertainties in the\nsystem and control Hamiltonians and initial state preparation, there is\nuncertainty about interactions with the environment leading to decoherence.\nThis paper investigates the robust performance of control schemes for open\nquantum systems subject to such uncertainties. A general formalism is\ndeveloped, where performance is measured based on the transmission of a dynamic\nperturbation or initial state preparation error to a final density operator\nerror. This formulation makes it possible to apply tools from classical robust\ncontrol, especially structured singular value analysis, to assess robust\nperformance of controlled, open quantum systems. However, there are additional\ndifficulties that must be overcome, especially at low frequency ($s\\approx0$).\nFor example, at $s=0$, the Bloch equations for the density operator are\nsingular, and this causes lack of continuity of the structured singular value.\nWe address this issue by analyzing the dynamics on invariant subspaces and\ndefining a pseudo-inverse that enables us to formulate a specialized version of\nthe matrix inversion lemma. The concepts are demonstrated with an example of\ntwo qubits in a leaky cavity under laser driving fields and spontaneous\nemission. In addition, a new performance index is introduced for this system.\nInstead of the tracking or transfer fidelity error, performance is measured by\nthe steady-steady entanglement generated, which is quantified by a non-linear\nfunction of the system state called concurrence. Simulations show that there is\nno conflict between this performance index, its log-sensitivity and stability\nmargin under decoherence, unlike for conventional control problems [...].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 15:51:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Schirmer", "Sophie G.", ""], ["Langbein", "Frank C.", ""], ["Weidner", "Carrie A.", ""], ["Jonckheere", "Edmond", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13698", "submitter": "Timothy Woodworth", "authors": "Timothy S.
