It has even been\ndescribed as \"the most profound discovery of science.\" Yet even as we approach\nthe 50th anniversary of Bell's discovery, its meaning and implications remain\ncontroversial. Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem\nrefutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\nin 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional (\"hidden\")\nvariables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an\nobserver-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the\northodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,\nwas quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an \"essential\nconflict\" between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory\nand relativistic \\emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in\ngeneral, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to\nexplain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept\nof relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests. We thus collect and\norganize many of Bell's crucial statements on these topics, which are scattered\nthroughout his writings, into a self-contained, pedagogical discussion\nincluding elaborations of the concepts \"beable\", \"completeness\", and\n\"causality\" which figure in the formulation.

The\ninformation, initially present in the system, is not erased, but is diluted in\nthe bath because of entanglement. Irreversibility may arise if, after quantum\ninformation has been thus diluted, some classical information is lost. This\npaper reviews a model for thermalization that displays these features. Two new\nanalytical results are provided for the zero-temperature channels: a new\nquantitative measure of entanglement, and a study of irreversibility in the\ncase where the lost classical information is the label of the particles in the\nbath.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2007 02:36:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Scarani", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0902", "submitter": "Kazuyuki Fujii", "authors": "Kazuyuki Fujii (Yokohama City University) and Tatsuo Suzuki (Shibaura\n  Institute of Technology)", "title": "Flow Representation of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian : General Case", "comments": "Latex ; 8 pages ; 1 figure ; minor changes", "journal-ref": "Int.J.Geom.Meth.Mod.Phys. 5(2008) 339-344", "doi": "10.1142/S0219887808002813", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper the explicit flow representation to the Bose-Hubbard\nHamiltonian is given in the general case.

The\noutstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive\nmicromechanical elements (which must be small, light, and flexible) into high\nfinesse cavities (which are typically much more rigid and massive) without\ncompromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more\nfundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's quantum state:\ndisplacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine the energy\neigenstate of an oscillator, and measurements which couple to quantities other\nthan displacement have been difficult to realize. Here we present a novel\noptomechanical system which seems to resolve both these challenges. We\ndemonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a thin dielectric\nmembrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This\napproach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct\nstructures and avoids compromising either.

Phys. 45, 2171 (2004)], there has been much\neffort in the quantum information community to prove (or disprove) the\nexistence of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) sets of quantum states in\narbitrary finite dimension. This paper strengthens the urgency of this question\nby showing that if SIC-sets exist: 1) by a natural measure of orthonormality,\nthey are as close to being an orthonormal basis for the space of density\noperators as possible, and 2) in prime dimensions, the standard construction\nfor complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and Weyl-Heisenberg covariant\nSIC-sets are intimately related: The latter represent minimum uncertainty\nstates for the former in the sense of Wootters and Sussman. Finally, we\ncontribute to the question of existence by conjecturing a quadratic redundancy\nin the equations for Weyl-Heisenberg SIC-sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2007 18:47:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 18:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Appleby", "D.

The entanglement exits even when there is no\ntwo-mode squeezing, since the correlation leading to these phenomena are\nessentially different. In addition, the more the external coherent light is\ndown converted, the more stronger the entanglement and mean photon number of\nthe two-mode radiation would be which is not generally true for squeezing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2007 08:34:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Tesfa", "Sintayehu", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3685", "submitter": "Ward Struyve", "authors": "Ward Struyve", "title": "Pilot-wave theory and quantum fields", "comments": "65 pages, no figures, LaTex; v2 minor changes, some extensions; v3\n  minor improvements; v4 some typos corrected", "journal-ref": "Rept.Prog.Phys.73:106001,2010", "doi": "10.1088/0034-4885/73/10/106001", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph hep-th", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pilot-wave theories provide possible solutions to the measurement problem.

When interactions\nbetween the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,\nintriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel\nindependently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the\ntunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the\npresence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on\nthe first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two\ninteracting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that\nfor weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,\nindividual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal\nJosephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms\nlocated on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel\ntogether as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both\nthe atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the\ntunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a\npair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a\nconditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the\npresence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work\nconstitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with\nultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly\ninteracting regime.
