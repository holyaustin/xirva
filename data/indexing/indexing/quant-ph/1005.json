And\nlocal energy densities, obtained from the vacuum expectation value of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, $\\langle T_{00}\\rangle$, typically diverge near\nboundaries. The energy of interaction between distinct rigid bodies of whatever\ntype is finite, corresponding to observable forces and torques between the\nbodies, which can be unambiguously calculated. The self-energy of a body is\nless well-defined, and suffers divergences which may or may not be removable.\nSome examples where a unique total self-stress may be evaluated include the\nperfectly conducting spherical shell first considered by Boyer, a perfectly\nconducting cylindrical shell, and dilute dielectric balls and cylinders. In\nthese cases the finite part is unique, yet there are divergent contributions\nwhich may be subsumed in some sort of renormalization of physical parameters.\nThe divergences that occur in the local energy-momentum tensor near surfaces\nare distinct from the divergences in the total energy, which are often\nassociated with energy located exactly on the surfaces. However, the local\nenergy-momentum tensor couples to gravity, so what is the significance of\ninfinite quantities here?

By replacing the free space of classical\nphysics with the quantum notion of the vacuum, we speculate that the values of\nthe aforementioned constants could arise from the polarization and\nmagnetization of virtual pairs in vacuum. A classical dispersion model with\nparameters determined by quantum and particle physics is employed to estimate\ntheir values. We find the correct orders of magnitude. Additionally, our simple\nassumptions yield an independent estimate for the number of charged elementary\nparticles based on the known values of the permittivity and the permeability,\nand for the volume of a virtual pair. Such interpretation would provide an\nintriguing connection between the celebrated theory of classical\nelectromagnetism and the quantum theory in the weak field limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 May 2010 09:40:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2010 17:29:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Leuchs", "G.", ""], ["Villar", "A.

For example, the position probability\ndistribution becomes increasingly Gaussian, with a concomitant fall in the\nstandard deviation, in the former case, but not in the latter. As another\nexample, each step of the quantum walk on a line may be subjected to an\narbitrary phase gate, without affecting the position probability distribution,\nno matter whether the walk is noiseless or noisy. This symmetry, which is\nabsent in the case of noiseless cyclic walk, but is restored in the presence of\nsufficient noise, serves as an indicator of classicalization, but only in the\ncyclic case. Here we show that the degree of quantum correlations between the\ncoin and position degrees of freedom, quantified by a measure based on the\ndisturbance induced by local measurements (Luo, Phys. Rev. A 77, 022301\n(2008)), provides a suitable measure of classicalization across both type of\nwalks. Applying this measure to compare the two walks, we find that cyclic\nquantum walks tend to classicalize faster than quantum walks on a line because\nof more efficient phase randomization due to the self-interference of the two\ncounter-rotating waves.

First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we\nconsider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle\n$f:[n]\\to[m]$. Here the probability $\\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\\in[m]$ is the\nfraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for\ntesting whether two such distributions are identical or $\\epsilon$-far in\n$L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \\cite{BHH10} showed that if\n$\\PP_f$ and $\\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then\nthis testing can be done in roughly $\\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the\nfunctions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and\nshow that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we\nprove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical\ntesting algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and\nabout $\\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we\nalso reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum\noracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our\nthird example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs\npolynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on\nShor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and\nNewman \\cite{lachish&newman:periodicity}.

This form of the ac-drive is\nespecially relevant to the problem of dynamics of TLS charge defects that cause\ndielectric losses in superconducting qubits. We apply our exact results to\nanalyze non-linear dielectric response of such TLSs and show that the position\nof the resonance peak in the spectrum of the relevant correlation function is\ndetermined by the quantum-mechanical phase accumulated by the TLS wave-function\nover a time evolution cycle. It is shown that in the non-linear regime, this\nresonance frequency may be shifted strongly from the value predicted by the\ncanonical TLS model. We also analyze the \"spin\" survival probability in the\nregime of strong external drive and recover a coherent destruction of tunneling\nphenomenon within our family of exact solutions, which manifests itself as a\nstrong suppression of \"spin-flip\" processes and suggests that such non-linear\ndynamics in LC-resonators may lead to lower losses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 00:16:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Gangopadhyay", "Anirban", ""], ["Dzero", "Maxim", ""], ["Galitski", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0654", "submitter": "Holger F.

Developments in these fields\nnormally assume these resources stable and not susceptible of distortion. That\nis not always the case, Heisenberg interactions between qubits can produce\ndistortion on entangled pairs generated for engineering purposes (e. g. for\nquantum computation or quantum cryptography).

The presence of\nparasite magnetic fields modifies the expected properties and behavior for\nwhich the pair was intended. Quantum measurement and control help to\ndiscriminate the original state in order to correct it or, just to try of\nreconstruct it using some procedures which do not alter their quantum nature.\n  Two different kinds of quantum entangled pairs driven by a Heisenberg\nHamiltonian with an additional inhomogeneous magnetic field which becoming\nself-distorted, can be reconstructed without previous discrimination by adding\nan external magnetic field, with fidelity close to 1 (with respect to the\noriginal state, but without discrimination).

We then add qubit\ncontrol pulses to enable the design of numerically optimized, two-dimensional\ncontrol functions with bounded amplitude, that are capable of decoupling the\nqubit from the dephasing effects of a broad variety of Markovian noise spectral\ndensities during arbitrary one qubit quantum operations. We illustrate the\nmethod with development of numerically optimized control pulse sequences that\nminimize decoherence due to a combination of $1/\\omega$ and constant offset\nnoise sources. Comparison with the performance of standard dynamical decoupling\nprotocols shows that the numerically optimized pulse sequences are considerably\nmore robust with respect to the noise offset, rendering them attractive for\napplication to situations where homogeneous dephasing noise sources are\naccompanied by some extent of heterogeneous dephasing. Application to the\nmitigation of dephasing noise on spin qubits in silicon indicates that high\nfidelity single qubit gates are possible with current pulse generation\ntechnology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2010 23:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "Kevin C.", ""], ["Gorman", "Dylan J", ""], ["Whaley", "K.

In our theory, a\nquasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of\ntunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined\nby the positions of Ohmic contacts. We describe strong coupling of the edge\nstates to Ohmic contacts and the resulting quasi-particle current through the\ninterferometer with the help of a master equation. We find that the coherent\ncontribution to the average quasi-particle current through Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometers does not vanish after summation over quasi-particle degrees of\nfreedom. However, it acquires oscillations with the electronic period, in\nagreement with the Byers-Yang theorem. Importantly, our theory does not rely on\nany ad-hoc constructions, such as Klein factors, etc. When the magnetic flux\nthrough an FP interferometer is varied with a modulation gate, current\noscillations have the quasi-particle periodicity, thus allowing for\nspectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2010 16:31:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 14:39:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Levkivskyi", "Ivan P.", ""], ["Froehlich", "Juerg", ""], ["Sukhorukov", "Eugene V.", ""]]}]
