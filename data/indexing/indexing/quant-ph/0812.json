Thanks to such concentration\nprocedure, the initial entanglement can be probabilistically recovered.\nFurthermore, we analyse the case of sequential linear couplings with many\ndepolarized photons showing that thanks to the concentration a full recovering\nof entanglement is still possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2008 14:00:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Nagali", "Eleonora", ""], ["Sciarrino", "Fabio", ""], ["De Martini", "Francesco", ""], ["Gavenda", "Miroslav", ""], ["Filip", "Radim", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.0941", "submitter": "Laurent Nottale", "authors": "Laurent Nottale", "title": "Generalized quantum potentials in scale relativity", "comments": "33 pages, submitted for publication", "journal-ref": "J.

In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present\noperational interpretations for both types of measures. We also show that the\nEHS fidelity between ensembles provides a novel interpretation of the fidelity\nbetween mixed states--the latter is equal to the maximum of the fidelity\nbetween all pure-state ensembles whose averages are equal to the mixed states\nbeing compared.

This simple model when analyzed properly in\nquantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some\nmisunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. We find that there is spatial\ndependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase\ndifference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together with\nthe interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector\non the other. When two initially entangled detectors are still outside each\nother's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude\ndependent on spatial separation $d$. When the two detectors begin to have\ncausal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement\n(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on\n$d$. The detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree of\nentanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. In the cases with weak\ncoupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.\nFor sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglement\neven if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a little\nlarger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.\nHowever, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for\ninitially separable states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Dec 2008 14:27:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2009 13:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Shih-Yuin", ""], ["Hu", "B.

Specifically, we outline an efficient method to identify the\noptimal strategy for estimating multiple unknown parameters of a quantum\nprocess and apply this method to a realistic example. The example is two\nelectron spin qubits coupled through the dipole and exchange interactions with\nunknown coupling parameters -- explicitly, the position vector relating the two\nqubits and the magnitude of the exchange interaction are unknown. This coupling\nHamiltonian generates a unitary evolution which, when combined with arbitrary\nsingle-qubit operations, produces a universal set of quantum gates. However,\nthe unknown parameters must be known precisely to generate high-fidelity gates.\nWe use the Cram\\'er-Rao bound on the variance of a point estimator to construct\nthe optimal series of experiments to estimate these free parameters, and\npresent a complete analysis of the optimal experimental configuration. Our\nmethod of transforming the constrained optimal parameter estimation problem\ninto a convex optimization is powerful and widely applicable to other systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2008 01:30:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2009 22:06:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 20:40:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "Kevin C.", ""], ["Sarovar", "Mohan", ""], ["Kosut", "Robert", ""], ["Whaley", "K.

The first topic concerns weak measurements and their\nuniversality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that\nevery generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak\n(infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result\nto the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions\nfor entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement\nmonotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance\nof different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics.\nThe system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction.\nThe fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian\nnoise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian\ndynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement\nfor a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The\nfifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under\ncontinuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and\nthe system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the\nrobustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure\nof fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that\noperator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for\nrestriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns\nholonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes.

The\nKerr twistor structure turns out to be adjoined to the Kerr complex string\nsource, forming a natural twistor-string construction similar to the\nNair-Witten twistor-string. We show that twistor polarization of the\nKerr-Newman solution may be matched with the {\\it massless} solutions of the\nDirac equation, providing consistency of the Dirac-Kerr model of spinning\nparticle (electron).

Indeed, if\nthe receiver only possesses a bounded-size quantum token of the sender's\nreference frame, then the decoding is imperfect, and we can describe this\neffect as a noisy quantum channel. We seek here to characterize the performance\nof such schemes, or equivalently, to determine the effective decoherence\ninduced by having a bounded-size reference frame. We assume that the token is\nprepared in a special state that has particularly nice group-theoretic\nproperties and that is near-optimal for transmitting information about the\nsender's frame. We present a decoding operation, which can be proven to be\nnear-optimal in this case, and we demonstrate that there are two distinct ways\nof implementing it (corresponding to two distinct Kraus decompositions). In\none, the receiver measures the orientation of the reference frame token and\nreorients the system appropriately. In the other, the receiver extracts the\nencoded information from the virtual subsystems that describe the relational\ndegrees of freedom of the system and token. Finally, we provide explicit\ncharacterizations of these decoding schemes when the system is a single qubit\nand for three standard kinds of reference frame: a phase reference, a Cartesian\nframe (representing an orthogonal triad of spatial directions), and a reference\ndirection (representing a single spatial direction).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 09:29:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2009 01:24:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bartlett", "Stephen D.", ""], ["Rudolph", "Terry", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""], ["Turner", "Peter S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.5042", "submitter": "Pulak Ranjan Giri", "authors": "Pulak Ranjan Giri, T.
