In particular, I\nargue that the physical explanation for quantum speedup is precisely the fact\nthat the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum computer to fully\nexploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for\nclassical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as\nproduct states.\n  Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate\nphysical explanations for quantum speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue\nthat unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics it does not\nhave the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred basis\nobjection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can\nserve as a good description of the physical process which takes place in\nso-called network-based computation, but that it is incompatible with other\nmodels of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,\nin Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of\nquantum speedup: quantum entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can\nbe said to be a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup, and\nI consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim. I argue that\nneither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup,\nand that, on the contrary, we should conclude that it is.

The\nfirst theory is the so-called Thermal Wave Model (TWM) that interprets the\nparaxial thermal spreading of the beam particles as the analog of the quantum\ndiffraction. The other theory, hereafter called Quantum Wave Model (QWM), that\ntakes into account the individual quantum nature of the single beam particle\n(uncertainty principle and spin) and provides the collective description of the\nbeam transport in the presence of the quantum paraxial diffraction. QWM can be\napplied to beams that are sufficiently cold to allow the particles to manifest\ntheir individual quantum nature but sufficiently warm to make overlapping-less\nthe single-particle wave functions. In both theories, the propagation of the\nbeam transport in plasmas or in vacuo is provided by fully similar set of\nnonlinear and nonlocal governing equations, where in the case of TWM the\nCompton wavelength (fundamental emittance) is replaced by the beam thermal\nemittance. In both models, the beam transport in the presence of the\nself-fields (space charge and inductive effects) is governed by a suitable\nnonlinear nonlocal 2D Schroedinger equation that is used to obtain the envelope\nbeam equation in quantum and quantum-like regimes, respectively. An envelope\nequation is derived for both TWM and QWM regimes. In TWM we recover the well\nknown Sacherer equation whilst, in QWM we obtain the evolution equation of the\nsingle-particle spot size, i.e., single quantum ray spot in the transverse\nplane (Compton regime).

In particular, we study how to use quantum key distribution\n(QKD) in common optical network infrastructures and propose a method to\novercome its distance limitations. QKD is the first technology offering\ninformation theoretic secret-key distribution that relies only on the\nfundamental principles of quantum physics. Point-to-point QKD devices have\nreached a mature industrial state; however, these devices are severely limited\nin distance, since signals at the quantum level (e.g. single photons) are\nhighly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate\ndevices. To overcome this limitation, intermediate nodes (i.e. repeaters) are\nused. Both, quantum-regime and trusted, classical, repeaters have been proposed\nin the QKD literature, but only the latter can be implemented in practice. As a\nnovelty, we propose here a new QKD network model based on the use of not fully\ntrusted intermediate nodes, referred as weakly trusted repeaters. This approach\nforces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the\nexchanged key, thus improving significantly the security of the network. We\nformalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow\nusers to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only\npassive components. Moreover, the theoretical framework allows to extend these\nscenarios not only to accommodate more complex trust constraints, but also to\nconsider robustness and resiliency constraints on the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 10:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Elkouss", "David", ""], ["Martinez-Mateo", "Jesus", ""], ["Ciurana", "Alex", ""], ["Martin", "Vicente", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.4059", "submitter": "Matthew Woolley", "authors": "M.

In this theoretical work, we jointly address these two\nproblems by (1) proposing an experimentally accessible quantum simulation of\nthe ABH phase transition in an array of tunably coupled superconducting circuit\nmicrowave resonators and (2) incorporating the simulation into a highly\nscalable protocol that takes as input any microwave resonator state with\nnegligible occupation of number states |0> and |1> and nonlocally superposes it\nacross the whole array of resonators. The large-scale multipartite entanglement\nproduced by the protocol is of the W-type, which is well-known for its\nrobustness. The protocol utilizes the ABH phase transition to generate the\nmultipartite entanglement of all of the resonators in parallel, and is\ntherefore deterministic and permits an increase in resonator number without\nincrease in protocol complexity; the number of resonators is limited instead by\nsystem characteristics such as resonator frequency disorder and inter-resonator\ncoupling strength. Only one local and two global controls are required for the\nprotocol.

For the purpose of examining the\nmicroscopic loss mechanisms in dielectrics, precise measurements of the\ninternal quality factor at different values of energy stored in the resonators\nare required. Here, we present a consistent method to analyze a LC\nsuperconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line. We first derive an\napproximate expression for the transmission S-parameter $S_{21}$ based on a\ncomplete circuit model. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the internal\nquality factor is reliably determined by fitting the approximate form of\n$S_{21}$. Since the voltage $V$ of the capacitor of the LC circuit is required\nto determine the energy stored in the resonator, we next calculate the relation\nbetween $V$ and the forward propagating wave voltage $V_{in}^+$. Due to the\ndependence of the quality factor on voltage, $V$ is not simply proportional to\n$V_{in}^+$. We find a self-consistent way to determine the relation between $V$\nand $V_{in}^+$, which employs only the fitting parameters for $S_{21}$ and a\nlinear scaling factor. We then examine the resonator transmission in the cases\nof port reflection and impedance mismatch. We find that resonator transmission\nasymmetry is primarily due to the reflection from discontinuity in transmission\nlines. We show that our analysis method to extract the internal quality factor\nis robust in the non-ideal cases above. Finally, we show that the analysis\nmethod on LC resonator can be generalize to arbitrary weakly coupled lumped and\ndistributed resonators. The generalization uses a systematic approximation on\nthe response function based on the pole and zero which are the closest to the\nresonance frequency.

Here we show that there is, within the Shabani-Lidar\nframework, no scope for any distinguished role for quantum discord in respect\nof complete positivity of reduced dynamics. Since most applications of quantum\ntheory to real systems rests on the traditional scheme, its robustness\ndemonstrated here could be of far-reaching significance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 15:17:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sabapathy", "Krishna Kumar", ""], ["Ivan", "J.

In doing\nso we demonstrate that these measurements allow us to implement a quantum\neraser, and a which-way measurement of the path taken by the neutron through\nthe interferometer. While strong phase noise removes the quantum eraser, the\nspin-filtered which-way measurement is robust to phase noise. We experimentally\ndemonstrate this disturbance by comparing the contrasts of the output beam with\nand without spin measurements of three neutron interferometers with varying\nnoise strengths. This demonstrates that even in the presence of noise that\nsuppresses path coherence and spin-path entanglement, a neutron interferometer\nstill exhibits uniquely quantum behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 15:27:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Jun 2013 00:26:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 20:28:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wood", "Christopher J.", ""], ["Cory", "David G.", ""], ["Abutaleb", "Mohamed O.", ""], ["Huber", "Michael G.", ""], ["Arif", "Muhammad", ""], ["Pushin", "Dmitry A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.6951", "submitter": "Gabriel Gasse", "authors": "Gabriel Gasse, Lafe Spietz, Christian Lupien and Bertrand Reulet", "title": "Observation of Quantum Oscillations in the Photo-assisted Shot Noise of\n  a Tunnel Junction", "comments": "3 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.88.241402", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report measurements of the low frequency current fluctuations of a tunnel\njunction placed at very low temperature biased by a time-dependent voltage\n$V(t)=V(1+\\cos 2\\pi\\nu t)$.

This emerging field is\nushered in by several categories of definitive experiments in\nsuperconductivity, electromechanical systems, Bose-Einstein condensates and\nothers. Yet this new field which is rich in open issues at the foundation of\nquantum and statistical physics remains little explored theoretically [1].

Three major themes discussed in three intended essays\nare the large N expansion [2], the correlation hierarchy [3] and quantum\nentanglement [4]. We give a sketch of the first two themes and then discuss\nseveral key issues in the consideration of macro and quantum, namely, a)\nrecognition that in a composite body there exist many 'levels of structure'\ncharacterized by collective variables. The quantum features of a macroscopic\nobject can be captured by understanding how these collective variables\nfunction; b) 'quantum entanglement', an exclusively quantum feature [5], is\nknown to persist to high temperatures [6] and large scales [7] under certain\nconditions, and may actually decrease with increased connectivity in a quantum\nnetwork [8]. Here we use entanglement as a measure of quantumness and pick out\nthese somewhat counter-intuitive examples to show that there are blind spots\nworthy of our attention and issues which we need to analyze closer.

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic\nmechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models\ndescribing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main\nfocus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent\noperation.
