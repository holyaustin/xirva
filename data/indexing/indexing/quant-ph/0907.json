Measurements whose statistics have high-frequency\nfringes, such as those obtained from NOON states, have commensurately high\ninformation yield. However this information is also highly ambiguous because it\ndoes not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes. We\nprovide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly efficient way,\nproviding phase estimates with uncertainty that is within a small constant\nfactor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum allowed by the laws of quantum\nmechanics. These techniques apply to NOON state and multi-pass interferometry,\nas well as phase measurements in quantum computing. We have reported the\nexperimental implementation of some of these schemes with multi-pass\ninterferometry elsewhere. Here we present the theoretical foundation, and also\npresent some new experimental results. There are three key innovations to the\ntheory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase properties of the\nsequence of states (in multiple time modes) via the equivalent two-mode state.\nSecond, we identify the key feature of the equivalent state that enables the\noptimal scaling of the intrinsic phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables\nus to identify appropriate combinations of states to use. The remaining\ndifficulty is that the ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinic phase\nuncertainty are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to\nsolve this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate\nthe optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 20:53:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 20:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Berry", "D.

A physical system, that is in an entangled state\ndisplays an intricate correlation between its subsystems.

It is generally claimed, often without a rigorous proof\nto support, that these intricate correlations of an entangled state cannot\noccur in a classical system.

Dynamics of population inversion\nand atom-field entanglement are studied taking the initial state of the field\nto be either a coherent state or a squeezed vacuum. Analysis is extended to the\ncase of a two-mode cavity field interacting with a two-level atom. For the\ntwo-mode case, the initial field is a pair coherent state or a two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum. Effects due to nonlinearity, intensity-dependent interaction\nand detuning on the dynamics are discussed and compared with those of the\nsingle-mode case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2009 06:50:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "A B M", ""], ["Sivakumar", "S", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.3018", "submitter": "Klaus Hornberger", "authors": "Klaus Hornberger, Bassano Vacchini", "title": "Comment on \"Quantum linear Boltzmann equation with finite intercollision\n  time\"", "comments": "3 pages; v3: corresponds to published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Lett. 102, 057202 (2009)]\ndemonstrated that the classical simulation of the dynamics of open 1D quantum\nsystems with matrix product algorithms can often be dramatically improved by\nperforming time evolution in the Heisenberg picture. For a closed system this\nwas exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the\ntime-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix\ndimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be\nsignificantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain\nsubjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear\nin the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the\ntime-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product\noperators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a\ncoherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product\nalgorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open\nquantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.\nWe present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might\nbe for the more detailed study of open system dynamics.
