Reasons for seeking to interpret quantum mechanics are\ndiscussed, then the specific `neo-Everettian' theory is introduced and its\nclaim as the best available interpretation defended. The main objections to the\ninterpretation, including the so-called ``problem of probability'' are shown to\nfail. The local nature of the interpretation is demonstrated, and the\nimplications of this both for the interpretation and for quantum mechanics more\ngenerally are discussed.

To\ninvestigate whether the so-called \"stability island\" could really exist around\nthe above Z, N values, the $\\alpha$-decay half lives along with the spontaneous\nfission and $\\beta$-decay half lives of such nuclei are studied.

Each phase\npattern is uniquely addressed by optical Raman processes with classical optical\nfields, while one- and two-qubit gates are accomplished by selectively\ntransferring the individual qubit states to a stripline microwave cavity field\nand a Cooper pair box where controllable two-level unitary dynamics is governed\nby classical microwave fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 14:46:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jul 2008 12:58:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tordrup", "Karl", ""], ["Negretti", "Antonio", ""], ["Molmer", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4441", "submitter": "Qiang Zhang", "authors": "Qiang Zhang, Hiroki Takesue, Carsten Langrock, Xiuping Xie, M.
