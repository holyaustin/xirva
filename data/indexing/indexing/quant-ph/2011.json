Traditional RB, however, is restricted to\ngatesets, such as the Clifford group, that form a unitary 2-design. The\nrecently introduced character RB can benchmark more general gates using\ntechniques from representation theory; up to now, however, this method has only\nbeen applied to \"multiplicity-free\" groups, a mathematical restriction on these\ngroups. In this paper, we extend the original character RB derivation to\nexplicitly treat non-multiplicity-free groups, and derive several applications.\nFirst, we derive a rigorous version of the recently introduced subspace RB,\nwhich seeks to characterize a set of one- and two-qubit gates that are\nsymmetric under SWAP. Second, we develop a new leakage RB protocol that applies\nto more general groups of gates. Finally, we derive a scalable RB protocol for\nthe matchgate group, a group that like the Clifford group is non-universal but\nbecomes universal with the addition of one additional gate. This example\nprovides one of the few examples of a scalable non-Clifford RB protocol. In all\nthree cases, compared to existing theories, our method requires similar\nresources, but either provides a more accurate estimate of gate fidelity, or\napplies to a more general group of gates. In conclusion, we discuss the\npotential, and challenges, of using non-multiplicity-free character RB to\ndevelop new classes of scalable RB protocols and methods of characterizing\nspecific gates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2021 19:56:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Claes", "Jahan", ""], ["Rieffel", "Eleanor", ""], ["Wang", "Zhihui", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00027", "submitter": "David Sutter", "authors": "Amira Abbas, David Sutter, Christa Zoufal, Aur\\'elien Lucchi, Alessio\n  Figalli, Stefan Woerner", "title": "The power of quantum neural networks", "comments": "25 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Nat Comput Sci 1, 403-409 (2021)", "doi": "10.1038/s43588-021-00084-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fault-tolerant quantum computers offer the promise of dramatically improving\nmachine learning through speed-ups in computation or improved model\nscalability.

As is well-known in\nany precise quantum measurement the competition between the shot noise (SN) and\nthe backaction noise of measurement executes a limitation on the measurement\nprecision which is the so-called standard quantum limit (SQL). In the case\nwhere the intensity of the signal is even lower than the SQL, one needs to\nperform an ultra precision quantum sensing to beat the SQL. For this purpose,\nwe review three important methods for surpassing the SQL in a hybrid OMS: (i)\nthe backaction evading measurement of a quantum nondemolition (QND) variable of\nthe system, (ii) the coherent quantum backaction noise cancellation (CQNC), and\n(iii) the so-called parametric sensing, the simultaneous signal amplification\nand added noise suppression below the SQL.

These constructions explain numerical results\nshowing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be\ncompetitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems.\nWe then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous\nquantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime.

In this Thesis, we study some\nexotic properties which arise in this regime. In particular, we are interested\nin the possibility to engineer quantum phase transitions in these systems. One\ndirection we explore is the study of two-photon coupling, a mechanism in which\nmatter creates or absorb photons by pairs. This mechanism creates a rich phase\ndiagram containing both phase transitions and instabilities. A second topic is\nthe use of these transitions for sensing applications. Indeed, near the\ncritical point, the system becomes extremely sensitive to external\nperturbations. We study a setup in which a single qubit is coupled to a bosonic\nfield. We show that even this finite-size system displays a phase transition,\nwhich can be used to measure the frequency of the qubit and the field with\nimproved accuracy.

In the coherent, phase-locked\nregime, an imbalanced photon number population appears if there is a phase\ndifference between the nanolasers, which appears in the steady-state as a\nresult of the competition between competing local dissipative dynamics and the\nJosephson photo-current.

A multitude of experimental observations suggest that chemical\nproperties can be fundamentally altered and novel physical states appear when\nmatter is strongly coupled to resonant cavity modes, i.e. when hybrid\nlight-matter states emerge. Up until now, theoretical approaches to explain and\npredict these observations were either limited to phenomenological quantum\noptical models, suited to describe collective polaritonic effects, or\nalternatively to ab initio approaches for small system sizes. The later methods\nwere particularly controversial since collective effects could not be\nexplicitly included due to the intrinsically low particle numbers, which are\ncomputationally accessible. Here, we demonstrate for a nitrogen dimer chain of\nvariable size that any impurity present in a collectively coupled chemical\nensemble (e.g. temperature fluctuations or reaction process) induces local\nmodifications in the polaritonic system. From this we deduce that a novel dark\nstate is formed, whose local chemical properties are modified considerably at\nthe impurity due to the collectively coupled environment. Our simulations unify\ntheoretical predictions from quantum optical models (e.g. formation of\ncollective dark states and different polaritonic branches) with the single\nmolecule quantum chemical perspective, which relies on the (quantized)\nredistribution of local charges.

Furthermore, up to logarithmic factors, this matches the\nscaling of the most efficient prior block encodings that can only work with\northogonal basis functions diagonalizing the Coloumb operator (e.g., the plane\nwave dual basis). Our key insight is to factorize the Hamiltonian using a\nmethod known as tensor hypercontraction (THC) and then to transform the Coulomb\noperator into an isospectral diagonal form with a non-orthogonal basis defined\nby the THC factors. We then use qubitization to simulate the non-orthogonal THC\nHamiltonian, in a fashion that avoids most complications of the non-orthogonal\nbasis. We also reanalyze and reduce the cost of several of the best prior\nalgorithms for these simulations in order to facilitate a clear comparison to\nthe present work. In addition to having lower asymptotic scaling spacetime\nvolume, compilation of our algorithm for challenging finite-sized molecules\nsuch as FeMoCo reveals that our method requires the least fault-tolerant\nresources of any known approach. By laying out and optimizing the surface code\nresources required of our approach we show that FeMoCo can be simulated using\nabout four million physical qubits and under four days of runtime, assuming\n$1\\,${\\textmu}s cycle times and physical gate error rates no worse than\n$0.1\\%$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:03:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:17:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Joonho", ""], ["Berry", "Dominic W.", ""], ["Gidney", "Craig", ""], ["Huggins", "William J.", ""], ["McClean", "Jarrod R.", ""], ["Wiebe", "Nathan", ""], ["Babbush", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.03504", "submitter": "Roie Dann", "authors": "Roie Dann and Ronnie Kosloff", "title": "Open system dynamics from thermodynamic compatibility", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

In the present article, I intend to recall the main aspects of his\nwork related to Wigner $3j$ symbols. It is well known that the latter can be\nexpressed with a hypergeometric series. The polynomial zeros of the $3j$\ncoefficients were initially characterized by the number of terms of the series\nminus one, which is the degree of the coefficient. A detailed study of the\nzeros of the $3j$ coefficient with respect to the degree $n$ for $J = a + b + c\n\\leq 240$ ($a$, $b$ and $c$ being the angular momenta in the first line of the\n$3j$ symbol) by Raynal revealed that most zeros of high degree had small\nmagnetic quantum numbers. This led him to define the order $m$ to improve the\nclassification of the zeros of the $3j$ coefficient. Raynal did a search for\nthe polynomial zeros of degree 1 to 7 and found that the number of zeros of\ndegree 1 and 2 are infinite, though the number of zeros of degree larger than 3\ndecreases very quickly as the degree increases. Based on Whipple's\ntransformations of hypergeometric $_3F_2$ functions with unit argument, Raynal\ngeneralized the Wigner $3j$ symbols to any arguments and pointed out that there\nare twelve sets of ten formulas (twelve sets of 120 generalized $3j$ symbols)\nwhich are equivalent in the usual case.

Here we tackle this gap and demonstrate how\nitinerant microwave photons can be efficiently and continuously converted to\nelectrical current in a high-quality, semiconducting nanowire double quantum\ndot that is resonantly coupled to a cavity. In particular, in our detection\nscheme, an absorbed photon gives rise to a single electron tunneling event\nthrough the double dot, with a conversion efficiency reaching 6 %. Our results\npave the way for photodiodes with single-shot microwave photon detection, at\nthe theoretically predicted unit efficiency [4].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2020 12:36:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Waqar", ""], ["Potts", "Patrick P.", ""], ["Lehmann", "Sebastian", ""], ["Thelander", "Claes", ""], ["Dick", "Kimberly A.", ""], ["Samuelsson", "Peter", ""], ["Maisi", "Ville F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.05743", "submitter": "Sergio Giardino", "authors": "Sergio Giardino", "title": "Quaternionic elastic scattering", "comments": "Accept by Europhysics Letters", "journal-ref": "2020 EPL 132 50010", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/132/50010", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the elastic scattering of quantum particles based on a real Hilbert\nspace approach to quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\\mathbbm H$QM) and derive\nexpression for the wave function, the phase shifts, as well as the optical\ntheorem for the case of a hard sphere scattering potential.

The saturation of the string-space information\nentropy is accompanied by the vanishing of OTOCs. Together these signal\nirreversibility and chaos, which we take to be the defining properties of good\nclassical ciphers. More precisely, we define a good cipher by requiring that\nthe saturation of the entropy and the vanishing of OTOCs occurs to\nsuper-polynomial precision, implying that the cipher cannot be distinguished\nfrom a pseudorandom permutation with a polynomial number of queries.

The beauty of these states is that these states can be\nused to establish quantum supremacy. Earlier, a considerable amount of works\nhas been reported on various types of quantum states and their nonclassical\nproperties. Here, complementing the earlier works, the effect of\nnon-Gaussianity inducing operators on the nonclassical and phase properties of\ndisplaced Fock states have been studied. This thesis includes 6 chapters. In\nChapter 1, motivation behind performing the present work is stated explicitly,\nalso the basic concepts of quantum optics are discussed with a specific\nattention on the witnesses and measures of nonclassicality. In Chapter 2,\nnonclassical properties of photon added and subtracted displaced Fock states\nhave been studied using various witnesses of lower- and higher-order\nnonclassicality which are introduced in Chapter 1. In Chapter 3, we have\ncontinued our investigation on photon added and subtracted displaced Fock\nstates (and their limiting cases). In this chapter, quantum phase properties of\nthese states are investigated from a number of perspectives, and it is shown\nthat the quantum phase properties are dependent on the quantum state\nengineering operations performed. In Chapter 4, we have continued our\ninvestigation on the impact of non-Gaussianity inducing operators on the\nnonclassical and phase properties of the displaced Fock states. In Chapter 5,\nwe have performed a comparison between to process that are used in quantum\nstate engineering to induce nonclassical features. Finally, this thesis is\nconcluded in Chapter 6, where we have summarized the findings of this thesis\nand have also described scope of the future works.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2020 12:01:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Malpani", "Priya", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.09814", "submitter": "Tomoya Hayata", "authors": "Tomoya Hayata, Yoshimasa Hidaka", "title": "Thermalization of Yang-Mills theory in a $(3+1)$ dimensional small\n  lattice system", "comments": "10 pages, 8 figures; (v2) version accepted for publication in PRD", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The first contribution comes from a noncontextual\napproximation to the Hamiltonian, and is computed classically. The second\ncontribution is obtained by using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)\ntechnique to compute a contextual correction on a quantum processor. In general\nthe VQE computation of the contextual correction uses fewer qubits and\nmeasurements than the VQE computation of the original problem. Varying the\nnumber of qubits used for the contextual correction adjusts the quality of the\napproximation. We simulate CS-VQE on tapered Hamiltonians for small molecules,\nand find that the number of qubits required to reach chemical accuracy can be\nreduced by more than a factor of two. The number of terms required to compute\nthe contextual correction can be reduced by more than a factor of ten, without\nthe use of other measurement reduction schemes.

One of the important aspects of our analysis\nconsists in utilizing the operators and the vacuum of interacting theory in\nconstructing the states, without invoking asymptotic particles. Focusing on a\ncoherent state describing a spatially homogeneous field configuration, it is\ndemonstrated that both adopted methods successfully account for nonlinear\nclassical dynamics, giving distinguishable quantum effects. In particular,\naccording to the time-expansion analysis the initial field-acceleration, with\nwhich the field departs from its initial expectation value, is governed by the\ntree-level potential with renormalized mass and bare coupling constant. The\ninteraction-picture computation, instead, can be manipulated to give the\nnonlinear dynamics, determined in terms of renormalized coupling and mass.\nHowever, it results in a logarithmic initial-time singularity in the\nfield-acceleration, reminiscent of the similar behaviour encountered within\nsemi-classical formalism, for certain choices of the initial state for\nfluctuations.

The shift, sometimes called collective Lamb\nshift, results from resonant dipole-dipole interaction mediated by real and\nvirtual photon exchange, forming many-body states displaying various super- and\nsubradiant spectral behavior. The scattering spectrum reflects the overall\nradiative behavior from these states. However, it also averages out the\nradiative details associated with a single collective state, causing ambiguity\nin explaining the origin of the spectral shift and raising controversy on its\nscaling property. We employ a Monte-Carlo simulation to study how the\ncollective states are occupied and contribute to emission. We thus distinguish\ntwo kinds of collective shift that follow different scaling laws. One results\nfrom dominant occupation of the near-resonant collective states. This shift is\nusually small and insensitive to the density or the number of participating\natoms. The other comes from large spatial correlation of dipoles, associated\nwith the states of higher degree of emission. This corresponds to larger\ncollective shift that is approximately linearly dependent on the optical depth.\nOur analysis provides not only a novel perspective for the spectral features in\ncollective scattering, but also a possible resolution to the controversy on the\nscaling property that has been reported elsewhere because of different origins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 09:20:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hsu", "Ting", ""], ["Lin", "Kuan-Ting", ""], ["Lin", "Guin-Dar", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.14635", "submitter": "Joshua Mornhinweg", "authors": "J.

In particular, the sensitivity of the best optomechanical devices has\nreached the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which directly follows from the\nHeisenberg uncertainty relation and corresponds to balancing the measurement\nimprecision and the perturbation of the probe by the quantum back action of the\nmeter. The SQL is not truly fundamental and several methods for its overcoming\nhave been proposed and demonstrated. At the same time, two quantum sensitivity\nconstraints which are more fundamental are known. The first limit arises from\nthe finiteness of the probing strength (in the case of optical interferometers\n- of the circulating optical power) and is known as the Energetic Quantum Limit\nor, in a more general context, as the Quantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao Bound (QCRB). The\nsecond limit arises from the dissipative dynamics of the probe, which prevents\nfull efficacy of the quantum back action evasion techniques developed for\novercoming the SQL. No particular name has been assigned to this limit; we\npropose the term Dissipative Quantum Limit (DQL) for it. Here we develop a\nunified theory of these two fundamental limits by deriving the general\nsensitivity constraint from which they follow as particular cases. Our analysis\nreveals a phase transition occurring at the boundary between the QCRB-dominated\nand the DQL regimes, manifested by the discontinuous derivatives of the optimal\nspectral densities of the meter field quantum noise. This leads to the\ncounter-intuitive (but favorable) finding that quantum-limited sensitivity can\nbe achieved with certain lossy meter systems.

A theory able to compute from\nfirst principles these properties, accounting for the anharmonicity and quantum\nfluctuations in the nuclear energy landscape that can be implemented in systems\nwith hundreds of atoms is missing. Here, we derive an approximate theory for\nthe quantum time evolution of lattice vibrations at finite temperature. This\ntheory introduces the time dynamics in the Self-Consistent Harmonic\nApproximation (SCHA) and shares with the static case the same computational\ncost. It is nonempirical, as pure states evolve according to the Dirac least\naction principle and the dynamics of the thermal ensemble conserves both energy\nand entropy. The static SCHA is recovered as a stationary solution of the\ndynamical equations. We apply perturbation theory around the static SCHA\nsolution and derive an algorithm to compute efficiently quantum dynamical\nresponse functions. Thanks to this new algorithm, we have access to the\nresponse function of any general external time-dependent perturbation, enabling\nthe simulation of phonon spectra without following any perturbative expansion\nof the nuclear potential or empirical methods. We benchmark the algorithm on\nthe IR and Raman spectroscopy of high-pressure hydrogen phase III, with a\nsimulation cell of 96 atoms. Our work also explores the nonlinear regime of the\ndynamical nuclear motion, providing a paradigm to simulate the interaction with\nintense or multiple probes, as in pump-probe spectroscopy, or chemical\nreactions involving light atoms, as the proton transfer in biomolecules\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 16:56:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2020 11:44:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2021 19:43:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Monacelli", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Mauri", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.15011", "submitter": "Carlos Handy", "authors": "Carlos R.

The\nsituation where the absorption is fully canceled, and the atom thus has been\nturned completely transparent, has been coined electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT). The characteristics of EIT is a narrow transparency window\nassociated with a fluorescence quench at its center frequency, indicating that\ninelastic scattering at this particular point is suppressed. The emergence of\nEIT-like transparency windows is common in waveguide quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) when multiple closely spaced quantum emitters are coupled to a waveguide.\nThe transparency depends on the separation and energy detuning of the atoms. In\nthis work, we study a number of different setups with two-level atoms in\nwaveguide QED that all exhibit EIT-like transparency windows. Unlike the case\nof a genuine three-level atom, no drive fields are required in the systems we\nconsider, and the coherent coupling of energy levels is mediated by the\nwaveguide. We specifically distinguish between systems with genuine EIT-like\ndynamics and those that exhibit a transparency window but lack the fluorescence\nquench.
