A parameterization of the control\nfunctions based on B-splines with built-in carrier waves is also introduced.\nThe carrier waves are used to specify the frequency spectra of the control\nfunctions, while the B-spline functions specify their envelope and phase. This\napproach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and\nsignificantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating\nSchrodinger's equation. We consider Hamiltonians that model the dynamics of a\nsuperconducting multi-level qudit and present numerical examples of how the\nproposed technique can be combined with the interior point L-BFGS algorithm\nfrom the IPOPT package for realizing quantum gates. In a set of test cases, the\nproposed algorithm is shown to compare favorably with QuTiP/pulse_optim and\nGrape-Tensorflow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jan 2020 00:02:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:27:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Petersson", "N.

On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler\nimproves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the\nIBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in\npractice.\n  In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently\ndriven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling\nnearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to\nperformance.

The principle\nis to decompose the evolution of a quantum system into two wave functions: an\nexternal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its center of mass and\nan internal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its internal\nvariables in the center-of-mass system. Mathematical decomposition is only\npossible in certain cases because there are many interactions linking these two\nparts. In addition, these two wave functions will have different meanings and\ninterpretations. The external wave function \"pilots\" the center of mass of the\nquantum system: it corresponds to the Broglie pilot wave. When the Planck\nconstant tends to zero, it results mathematically from the convergence of the\nsquare of the module and the phase of the external wave function to a density\nand a classical action verifying the Hamilton-Jacobi statistical equations.\nThis interpretation explains all the measurement results, namely those yielded\nby interference, spin measurement (Stern and Gerlach) and non-locality (EPR-B)\nexperiments. For the internal wave function, several interpretations are\npossible : the one of the pilot wave can be applied in cascade to the internal\nwave function. However, the interpretation proposed by Erwin Schr{\\\"o}dinger at\nthe Solvay Congress in 1927 and restricted to the internal wave function is\nalso possible. For Schr{\\\"o}dinger, the particles are extended and the square\nof the module of the (internal) wave function of an electron corresponds to the\ndensity of its charge in space. We present many arguments in favour of this\ninterpretation, which like the pilot wave interpretation is realistic and\ndeterministic. Finally, we will see that this double interpretation serves as a\nframe of reference by which to better understand the debates on the\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and to review the relationships between\ngravity and quantum mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:41:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Gondran", "Michel", "", "AEIS"], ["Gondran", "Alexandre", "", "ENAC"]]}, {"id": "2001.04814", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Bruno Chagas (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais), Renato Portugal\n  (National Laboratory of Scientific Computing - LNCC)", "title": "Discrete-Time Quantum Walks on Oriented Graphs", "comments": "In Proceedings QSQW 2020, arXiv:2004.01061", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 315, 2020, pp. 26-37", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.315.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The interest in quantum walks has been steadily increasing during the last\ntwo decades.

The striking feature of this emergent\nLuttinger liquid is its quasi-particle charge (or Luttinger parameter $K$)\nwhich acquires a fractal dependence on the XXZ chain anisotropy parameter\n$\\Delta$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 18:07:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Collura", "Mario", ""], ["De Luca", "Andrea", ""], ["Calabrese", "Pasquale", ""], ["Dubail", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04955", "submitter": "Joshua Feinberg", "authors": "F.

Then the Quantum Fourier Transform is\nalso studied with Mermin polynomials. A different optimal Mermin operator is\nsearched at each execution step, since in this case there is no single\ndirection of evolution. The results for the Quantum Fourier Transform are\ncompared to results from a previous study of entanglement with Cayley\nhyperdeterminant.

Based on this technology, a future GPS\nemploying portable SBS clocks offers the potential for distance measurements\nwith a 100-fold increase in resolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 15:54:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Loh", "William", ""], ["Stuart", "Jules", ""], ["Reens", "David", ""], ["Bruzewicz", "Colin D.", ""], ["Braje", "Danielle", ""], ["Chiaverini", "John", ""], ["Juodawlkis", "Paul W.", ""], ["Sage", "Jeremy M.", ""], ["McConnell", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.06442", "submitter": "Dmitry Chistikov", "authors": "Dmitry Chistikov, Olga Goulko, Adrian Kent, Mike Paterson", "title": "Globe-hopping", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc.

Conversely, versatile cryptography allows the user to\nswitch the cryptographic task without requiring any knowledge of its inner\nworkings. In this paper, we suggest how these related principles can be applied\nto the field of quantum cryptography by explicitly demonstrating two quantum\ncryptographic protocols, quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret\nsharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform. Crucially,\nthe protocols differ only in their classical post-processing. The system is\nalso suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with\ndeployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature\nphase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first\ntime, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver,\nenhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are\ninherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a\nplayer internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external)\neavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed.

This\ncarbon-hydrogen structure is present in a polycrystalline adamantane, which was\nused in our experimental setup. The required interaction engineering is\nachieved by applying a specific sequence of radio-frequency pulses using\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), while the temperature of the bath can be\ncontrolled by appropriate preparation of the initial hydrogen nuclear spin\nstate, being the predicted results in very good agreement with the experimental\ndata.

Some of them are intrinsic to the materials employed (the absolute\nvalue of the Hall conductivity of the WSM, the Verdet constant of the Faraday\nmaterial), while some of them can be manipulated externally even for a fixed\nsample, such as the external magnetic field and the orientation of the plates\nwhich determines the sign of their conductivity. Suitable combinations of these\nparameters can be used to switch from attraction to repulsion, and to place the\ntrapping distance, in which no force acts on the plates, at any desired\ndistance between them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:08:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Farias", "M.

In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A\n73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovian\nmaster equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despite\napparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations are\nroutinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs is\nlikely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulations\nof two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtain\nquantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian master\nequations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, we\nfind that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Master\nequations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies and\nbandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transition\nfrequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as large\nas the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does not\noverlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accurate\ndescriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomic\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 03:12:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["McCauley", "Gavin", ""], ["Cruikshank", "Benjamin", ""], ["Santra", "Siddhartha", ""], ["Jacobs", "Kurt", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11166", "submitter": "Vagharsh Mkhitaryan", "authors": "V.

Here we provide such a test using quantum\nannealing. Specifically, we report on extensive experimental tests of\ntopological defect formation via the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising\nmodel on two different D-Wave quantum annealing devices. We find that the\nquantum simulator results can indeed be explained by the KZM for open-system\nquantum dynamics with phase-flip errors, with certain quantitative deviations\nfrom the theory likely caused by factors such as random control errors and\ntransient effects. In addition, we probe physics beyond the KZM by identifying\nsignatures of universality in the distribution and cumulants of the number of\nkinks and their decay, and again find agreement with the quantum simulator\nresults. This implies that the theoretical predictions of the generalized KZM\ntheory, which assumes isolation from the environment, applies beyond its\noriginal scope to an open system. We support this result by extensive numerical\ncomputations.

We validate the expression against the Mie theory for a nano-sphere of\nradius comparable to the plasma wavelength. Eventually, we investigate the\ndecay rate and the frequency shift of the plasmon modes in isolated and\ninteracting nanoparticle of non-canonical shape, as their size increases up to\nthe plasma wavelength.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 16:01:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2020 11:06:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2020 14:10:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Forestiere", "Carlo", ""], ["Miano", "Giovanni", ""], ["Pascale", "Mariano", ""], ["Tricarico", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11946", "submitter": "Jennifer Sleeman", "authors": "Jennifer Sleeman, John Dorband, Milton Halem", "title": "A Hybrid Quantum enabled RBM Advantage: Convolutional Autoencoders For\n  Quantum Image Compression and Generative Learning", "comments": "18 figures, 15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET cs.LG cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding how the D-Wave quantum computer could be used for machine\nlearning problems is of growing interest. Our work evaluates the feasibility of\nusing the D-Wave as a sampler for machine learning. We describe a hybrid system\nthat combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum\nannealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our\nhybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST\nFashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream\nclassification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated\nsamples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit\nD-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate\ntypical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and\nsamples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these\nlimitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression\nfactor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a\nlossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how\ngenerating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28\nimages that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed\nto recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification\nproblem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a\nquantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an\nMNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as\nan MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder\napproach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current\nRBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even\nmore promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 16:44:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sleeman", "Jennifer", ""], ["Dorband", "John", ""], ["Halem", "Milton", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11948", "submitter": "Nina Megier", "authors": "Nina Megier, Andrea Smirne and Bassano Vacchini", "title": "The interplay between local and non-local master equations: exact and\n  approximated dynamics", "comments": "26 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "New J.

In order to characterize the mathematical features and the physical\norigin of the dynamics, it is often useful to consider different kinds of\nmaster equations for the same system. Here, we derive an exact connection\nbetween the time-local and the integro-differential descriptions, focusing on\nthe class of commutative dynamics. The use of the damping-basis formalism\nallows us to devise a general procedure to go from one master equation to the\nother and vice-versa, by working with functions of time and their Laplace\ntransforms only. We further analyze the Lindbladian form of the time-local and\nthe integro-differential master equations, where we account for the appearance\nof different sets of Lindbladian operators. In addition, we investigate a\nRedfield-like approximation, that transforms the exact integro-differential\nequation into a time-local one by means of a coarse graining in time. Besides\nrelating the structure of the resulting master equation to those associated\nwith the exact dynamics, we study the effects of the approximation on\nMarkovianity. In particular, we show that, against expectation, the coarse\ngraining in time can possibly introduce memory effects, leading to a violation\nof a divisibility property of the dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 16:55:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2020 13:16:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Megier", "Nina", ""], ["Smirne", "Andrea", ""], ["Vacchini", "Bassano", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11968", "submitter": "Carlo Sias", "authors": "Elia Perego, Lucia Duca, Carlo Sias", "title": "Electro-optical ion trap for experiments with atom-ion quantum hybrid\n  systems", "comments": "17 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.atom-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the development of atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics, atom-ion\nhybrid systems are characterized by the presence of a new tool in the\nexperimental AMO toolbox: atom-ion interactions.

The confining optical field is generated by a deep optical\nlattice created at the crossing of a bow-tie cavity, while a static electric\nquadrupole ensures the ions' confinement in the plane orthogonal to the optical\nlattice. The setup is also equipped with a Paul trap for cooling the ions\nproduced by photoionization of a hot atomic beam, and the design of the two ion\ntraps facilitates the swapping of the ions from the Paul trap to the\nelectro-optical trap.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:31:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Perego", "Elia", ""], ["Duca", "Lucia", ""], ["Sias", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11980", "submitter": "James Hague", "authors": "J.P.
