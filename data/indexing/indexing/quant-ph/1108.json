My conclusion is that these experiments show that quantum mechanics is\nnonobjective: that is, the values of physical observables cannot be assigned to\na system before measurement. Bell's assumption of nonlocality has to be\nrejected as having no direct experimental confirmation, at least thus far. I\nalso consider the relationships between nonobjectivity and contextuality.\nSpecifically, I analyze the impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem on the problem\nof contextuality of quantum observables. I argue that, just as von Neumann's\n\"no-go\" theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem is based on assumptions that do not\ncorrespond to the real physical situation. Finally, I present a theory of\nmeasurement based on a classical, purely wave model (pre-quantum classical\nstatistical field theory), a model that reproduces quantum probabilities. In\nthis model continuous fields are transformed into discrete clicks of detectors.\nWhile this model is classical, it is nonobjective. In this case, nonobjectivity\nis the result of the dependence of experimental outcomes on the context of\nmeasurement, in accordance with Bohr's view.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2011 09:37:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2011 15:41:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2011 10:50:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Khrennikov", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0005", "submitter": "Wlodzimierz Piechocki", "authors": "Jakub Mielczarek and Wlodzimierz Piechocki", "title": "Gaussian state for the bouncing quantum cosmology", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures; matches version published in Phys.

Furthermore, all previous classical schemes\ncould be broken completely by the onslaught of a quantum eavesdropper and we\nconjectured that this is unavoidable.\n  We give now two novel key establishment schemes in the spirit of Merkle's.\nThe first one can be broken by a quantum adversary who makes an effort\nproportional to N^{5/3}, which is the optimal attack against this scheme. Our\nsecond scheme is purely classical, yet it cannot be broken by a quantum\neavesdropper who is only willing to expend an effort proportional to that of\nthe legitimate parties.\n  We then introduce two families of more elaborate protocols.

Exploring such quantum-classical correspondences in a more\ntransparent manner is central to the deeper understanding of foundational\naspects and has attracted a great deal of attention - starting from the early\ndays of quantum theory. While it is often highlighted that quantum to classical\ntransition occurs in the limit hbar tending to zero, several objections have\nbeen raised about its suitability in some physical contexts. Ehrenfest's\ntheorem is another widely discussed classical limit - however, its inadequacy\nhas also been pointed out in specific examples. It has been proposed that since\na quantum mechanical wave function inherits an intrinsic statistical behavior,\nits classical limit must correspond to a classical ensemble - not an individual\nparticle.

We\nconfine ourselves to one dimensional conservative systems and show, with the\nhelp of suitably defined dimensionless physical quantities, that first and\nsecond moments of the canonical observables match with each other in classical\nand quantum descriptions - resulting in an identical structure for uncertainty\nrelations in both the realms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 18:23:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Devi", "A.

Based on a multimode theory that takes into account the effect of\nsimultaneous multiple photon-pair emission, we find that these filters can be\noptimized to yield both a high heralding efficiency and a high production rate.\nWhile the optimization conditions vary depending on the underlying photon-pair\nspectral correlations, all correlation profiles can lead to similarly high\nperformance levels when optimized filters are employed.

This research was motivated by a simple\nexperimental question: if we move a spatially localized qubit, initially in a\nstate |\\psi_1>, along some spacetime path \\Gamma from a spacetime point x_1 to\nanother point x_2, what will the final quantum state |\\psi_2> be at point x_2?\nThis paper addresses this question for two physical realizations of the qubit:\nspin of a massive fermion and polarization of a photon. Our starting point is\nthe Dirac and Maxwell equations that describe respectively the one-particle\nstates of localized massive fermions and photons. In the WKB limit we show how\none can isolate a two-dimensional quantum state which evolves unitarily along\n\\Gamma. The quantum states for these two realizations are represented by a\nleft-handed 2-spinor in the case of massive fermions and a four-component\ncomplex polarization vector in the case of photons. In addition we show how to\nobtain from this WKB approach a fully general relativistic description of\ngravitationally induced phases. We use this formalism to describe the\ngravitational shift in the COW 1975 experiment. In the non-relativistic weak\nfield limit our result reduces to the standard formula in the original paper.\nWe provide a concrete physical model for a Stern-Gerlach measurement of spin\nand obtain a unique spin operator which can be determined given the orientation\nand velocity of the Stern-Gerlach device and velocity of the massive fermion.\nFinally, we consider multipartite states and generalize the formalism to\nincorporate basic elements from quantum information theory such as quantum\nentanglement, quantum teleportation, and identical particles. The resulting\nformalism provides a basis for exploring precision quantum measurements of the\ngravitational field using techniques from quantum information theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Aug 2011 05:28:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2012 04:11:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 13:22:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Palmer", "Matthew C.", ""], ["Takahashi", "Maki", ""], ["Westman", "Hans F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.3898", "submitter": "Amilcar Queiroz Mr", "authors": "A.

With quantum\neffects a motion of a particle through a barrier is allowed due to quantum\ntunneling.

However, there are no general laws forbidding fast motion through\nclassical barriers. The problem addressed is investigation of unusual features\no quantum tunneling through a classic static barrier which is at least\ntwo-dimensional. Here we show that penetration through such barrier can be not\nslow. When the barrier satisfies the certain conditions, a regime of quantum\nlens is possible with formation of caustics. De Broglie waves are reflected\nfrom the caustics, interfere, and result in a not small flux from under the\nbarrier. This strongly contrasts to the usual scenario with a decaying\nunder-barrier density. We construct a particular example of fast motion through\na classical barrier. One can unexectedly conclude that, in principle, nature\nallows fast penetration through classical barriers which against common sense.\nThe phenomenon may be responsible for a variety of processes in labs and\nnature.

We extend this result and show that even optimal\nclassical models (models with minimal internal entropy) in general are not the\nbest possible models (called ideal models). Instead of optimal classical models\nwe can construct quantum models which are significantly better but not yet the\nbest possible ones (i.e. they have a strictly smaller internal entropy). In\nthis paper we show conditions when the internal entropies between classical\nmodels and specific quantum models coincide. Furthermore it turns out that this\nsituation appears very rarely. An example shows that our results hold only for\nthe specific quantum model construction and in general not for alternative\nconstructions. Furthermore another example shows that classical models with\nminimal internal entropy need not to be related to quantum models with minimal\ninternal entropy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2011 13:58:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gmeiner", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5306", "submitter": "Gang Shu", "authors": "G.Shu, C.-K.Chou, N.Kurz, M.R.Dietrich and B.B.Blinov", "title": "Efficient fluorescence collection and ion imaging with the \"tack\" ion\n  trap", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1364/JOSAB.28.002865", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.atom-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Trapped, laser-cooled ions produce intense fluorescence.

The most important\nissue is the construction, from the wave function, of a probability\ndistribution answering various questions of physical interest, such as the\nprobability of the system entering a given region of configuration space at any\nstage in its entire history. A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the\nflux of (components of) the wave function in a WKB approximation as the\nprobability. This gives sensible semiclassical results but lacks an underlying\noperator formalism. Here, we supply the underlying formalism by deriving\nprobability distributions linked to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the\ndecoherent histories approach to quantum theory, building on the generalized\nquantum mechanics formalism developed by Hartle. The key step is the\nconstruction of class operators characterizing questions of physical interest.\nTaking advantage of a recent decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time\nproblem in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we show that the appropriate\nclass operators in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a complex\npotential. The class operator for not entering a region of configuration space\nis given by the $S$-matrix for scattering off a complex potential localized in\nthat region. We thus derive the class operators for entering one or more\nregions in configuration space. The class operators commute with the\nHamiltonian, have a sensible classical limit and are closely related to an\nintersection number operator.

One of the observable effects could be\nthe degradation of the diffraction images of distant sources.\n  Aims: We searched for this degradation effect, caused by QG fluctuations, in\nthe light of the farthest quasars (QSOs) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope\nwith the aim of setting new limits on the fluctuations of the space-time foam\nand QG models.\n  Methods: We developed a software that estimates and compares the phase\nvariation in the interference patterns of the high-redshift QSOs, taken from\nthe snapshot survey of HST-SDSS, with those of stars that are expected to not\nbe affected by QG effects. We used a two-parameter function to determine, for\neach test star and QSO, the maximum of the diffraction pattern and to calculate\nthe Strehl ratio.\n  Results: Our results go far beyond those already present in the literature.\nBy adopting the most conservative approach where the correction terms, that\ndescribe the possibility for space-time fluctuations cumulating across long\ndistances and partially compensate for the effects of the phase variations, are\ntaken into account.

In the attractive interaction regime we calculate\nthe same physical quantities in terms of the imbalance parameter, and find that\nthe symmetry breaking, occurring at interaction Uc, predicted by a\nsemiclassical approximation, is valid only in the limit of infinite number of\nbosons. For a large but finite number, we determine a characteristic strength\nof interaction, Uc*, which can be promoted as the crossover point from coherent\nto incoherent regimes and can be identified as the collapse threshold.\nMoreover, we find that the Fisher information is always in direct ratio to the\nvariance of on-site number of bosons, for both positive and negative\ninteractions. We finally show that the entanglement entropy is maximum close to\nUc* and exceeds its coherent value within the whole range of interaction\nbetween 2Uc and zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 11:02:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 17:36:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2012 09:17:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dell'Anna", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6216", "submitter": "Frederic Pierre", "authors": "F.D.

This very\nfundamental question has also direct implications for the quantum engineering\nof nanoelectronic devices. Indeed, when a quantum coherent conductor is\ninserted into a circuit, its transport properties are modified. In particular,\nits conductance is reduced because of the circuit back-action. This phenomenon,\ncalled environmental Coulomb blockade, results from the granularity of charge\ntransfers across the coherent conductor. Although extensively studied for a\ntunnel junction in a linear circuit, it is only fully understood for arbitrary\nshort coherent conductors in the limit of small circuit impedances and small\nconductance reduction. Here, we investigate experimentally the strong\nback-action regime, with a conductance reduction of up to 90%. This is achieved\nby embedding a single quantum channel of tunable transmission in an adjustable\non-chip circuit of impedance comparable to the resistance quantum $R_K=h/e^2$\nat microwave frequencies. The experiment reveals important deviations from\ncalculations performed in the weak back-action framework, and matches with\nrecent theoretical results. From these measurements, we propose a generalized\nexpression for the conductance of an arbitrary quantum channel embedded in a\nlinear circuit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 12:59:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Parmentier", "F.

Security is then defined by\nrequiring that as long as the queries satisfy some constraint, there is some\nproblem the adversary cannot solve, such as compute a certain piece of\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally new model of quantum\nattacks on classical cryptographic protocols, where the adversary is allowed to\nask several classical queries in quantum superposition. This is a strictly\nstronger attack than the standard one, and we consider the security of several\nprimitives in this model. We show that a secret-sharing scheme that is secure\nwith threshold $t$ in the standard model is secure against superposition\nattacks if and only if the threshold is lowered to $t/2$. We use this result to\ngive zero-knowledge proofs for all of NP in the common reference string model.\nWhile our protocol is classical, it is sound against a cheating unbounded\nquantum prover and computational zero-knowledge even if the verifier is allowed\na superposition attack. Finally, we consider multiparty computation and show\nthat for the most general type of attack, simulation based security is not\npossible. However, putting a natural constraint on the adversary, we show a\nnon-trivial example of a protocol that can indeed be simulated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 18:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Damgaard", "Ivan", ""], ["Funder", "Jakob", ""], ["Nielsen", "Jesper Buus", ""], ["Salvail", "Louis", ""]]}]
