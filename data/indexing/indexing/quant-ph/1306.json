This is called the three-level ansatz and is the only\nunproven assumption in the theory of fundamental limits. All calculations that\nare based on direct solution of the Schrodinger equation yield intrinsic\nhyperpolarizabilities less than 0.709 and intrinsic second\nhyperpolarizabilities less than 0.6. In this work, we show that relaxing the\nthree-level ansatz and allowing an arbitrary number of states to contribute\nleads to divergence of the optimized intrinsic hyperpolarizability in the limit\nof an infinite number of states - what we call the many-state catastrophe. This\nis not surprising given that the divergent systems are most likely not\nderivable from the Schrodinger equation, yet obey the sum rules. The sums rules\nare the second ingredient in limit theory, and apply also to systems with more\ngeneral Hamiltonians. These exotic Hamiltonians may not model any real systems\nfound in nature. Indeed, a class of transition moments and energies that come\nform the sum rules do not have a corresponding Hamiltonian that is expressible\nin differential form. In this work, we show that the three-level ansatz acts as\na constraint that excludes many of the nonphysical Hamiltonians and prevents\nthe intrinsic hyperpolarizability from diverging. We argue that this implies\nthat the true fundamental limit is smaller than previously calculated. Since\nthe three-level ansatz does not lead to the largest possible nonlinear\nresponse, contrary to its assertion, we propose the intriguing possibility that\nthe three-level ansatz is true for any system that obeys the Schrodinger\nequation, yet this assertion may be unprovable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 22:23:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Shafei", "Shoresh", ""], ["Kuzyk", "Mark G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0945", "submitter": "Kil-Chan Ha", "authors": "Kil-Chan Ha", "title": "Notes on extremality of the Choi map", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": "Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 439/10, 3156-3165 (2013)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OA quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is widely believed that the Choi map generates an extremal ray in the cone\n$\\mathcal P(M_3)$ of all positive linear maps between $C^*$-algebra $M_3$ of\nall $n\\times n$ matrices over the complex field.

To reach these goals, several kinds of spin chains have\nbeen suggested, which differ in the degree of fine-tuning, or engineering, of\nthe system parameters.

We identify the system features responsible for these similarities\nand we perform a detailed study of the transfer fidelity as a function of chain\nlength and disorder strength, yielding empirical scaling laws for the fidelity\nwhich are similar for all kinds of chain and all disorder models.

We consider two\nmodels. In the first, the incoming particle is classicalized by coupling it to\nan environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation diagonalizing\nin position. We find, however, that suppression of reflection is achieved only\nfor environmental interaction so strong that large fluctuations in momentum are\ngenerated which blurs the distinction between incoming and reflected wave\npackets. This negative conclusion also holds for a complex potential which has\nsimilar implications for attempts to understand the suppression of the Zeno\neffect using the same mechanism (discussed in more detail in another paper). A\ndifferent Lindblad master diagonalizing in momentum is shown to be successful\nin suppressing reflection without large fluctuations but such a master equation\nis unphysical. We consider a second model in which the barrier is modelled\nquantum-mechanically by a massive target particle coupled to an environment to\nmaintain it in a quasi-classical state. This avoids the fluctuations problem\nsince the incoming particle is not coupled to the environment directly. We find\nthat reflection is significantly suppressed as long as the decoherence\ntimescale of the target particle is much smaller than certain characteristic\nscattering timescales of the incoming particle, or equivalently, as long as the\nvelocity fluctuations in the target are larger than the velocity of the\nincoming particle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 12:27:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2013 12:07:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bedingham", "D.

In principle the process should produce controlled vibrational\ntransfers due to an adiabatic flip of the dressed eigenstates. We directly\nsolve the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the complete time-dependent field instead\nof using the adiabatic Floquet formalism which initially suggested the design\nof the laser pulses. Results given by wavepacket propagations disagree with\npredictions obtained using the adiabatic hypothesis. Thus we show that there\nare large non-adiabatic exchanges and that the dissipative character of the\ndynamics renders the adiabatic flip very difficult to obtain.

All path lengths,\nand values of physical quantities, are crushed to 0 as $t$ goes to 0. Other\nexamples have spherically symmetric scaling factors about some point, $x.$ In\none type, a black scaling hole, the scaling factor goes to infinity as the\ndistance, $d$, between any point $y$ and $x$ goes to 0. For scaling white\nholes, the scaling factor goes to 0 as $d$ goes to 0. For black scaling holes,\npath lengths from a reference point, $z$, to $y$ become infinite as $y$\napproaches $x.$ For white holes, path lengths approach a value much less than\nthe unscaled distance from $z$ to $x.$\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:51:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Benioff", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.4617", "submitter": "Peter Asenbaum", "authors": "Peter Asenbaum, Stefan Kuhn, Stefan Nimmrichter, Ugur Sezer, Markus\n  Arndt", "title": "Cavity cooling of free silicon nanoparticles in high-vacuum", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Nat.

Although this feat has recently even been achieved for diatomic\nmolecules, it is very hard for mesoscopic particles. It has been proposed that\nan external cavity may compensate for the lack of internal cycling transitions\nin dielectric objects and it may thus provide assistance in the cooling of\ntheir centre of mass state.

We point out\nthe possibility of mapping the experimental values of the specie's g-factors\ninto a theoretical parameter which accounts for fractionality, without\ncomputing higher-order QED calculations. We wish to understand whether the\nvalue of (g-2) may be traced back to a fractionality of space-time.The\njustification for the difference between the experimental and the theoretical\nvalue g=2 stemming from the Dirac equation is given in the terms of the\ncomplexity of the interactions of the charged leptons, considered as\npseudo-particles and \"dressed\" by the interactions and the medium. Stepwise, we\nbuild up a fractional Dirac equation from the fractional Weyl equation that, on\nthe other hand, was formulated exclusively in terms of the helicity operator.\nFrom the fractional angular momentum algebra, in a coarse-grained scenario, we\nwork out the eigenvalues of the spin operator. Based on the standard\nelectromagnetic current, as an analogy case, we write down a fractional\nLagrangian density, with the electromagnetic field minimally coupled to the\nparticular charged lepton. We then study a fractional gauge-like invariance\nsymmetry, formulate the covariant fractional derivative and propose the spinor\nfield transformation. Finally, by taking the non-relativistic regime of the\nfractional Dirac equation, the fractional Pauli equation is obtained and, from\nthat, an explicit expression for the fractional g-factor comes out that is\ncompared with the experimental CODATA value.

Earlier it was shown that the quasi-energy spectra of\nthese two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an\neffective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be\ndifferent if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work\nmakes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective\nPlanck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers.\nIt is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having\nthe same kick strength) has one flat band and $N-1$ non-flat bands whose\nlargest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a\nkicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and\nthe power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also\nanalytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have\nany flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to\nresult in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but\nextremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM.\nFinally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions\nof KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such\nthat the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically\nequivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and\ndisplay topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths.

During the last decade, intense research was devoted to their\ndevelopment, mostly with the aim of fulfilling the requirements of their first\ntwo applications, namely quantum repeaters and linear-optical quantum\ncomputation. A better understanding of those requirements then motivated\nseveral different experimental approaches. Along the way, other exciting\napplications emerged, such as as quantum metrology, single-photon detection,\ntests of the foundations of quantum physics, device-independent quantum\ninformation processing and nonlinear processing of quantum information. Here we\nreview several prospective applications of optical quantum memories with a\nfocus on recent experimental achievements pertaining to these applications.\nThis review highlights that optical quantum memories have become essential for\nthe development of optical quantum information processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 17:44:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bussieres", "Felix", ""], ["Sangouard", "Nicolas", ""], ["Afzelius", "Mikael", ""], ["de Riedmatten", "Hugues", ""], ["Simon", "Christoph", ""], ["Tittel", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6912", "submitter": "Gerald Kerley Ph.D.", "authors": "Gerald I.

The first concept begins with\nrewriting the perturbation equations in a form that is closely related to\nmatrix diagonalization methods. That allows a simple, compact derivation of the\nstandard (Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger) equations. But it also leads to a new\niterative solution method that is not based on the usual power series\nexpansion. The iterative method can also be used when the unperturbed system is\ntwo-fold degenerate. The second concept is quite different from the first but\ncompatible with it. It is based on the fact that one can replace the true\nHamiltonian with a synthetic Hamiltonian having the same eigenvalues. This\napproach allows one to cancel part of the perturbation and to reduce the size\nof the off-diagonal matrix elements, giving better convergence of the series.\nThese methods are illustrated by application to three perturbed harmonic\noscillator problems--a 1-D oscillator with a linear perturbation, a 1-D\noscillator with a quartic perturbation, and a perturbed 2-D oscillator, which\ninvolves degenerate states. The iterative method and the synthetic Hamiltonian\nmethod are shown to give significantly better results than the standard method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:37:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kerley", "Gerald I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6922", "submitter": "Tomoi Koide", "authors": "T.
