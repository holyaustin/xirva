We develop a cluster-correlation\nexpansion (CCE) theory for the spin bath dynamics relevant to the qubit\ndecoherence problem. A cluster correlation term is recursively defined as the\nevolution of a group of bath spins divided by the cluster correlations of all\nthe subgroups. The so-defined correlation accounts for the authentic collective\nexcitations within a given group. The bath propagator is the product of all\npossible cluster correlation terms. For a finite-time evolution as in the qubit\ndecoherence problem, a convergent result can be obtained by truncating the\nexpansion up to a certain cluster size. The two-spin cluster truncation of the\nCCE corresponds to the pair-correlation approximation [PRB 74,195301(2006)]. In\nterms of the standard linked cluster expansion, a cluster correlation term is\nthe infinite summation of all the connected diagrams with all and only the\nspins in the group flip-flopped, and thus the expansion is exact whenever\nconverges. When the individual contribution of each higher-order correlation\nterm to the decoherence is small, as the usual case for relatively large baths\nwhere the decoherence could complete well within the bath spin flip-flop time,\nthe CCE coincides with the cluster expansion [PRB 74,035322(2006)]. For small\nbaths, however, the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin\nflip-flop timescale and thus individual higher-order cluster correlations could\ngrow significant. In such cases, only the CCE converges to the exact coherent\ndynamics of multi-spin clusters.

On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 22:48:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Saurya", "", "Lethbridge U."], ["Shankaranarayanan", "S.", "", "Portsmouth U., ICG"], ["Sur", "Sourav", "", "Lethbridge U."]]}, {"id": "0806.0414", "submitter": "Lixin He", "authors": "Lixin He, Ming Gong, Chuan-Feng Li, Guang-Can Guo, Alex Zunger", "title": "Highly-reduced Fine-structure splitting in InAs/InP quantum dots\n  offering efficient on-demand 1.55 $\\mu$m entangled photon emitter", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.157405", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To generate entangled photon pairs via quantum dots (QDs), the exciton fine\nstructure splitting (FSS) must be comparable to the exciton homogeneous line\nwidth.

Although a common approach to teleportation\namongst physicists nowadays is a somewhat operational one, some researchers are\nmaking an effort to deflate the above views.\n  On the one hand, it was recently argued that the paradox of information\ntransfer taking place in teleportation is dissolved (Timpson, 2006) by\nappealing the very notion of information. On the other hand, it was\ndemonstrated that some classical versions of teleportation retain its important\nfeatures, which hitherto were considered genuinely quantum (Cohen, 2003;\nCollins&Popescu, 2002; Hardy, 1999; Mor, 2006; Spekkens, 2007).\n  I will present a special version of a quantum teleportation protocol which is\nin a sense split into classical and quantum steps. This description provides us\nwith a unified picture of teleportation in both domains. It will be explicitly\nshown how classical teleportation is embedded in the quantum protocol.\nMoreover, the classical step can be successfully accomplished even if the state\nshared by the parties is completely disentangled [this is consistent with the\nresult obtained in (Wang, 2005)]. Yet, all the (apparent) paradoxical features\nusually associated with quantum teleportation are clearly present in this step.\nIn particular, this demonstrates that entanglement cannot be ultimately\nresponsible and not necessary for the (paradoxical?) information transfer.\n  Thus, even if one considers teleportation as mysterious, all its mysteries\nare shifted from quantum domain into purely classical one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 14:50:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Groisman", "Berry", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1691", "submitter": "Cristiano Ciuti", "authors": "Simone De Liberato (MPQ, LPA), Cristiano Ciuti (MPQ)", "title": "Stimulated scattering and lasing of intersubband cavity polaritons", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Physical Review Letters 102 (2009) 136403", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.136403", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.other", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a microscopic theory describing the stimulated scattering of\nintersubband polariton excitations in a microcavity-embedded two-dimensional\nelectron gas.

Interestingly, according to the\nrelativistic version of Bohmian mechanics using the Dirac equation, a massive\nparticle's speed is less than or equal to the speed of light, but not\nnecessarily less. That is, there are situations in which the particle actually\nreaches the speed of light---a very non-classical behavior. That leads us to\nthe question of whether such situations can be arranged experimentally. We\nprove a theorem, Theorem 5, implying that for generic initial wave functions\nthe probability that the particle ever reaches the speed of light, even if at\nonly one point in time, is zero. We conclude that the answer to the question is\nno. Since a trajectory reaches the speed of light whenever the quantum\nprobability current psi-bar gamma^mu psi is a lightlike 4-vector, our analysis\nconcerns the current vector field of a generic wave function and may thus be of\ninterest also independently of Bohmian mechanics. The fact that the current is\nnever spacelike has been used to argue against the possibility of\nfaster-than-light tunnelling through a barrier, a somewhat similar question.\nTheorem 5, as well as a more general version provided by Theorem 6, are also\ninteresting in their own right. They concern a certain property of a function\npsi: R^4 --> C^4 that is crucial to the question of reaching the speed of\nlight, namely being transverse to a certain submanifold of C^4 along a given\ncompact subset of space-time. While it follows from the known transversality\ntheorem of differential topology that this property is generic among smooth\nfunctions psi: R^4 --> C^4, Theorem 5 asserts that it is also generic among\nsmooth solutions of the Dirac equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2008 12:41:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2009 17:11:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Aug 2010 14:19:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Jan 2011 19:03:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tausk", "Daniel V.", ""], ["Tumulka", "Roderich", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4490", "submitter": "Anjana Sinha Dr.", "authors": "A.

Our method is\nscalable and can be implemented straightforwardly in any desired dimension.\nMoreover, we show that it allows for detection of Bound Entangled States\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2008 10:59:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2008 03:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Herrera-Mart\u00ed", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4861", "submitter": "Zbigniew Walczak", "authors": "Zbigniew Walczak", "title": "Total correlations and mutual information", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures, published version", "journal-ref": "Physics Letters A 373 (2009) 1818-1822", "doi": "10.1016/j.physleta.2009.03.047", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In quantum information theory it is generally accepted that quantum mutual\ninformation is an information-theoretic measure of total correlations of a\nbipartite quantum state.
