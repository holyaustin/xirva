Understanding the effect of weakly breaking a conservation\nlaw due to coherent and incoherent errors is thus crucial, e.g., in the\nrealization of reliable quantum simulators. In this work, we perform exact\nnumerics and time-dependent perturbation theory to study the dynamics of\n\\textit{symmetry violation} in quantum many-body systems with slight coherent\n(at strength $\\lambda$) or incoherent (at strength $\\gamma$) breaking of their\nlocal and global symmetries. We rigorously prove the symmetry violation to be a\ndivergence measure in Hilbert space. Based on this, we show that symmetry\nbreaking generically leads to a crossover in the divergence growth from\ndiffusive behavior at onset times to ballistic or hyperballistic scaling at\nintermediate times, before diffusion dominates at long times. More precisely,\nwe show that for local errors the leading coherent contribution to the symmetry\nviolation cannot be of order lower than $\\propto\\lambda t^2$ while its\nleading-order incoherent counterpart is typically of order $\\propto\\gamma t$.\nThis remarkable interplay between unitary and incoherent gauge-breaking\nscalings is also observed at higher orders in projectors onto symmetry\n(super)sectors. Due to its occurrence at short times, the\ndiffusive-to-ballistic crossover is expected to be readily accessible in modern\nultracold-atom and NISQ-device experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Halimeh", "Jad C.", ""], ["Hauke", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00013", "submitter": "Vijay Pal Singh", "authors": "Vijay Pal Singh and Ludwig Mathey", "title": "Collective modes and superfluidity of a two-dimensional ultracold Bose\n  gas", "comments": "Main text: 7 pages + 6 figures and Supplementary text: 5 pages + 4\n  figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In an experiment with ultra-cold Rubidium atoms, we\nsimultaneously record whether atoms are excited by incident (\"signal\") photons\nand whether those photons are transmitted.

Namely, the majorization pre-order attains a\nminimum over $\\epsilon$-balls in this distance. By tracing the path of the\nmajorization-minimizer as a function of the distance $\\epsilon$, we obtain the\npath of \"majorization flow\". This yields a new proof of the Audenaert-Fannes\ncontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in a universal framework which\nextends to the other functions, including the $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi entropy, for\nwhich we obtain novel bounds in the case $\\alpha > 1$. We apply this technique\nto other Schur concave functions, such as the number of connected components of\na certain random graph model, and the number of distinct realizations of a\nrandom variable.\n  In the second part, we consider repeated interaction systems, in which a\nsystem of interest interacts with a sequence of probes one at a time. We\ncharacterize which repeated interaction systems break any initially-present\nentanglement between the system and an untouched reference after finitely many\nsteps. Additionally, when the probes and their interactions with the system are\nslowly-varying (i.e. adiabatic), we analyze the saturation of Landauer's bound,\nan inequality between the entropy change of the system and the energy change of\nthe probes, in the limit in which the number of steps tends to infinity and\nboth the difference between consecutive probes and the difference between their\ninteractions vanishes.

By carefully\narranging these qubits resets, we are able to reuse qubits and increase the\ncircuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences.

As a consequence, negative\nvacuum expectation values of classically positive-defined quantities can\nappear. This has been addressed in the literature as subvacuum phenomenon. Here\nit is investigated how a scalar charged test particle is affected by the vacuum\nfluctuations of a massive scalar field in D+1 spacetime when the background\nevolves from empty space to a thermal bath, and also when a perfectly\nreflecting boundary is included. It is shown that when the particle is brought\ninto a thermal bath it gains an amount of energy by means of positive\ndispersions of its velocity components. The magnitude of this effect is\ndependent on the temperature and also on the field mass. However, when a\nreflecting wall is inserted, dispersions can be positive or negative, showing\nthat subvacuum effect happens even in a finite temperature environment.\nFurthermore, a remarkable result is that temperature can even improve negative\nvelocity fluctuations. The magnitude of the residual effects depends on the\nswitching interval of time the system takes to evolve between two states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:02:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 19:02:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Camargo", "G.

In this work, we develop a\ncomprehensive framework of randomized benchmarking general enough to encompass\nvirtually all known protocols. Overcoming previous limitations on e.g. error\nmodels and gate sets, this framework allows us to formulate realistic\nconditions under which we can rigorously guarantee that the output of a\nrandomized benchmarking experiment is well-described by a linear combination of\nmatrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed discussion of the\nfitting problem associated to randomized benchmarking data. We discuss modern\nsignal processing techniques and their guarantees in the context of randomized\nbenchmarking, give analytical sample complexity bounds and numerically evaluate\ntheir performance and limitations. In order to reduce the resource demands of\nthis fitting problem, we moreover provide scalable post-processing techniques\nto isolate exponential decays, significantly improving the practical\nfeasibility of a large set of randomized benchmarking protocols. These\npost-processing techniques generalize several previously proposed methods such\nas character benchmarking and linear-cross entropy benchmarking. Finally we\ndiscuss, in full generality, how and when randomized benchmarking decay rates\ncan be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity.

A natural question arises: Can we quantify the quantum\ncorrelations between the two accelerated detectors or equivalently between two\nlocations in curved space time and are these equilibrium (equal accelerations\nof the two detectors) quantum correlation equivalent to the ones between the\ntwo stationary detectors under a thermal bath? A further question is what if\nthe two accelerations or the couplings between the detectors and the vacuum\nfield are different and how this nonequilibrium effect can influence the\nquantum correlations. In this study, we examine the above scenarios. The\ntemperature and acceleration characterizing the equivalently effective local\nspace-time curvature show qualitatively similar and quantitatively different\nimpacts on the quantum correlations in this equilibrium scenario. This shows\nthe similarities and differences between the two detectors under equal\naccelerations or equivalently local curvatures and the same temperatures for\nthe effects on the quantum correlations. As the acceleration (temperature) of\nthe detectors increases, the entanglement decreases to zero at some instant but\nthe mutual information (discord) is amplified. As the acceleration increases\nwhen the equal acceleration is in the opposite direction, the quantum\ncorrelation decays. Importantly, we show that the larger quantum correlations\ncan appear due to the nonequilibriumness characterized by the degree of the\ndetailed balance breaking from enhanced difference in the couplings.

However, GANs are\nvery computationally expensive, sometimes computationally prohibitive. Training\nGAN may suffer from convergence failure and modal collapse. Aiming at the\nacceleration of practical quantum computers, we propose QuGAN, a quantum GAN\narchitecture that provides stable differentiation, quantum-states based\ngradients and significantly reduced parameter sets. QuGAN architecture runs the\ndiscriminator and the generator purely on quantum hardware and utilizes the\nswap test on qubits to calculate the values of loss functions. Built on quantum\nlayers, QuGAN is able to achieve similar performance with 98.5% reduction on\nthe parameter set when compared to classical GANs. With the same number of\nparameters, additionally, QuGAN outperforms other quantum based GANs in the\nliterature for up to 125.0% in terms of similarity between generated\ndistributions and original datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Oct 2020 17:10:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Stein", "Samuel A.", ""], ["Baheri", "Betis", ""], ["Tischio", "Ray Marie", ""], ["Mao", "Ying", ""], ["Guan", "Qiang", ""], ["Li", "Ang", ""], ["Fang", "Bo", ""], ["Xu", "Shuai", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.09038", "submitter": "Will McCutcheon Dr", "authors": "Will McCutcheon", "title": "Backscattering in Nonlinear Microring Resonators Via A Gaussian\n  Treatment of Coupled Cavity Modes", "comments": "21(13+8)pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "APL Photonics 6, 066103 (2021)", "doi": "10.1063/5.0044059", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Systems of coupled cavity modes have the potential to provide bright quantum\noptical states of light in a highly versatile manner.

The\ntheorem, which was the subject of a 2007 critique by Meir Hemmo and Pitowsky,\nis critically examined, along with recent related work by John Earman.

In particular, we show that the excitation\nprobability by a single electron is independent of its wave function, apart\nfrom a classical average over the transverse beam density profile, whereas the\nprobability for two or more modulated electrons depends on their relative\nspatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum nature of their interactions.\nWe derive first-principles analytical expressions that embody these results and\nhave general validity for arbitrarily shaped electrons and any type of\nelectron-sample interaction. We conclude with perspectives on various exciting\ndirections for disruptive approaches to non-invasive spectroscopy and\nmicroscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response at the\nnanoscale, the manipulation of the density matrices associated with free\nelectrons and optical sample modes, and applications in optical modulation of\nelectron beams.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 12:08:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:11:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2021 22:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:35:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["de Abajo", "F.

Pre/post-test\ndesign method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure\nknowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by\nthe participants.\n  Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a\nstatistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the\nparticipants on quantum computing concepts.

To properly study and\ncharacterize the origin of quantum \"complexity\" in computation as well as\nphysics, it is crucial to develop a rigorous understanding of the\nquantification of magic. Previous studies of magic mostly focused on small\nsystems and largely relied on the discrete Wigner formalism (which is only well\nbehaved in odd prime power dimensions). Here we present an initiatory study of\nthe magic of genuinely many-body quantum states (with focus on the important\ncase of many qubits) at a quantitative level. We first address the basic\nquestion of how magical a many-body state can be, and show that the maximum and\ntypical magic of an $n$-qubit state is essentially $n$, simultaneously for a\nrange of natural resource measures. As a corollary, we show that the resource\ntheory of magic with stabilizer-preserving free operations is asymptotically\nreversible. In the quest for explicit, scalable cases of highly entangled\nstates whose magic can be understood, we connect the magic of hypergraph states\nwith the second-order nonlinearity of their underlying Boolean functions. Next,\nwe go on and investigate many-body magic in practical and physical contexts. We\nfirst consider Pauli measurement-based quantum computation, in which magic is a\nnecessary feature of the initial resource state. We show that $n$-qubit states\nwith nearly $n$ magic, or indeed almost all states, cannot supply nontrivial\nspeedups over classical computers. We then present an example of analyzing the\nmagic of \"natural\" condensed matter systems.

We further give a convenient formula to\ndetermine the magnitude of the penalty term, which may lead to the faster\nconvergence of the VQE. Meanwhile, we prove that the other type of penalty\nterms does not work for obtaining the target state with the desired symmetry in\na rigorous sense and even gives completely wrong results in some cases. We\nfinally provide numerical simulations to validate our analysis. Our results\napply to general quantum systems and lay the theoretical foundation for the use\nof the VQE with the penalty terms to obtain the symmetry-resolving energy\nspectrum of the system, which fuels the application of a near-term quantum\ncomputer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 23:38:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 23:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kuroiwa", "Kohdai", ""], ["Nakagawa", "Yuya O.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.13973", "submitter": "Mohammad Ali Rajabpour", "authors": "Jiaju Zhang, M.

When\nthe momentum difference of any pair of distinct quasiparticles is small, the\nadditional terms are non-negligible. On the contrary, when the difference of\nthe momenta of each pair of distinct quasiparticles is large, the additional\nterms could be neglected. The universal single-interval R\\'enyi entropy and its\nadditional terms in the XY chain are the same as those in the fermionic chain,\nwhile the universal R\\'enyi entropy of the double intervals and its additional\nterms are different, due to the fact that the local degrees of freedom of the\nXY chain are the Pauli matrices not the spinless fermions.

Dynamical field inference (DFI) addresses the\nproblem of reconstructing a stochastically driven, dynamically evolving field\nfrom finite data. It relies on information field theory (IFT), the information\ntheory for fields. Here, the relations of DFI, IFT, and the recently developed\nsupersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) are established in a pedagogical\ndiscussion. In IFT, field expectation values can be calculated from the\npartition function of the full space-time inference problem. The partition\nfunction of the inference problem invokes a functional Dirac function to\nguarantee the dynamics, as well as a field-dependent functional determinant, to\nestablish proper normalization, both impeding the necessary evaluation of the\npath integral over all field configurations. STS replaces these problematic\nexpressions via the introduction of fermionic ghost and bosonic Lagrange\nfields, respectively. The action of these fields has a supersymmetry, which\nmeans there exists an exchange operation between bosons and fermions that\nleaves the system invariant. In contrast to this, measurements of the dynamical\nfields do not adhere to this supersymmetry. The supersymmetry can also be\nbroken spontaneously, in which case the system evolves chaotically. This\naffects the predictability of the system and thereby make DFI more challenging.\nWe investigate the interplay of measurement constraints with the non-linear\nchaotic dynamics of a simplified, illustrative system with the help of Feynman\ndiagrams and show that the Fermionic corrections are essential to obtain the\ncorrect posterior statistics over system trajectories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 08:26:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 May 2021 20:02:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Westerkamp", "Margret", ""], ["Ovchinnikov", "Igor", ""], ["Frank", "Philipp", ""], ["En\u00dflin", "Torsten", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15465", "submitter": "Jisho Miyazaki Dr.", "authors": "Jisho Miyazaki", "title": "Symmetry in Metrology: Universal Reduction of Quantum Multi-Parameter\n  Incompatibility", "comments": "10 pages (7main + 3appendix), 2 figures.

Such an averaging process can be always represented as\naveraging with respect to a finite number of elements of the group, called a\nfinite averaging set. In the previous research such sets, known as $t$-designs,\nwere constructed only for the case of averaging over unitary groups (hence the\nname unitary $t$-designs). In this work we investigate the problem of\nconstructing finite averaging sets for averaging over general non-compact\nmatrix Lie groups, which is much more subtle task due to the fact that the the\nuniform invariant measure on the group manifold (the Haar measure) is infinite.\nWe provide a general construction of such sets based on the Cartan\ndecomposition of the group, which splits the group into its compact and\nnon-compact components. The averaging over the compact part can be done in a\nuniform way, whereas the averaging over the non-compact one has to be endowed\nwith a suppresing weight function, and can be approached using generalised\nGauss quadratures. This leads us to the general form of finite averaging sets\nfor semisimple matrix Lie groups in the product form of finite averaging sets\nwith respect to the compact and non-compact parts. We provide an explicit\ncalculation of such sets for the group $SL(2, \\mathbb{C})$, although our\nconstruction can be applied to other cases.

No power is\napplied to the gate apart from the energy of the input fluxons, and the two\npossible flux polarities represent the bit states. Undamped long Josephson\njunctions (LJJs), where fluxons move at practically constant speed from\ninertia, form the input and output channels of the gates. LJJs are connected in\nthe gates by circuit interfaces, which are designed to allow the ballistic\nscattering from input to output fluxon states, using the temporary excitation\nof a localized mode. The duration of the resonant scattering determines the\noperation time of the gate, approximately a few Josephson plasma periods. Due\nto the coherent conversions between fluxon and localized modes the ballistic\ngates can be very efficient: in our simulations only a few percent of the\nfluxon's energy are dissipated in the gate operation. Ballistic-reversible\ngates can be combined with other, non-ballistic gate circuits to extend the\nrange of gate functionalities. Here we describe how the CNOT can be built as a\nstructure that includes the IDSN (Identity-else-Same-gives-NOT) and\nStore-and-Launch (SNL) gates. The IDSN is a 2-bit ballistic gate, which we\ndescribe and analyze in terms of equivalent 1-bit circuits. The SNL is a\nclocking gate, that allows the storage of a bit and the clocked launch of a\nfluxon on a bit-state dependent output path. In the CNOT the SNL gates provide\nthe necessary routing and fluxon synchronization for the input to the IDSN\ngate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 23:26:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Osborn", "Kevin D.", ""], ["Wustmann", "Waltraut", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16036", "submitter": "Xiao-Qiang Shao Dr", "authors": "H.
