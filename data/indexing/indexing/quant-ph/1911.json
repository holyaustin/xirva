In this way, lattice gauge theories provide\nboth motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research towards the\ndevelopment of special purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and\nultimately of scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent\nresults and new tools from a quantum science approach to study lattice gauge\ntheories are reviewed. Two new complementary approaches are discussed: first,\ntensor network methods are presented - a classical simulation approach -\napplied to the study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on\nAbelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, recent proposals for the\nimplementation of lattice gauge theory quantum simulators in different quantum\nhardware are reported, e.g., trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting\ncircuits.

As LOCC\nhas a highly intricate structure, sometimes the larger set of separable (SEP)\nmaps is considered, which has a mathematically much simpler description. In the\nliterature, mainly SEP maps consisting of invertible Kraus operators have been\ntaken into account. In this paper we show that the consideration of those maps\nis not sufficient when deciding whether a state can be mapped to another via\ngeneral SEP transformations. This is done by providing explicit examples of\ntransformations among pure 3- and 5- qubits states, which are feasible via SEP\nmaps containing singular Kraus operators, however, not possible via SEP maps\ncontaining solely regular Kraus operators. The key point that allows to\nconstruct the SEP maps is to introduce projective measurements that occur with\nprobability zero on the input state. The fact that it is not sufficient to\nconsider SEP maps composed out of regular Kraus operators even in the case of\npure state transformations, also affects the results on LOCC transformations\namong pure states. However, we show that non-invertible Kraus operators do not\nhelp in state transformations under LOCC with finitely many rounds of classical\ncommunication, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SEP\ntransformations with invertible Kraus operators is still a necessary condition\nfor convertibility under finite-round LOCC.

By varying the coupling strength of the\nfour-point interaction in relation to the kinetic term, one can analyze the\nphase structure of the model. This intriguing fact leads us to investigate\nwhether similar Hamiltonians with four-point interactions can also be studied\nas a function of their four-point coupling strength. In this paper, we\nreexamine the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, regarding it generally beyond the\ncontext of quantum chromodynamics. Essentially, it is a model in which\nparticle-antiparticle pairing leads to a BCS-like condensate, with the result\nthat chiral symmetry is broken dynamically in the strong-coupling regime. To\nstudy the behavior of the system, it is necessary to move from this regime to a\nhypothetical regime of weak coupling, altering the coupling strength of the\ninteraction arbitrarily. In order to do this, the gap equation must be regarded\nas complex and its Riemann surface structure must be known. We do this and\nobtain a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the development\nof a complex order parameter (the dynamically generated mass) from the second\nsheet of the Riemann surface, as we move into the weak-coupling regime. The\npower-law behavior of the order parameter in the vicinity of the phase\ntransition point is demonstrated to be independent of the choice of the\nregularization scheme with the critical exponent as $\\beta \\approx 0.55$. At\nthe same time, the isovector pseudoscalar modes retain their feature as\nGoldstone modes and still have zero mass, while the isoscalar scalar meson\nfollows the behavior of the order parameter and gains a width. Energetically,\nthis mode is not favored over the normal, uncondensed mode but would have to be\naccessed through an excitation process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Nov 2019 15:59:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Beygi", "Alireza", ""], ["Klevansky", "S.

Their results have the advantage that the quantum circuit is\nfairly practical, and their proofs are free of hardness assumptions (e.g.,\nfactoring is classically hard, etc.).

The use of MPOs accounts for the high\nlevel of generality and wide range of applicability of DMRG. However, current\nalgorithms for two dimensional (2D) tensor network states, known as projected\nentangled-pair states (PEPS), rarely employ the associated 2D tensor network\noperators, projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), due to their\ncomputational cost and conceptual complexity. To lower these two barriers, we\ndescribe how to reformulate a PEPO into a set of tensor network operators that\nresemble MPOs by considering the different sets of local operators that are\ngenerated from sequential bipartitions of the 2D system. The expectation value\nof a PEPO can then be evaluated on-the-fly using only the action of MPOs and\ngeneralized MPOs at each step of the approximate contraction of the 2D tensor\nnetwork.

Recently, a new\nmodel of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational\ndelegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the\nserver, the client pays a reward to the server. The rational server sends\nmessages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the\nclassical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational\nquantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational\ndelegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational\nsumcheck protocol. The construction of the previous rational protocols depends\non gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any\nlocal gate set. Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward\nfunction satisfies natural requirements. We also discuss the reward gap. Simply\nspeaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the\nserver's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept\nan incorrect answer. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only\nexponentially small reward gaps as with the previous protocols, we show that a\nconstant reward gap can be achieved if two non-communicating but entangled\nrational servers are allowed. We also discuss that a single rational server is\nsufficient under the (widely-believed) assumption that the learning-with-errors\nproblem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing.

Thus, a quantum system must be described relative\nto a quantum reference frame (QRF). Further requirements on QRF include using\nonly relational observables and not assuming the existence of external\nreference frame. To address these requirements, two approaches are proposed in\nthe literature. The first one is an operational approach (F. Giacomini, et al,\nNat. Comm. 10:494, 2019) which focuses on the quantization of transformation\nbetween QRFs. The second approach attempts to derive the quantum transformation\nbetween QRFs from first principles (A. Vanrietvelde, et al, \\textit{Quantum}\n4:225, 2020). Such first principle approach describes physical systems as\nsymmetry induced constrained Hamiltonian systems. The Dirac quantization of\nsuch systems before removing redundancy is interpreted as perspective-neutral\ndescription. Then, a systematic redundancy reduction procedure is introduced to\nderive description from perspective of a QRF. The first principle approach\nrecovers some of the results from the operational approach, but not yet include\nan important part of a quantum theory - the measurement theory. This paper is\nintended to bridge the gap. We show that the von Neumann quantum measurement\ntheory can be embedded into the perspective-neutral framework. This allows us\nto successfully recover the results found in the operational approach, with the\nadvantage that the transformation operator can be derived from the first\nprinciple. In addition, the formulation presented here reveals several\ninteresting conceptual insights. For instance, the projection operation in\nmeasurement needs to be performed after redundancy reduction. These results\nrepresent one step forward in understanding how quantum measurement should be\nformulated when the reference frame is also a quantum system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2019 07:14:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2019 07:13:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2020 06:35:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 13 Jun 2020 05:43:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jianhao M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.04906", "submitter": "Ariel Norambuena", "authors": "Ariel Norambuena, Diego Tancara, and Ra\\'ul Coto", "title": "Coding closed and open quantum systems in MATLAB: applications in\n  quantum optics and condensed matter", "comments": "26 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1361-6404/ab8360", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a package of numerical simulations implemented in MATLAB to solve\ncomplex many-body quantum systems.

The methods we compare include Quantum Annealing (QA), Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs Sampling, and Simulated Annealing (SA) as well\nas machine learning algorithms like gradient boosted decision trees. We find\nthat RBMs implemented on D-Wave hardware perform well, and that they show some\nclassification performance advantages on small datasets, but they don't offer a\nbroadly strategic advantage for this task.

The eikonal model diverges for Coulomb breakup since it relies\non the adiabatic approximation. To correct this weakness, a Coulomb-corrected\neikonal method (CCE) using the Coulomb first-order-perturbation approximation\nwas developed.\n  Purpose: Since the CCE mixes two reaction models and treats the Coulomb and\nnuclear interactions on different footings, we study here an alternative\napproach. We develop a simplification to the dynamical eikonal approximation\n(S-DEA) which has a similar numerical cost as the usual eikonal model, and\nstudy its efficiency for both nuclear- and Coulomb-dominated breakup reactions.\n  Methods: We compare the energy and parallel-momentum cross sections obtained\nwith the dynamical eikonal approximation, the usual eikonal approximation, the\nCCE and the S-DEA.\n  Results: The S-DEA leads to precise energy distributions for both breakup\nreactions. The corresponding parallel-momentum distributions obtained with the\nS-DEA are improved compared to the ones computed with the eikonal model. It is\nmore efficient for nuclear-dominated breakup than the CCE since it reproduces\nbetter the shape and magnitude of the distribution. However, for the Coulomb\nbreakup, the distribution lacks asymmetry.\n  Conclusions: The simplification of the DEA developed in this work improves\nsignificantly the eikonal descriptions of breakup energy distribution for both\nCoulomb- and nuclear-dominated reactions. The asymmetry of the\nparallel-momentum distribution is enhanced for nuclear-dominated breakup. This\nstudy confirms that the asymmetry is due to dynamical effects.

The feasibility and performance of this algorithm depend\ncritically on the form of the wavefunction ansatz. Recently in Nat.

This algorithm relies heavily on a predefined\noperator pool with which it builds the ansatz. However, Nat.

In addition, the pool used in that work leads\nto state preparation circuits that are too deep for a practical application on\nnear-term devices. Here, we address all these key outstanding issues of the\nalgorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that\ndrastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to\ncontain the operators necessary to construct exact ans\\\"atze.

It is then interesting to\nsee what is the interpretation of the classical phase transition in the random\nbond Ising model within the framework of the above duality and whether such an\ninterpretation has any connection to the error threshold of the corresponding\ntopological CSS code. In this paper, we consider the above duality relation\nspecifically for a two-dimensional random bond Ising model. We show that the\norder parameter of this classical system is mapped to a coherence order\nparameter in a noisy Toric code model. In particular, a quantum phase\ntransition from a coherent phase to a non-coherent phase occurs when the\ninitial coherent state is affected by two sequences of bit-flip quantum\nchannels where a quenched disorder is induced by measurement of the errors\nafter the first channel. On the other hand, the above transition is directly\nrelated to error threshold of the Toric code model. Accordingly, and since the\nnoisy process can be applied to other topological CSS states, we conclude that\nthe dual correspondence can also provide a useful tool for the study of error\nthresholds in different topological CSS codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2019 10:26:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zarei", "Mohammad Hossein", ""], ["Ramezanpour", "Abolfazl", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10555", "submitter": "Volodymyr Gorkavenko", "authors": "Yurii A.

QAOA\nis a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximately solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems. The quality of the solution obtained by\nQAOA for a given problem instance depends on the performance of the classical\noptimizer used to optimize the variational parameters. In this paper, we\nformulate the problem of finding optimal QAOA parameters as a learning task in\nwhich the knowledge gained from solving training instances can be leveraged to\nfind high-quality solutions for unseen test instances. To this end, we develop\ntwo machine-learning-based approaches. Our first approach adopts a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn a policy network to optimize\nQAOA circuits. Our second approach adopts a kernel density estimation (KDE)\ntechnique to learn a generative model of optimal QAOA parameters. In both\napproaches, the training procedure is performed on small-sized problem\ninstances that can be simulated on a classical computer; yet the learned RL\npolicy and the generative model can be used to efficiently solve larger\nproblems.

We study a variation of the\ndisordered-Heisenberg model, which is known to exhibit an MBL phase [5][6],\nknown as the quasi-Heisenberg model. Our model is a variation of the\nquasi-Heisenberg model with fields in both x and y directions.

To determine the characteristics of the\nsystem when transitioning from the ergodic to MBL phase, we calculate the\nquantities: entanglement entropy, adjacent gap ratio, and the probability\ndistributions for both. We calculate the aforementioned quantities through the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system's Hamiltonian, which are obtained\nthrough exact diagonalization.

The method radically expands the scope of the input-output\ntheory, which was originally proposed to treat quantum optic problems. Based on\nthe GIOM we derive a Langevin-type equation of motion for molecular operators,\nwhich posses a great generality and accuracy, and permits the derivation of a\nstationary charge current expression involving only two types of transfer\nrates. Furthermore, we devise the so-called \"Polaron Transport in Electronic\nResonance\" (PoTER) approximation, which allows to feasibly simulate electron\ndynamics in generic tight-binding models with strong electron-vibration\ninteractions. For short chains, the charge current reduces to known limits and\nreasonably agrees with exact numerical simulations. For extended junctions the\ncurrent displays a turnover from phonon-assisted to phonon-suppressed\ntransport. Nevertheless, the onset of ohmic behavior requires extensions beyond\nthe PoTER approximation. As an additional application, we consider a\ncavity-coupled molecule junction. Here we identify a cavity-induced suppression\nof charge current in the single-site case, and observe signatures of polariton\nformation in the current-voltage characteristics in the strong light-matter\ncoupling regime. A critical understanding gained from the GIOM-PoTER scheme is\nthat the single-site vibrationally-coupled model is deceptively simpler, and\namenable to approximations than multi-site models. Therefore, benchmarking of\nmethods should not be concluded with the single-site case.

Another\nchallenging aspect is that parameters governing the performance of various\noperations tend to drift over time, and monitoring these is hence a difficult\ntask. One of the most promising characterization techniques, gate set\ntomography (GST), provides a self-consistent estimate of the completely\npositive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps for a complete set of gates, as well as\npreparation and measurement operators. We develop a method for performance\noptimization seeded by tomography (POST), which couples the power of GST with a\nclassical optimization routine to achieve a consistent gate improvement in just\na short number of steps within a given calibration cycle. By construction, the\nPOST procedure finds the best available gate operation given the hardware, and\nis therefore robust to the effects of drift.

To demonstrate the performance of this method on a real quantum computer,\nwe map out the operations of six qubit pairs on the superconducting\n\\emph{ibmq\\_poughkeepsie} quantum device. Under the restriction of logical-only\ncontrol, we monitor the performance of the POST approach on a chosen CNOT gate\nover a period of six weeks.
