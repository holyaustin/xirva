The theory of contextual values extends the well-established\ntheory of generalized state measurements by bridging the gap between partial\nstate collapse and the observables that represent physically relevant\ninformation about the system. To emphasize the general utility of the concept,\nwe first construct the full theory of contextual values within an operational\nformulation of classical probability theory, paying special attention to\nobservable construction, detector coupling, generalized measurement, and\nmeasurement disturbance. We then extend the results to quantum probability\ntheory built as a superstructure on the classical theory, pointing out both the\nclassical correspondences to and the full quantum generalizations of both\nL\\\"uder's rule and the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz rule in the process. We find\nin both cases that the contextual values of a system observable form a\ngeneralized spectrum that is associated with the independent outcomes of a\npartially correlated and generally ambiguous detector; the eigenvalues are a\nspecial case when the detector is perfectly correlated and unambiguous. To\nillustrate the approach, we apply the technique to both a classical example of\nmarble color detection and a quantum example of polarization detection.

Even though almost all the\nstudies of quantum correlations at quantum phase transitions deal only with\nentanglement, we here argue that Bell inequalities can also reveal a general\nquantum phase transition. This is also shown for a particular case of two\nspin-1/2 particles in an infinite one-dimensional chain described by the XXZ\nmodel. In this case, the Bell inequality is able to signal not only the\nfirst-order phase transition, but also the infinite-order Kosterlitz-Thouless\nquantum phase transition, which cannot be revealed either by the energy of the\nsystem nor by the bipartite entanglement. We also show that although the\nnearest-neighbor spins are entangled, they, unexpectedly, never violate the\nBell inequality.

The generic cost of quantum algorithms for\nthese problems is determined by the inverse spectral gap of H for that\neigenstate and the cost of evolving with H for some fixed time. The goal of\nspectral gap amplification is to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the same\neigenstate as H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring that constant-time\nevolutions with H' and H are implemented with nearly the same cost. We show\nthat a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible when H satisfies a\nfrustration-free property and give H' for these cases. This results in quantum\nspeedups for optimization problems. It also yields improved constructions for\nadiabatic simulations of quantum circuits and for the preparation of projected\nentangled pair states (PEPS), which play an important role in quantum many-body\nphysics. Defining a suitable black-box model, we establish that the quadratic\namplification is optimal for frustration-free Hamiltonians and that no spectral\ngap amplification is possible, in general, if the frustration-free property is\nremoved. A corollary is that finding a similarity transformation between a\nstoquastic Hamiltonian and the corresponding stochastic matrix is hard in the\nblack-box model, setting limits to the power of some classical methods that\nsimulate quantum adiabatic evolutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Oct 2011 20:04:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 18:23:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 21:41:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Somma", "Rolando D.", ""], ["Boixo", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2514", "submitter": "Michael Cuffaro", "authors": "Michael Cuffaro", "title": "Many Worlds, the Cluster-state Quantum Computer, and the Problem of the\n  Preferred Basis", "comments": "Added doi, acknowledgements, miscellaneous typo corrections", "journal-ref": "Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 43 (2012),\n  35-42", "doi": "10.1016/j.shpsb.2011.11.007", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.hist-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  I argue that the many worlds explanation of quantum computation is not\nlicensed by, and in fact is conceptually inferior to, the many worlds\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics from which it is derived.

On the other hand, recent progress in\ncosmology has led to the \"multiverse\" picture, in which our observed universe\nis only one of the many, bringing an apparent arbitrariness in defining\nprobabilities, called the measure problem.\n  In this paper, we discuss how these two problems are intimately related with\neach other, developing a complete picture for quantum measurement and\ncosmological histories in the quantum mechanical universe. On one hand, quantum\nmechanics eliminates the arbitrariness of defining probabilities in the\nmultiverse, as discussed in arXiv:1104.2324. On the other hand, the multiverse\nallows for understanding why we observe an ordered world obeying consistent\nlaws of physics, by providing an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This\nresults in the irreversibility of quantum measurement, despite the fact that\nthe evolution of the multiverse state is unitary.\n  In order to describe the cosmological dynamics correctly, we need to identify\nthe structure of the Hilbert space for a system with gravity. We argue that in\norder to keep spacetime locality, the Hilbert space for dynamical spacetime\nmust be defined only in restricted spacetime regions: in and on the (stretched)\napparent horizon as viewed from a fixed reference frame. This requirement\narises from eliminating all the redundancies and overcountings in a general\nrelativistic, global spacetime description of nature. It is responsible for\nhorizon complementarity as well as the \"observer dependence\" of\nhorizons/spacetime---these phenomena arise to represent changes of the\nreference frame in the relevant Hilbert space.

The\ndynamics of the system is thereby fully described by a stochastic differential\nequation and the desired master equation would be acquired with statistical\naveraging. It is shown that the existence of a closed-form master equation\ndepends on the specificity of the system as well as the feature of the\ndissipation characterized by the spectral density function. For a dissipative\nharmonic oscillator it is observed that the correlation between the stochastic\nfield due to the bath and the system can be decoupled and the master equation\nnaturally comes out. Such an equation possesses the Lindblad form in which time\ndependent coefficients are determined by a set of integral equations. It is\nproved that the obtained master equation is equivalent to the well-known\nHu-Paz-Zhang equation based on the path integral technique.

In this thesis the\nentanglement of symmetric multipartite states is categorised, with a particular\nfocus on the pure multi-qubit case and the geometric measure of entanglement.\nAn essential tool for this analysis is the Majorana representation, a\ngeneralisation of the single-qubit Bloch sphere representation, which allows\nfor a unique representation of symmetric n qubit states by n points on the\nsurface of a sphere. Here this representation is employed to search for the\nmaximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits in terms of the\ngeometric measure, and an intuitive visual understanding of the upper bound on\nthe maximal symmetric entanglement is given. Furthermore, it will be seen that\nthe Majorana representation facilitates the characterisation of entanglement\nequivalence classes such as Stochastic Local Operations and Classical\nCommunication (SLOCC) and the Degeneracy Configuration (DC). It is found that\nSLOCC operations between symmetric states can be described by the Mobius\ntransformations of complex analysis, which allows for a clear visualisation of\nthe SLOCC freedoms and facilitates the understanding of SLOCC invariants and\nequivalence classes. In particular, explicit forms of representative states for\nall symmetric SLOCC classes of up to 5 qubits are derived.

Empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable\nsituations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the\nrandom walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this\nreason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the\nformalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism',\nelaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the\nstock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual\nsystem where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks\nprices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain\nthat a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but\nits value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the\ntrading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the\nnon-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.\nThen, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'\nthat describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is\nintuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until\nit is traded. This result is relevant in our opinion since it provides a\ntheoretical support to the use of quantum models in finance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 20:40:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["D'Hooghe", "Bart", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5351", "submitter": "Christopher Osborn", "authors": "G.

One can also ask a related\nquestion, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected\nprograms, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more\nprograms for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern\ncomputational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles\nrelative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family\nof functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior\ncan be quantumly copy-protected.

Moving beyond the oracle world, we also\npresent an explicit candidate scheme for publicly-verifiable quantum money,\nbased on random stabilizer states; as well as two explicit schemes for\ncopy-protecting the family of point functions.

Time observables are interesting quantities in quantum\ntheory because they often cannot be associated with self-adjoint operators.\nTheir definition therefore touches on foundational issues in quantum theory.\n  Various operational approaches to defining time observables have been\nproposed in the past. Two of the most common are those based on pulsed\nmeasurements in the form of strings of projection operators and continuous\nmeasurements in the form of complex potentials. One of the major achievements\nof this thesis is to prove that these two operational approaches are\nequivalent.\n  However operational approaches are somewhat unsatisfying by themselves. To\nprovide a definition of time observables which is not linked to a particular\nmeasurement scheme we employ the decoherent, or consistent, histories approach\nto quantum theory. We focus on the arrival time, one particular example of a\ntime observable, and we use the relationship between pulsed and continuous\nmeasurements to relate the decoherent histories approach to one based on\ncomplex potentials. This lets us compute the arrival time probability\ndistribution in decoherent histories and we show that it agrees with\nsemiclassical expectations in the right limit. We do this both for a free\nparticle and for a particle coupled to an environment.\n  Finally, we consider how the results discussed in this thesis relate to those\nderived by coupling a particle to a model clock.

In\nreexamining the postulates of standard quantum measurement theory, we\ninvestigate how they may formally generalized, going beyond the description in\nterms of selfadjoint operators and projective measurements, and how this leads\nto the introduction of generalized measurements, probability operator-valued\nmeasures (POVM) and detection operators. We then state and prove the Naimark\ntheorem, which elucidates the connections between generalized and standard\nmeasurements and illustrates how a generalized measurement may be physically\nimplemented. The \"impossibility\" of a joint measurement of two non commuting\nobservables is revisited and its canonical implementations as a generalized\nmeasurement is described in some details. Finally, we address the basic\nproperties, usually captured by the request of unitarity, that a map\ntransforming quantum states into quantum states should satisfy to be physically\nadmissible, and introduce the notion of complete positivity (CP). We then state\nand prove the Stinespring/Kraus-Choi-Sudarshan dilation theorem and elucidate\nthe connections between the CP-maps description of quantum operations, together\nwith their operator-sum representation, and the customary unitary description\nof quantum evolution. We also address transposition as an example of positive\nmap which is not completely positive, and provide some examples of generalized\nmeasurements and quantum operations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 14:58:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Oct 2012 08:32:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Paris", "Matteo G.

We evaluate the quantum\nFisher Information (QFI) for the system undergone the Jaynes-Cummings\nevolution, considering that the probe initial state is prepared in a Fock state\nfor the oscillator and in a generic pure state for the qubit; we obtain that\nthe QFI is exactly equal to the number of excitations present in the probe\nstate. We then focus on the two subsystems, namely the qubit and the oscillator\nalone, deriving the two QFIs of the two reduced states, and comparing them with\nthe previous result. Next we focus on feasible measurements on the system, and\nwe find out that if population measurement on the qubit and Fock number\nmeasurement on the oscillator are performed together, the Cramer-Rao bound is\nsaturated, that is the corresponding Fisher Information (FI) is always equal to\nthe QFI. We compare also the performances of these measurements performed\nalone, that is when one of the two subsystem is ignored. We show that, when the\nqubit is prepared in either the ground or the excited state, the local\nmeasurements are still optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 15:15:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Genoni", "Marco G.", ""], ["Invernizzi", "Carmen", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6873", "submitter": "Shengjun Wu", "authors": "Shengjun Wu", "title": "Correlation measures in bipartite states and entanglement\n  irreversibility", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
