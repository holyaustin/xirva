Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to\nmetallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement\nstructure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental\ndifficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.\nWe investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two \"toy\" models for\ncoherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated\nthree-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum\ncircuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,\ninteracting fermion problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be\ntuned to have no interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson\nmodel. We show that the long-time states of driven noninteracting fermions\nexhibit volume-law mutual information and entanglement, both for our random\ncircuit model and for the nonequilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model.\nWith interactions, the random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches\nlocal equilibrium, with only short-range entanglement. These results provide a\ngeneric picture for the emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven\nquantum-chaotic systems, and also provide examples of stable, highly-entangled\nmany-body states out of equilibrium.

The strength of this optically induced\nfield can be controlled by the excitation light polarization.

Adding this assumption clarifies how different interpretations of\nquantum theory fit in, i.e., which properties they violate. Finally, we show\nhow most of the axioms of classical modal logic break down in quantum settings,\nand attempt to generalize them. Namely, we introduce constructions of trust and\ncontext, which highlight the importance of an exact structure of trust\nrelations between agents. We propose a challenge to the community: to find\nconditions for the validity of trust relations, strong enough to exorcise the\nparadox and weak enough to still recover classical logic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 18:00:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2019 05:39:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Nurgalieva", "Nuriya", ""], ["del Rio", "L\u00eddia", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.01114", "submitter": "Hatem Barghathi", "authors": "Hatem Barghathi, C.

However, Timothy\nWallstrom and others have emphasized that SM runs into the problem that it\ncannot recover the Schroedinger equation of QM unless an ad hoc quantization\ncondition is assumed. In this thesis, I reformulate SM so that the quantization\ncondition arises as a natural consequence of the classical point particles\ninteracting with the classical-like ether. This is done by combining SM with a\nproposal by Louis de Broglie and David Bohm, in which an elementary particle in\nits rest frame is viewed as a localized periodic phenomenon of fixed frequency,\nfrom which it follows that the phase of the periodic phenomenon in the lab\nframe satisfies a relation that's equivalent to the quantization condition. In\ndoing so, I argue that SM can once again be regarded as a viable approach to\nreconstructing QM. In addition, I show that SM yields novel and empirically\nviable models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, simply by\nincorporating classical Newtonian gravitational and electrostatic interactions\nbetween the particles. I also show how the Schroedinger-Newton equation and the\nSchroedinger-Coulomb equation arise as mean-field approximations from within\nthese SM models of semiclassical Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics, and how\nclassical Newtonian gravity can be recovered from an appropriate center-of-mass\ndescription of many interacting SM particles. Finally, I argue that SM has\ndistinct advantages over the standard and other heterodox approaches to\ncombining quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity semiclassically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2018 18:45:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Derakhshani", "Maaneli", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.01397", "submitter": "Katherine Jones-Smith", "authors": "Katherine Jones-Smith, Harsh Mathur, Ashton Lowenstein", "title": "The Effect of Forcing on Vacuum Radiation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vacuum radiation has been the subject of theoretical study in both cosmology\nand condensed matter physics for many decades. Recently there has been\nimpressive progress in experimental realizations as well. Here we study vacuum\nradiation when a field mode is driven both parametrically and by a classical\nsource. We find that in the Heisenberg picture the field operators of the mode\nundergo a Bogolyubov transformation combined with a displacement, in the\nSchr\\\"odinger picture the oscillator evolves from the vacuum to a squeezed\ncoherent state. Whereas the Bogolyubov transformation is the same as would be\nobtained if only the parametric drive were applied the displacement is\ndetermined by both the parametric drive and the force. If the force is applied\nwell after the parametric drive then the displacement is the same as would be\nobtained by the action of the force alone and it is essentially independent of\n$t_f$, the time lag between the application of the force and the parametric\ndrive. If the force is applied well before the parametric drive the\ndisplacement is found to oscillate as a function of $t_f$. This behavior can be\nunderstood in terms of quantum interference. A rich variety of behavior is\nobserved for intermediate values of $t_f$. The oscillations can turn off\nsmoothly or grow dramatically and decrease depending on strength of the\nparametric drive and force and the durations for which they are applied. The\ndisplacement depends only on the Fourier component of the force at a single\nresonant frequency when the forcing and the parametric drive are well separated\nin time.

The joint probability\ndistribution for the possible spin outcomes for two particles with coupled\nspins is examined. Contrasting conclusions are made: (i) Under the frequentist\ninterpretation, the QM spin distribution implies a widely-discussed\nnon-locality because probabilistic conditioning on a spin measurement is viewed\nas corresponding to a causal influence. Under the Bayesian interpretation, this\nconditioning is viewed as providing information relevant to the spin\nprobabilities and the argument for non-locality loses its force. (ii) The\nfrequentist interpretation leads to the locality condition used by John Bell in\n1964 to establish conditions for the existence of hidden variables behind the\nspin probability distribution but this condition is not consistent with the\nproduct (Bayes) rule of probability theory. Under the Bayesian interpretation,\nthere is no motivation for this locality condition and a new stochastic\nhidden-variable model is given that reproduces the spin distribution. (iii)\nBell's original 1964 inequality provides a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a third-order joint probability distribution for three spin\nvariables that is compatible through marginalization with the second-order\njoint distributions for the three possible spin pairs. Bell's inequality is\nlogically equivalent to the 1969 CHSH inequality that involves expectations of\nfour pairs of four spin variables; the CHSH inequality must be satisfied in\norder for a fourth-order joint probability distribution for the four spin\nvariables to exist.

We\nprovide a complete answer to these questions, by identifying provably optimal\nprotocols for both classical and quantum sources of randomness, based on a\ndephasing construction. We find that in order to implement any noisy transition\non a $d$-dimensional quantum system it is necessary and sufficient to have a\nquantum source of randomness of dimension $\\sqrt{d}$ or a classical one of\ndimension $d$. Interestingly, coherences provided by quantum states in a source\nof randomness offer a quadratic advantage. The process we construct has the\nadditional features to be robust and catalytic, i.e., the source of randomness\ncan be re-used. Building upon this formal framework, we illustrate that this\ndephasing construction can serve as a useful primitive in both equilibration\nand quantum information theory: We discuss applications describing the smallest\nmeasurement device, capturing the smallest equilibrating environment allowed by\nquantum mechanics, or forming the basis for a cryptographic private quantum\nchannel. We complement the exact analysis with a discussion of approximate\nprotocols based on quantum expanders deriving from discrete Weyl systems.

This appears to be the most\ngeneric occurrence of QAR in quantum systems. The vicinity of QAR is shown to\ncorrespond semiclassically to SWC.

Using an effective\nHamiltonian, we first show why the transition amplitudes that increase\noccupation numbers are exponentially suppressed and how a very special family\nof classicalizing theories compensates this suppression. This is thanks to a\nlarge micro-state entropy generated by the emergent gapless modes around the\nfinal classical state. The dressing of the process by the super-soft quanta of\nthese modes compensates the exponential suppression of the transition\nprobability. Hence, an unsuppressed classicalization takes place exclusively\ninto the states of exponentially enhanced memory storage capacity. Next, we\ndescribe this phenomenon in the language of a quantum neural network, in which\nthe neurons are represented as interconnected quantum modes with gravity-like\nnegative-energy synaptic connections. We show that upon an injection of energy\nin form of a hard quantum stimulus, the network reaches the classicalized state\nof exponentially enhanced memory capacity with order one probability. We\nconstruct a simple model in which the transition results into classical states\nthat carry an area-law micro-state entropy.

Starting from these\nstates, one may define a family of quantum channels, known as the Holevo-Werner\nchannels, which themselves afford several unusual properties. In this paper we\nuse the teleportation covariance of these channels to upper bound their two-way\nassisted quantum and secret-key capacities. This bound may be expressed in\nterms of relative entropy distances, such as the relative entropy of\nentanglement, and also in terms of the squashed entanglement. Most\ninterestingly, we show that the relative entropy bounds are strictly\nsub-additive for a sub-class of the Holevo-Werner channels, so that their\nregularisation provides a tighter performance. These information-theoretic\nresults are first found for point-to-point communication and then extended to\nrepeater chains and quantum networks, under different types of routing\nstrategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 18:00:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Cope", "Thomas P.

By virtue of the\nCayley-Hamilton theorem for characteristic polynomials and the\nCoulson-Rushbrooke pairing theorem for alternant hydrocarbons, it is possible\nto derive a finite series expansion of the Green's function for electron\ntransmission in terms of the odd powers of the vertex adjacency matrix or\nH{\\\"u}ckel matrix. This means that only odd-length walks on a molecular graph\ncontribute to the conductivity through a molecule. Thus, if there are only\neven-length walks between two atoms, quantum interference is expected to occur\nin the electron transport between them. However, even if there are only\nodd-length walks between two atoms, a situation may come about where the\ncontributions to the QI of some odd-length walks are canceled by others,\nleading to another class of quantum interference. For non-alternant\nhydrocarbons, the finite Green's function expansion may include both even and\nodd powers. Nevertheless, QI can in some circumstances come about for\nnon-alternants, from the cancellation of odd and even-length walk terms.

Here we develop a general framework of\nprobabilistic distillation of quantum coherence in a one-shot setting,\nestablishing fundamental limitations for different classes of free operations.\nWe first provide a geometric interpretation for the maximal success\nprobability, showing that under maximally incoherent operations (MIO) and\ndephasing-covariant incoherent operations (DIO) the problem can be simplified\ninto efficiently computable semidefinite programs. Exploiting these results, we\nfind that DIO and its subset of strictly incoherent operations (SIO) have equal\npower in probabilistic distillation of coherence from pure input states, while\nMIO are strictly stronger. We then prove a fundamental no-go result: distilling\ncoherence from any full-rank state is impossible even probabilistically. We\nfurther find that in some conditions the maximal success probability can vanish\nsuddenly beyond a certain threshold in the distillation fidelity. Finally, we\nconsider probabilistic coherence distillation assisted by a catalyst and\ndemonstrate, with specific examples, its superiority to the unassisted and\ndeterministic cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2018 12:07:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 03:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Fang", "Kun", ""], ["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Lami", "Ludovico", ""], ["Regula", "Bartosz", ""], ["Adesso", "Gerardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09505", "submitter": "Daiki Ueda", "authors": "Kiyoharu Kawana and Daiki Ueda", "title": "Amplification of gravitational motion via Quantum weak measurement", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.quant-gas gr-qc hep-ph hep-th", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate a new experimental possibility of measuring the Newtonian\ngravitational constant $G$ by using the weak measurement.

These\nresults are the consequence of the asymmetry of this system and the decoherence\ndriven by the common reservoir.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 07:52:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hama", "Yusuke", ""], ["Yukawa", "Emi", ""], ["Munro", "William J.", ""], ["Nemoto", "Kae", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09934", "submitter": "Junggi Yoon", "authors": "Tomoki Nosaka, Dario Rosa and Junggi Yoon", "title": "Thouless time for mass-deformed SYK", "comments": "44 pages, many figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/JHEP09(2018)041", "report-no": "KIAS-P18037", "categories": "hep-th cond-mat.str-el nlin.CD quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the onset of RMT dynamics in the mass-deformed SYK model (i.e. an\nSYK model deformed by a quadratic random interaction) in terms of the strength\nof the quadratic deformation.

However, all existing\nrealizations of time-bin entanglement suffer from an intrinsic postselection\nloophole, which undermines their usefulness. Here, we report the first\nexperimental violation of Bell's inequality with \"genuine\" time-bin\nentanglement, free of the postselection loophole. We introduced a novel\nfunction of the interferometers at the two measurement stations, that operate\nas fast synchronized optical switches. This scheme allowed to obtain a\npostselection-loophole-free Bell violation of more than nine standard\ndeviations.
