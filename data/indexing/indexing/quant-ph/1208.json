As\nexpected from the analogy with a particle in a double-well potential,\ntransitions between these states become possible either at finite temperature,\nor in the quantum regime due to tunneling. In this analogy, besides local\nstability, one can also discuss global stability by comparing the two potential\nminima. For the Duffing oscillator, the stationary states emerge dynamically so\nthat a priori, a potential-minimum criterion for them does not exist. However,\nglobal stability is still relevant, and definable as the state containing the\nmajority population for long times, low temperature, and close to the classical\nlimit. Further, the crossover point is the parameter value at which global\nstability abruptly changes from one state to the other.\n  For the double-well model, the crossover point is defined by\npotential-minimum degeneracy. Given that this analogy is so effective in other\nrespects, it is thus striking that for the Duffing oscillator, the crossover\npoint turns out to be non-unique. Rather, none of the three aforementioned\nlimits commute with each other, and the limiting behaviour depends on the order\nin which they are taken. More generally, as both $\\hbar\\To0$ and $T\\To0$, the\nratio $\\hbar\\omega_0/k_\\mathrm{B}T$ continues to be a key parameter and can\nhave any nonnegative value. This points to an apparent conceptual difference\nbetween equilibrium and nonequilibrium tunneling.

In this\nintroduction paper, at first, it is explicitly explained what is the main\nmisconception in the claim of the unconditional security for QKD theory. In\ngeneral terms, the cause of the misunderstanding on the security claim is the\nLemma in the paper of Renner. It suggests that the generation of the perfect\nrandom key is assured by the probability $ (1-d)$, and its failure probability\nis $d$. Thus, it concludes that the generated key provides the perfect random\nkey sequence when the protocol suceeds. So the QKD provides perfect secrecy to\nthe one time pad. This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the\nquantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability\nfor such an event. If $d $ is not small enough, always the generated key\nsequence is not uniform. Now one needs the reconstruction of the evaluation of\nthe trace distance if one wants to use it. One should first go back to the\nindistinguishability theory in the computational complexity based, and to\nclarify the meaning of the value of the variational distance. In addition, the\nsame analysis for the information theoretic case is necessary. The recent\nserial papers by H.P.Yuen have given the answer on such questions. In this\npaper, we show more concise description of Yuen's theory, and clarify that the\nrecent upper bound theories for the trace distance by Tomamichel et al and\nHayashi et al are constructed based on the reasoning of Renner and it is\nunsuitable as the analysis for information theoretic security.

The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is essential for the\nappearance of unpaired Majorana fermions.

Practical use is limited to emission situations where slope\ncorrection factors can be reliably predicted. By making a series of\nwell-defined assumptions and approximations, it is shown how the general\nformulas reduce to provide an improved theory of orthodox FN-plot data\nanalysis. This applies to situations where the circuit current is fully\ncontrolled by the emitter characteristics, and tunneling can be treated as\ntaking place through a Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier. For orthodox emission,\ngood working formulas make numerical evaluation of the slope correction factor\nand the new intercept correction factor quick and straightforward. A numerical\nillustration, using simulated emission data, shows how to use this improved\napproach to derive values for parameters in the full FN-type equation for the\nSN barrier.

In the context of ordered qubit registers this scheme\nfinds a natural translation in terms of global operations, and single particle\nmeasurements on the edge of the array. Two applications of this scheme are\npresented. First, through appropriate Wick rotations, those amplitudes can be\nanalytically continued to yield estimates for partition functions of Ising\nmodels. Bounds on the estimation error, valid with high confidence, are\nprovided through a central-limit theorem, which validity extends beyond the\npresent context. It holds for example for estimations of the Jones polynomial.\nInterestingly, the kind of state preparations and measurements involved in this\napplication can in principle be made \"instantaneous\", i.e. independent of the\nsystem size or the parameters being simulated. Second, the scheme allows to\naccurately estimate some non-trivial invariants of links. A third result\nconcerns the computational power of estimations of partition functions for real\ntemperature classical ferromagnetic Ising models on a square lattice. We\nprovide conditions under which estimating such partition functions allows one\nto reconstruct scattering amplitudes of quantum circuits making the problem\nBQP-hard. Using this mapping, we show that fidelity overlaps for ground states\nof quantum Hamiltonians, which serve as a witness to quantum phase transitions,\ncan be estimated from classical Ising model partition functions.

This model enabled us\nto use a single trapped ion as a sensitive probe for strong, non-Gaussian,\ndiscrete magnetic field noise. To overcome ambiguities arising from the\nnon-linear character of strong noise, we develop a three step noise\ncharacterization scheme: peak identification, magnitude identification and\nfine-tuning. Finally, we compare experimentally equidistant versus Uhrig pulse\nschemes for spectral analysis. The method is readily available to any quantum\nprobe which can be coherently manipulated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2012 14:09:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kotler", "Shlomi", ""], ["Akerman", "Nitzan", ""], ["Glickman", "Yinnon", ""], ["Ozeri", "Roee", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.4028", "submitter": "A.

How should be an answer to this question? At\nthis level, we are so deep that all our concepts are obscure. Quantum theory\n(QT) is at this level. The quest for interpreting it fails because the clarity\nof our actual fundamental concepts in ordinary language cannot match the\nprecision of the theory's mathematical formalism. The interpretation of quantum\nmechanics should define and bring clarity to fundamental concepts; not simply\nrely over them. Quantum theory requires a new worldview, the one that will make\nit understandable. We discuss on the formulation and interpretation of closed,\nand final theories, in other words, completely axiomatic theories that define\ntheir own conceptual framework, and closed theories that cannot be made\nsimpler. We claim that everything we can properly say about a theory follows\nfrom its interpretation, and that interpreting is saying the meaning of each of\nits mathematical statements. We argue that quantum mechanics is a closed\ntheory; and, therefore, that part of it is part of the final or fundamental\ntheory of physics (FTP). We propose a new entirely axiomatic formulation of\npart of quantum theory (including all its mathematical framework) in which new\npowerful and useful elements are added to the existing formalism. Our\ninterpretation is straightforward: it allows us reading or saying the meaning\nof each of the theory's axiom, theorem or element. We state that the proposed\ntheory is the FTP. Its interpretation may dissolve most of the existing\nparadoxes around QT. The principle of excluded middle is not valid in general.\nBoth epistemic and ontic elements are present in the theory since it is a\ntheory of knowledge and truth. This and other fundamental concepts are defined\nby the theory, which can represent both reality and our knowledge about it.\nAesthetics is one of its key features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2012 03:05:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 15:30:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Pfrimer", "Frederico R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.4491", "submitter": "Usha Devi A.

This symmetry underlies\nthe conservation of optical helicity, and, as we show here, is closely related\nto the separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of light (the helicity\nflux coincides with the spin angular momentum). However, in the standard\nfield-theory formulation of electromagnetism, the field Lagrangian is not dual\nsymmetric. This leads to problematic dual-asymmetric forms of the canonical\nenergy-momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum tensors. Moreover, we show\nthat the components of these tensors conflict with the helicity and energy\nconservation laws. To resolve this discrepancy between the symmetries of the\nLagrangian and Maxwell equations, we put forward a dual-symmetric Lagrangian\nformulation of classical electromagnetism. This dual electromagnetism preserves\nthe form of Maxwell equations, yields meaningful canonical energy-momentum and\nangular momentum tensors, and ensures a self-consistent separation of the spin\nand orbital degrees of freedom. This provides rigorous derivation of results\nsuggested in other recent approaches. We make the Noether analysis of the dual\nsymmetry and all the Poincar\\'e symmetries, examine both local and integral\nconserved quantities, and show that only the dual electromagnetism naturally\nproduces a complete self-consistent set of conservation laws.

However, quantum mechanics\nimposes a fundamental limit on how well different coher- ent states can be\ndistinguished, even with perfect detectors, and limits such discrimination to\nhave a finite minimum probability of error. While conventional optical\nreceivers lead to error rates well above this fundamental limit, Dolinar found\nan explicit receiver design involving optical feedback and photon counting that\ncan achieve the minimum probability of error for discriminating any two given\ncoherent states. The generalization of this construction to larger sets of\ncoherent states has proven to be challenging, evidencing that there may be a\nlimitation inherent to a linear-optics-based adaptive measurement strategy.

Far from just being puzzling constraints on\nour ability to know the state of a quantum system, uncertainty relations are at\nthe heart of why some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become\npossible when quantum communication is allowed. This thesis is concerned with\nstrong notions of uncertainty relations and their applications in quantum\ninformation theory.\n  One operational manifestation of such uncertainty relations is a purely\nquantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be\nviewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is\nencoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n.\nWithout the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a\nnegligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message\nis said to be \"locked\". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to\nrecover, that is \"unlock\", the message. We give new efficient constructions of\nbases satisfying strong uncertainty relations leading to the first explicit\nconstruction of an information locking scheme. We also give several other\napplications of our uncertainty relations both to cryptographic and\ncommunication tasks.\n  In addition, we define objects called QC-extractors, that can be seen as\nstrong uncertainty relations that hold against quantum adversaries. We provide\nseveral constructions of QC-extractors, and use them to prove the security of\ncryptographic protocols for two-party computations based on the sole assumption\nthat the parties' storage device is limited in transmitting quantum\ninformation.

It was shown many years ago by EPR that two\nsystems which interacted in the past and separated afterwards had to be\ndescribed in most cases by particular non-separable states which are called\nentangled. It was noticed by Zanardi et al. that a Hilbert space of possible\nstate vectors of compound physical system could be partitioned in different way\nby introducing various tensor product structures induced by the experimentally\naccessible observables (interactions and measurements). Therefore a separable\nstate in one partition could become entangled in different partition. In this\nsense the entanglement was relative to a particular set of experimental\ncapabilities.

The same claims one\nmay find in several recent papers. In this paper we will discuss in operational\nway the differences existing between separable, non-separable and entangled\nstates and we will show that the conclusions of Torre et al. were unjustified.\nA sufficient condition for entanglement is the violation of BI-CHSH and/or\nsteering inequalities.

We show that such a factorization\ninto a product of block diagonal matrices gives rise to a circuit acting on a\nHilbert space with a tensor product structure and that the permanent is equal\nto the transition amplitude of this circuit and a product basis state. In this\ncorrespondence, a block diagonal matrix gives rise to one layer of the circuit,\nwhere each block to a gate acting either on a single tensor component or on two\nadjacent tensor components.
