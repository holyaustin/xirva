It is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with various\napplications in human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, robot\nperception, traffic control, etc. In this paper, we address this problem for\nthe first time in the quantum setting, and present a quantum algorithm for VT\nbased on the framework proposed by Henriques et al. [IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal.\nMach. Intell., 7, 583 (2015)]. Our algorithm comprises two phases: training and\ndetection. In the training phase, in order to discriminate the object and\nbackground, the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum\nstate form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded\nin the amplitudes. In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to\ngenerate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the\ncandidate image patches. The algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in\nscaling, when the image data matrices have low condition numbers, and therefore\nmay achieve exponential speedup over the best classical counterpart. However,\nonly quadratic speedup can be achieved when the algorithm is applied to\nimplement the ultimate task of Henriques's framework, i.e., detecting the\nobject position. We also discuss two other important applications related to\nVT: (1) object disappearance detection and (2) motion behavior matching, where\nmuch more significant speedup over the classical methods can be achieved.

Avoiding the exponential\noverhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of\nlarger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost\non a quantum computer. To this end, we propose a variational hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm called quantum-assisted quantum compiling (QAQC).\nIn QAQC, we use the overlap between a target unitary $U$ and a trainable\nunitary $V$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. More\nprecisely, to ensure that QAQC scales well with problem size, our cost involves\nnot only the global overlap ${\\rm Tr} (V^\\dagger U)$ but also the local\noverlaps with respect to individual qubits. We introduce novel short-depth\nquantum circuits to quantify the terms in our cost function, and we prove that\nour cost cannot be efficiently approximated with a classical algorithm under\nreasonable complexity assumptions. We present both gradient-free and\ngradient-based approaches to minimizing this cost.

What can computation compute? How many steps does a\ncomputation require to solve an instance of the 3-SAT problem? Our work\naddresses the first question, by introducing a new model called the ex-machine.\nThe ex-machine executes Turing machine instructions and two special types of\ninstructions. Quantum random instructions are physically realizable with a\nquantum random number generator. Meta instructions can add new states and add\nnew instructions to the ex-machine. A countable set of ex-machines is\nconstructed, each with a finite number of states and instructions; each\nex-machine can compute a Turing incomputable language, whenever the quantum\nrandomness measurements behave like unbiased Bernoulli trials. In 1936, Alan\nTuring posed the halting problem for Turing machines and proved that this\nproblem is unsolvable for Turing machines. Consider an enumeration E_a(i) =\n(M_i, T_i) of all Turing machines M_i and initial tapes T_i. Does there exist\nan ex-machine X that has at least one evolutionary path X --> X_1 --> X_2 --> .\n. . --> X_m, so at the mth stage ex-machine X_m can correctly determine for 0\n<= i <= m whether M_i's execution on tape T_i eventually halts? We demonstrate\nan ex-machine Q(x) that has one such evolutionary path. The existence of this\nevolutionary path suggests that David Hilbert was not misguided to propose in\n1900 that mathematicians search for finite processes to help construct\nmathematical proofs. Our refinement is that we cannot use a fixed computer\nprogram that behaves according to a fixed set of mechanical rules. We must\npursue methods that exploit randomness and self-modification so that the\ncomplexity of the program can increase as it computes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 22:45:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2018 02:34:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2018 21:16:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2018 00:04:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2018 18:46:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 18:49:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 15:37:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 19:55:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Fiske", "Michael Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.01454", "submitter": "Xifeng Ren", "authors": "Ming Li, Chang-Ling Zou, Di Liu, Guo-Ping Guo, Guang-Can Guo, Xi-Feng\n  Ren", "title": "Enhanced absorption microscopy with correlated photon pairs", "comments": "7 Pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.98.012121", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By harnessing the quantum states of light for illumination, precise phase and\nabsorption estimations can be achieved with precision beyond the standard\nquantum limit.

With probabilities at hand\none also gains new insights into foundations of quantum statistical physics.\nMoreover, one can now analyze information flows responsible for decoherence.\nThese information flows explain how perception of objective classical reality\narises from the quantum substrate: Effective amplification they represent\naccounts for the objective existence of the einselected states of macroscopic\nquantum systems through the redundancy of pointer state records in their\nenvironment - through quantum Darwinism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:18:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zurek", "Wojciech Hubert", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.02105", "submitter": "Krzysztof Sacha", "authors": "Krzysztof Giergiel, Arkadiusz Kuro\\'s, and Krzysztof Sacha", "title": "Discrete Time Quasi-Crystals", "comments": "Version accepted for publication in Phys.

Probably the best known example of a Bell\ninequality is due to Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH), which is defined\nin the simplest scenario involving two dichotomic measurements and whose all\nkey properties are well understood. There have been many attempts to generalise\nthe CHSH Bell inequality to higher-dimensional quantum systems, however, for\nmost of them the maximal quantum violation---the key quantity for most\ndevice-independent applications---remains unknown. On the other hand, the\nconstructions for which the maximal quantum violation can be computed, do not\npreserve the natural property of the CHSH inequality, namely, that the maximal\nquantum violation is achieved by the maximally entangled state and measurements\ncorresponding to mutually unbiased bases. In this work we propose a novel\nfamily of Bell inequalities which exhibit precisely these properties, and whose\nmaximal quantum violation can be computed analytically. In the simplest\nscenario it recovers the CHSH Bell inequality. These inequalities involve $d$\nmeasurements settings, each having $d$ outcomes for an arbitrary prime number\n$d\\geq 3$. We then show that in the three-outcome case our Bell inequality can\nbe used to self-test the maximally entangled state of two-qutrits and three\nmutually unbiased bases at each site. Yet, we demonstrate that in the case of\nmore outcomes, their maximal violation does not allow for self-testing in the\nstandard sense, which motivates the definition of a new weak form of\nself-testing.

In this limit the so-called length-gauge transformation\nfor a fully quantized light-matter system gives rise to a dipole self-energy\nterm in the Hamiltonian, i.e., a harmonic potential of the total dipole matter\nmoment. In practice this term is often discarded as it is assumed to be\nsubsumed in the kinetic energy term. In this work we show the necessity of the\ndipole self-energy term. First and foremost, without it the light-matter system\nin the long-wavelength limit does not have a ground-state, i.e., the combined\nlight-matter system is unstable. Further, the mixing of matter and photon\ndegrees of freedom due to the length-gauge transformation, which also changes\nthe representation of the translation operator for matter, gives rise to the\nMaxwell equations in matter and the omittance of the dipole self-energy leads\nto a violation of these equations. Specifically we show that without the dipole\nself-energy the so-called 'depolarization shift' is not properly described.\nFinally we show that this term also arises if we perform the semi-classical\nlimit after the length-gauge transformation. In contrast to the standard\napproach where the semi-classical limit is performed before the length-gauge\ntransformation, the resulting Hamiltonian is bounded from below and thus\nsupports ground-states. This is very important for practical calculations and\nfor density-functional variational implementations of the non-relativistic QED\nformalism.

Here, we\ntheoretically present a novel scheme for eliminating the dynamical phase by\ntaking advantage of chiral symmetry in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,\nand experimentally observe DPTs by directly measuring PGP in a quenched\ntopological nanomechanical lattice. Time-dependent topological structures of\nthe SSH model are configured by eight strong-coupled high-quality-factor\nnanomechanical oscillators. By measuring the vibration phase and the normalized\namplitude of the edge oscillator, we show a direct classical analog of DPTs.\nFurthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the robustness of DPTs against weak\nstructure disorders, and numerically explore the relation between DPTs and the\nequilibrium phase boundary. This work not only establishes the quantitative\nmethod to identify DPTs, but also opens the door for studying non-equilibrium\ntopological dynamics with a well-controlled nanomechanical system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2018 09:00:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Aug 2018 08:19:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2019 03:21:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Tian", ""], ["Ke", "Yongguan", ""], ["Zhang", "Liang", ""], ["Lin", "Shaochun", ""], ["Shi", "Zhifu", ""], ["Huang", "Pu", ""], ["Lee", "Chaohong", ""], ["Du", "Jiangfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.04484", "submitter": "Zhiliang Yuan", "authors": "Z.

The first part is dedicated to the analysis of causal\nstructure, which encodes the relationship between observed variables, in\ngeneral restricting the set of possible correlations between them. Our\nconsiderations rely on a recent entropy vector method. Based on this, we\ndevelop techniques for deriving entropic constraints to differentiate between\ncausal structures. We provide sufficient conditions for entropy vectors to be\nrealisable within a causal structure and derive new, improved necessary\nconditions in terms of so-called non-Shannon inequalities. We also report that\nfor a family of causal structures, including the bipartite Bell scenario and\nthe bilocal causal structure, entropy vectors are unable to distinguish between\nclassical and quantum causes, in spite of the existence of quantum correlations\nthat are not classically reproducible. Hence, further development is needed in\norder to understand cause from a quantum perspective.\n  In the second part we explore an axiomatic framework for modelling\nerror-tolerant processes in microscopic thermodynamics. Our axiomatisation\nallows for the accommodation of finite precision levels, crucial for describing\nexperiments in the microscopic regime. It leads to the emergence of manageable\nquantities that give insights into the feasibility and expenditure of\nprocesses, which for adiabatic processes are shown to be smooth entropy\nmeasures.

In this paper we develop a technique to overcome the\nDNP bottlenecks set by the slow sweeps, employing a swept microwave frequency\ncomb that increases the effective number of polarization transfer events while\nrespecting adiabaticity constraints. This allows a multiplicative gain in DNP\nenhancement, scaling with the number of comb frequencies and limited only by\nthe hyperfine-mediated electron linewidth. We demonstrate the technique for the\noptical hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in powdered microdiamonds at low\nfields, increasing the DNP enhancement from 30 to 100 measured with respect to\nthe thermal signal at 7T. For low concentrations of broad linewidth electron\nradicals, e.g. TEMPO, these multiplicative gains could exceed an order of\nmagnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jul 2018 23:49:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ajoy", "A.", ""], ["Nazaryan", "R.", ""], ["Liu", "K.", ""], ["Lv", "X.", ""], ["Safvati", "B.", ""], ["Wang", "G.", ""], ["Druga", "E.", ""], ["Reimer", "J.

The current industry standard is Clifford randomized benchmarking\n(RB), which measures a single error rate that quantifies overall performance.\nBut scaling Clifford RB to many qubits is surprisingly hard. It has only been\nperformed on 1, 2, and 3 qubits as of this writing. This reflects a fundamental\ninefficiency in Clifford RB: the $n$-qubit Clifford gates at its core have to\nbe compiled into large circuits over the 1- and 2-qubit gates native to a\ndevice. As $n$ grows, the quality of these Clifford gates quickly degrades,\nmaking Clifford RB impractical at relatively low $n$. In this Letter, we\npropose a direct RB protocol that mostly avoids compiling. Instead, it uses\nrandom circuits over the native gates in a device, seeded by an initial layer\nof Clifford-like randomization. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on\n2 -- 5 qubits, using the publicly available IBMQX5. We believe this to be the\ngreatest number of qubits holistically benchmarked, and this was achieved on a\nfreely available device without any special tuning up. Our protocol retains the\nsimplicity and convenient properties of Clifford RB: it estimates an error rate\nfrom an exponential decay. But it can be extended to processors with more\nqubits -- we present simulations on 10+ qubits -- and it reports a more\ndirectly informative and flexible error rate than the one reported by Clifford\nRB.

Actually such a quantum-classical\nmapping can not reveal the rich structures of low-energy excitations at these\nthree QCPs. So we further demonstrate that the full eigenvalue spectra of the\ntransfer operators with/without the flux insertions can describe the complete\nquantum criticalities, which are characterized by the two-dimensional\ncompactified free boson conformal field theories (CFTs) with the compactified\nradii $R=\\sqrt{6}$ for the QCPs at $\\lambda =\\pm\\sqrt{3}$ and $R=\\sqrt{8/3}$\nfor the QCP at $\\lambda =0$. For the QCP at $\\lambda =0$, there are no anyon\ncondensation, and the emerged matrix product operator symmetries result in a\nrich structure of the low-energy excitations, distinct from those of both toric\ncode and double semion phases. Finally, we discuss the possible relation\nbetween our conformal quantum criticalities and the general (2+1) spatial-time\ndimensional CFTs for quantum topological phase transitions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2018 09:04:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 08:57:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Wen-Tao", ""], ["Zhang", "Guang-Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.08497", "submitter": "Tomer Goldfriend", "authors": "Tomer Goldfriend and Jorge Kurchan", "title": "Fluctuation Theorem for Quasi-Integrable Systems", "comments": "11 pages (6 main text + 5 supplemental material); 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/124/10002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Fluctuation Theorem (FT), both Classical and Quantum, describes the\nlarge-deviations in the approach to equilibrium of an isolated quasi-integrable\nsystem.

On the other hand, at most two\nCharlies can simultaneously demonstrate genuine tripartite nonlocality with\nsingle Alice and single Bob. Hence, the present study shows that standard\ntripartite nonlocality can be simultaneously shared by larger number of\nCharlies compared to genuine tripartite nonlocality in the aforementioned\nscenario, which implies that standard tripartite nonlocality is more effective\nthan genuine tripartite nonlocality in the context of simultaneous sharing by\nmultiple observers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2018 09:19:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2019 10:14:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sutapa", ""], ["Das", "Debarshi", ""], ["Sasmal", "Souradeep", ""], ["Sarkar", "Debasis", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Kaushiki", ""], ["Roy", "Arup", ""], ["Bhattacharya", "Some Sankar", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.08515", "submitter": "Ilan Shlesinger", "authors": "Benjamin Vest, Ilan Shlesinger, Marie-Christine Dheur, Elo\\\"ise\n  Devaux, Jean-Jacques Greffet, Ga\\'etan Messin, Fran\\c{c}ois Marquier", "title": "Plasmonic interferences of two-particle N00N states", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "New J.

This localization can be understood as a consequence of the\nreturn properties of low dimensional random walks, through a mechanism\nreminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing. The charge\ndynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which\nmakes several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics.\nImportantly, these equations also predict localization in 2d fractonic\ncircuits. Immobile fractonic charge emits non-conserved operators, whose\nspreading is governed by exponents distinct to non-fractonic circuits.\nFractonic operators exhibit a short time linear growth of observable\nentanglement with saturation to an area law, as well as a subthermal volume law\nfor operator entanglement.

Here,\nwe develop the Keldysh non-linear sigma model technique to calculate these\ncorrelators in interacting disordered metals. In particular, we focus on the\nregularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\\sqrt{\\rho} A(t)\n\\sqrt{\\rho} A^\\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\\rho A(t)A^\\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where\n$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\\rho$ is the\nthermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential\ngrowth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but\nhere it involves two replicas of the system (two \"worlds\"). The intra-world\ncontributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the\ncorrelator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign\nthat exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs\ngrow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding\nmany-body Lyapunov exponents are different. For the regularized correlator, we\nreproduce an earlier perturbation theory result for the Lyapunov exponent that\nsatisfies the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound. However, the Lyapunov exponent\nof the unregularized correlator parametrically exceeds the bound. We argue that\nthe latter is not a reliable indicator of many body quantum chaos as it\ncontains additional contributions from elastic scattering events due to virtual\nprocesses that should not contribute to many-body chaos. These results bring up\nan important general question of the physical meaning of the OTOCs often used\nin calculations and proofs.

Our work is\nmotivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In\nthis model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations\nare effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic\nstates in this context. The robustness of magic measures the complexity of\nsimulating such a circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. It is\nclosely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo\nsimulations through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of\nmagic is submultiplicative. This implies that the classical simulation overhead\nscales subexponentially with the number of injected magic states - better than\na naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness of n copies\nof a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation\nproblem in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent\nsymmetries to reduce the problem to n dimensions. The total run-time of our\nalgorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially faster than\npreviously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the\nrobustness of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by\nthe exact results, we find a finite hierarchy of approximate solutions where\neach level can be evaluated in polynomial time and yields rigorous upper bounds\nto the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to\nconnect the robustness of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex\npolytope generated by certain signed quantum weight enumerators. As a\nby-product, we characterised the automorphism group of the stabiliser polytope,\nand, more generally, of projections onto complex projective 3-designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jul 2018 18:00:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:35:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2019 12:27:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Heinrich", "Markus", ""], ["Gross", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.10300", "submitter": "Raban Iten", "authors": "Raban Iten, Tony Metger, Henrik Wilming, Lidia del Rio, Renato Renner", "title": "Discovering physical concepts with neural networks", "comments": "4 pages main text + 11 pages appendix, changes since v2: improved\n  references and presentation", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The prespace structure is compared with a computational system, in\nparticular to a cellular automaton, in which space and all physical quantities\nare broken into discrete units. One way open for a prespace metaphysics can be\nfound if physics is made fully discrete.

Considering how quantum\ntheory could be made fully discrete leads naturally to a suggestion of how\nstandard linear quantum mechanics could be modified to give a solution to the\nmeasurement problem, calling this model Critical Complexity Quantum Mechanics\n(CCQM). I compare CCQM with some other proposed solutions to the measurement\nproblem, in particular, the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini,\nand Weber.

In bosonic interferometers, squeezed states, number states and\ncat states have been implemented on various platforms and have demonstrated\nimproved measurement precision over interferometers based on coherent states.\nAnother metrologically useful state is an equal superposition of two\neigenstates with maximally different energies; this state ideally reaches the\nfull interferometric sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics. By leveraging\nimprovements to our apparatus made primarily to reach higher operation\nfidelities in quantum information processing, we extend a technique to create\nnumber states up to $n=100$ and to generate superpositions of a harmonic\noscillator ground state and a number state of the form\n$\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}(\\lvert 0\\rangle+\\lvert n\\rangle)$ with $n$ up\nto 18 in the motion of a single trapped ion. While experimental imperfections\nprevent us from reaching the ideal Heisenberg limit, we observe enhanced\nsensitivity to changes in the oscillator frequency that initially increases\nlinearly with $n$, with maximal value at $n=12$ where we observe 3.2(2) dB\nhigher sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with\nthe same average occupation number. The quantum advantage from using\nnumber-state superpositions can be leveraged towards precision measurements on\nany harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the average\nfractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately\n2.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-6}$ in 5 s.

In particular, it is defined here to be the\nsmallest rate at which entanglement is required, in addition to free classical\ncommunication, in order to simulate $n$ calls to $\\mathcal{N}$, such that the\nmost general discriminator cannot distinguish the $n$ calls to $\\mathcal{N}$\nfrom the simulation. The most general discriminator is one who tests the\nchannels in a sequential manner, one after the other, and this discriminator is\nknown as a quantum tester [Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 101, 060401\n(2008)] or one who is implementing a quantum co-strategy [Gutoski et al., Symp.\nTh. Comp., 565 (2007)]. As such, the proposed revised definition of\nentanglement cost of a quantum channel leads to a rate that cannot be smaller\nthan the previous notion of a channel's entanglement cost [Berta et al., IEEE\nTrans. Inf. Theory, 59, 6779 (2013)], in which the discriminator is limited to\ndistinguishing parallel uses of the channel from the simulation. Under this\nrevised notion, I prove that the entanglement cost of certain\nteleportation-simulable channels is equal to the entanglement cost of their\nunderlying resource states. Then I find single-letter formulas for the\nentanglement cost of some fundamental channel models, including dephasing,\nerasure, three-dimensional Werner--Holevo channels, epolarizing channels\n(complements of depolarizing channels), as well as single-mode pure-loss and\npure-amplifier bosonic Gaussian channels. These examples demonstrate that the\nresource theory of entanglement for quantum channels is not reversible.\nFinally, I discuss how to generalize the basic notions to arbitrary resource\ntheories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 17:56:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2018 05:32:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:18:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}]
