We\nre-formulate the problem of decoherence control as a disturbance rejection\nscheme which also leads us to the idea of Internal Model Principle for quantum\ncontrol systems which is first of its kind in the literature.\n  It is shown that decoupling a quantum disturbance from an open quantum\nsystem, is possible only with the help of a quantum controller which takes into\naccount the model of the environmental interaction. This is demonstrated for a\nsimple 2-qubit system wherein the effects of decoherence are completely\neliminated. The theory provides conditions to be imposed on the controller to\nensure perfect decoupling. Hence the problem of decoherence control naturally\ngives rise to the quantum internal model principle which relates the\ndisturbance rejecting control to the model of the environmental interaction.\n  Classical internal model principle and disturbance decoupling focus on\ndifferent aspects viz. perfect output tracking and complete decoupling of\noutput from external disturbances respectively. However for quantum systems,\nthe two problems come together and merge in order to produce an effective\nplatform for decoherence control. In this article we introduce a seminal\nconnection between disturbance decoupling and the corresponding analog for\ninternal model principle for quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2010 17:26:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 08:43:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ganesan", "Narayan", ""], ["Tarn", "Tzyh-Jong", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.0668", "submitter": "Aaron VanDevender", "authors": "A.

Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the\nmeasurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to\nmeasure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement.\nHowever, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite\namount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement\nis necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of\ninstantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which\nonly a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever\nutilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average\nconsumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes\nthe tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system\nis in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of\neigenstates of an observable. Despite its finiteness the growth of entanglement\nconsumption is found to display an extremely unfavourable exponential of an\nexponential scaling with either the number of qubits needed to contain the\nSchmidt rank of the target state or total number of qubits in the system for an\noperator measurement. This scaling is seen to be a consequence of the\ncombination of the generic exponential scaling of unitary decompositions\ncombined with the highly recursive structure of our scheme required to overcome\nthe no-signalling constraint of relativistic causality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2010 14:55:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Aug 2010 14:46:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Clark", "S.

A new feature of these novel models is that when compared with\nthe undeformed case their solutions are usually no longer singular for an\nexchange of an amount of particles less than the dimension of the\nrepresentation space of the roots. The simultaneous scattering of all particles\nin the model leads to anyonic exchange factors for processes which have no\nanalogue in the undeformed case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2010 18:01:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fring", "Andreas", ""], ["Smith", "Monique", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.0929", "submitter": "Maurice Kibler", "authors": "Maurice Robert Kibler (IPNL)", "title": "Bases for qudits from a nonstandard approach to SU(2)", "comments": "From a talk presented at the 13th International Conference on\n  Symmetry Methods in Physics (Dubna, Russia, 6-9 July 2009) organized in\n  memory of Prof. Yurii Fedorovich Smirnov by the Bogoliubov Laboratory of\n  Theoretical Physics of the JINR and the ICAS at Yerevan State University.", "journal-ref": "13th International Conference on Symmetry Methods in Physics\n  (SYMPHYS XIII), Dubna : Russian Federation (2009)", "doi": "10.1134/S1063778811060172", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bases of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (in dimension d) of relevance for\nquantum information and quantum computation are constructed from angular\nmomentum theory and su(2) Lie algebraic methods.

Our\nderivation provides insights into the physical origin of the structure of\nquantum state spaces (including a group-theoretic explanation of the Bloch ball\nand its three-dimensionality), and it suggests several natural possibilities to\nconstruct consistent modifications of quantum theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Apr 2010 07:44:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Oct 2010 11:58:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 May 2011 08:07:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2011 19:51:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Masanes", "Lluis", ""], ["Mueller", "Markus P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1496", "submitter": "Nicolae Cotfas", "authors": "Nicolae Cotfas and Liviu Adrian Cotfas", "title": "Hypergeometric type operators and their supersymmetric partners", "comments": "New examples concerning the Poschl-Teller, Morse, Scarf, Coulomb,\n  Rosen-Morse and Eckart type potentials have been added", "journal-ref": "J.

A 2-non-universal\n2-qubit Hamiltonian can still be n-universal for some n >= 3. We give some\npartial results on 3-universality. Finally, we also show how our\ncharacterization of 2-universal Hamiltonians implies the well-known result that\nalmost any 2-qubit unitary is universal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Apr 2010 20:19:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Dec 2014 10:35:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Childs", "Andrew M.", ""], ["Leung", "Debbie", ""], ["Man\u010dinska", "Laura", ""], ["Ozols", "Maris", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1655", "submitter": "Dariusz Chruscinski", "authors": "D.

This purpose is achieved by considering a spring whose constant\n(and so its frequency) depends on the quantum states of another system.\nRecently, it is realized that by the assumption of frequency modulation of\n$\\omega$ to $\\omega\\sqrt{1+\\mu a^\\dagger a}$ the mentioned idea can be\nestablished. In the present paper we generalize the approach of quantum optical\nspring (has been called by us as nonlinear quantum optical spring) with\nattention to the {\\it dependence of frequency to the intensity of radiation\nfield} that {\\it naturally} observed in nonlinear coherent states. Then, after\nthe introduction of the generalized Hamiltonian of nonlinear quantum optical\nspring and it's solution, we will investigate the nonclassical properties of\nthe obtained states. Specially, typical collapse and revival in the\ndistribution functions and squeezing parameters as particular quantum features\nwill be revealed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2010 15:53:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Faghihi", "M.

Much is known about mutually unbiased bases, but there are also a\nfair number of important questions that have not been answered in full as yet.\nIn particular, one can find maximal sets of ${N+1}$ mutually unbiased bases in\nHilbert spaces of prime-power dimension ${N=p^\\m}$, with $p$ prime and $\\m$ a\npositive integer, and there is a continuum of mutually unbiased bases for a\ncontinuous degree of freedom, such as motion along a line. But not a single\nexample of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number\n($N=6,10,12,...$). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the\nbasis states are labeled by numbers ${0,1,2,...,N-1}$ that are both elements of\na Galois field and ordinary integers. This dual nature permits a compact\nsystematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they\nare known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other\ncases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually unbiased bases in\nquantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation,\nentanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which\nrely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the\nfamiliar two--q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased\nbases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also\nexploit the one-to-one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex\nHadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other. The ultimate hope, not\nyet fulfilled, is that open questions about mutually unbiased bases can be\nrelated to open questions about Hadamard matrices or affine planes, in\nparticular the ...[rest deleted]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Apr 2010 05:06:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Oct 2010 07:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Durt", "Thomas", ""], ["Englert", "Berthold-Georg", ""], ["Bengtsson", "Ingemar", ""], ["\u017byczkowski", "Karol", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3352", "submitter": "Flavio Mercati", "authors": "Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Flavio Mercati", "title": "String-inspired ultraviolet/infrared mixing and preliminary evidence of\n  a violation of the de Broglie relation for nonrelativistic neutrons", "comments": "Analysis unchanged; additional comments on the part of the motivation\n  drawn from a Loop-Quantum-Gravity-inspired model; additional comments on the\n  derivation of a LOWER bound on the parameter $\\chi$ for the\n  lightlike-noncommutativity case.", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th gr-qc hep-ph physics.atom-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We advocate a novel perspective on the phenomenology of a framework with\nspacetime noncommutativity which is of established relevance for string theory.\nOur analysis applies to cases in which the noncommutativity parameters are\narranged according to the criteria of \"light-like noncommutativity\" and\nultraviolet supersymmetry is assumed, so that the implications of the\ncharacteristic mechanism of ultraviolet/infrared mixing are relatively soft.

An\nimportant role in this paper is played by statistical morphisms, namely, affine\nmaps whose definition generalizes that of coarse-grainings given by Petz and\ninduces a corresponding criterion for statistical sufficiency that is weaker,\nand hence easier to be characterized, than Petz's.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2010 20:29:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 14:06:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 08:22:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2011 06:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Buscemi", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3818", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "David Avis, Patrick Hayden, and Mark M.

We\nanalyzed the entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth\n(ESB) by the non-Markovian master equation. Furthermore, we find that the\nlarger the ratio $r$ and the thermal energy $k_BT$, the shorter the\ndecoherence. In this superconducting qubit system we find that the entanglement\ncan be controlled and the ESD time can be prolonged by adjusting the\ntemperature and the superconducting phases $\\Phi_k$ which split the energy\nlevels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Apr 2010 18:36:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cui", "Wei", ""], ["Xi", "Zairong", ""], ["Pan", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4305", "submitter": "Theo Johnson-Freyd", "authors": "Theo Johnson-Freyd", "title": "The formal path integral and quantum mechanics", "comments": "33 pages, many TikZ diagrams, submitted to _Journal of Mathematical\n  Physics_", "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematical Physics 51, 122103 (2010)", "doi": "10.1063/1.3503472", "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph hep-th math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given an arbitrary Lagrangian function on \\RR^d and a choice of classical\npath, one can try to define Feynman's path integral supported near the\nclassical path as a formal power series parameterized by \"Feynman diagrams,\"\nalthough these diagrams may diverge.

The approach uses classical and quantum versions of normal form\ntheory and the perspective of dynamical systems theory. Over the past ten years\nthe classical normal form theory has provided a method for realizing the phase\nspace structures that are responsible for determining reactions in high\ndimensional Hamiltonian systems. This has led to the understanding that a new\n(to reaction dynamics) type of phase space structure, a {\\em normally\nhyperbolic invariant manifold} (or, NHIM) is the \"anchor\" on which the phase\nspace structures governing reaction dynamics are built. The quantum normal form\ntheory provides a method for quantizing these phase space structures through\nthe use of the Weyl quantization procedure. We show that this approach provides\na solution of the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation leading to a (local)\nS-matrix in a neighborhood of the saddle point governing the reaction. It\nfollows easily that the quantization of the directional flux through the\ndividing surface with the properties noted above is a flux operator that can be\nexpressed in a \"closed form\". Moreover, from the local S-matrix we easily\nobtain an expression for the cumulative reactio probability (CRP).\nSignificantly, the expression for the CRP can be evaluated without the need to\ncompute classical trajectories. The quantization of the NHIM is shown to lead\nto the activated complex, and the lifetimes of quantum states initialized on\nthe NHIM correspond to the Gamov-Siegert resonances.

In this paper we survey the theoretical and experimental development\nof quantum simulation using quantum computers, from the first ideas to the\nintense research efforts currently underway.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 13:43:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 16:35:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 20:56:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "Katherine L", ""], ["Munro", "William J", ""], ["Kendon", "Vivien M", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5532", "submitter": "Clive Emary", "authors": "Clive Emary", "title": "Self-consistent electron counting statistics", "comments": "11 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

Topological quantum computation was discussed so far as\nmanipulation of the wave function within degenerate many body ground state. The\nsimplest particles providing degenerate ground state, Majorana fermions, often\ncoexist with extremely low energy excitations, so keeping the system in the\nground state may be hard. We show that the topological protection extends to\nthe excited states, as long as the Majorana fermions do not interact neither\ndirectly, nor via the excited states. This protection relies on the fermion\nparity conservation, and so it is generic to any implementation of Majorana\nfermions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 13:55:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2010 14:12:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Akhmerov", "A.
