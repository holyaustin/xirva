The security analysis we proved corresponds to the downstream access\nnetwork where only passive beamsplitter is sufficient to distribute the quantum\nsignals and no other active controls are demanded. Moreover, standard CV-QKD\nsystems can be directly fitted in the downstream access network, which makes it\nmore applicable for practical implementations. Numerous simulation results are\nprovided to demonstrate the performance of the CV-QKD downstream access\nnetwork, where up to 64 end-users are shown to be feasible to access the\nnetwork. Our work provides the security analysis framework for realizing QKD in\nthe downstream access network which will boost the diversity for constructing\npractical QKD networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2021 05:36:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Yundi", ""], ["Shen", "Tao", ""], ["Wang", "Xiangyu", ""], ["Chen", "Ziyang", ""], ["Xu", "Bingjie", ""], ["Yu", "Song", ""], ["Guo", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.01816", "submitter": "Yuwen Huang", "authors": "Yuwen Huang and Pascal O.

Finally, we introduce the balanced homodyne\ndetection to measure the quadrature operator and the homodyne tomography as a\ntool for characterizing quantum optical states also in the presence of non-unit\nquantum efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2021 10:23:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Olivares", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.02566", "submitter": "Andrea Oldofredi", "authors": "Andrea Oldofredi, Claudio Calosi", "title": "Relational Quantum Mechanics and the PBR Theorem: A Peaceful Coexistence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.hist-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  According to Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) the wave function $\\psi$ is\nconsidered neither a concrete physical item evolving in spacetime, nor an\nobject representing the absolute state of a certain quantum system.

Thus we find that the resonance properties define two landmarks\nthat divide the MBL regime in to three subregimes: (i) at strongest disorder,\ntypical samples do not have any eigenstates that are involved in system-wide\nmany-body resonances; (ii) there is a substantial intermediate regime where\ntypical samples do have such resonances, but the pair of eigenstates with the\nminimum spectral gap does not; and (iii) in the weaker randomness regime, the\nminimum gap is involved in a many-body resonance and thus subject to level\nrepulsion.

For instance, an\naverage fidelity of $0.88$ on the Hilbert space of $10$ qubits is achieved with\n$21$ separable bases. The use of separable bases makes our estimation method\nparticularly well suited for applications in noisy intermediate-scale quantum\ncomputers, where entangling gates are much less accurate than local gates. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the proposed method in one of IBM's quantum\nprocessors by estimating 4-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with a\nfidelity close to $0.875$ via separable bases. Other $10$-qubit separable and\nentangled states achieve an estimation fidelity in the order of $0.85$ and\n$0.7$, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jul 2021 19:02:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Pereira", "L.", ""], ["Zambrano", "L.", ""], ["Delgado", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.05692", "submitter": "Qipeng Liu", "authors": "Andrea Coladangelo and Jiahui Liu and Qipeng Liu and Mark Zhandry", "title": "Hidden Cosets and Applications to Unclonable Cryptography", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we study a generalization of hidden subspace states to hidden\ncoset states (first introduced by Aaronson and Christiano [STOC '12]).

Determinism that\npervades classical physics, however, forbids free will, undermines the\nfoundations of ethics, and precludes meaningful quantification of personal\nbiases. To resolve that impasse, we utilize the characteristic indeterminism of\nquantum physics and derive a quantitative measure for the amount of free will\nmanifested by the brain cortical network. The interaction between the central\nnervous system and the surrounding environment is shown to perform a quantum\nmeasurement upon the neural constituents, which actualize a single measurement\noutcome selected from the resulting quantum probability distribution. Inherent\nbiases in the quantum propensities for alternative physical outcomes provide\nvarying amounts of free will, which can be quantified with the expected\ninformation gain from learning the actual course of action chosen by the\nnervous system. For example, neuronal electric spikes evoke deterministic\nsynaptic vesicle release in the synapses of sensory or somatomotor pathways,\nwith no free will manifested. In cortical synapses, however, vesicle release is\ntriggered indeterministically with probability of 0.35 per spike. This grants\nthe brain cortex, with its over 100 trillion synapses, an amount of free will\nexceeding 96 terabytes per second. Although reliable deterministic transmission\nof sensory or somatomotor information ensures robust adaptation of animals to\ntheir physical environment, unpredictability of behavioral responses initiated\nby decisions made by the brain cortex is evolutionary advantageous for avoiding\npredators.

Therefore, our method can in\nprinciple generate optimal polarization-entangled states for\npolarization-entanglement-based quantum-networking protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:25:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Lafler", "Randy", ""], ["Lanning", "R.

Quantum trajectories,\ninstead, model the outcome of ideal single experiments -- the ``clicks'' of a\nperfect detector due to, e.g., spontaneous emission. The correct description of\nquantum jumps, which are related to random events characterizing a sudden\nchange in the wave function of an open quantum system, is pivotal to the\ndefinition of quantum trajectories. In this article, we extend the formalism of\nquantum trajectories to open quantum systems with ultrastrong coupling (USC)\nbetween light and matter by properly defining jump operators in this regime. In\nsuch systems, exotic higher-order quantum-state- and energy-transfer can take\nplace without conserving the total number of excitations in the system. The\nemitted field of such USC systems bears signatures of these higher-order\nprocesses, and significantly differs from similar processes at lower coupling\nstrengths. Notably, the emission statistics must be taken at a single quantum\ntrajectory level, since the signatures of these processes are washed out by the\n``averaging'' of a master equation. We analyze the impact of the chosen\nunravelling (i.e., how one collects the output field of the system) for the\nquantum trajectories and show that these effects of the higher-order USC\nprocesses can be revealed in experiments by constructing histograms of detected\nquantum jumps.

These applications entail the challenging problem of\ncertifying quantum nonlocality, something that is hard to achieve when the\ntarget quantum state is weakly entangled, or when the source of errors is high,\ne.g. when photons propagate through the atmosphere or a long optical fiber.\nHere, we introduce a technique to find a Bell inequality with the largest\npossible gap between the quantum prediction and the classical local hidden\nvariable limit for a given set of measurement frequencies. Our method\nrepresents an efficient strategy to certify quantum nonlocal correlations from\nexperimental data without requiring extra measurements, in the sense that there\nis no Bell inequality with a larger gap than the one provided. Furthermore, we\nalso reduce the photodetector efficiency required to close the detection\nloophole.

Conventionally, the focus has been on the accuracy of the\nelectronic state simulations of the sample, whereas the STM tip electronic\nstate is typically approximated as a simple spherically symmetric $ s $\norbital. This widely used $ s $ orbital approximation has failed in recent STM\nstudies where the measured STM images of subsurface impurity wave functions in\nsilicon required a detailed description of the STM tip electronic state. In\nthis work, we show that the failure of the $ s $ orbital approximation is due\nto the indirect band-gap of the sample material silicon (Si), which gives rise\nto complex valley interferences in the momentum space of impurity wave\nfunctions. Based on direct comparison of STM images computed from\nmulti-million-atom electronic structure calculations of impurity wave functions\nin direct (GaAs) and indirect (Si) band-gap materials, our results establish\nthat whilst the selection of STM tip orbital only plays a minor qualitative\nrole for the direct band gap GaAs material, the STM measurements are\ndramatically modified by the momentum space features of the indirect band gap\nSi material, thereby requiring a quantitative representation of the STM tip\norbital configuration.

The duality is rather pervasive in the quantum world in the sense that\nnot only classical particles sometimes behave like waves, but also classical\nwaves, e.g., light, may behave as point particles. In this article, motivated\nby the wave-particle duality, I develop a deterministic time-crystal\nLorentz-covariant mechanical model for an electron with spin. In the proposed\ntime-crystal model an electron is formed by two components: a particle-type\ncomponent that transports the electric charge, and a wave component that moves\nat the speed of light and whirls around the massive component. Interestingly,\nthe motion of the particle-component is completely ruled by the trajectory of\nthe wave-component, somewhat analogous to the pilot-wave theory of de\nBroglie-Bohm. The dynamics of the time-crystal electron is controlled by a\ngeneralized least action principle. The model predicts that the electron\nstationary states have a constant spin angular momentum, predicts the spin\nvector precession in a magnetic field and gives a possible explanation for the\nphysical origin of the anomalous magnetic moment. Remarkably, the developed\nmodel has nonlocal features that prevent the divergence of the self-field\ninteractions.

In this work, we propose\na novel method for coherent microwave transmission using a typical microwave\nwaveguide at room temperature.

At the receiver side, we implement a cryogenic loop\nantenna coupled to an LC harmonic oscillator inside the output port of the\nwaveguide, while the LC harmonic oscillator is located outside the waveguide.\nThe loop antenna converts the quantum microwave fields (which contain both\nsignal and thermal noise photons) to a quantum voltage across the coupled LC\nharmonic oscillator. We show that by properly designing the loop antenna, the\nnumber of detected noise photons can be significantly less than one.\nSimultaneously, the detected signal photons can be maintained at a sufficient\nnumber greater than one by transmitting a proper number of photons at the input\nport of the waveguide. For example, we show that for a 10 GHz microwave signal,\nwhen using a room-temperature transmission waveguide of 5m length, 35 coherent\nphotons are detected across the LC circuit by transmitting 32x10^4 signal\nphotons at the input port of the waveguide.

This limits the scalability in the implementation of\nquantum algorithms. Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) has been proposed\nas a more resilient alternative quantum computing paradigm to outperform\ndigital quantum computation within the NISQ era framework. It arises from\nadding the flexibility provided by fast single-qubit gates to the robustness of\nanalog quantum simulations. Here, we perform a careful comparison between\ndigital and digital-analog paradigms under the presence of noise sources. The\ncomparison is illustrated by comparing the performance of the quantum Fourier\ntransform algorithm under a wide range of single- and two-qubit noise sources.\nIndeed, we obtain that, when the different noise channels usually present in\nsuperconducting quantum processors are considered, the fidelity of the QFT\nalgorithm for the digital-analog paradigm outperforms the one obtained for the\ndigital approach. Additionally, this difference grows when the size of the\nprocessor scales up, constituting consequently a sensible alternative paradigm\nin the NISQ era.

This is a nontrivial issue since a squeezed bath\nfield cannot reach equilibration and yet, as this work shows, the system\noscillator indeed can, which is a necessary condition for FDRs. We discuss\nthree different settings: A) The bath field essentially remains in a squeezed\nthermal state throughout, whose squeeze parameter is a mode- and\ntime-independent constant. This situation is often encountered in quantum\noptics and quantum thermodynamics. B) The field is initially in a thermal\nstate, but subjected to a parametric process leading to mode- and\ntime-dependent squeezing. This scenario is met in cosmology and dynamical\nCasimir effect. The squeezing in the bath in both types of processes will\naffect the oscillator's nonequilibrium evolution. We show that at late times it\napproaches equilibration, which warrants the existence of an FDR. The trait of\nsqueezing is marked by the oscillator's effective equilibrium temperature, and\nthe factor in the FDR is only related to the stationary component of bath's\nnoise kernel. Setting C) is more subtle: A finite system-bath coupling strength\ncan set the oscillator in a squeezed state even the bath field is stationary\nand does not engage in any parametric process. The squeezing of the system in\nthis case is in general time-dependent but becomes constant when the internal\ndynamics is fully relaxed.

In this work, we recognize that many state-of-the-art error\nmitigation methods share a common feature: they are data-driven, employing\nclassical data obtained from runs of different quantum circuits. For example,\nZero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) uses variable noise data and Clifford-data\nregression (CDR) uses data from near-Clifford circuits. We show that Virtual\nDistillation (VD) can be viewed in a similar manner by considering classical\ndata produced from different numbers of state preparations.

In certain situations, we find that our UNITED method can\noutperform the individual methods (i.e., the whole is better than the\nindividual parts). Specifically, we employ a realistic noise model obtained\nfrom a trapped ion quantum computer to benchmark UNITED, as well as\nstate-of-the-art methods, for problems with various numbers of qubits, circuit\ndepths and total numbers of shots.

The theory of asymmetry grew out of\ninformation-theoretic work on entanglement and quantum reference frames, and\nallows us to quantify the degree to which a quantum system encodes coordinates\nof a symmetry group. Recently a complete set of entropic conditions was found\nfor asymmetry in terms of correlations relative to infinitely many quantum\nreference frames. However these conditions are difficult to use in practice and\nthe physical implications unclear. Here we show that this set of conditions has\nextensive redundancy, and one can restrict to reference frames forming any\nclosed surface in the state space that has the maximally mixed state in its\ninterior. This in turn implies that asymmetry can be reduced to just a single\nentropic condition evaluated at the maximally mixed state. Contrary to\nintuition, this shows that we do not need macroscopic, classical reference\nframes to determine the asymmetry properties of a quantum system, but instead\ninfinitesimally small frames suffice. Building on this analysis, we provide\nsimple, closed conditions to estimate the minimal depolarization needed so as\nto make a given quantum state accessible under $G$-covariant quantum channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 17:07:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Alexander", "Rhea", ""], ["Gvirtz-Chen", "Si", ""], ["Jennings", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.14191", "submitter": "Gerard Hooft 't", "authors": "Gerard t Hooft", "title": "Ontology in quantum mechanics", "comments": "21 pages, 3 figures, Invited contribution as Chapter in Intech Open\n  Book: Topics on Quantum Information Science", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph gr-qc hep-th", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  It is suspected that the quantum evolution equations describing the\nmicro-world as we know it are of a special kind that allows transformations to\na special set of basis states in Hilbert space, such that, in this basis, the\nevolution is given by elements of the permutation group.
