We demonstrate how this\nmechanism can be engineered to realize a single-photon switch, where the first\nincoming photon switches the system from being highly transmissive to highly\nreflective, and analyze how signatures can be observed via non-classical\ncorrelations of the outgoing photon field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 13:35:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 18:22:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Albrecht", "Andreas", ""], ["Caneva", "Tommaso", ""], ["Chang", "Darrick E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.01021", "submitter": "J\\'er\\'emy Dohet-Eraly", "authors": "J\\'er\\'emy Dohet-Eraly", "title": "A regularized Lagrange-mesh method based on an orthonormal\n  Lagrange-Laguerre basis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Lagrange-mesh method is an approximate variational approach having the\nform of a mesh calculation because of the use of a Gauss quadrature.

We\nconsidered a one-dimensional quantum scalar field interacting with the volume\nelements' degrees of freedom of the material bodies, which are modeled as\ncomposite systems consisting in a harmonic oscillators interacting with an\nenvironment. Solving the full dynamics of the composite system through its\nHeisenberg equations, we studied each contribution to the field operator by\nemploying general properties of the Green function. We deduced the long-time\nlimit of the field operator. In agreement with previous works, we showed that\nthe expectation values of the components of the energy-momentum tensor present\ntwo contributions, one associated to the thermal baths and the other one\nassociated to the field's initial conditions. This allows us to the direct\nstudy of steady situations involving different initial states for the field and\narbitrary thermal states for the baths. This leads to the other main result,\nconsisting in computing the Casimir force when the field is initially in\nthermal or continuum-single-mode squeezed states (characterized by a given\nbandwidth and frequency). Time-averaging is required for the squeezed case,\nshowing both results in a unified way. For the thermal state, all the\nwell-known equilibrium results can be successfully reproduced. Finally, we\ncompared the initial conditions' contribution and the total force for each\ncase, showing that the latter can be tuned in a wide range of values through\nvarying the size of the bandwidth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 18:23:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lopez", "Adrian E.

We find that the intrinsic decoherence time increases\nmonotonically as the disorder strength increases in accordance with the\nrelaxation of locally measurable quantities.

We focus on the following two facets: (1) Adopting\na simple dielectric model where the refractive index $n$ is constant, we\ndemonstrate by means of a mapping procedure how the electromagnetic field in a\nmedium can be mapped into a corresponding field in vacuum. This mapping was\npresented many years ago [I. Brevik and B. Lautrup, Mat. Fys. Medd. Dan. Vid.\nSelsk {\\bf 38}(1), 1 (1970)], but is apparently not well known. A\ncharacteristic property of this procedure is that it shows how natural the\nMinkowski energy-momentum tensor fits into the canonical formalism. Especially\nthe spacelike character of the electromagnetic total four-momentum for a\nradiation field (implying negative electromagnetic energy in some inertial\nframes), so strikingly demonstrated in the Cherenkov effect, is worth\nattention. (2) Our second objective is to give a critical analysis of some\nrecent experiments on electromagnetic momentum. Care must here be taken in the\ninterpretations: it is easy to be misled and conclude that an experiment is\nimportant for the energy-momentum problem, while what is demonstrated\nexperimentally is merely the action of the Abraham-Minkowski force acting in\nsurface layers or inhomogeneous regions. The Abraham-Minkowski force is common\nfor the two energy-momentum tensors and carries no information about field\nmomentum. As a final item, we propose an experiment that might show the\nexistence of the Abraham force at high frequencies.

The\ninclusion of the energy loss of photons leads to the fact that the duration of\ncoherent pulse is almost constant with increasing inversion, at least well away\nfrom the threshold. If there is exist a recovery mechanism for the population\ninversion, the pulsating mode of stimulated emission generation becomes\npossible. The integral radiation intensity at this may be increased several\ntimes. This approach can be used for analysis of the cosmic radiation that\nmight help explain a great variety of pulsating radiation sources in space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 20:19:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kirichok", "A.

However, the quantum\nfluctuations with a short time period engender bifurcation and subsequent\nrejoining of these peaks in the phase space. The abovementioned doubling of the\nnumber of peaks increases the entropy to its near maximal value. Nonetheless,\nthese states characterized by high entropy values, are endowed with a large\nnegativity of the W -distribution that points towards their non-Gaussian\nbehavior. This may be ascertained by the significantly large Hilbert-Schmidt\ndistance between the oscillator state and an ensemble of most general\nstatistical mixture of squeezed Gaussian states possessing nearly identical\nsecond order quadrature moments as that of the oscillator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 13:56:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Balamurugan", "M.", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "R.", ""], ["Jenisha", "B.

Additionally, the nuclei\nwith angular momenta greater than 1/2 possess a quadrupolar charge\ndistribution. At the intersection of these two phenomena, we devise a simple\nscheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states. The native\nbiaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained\nsolid-state systems plays a key role here. However, the fact that built-in\nstrain cannot be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target\ncat states once they are prepared. We remedy this by abruptly diverting via a\nsingle rotation pulse the state evolution to the neighborhood of the fixed\npoints of the underlying classical Hamiltonian flow. Optimal process parameters\nare obtained as a function of electric field gradient biaxiality and nuclear\nspin angular momentum. The overall procedure is seen to be robust under 5%\ndeviations from optimal values. We show that higher level cat states with four\nsuperposed CSS can also be formed using three rotation pulses. Finally, for\nopen systems subject to decoherence we extract the scaling of cat state\nfidelity damping with respect to the spin quantum number. This reveals rates\ngreater than the dephasing of individual CSSs.

We analyze the\nchannel capacity of the pure-loss optical channel with a general\ncoherent-processing receiver in the low-photon number regime and compare it\nwith the capacity achievable with direct detection and the Holevo limit\n(achieving the latter would require a quantum joint-detection receiver). We\nshow compelling evidence that despite the optimal performance of Dolinar's\nreceiver for the binary coherent-state hypothesis test (either in error\nprobability or mutual information), the asymptotic communication rate\nachievable by such a coherent-processing receiver is only as good as direct\ndetection. This suggests that in the infinitely-long codeword limit, all\npotential benefits of coherent processing at the receiver can be obtained by\ndesigning a good code and direct detection, with no feedback within the\nreceiver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 19:48:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 21:45:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 21:10:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "Hye Won", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""], ["Zheng", "Lizhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.07579", "submitter": "Francesco Massel", "authors": "C.

It turns out that local\nmeasurement (i.e. opening one of the boxes) fails to indicate the particle's\npresence, but subtler measurements performed on the two boxes together reveal\nthe particle's nonlocal modular momentum spatially separated from its mass.\nAnother advance of this setting is that, unlike other predictions of the TSVF\nthat rely on weak and/or counterfactual measurements, the present one uses\nactual projective measurements. This outcome is then corroborated by adding\nweak measurements and the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

It generalizes and unifies previous\nframeworks, including the standard formulation of quantum theory, the convex\noperational framework and Segal's approach to quantum field theory. It is\ncapable of encoding both classical and quantum (field) theories, implements\nspacetime locality in a manifest way and contains the complete modern notion of\nmeasurement in the quantum case. Its mathematical content can be condensed into\na set of axioms that are similar to those of Atiyah and Segal. This is\nsupplemented by two basic rules for extracting probabilities or expectation\nvalues for measurement processes. The framework, called the positive formalism,\nis derived in three completely different ways. One derivation is from first\nprinciples, one starts with classical field theory and one with quantum field\ntheory. The latter derivation arose previously in the programme of the general\nboundary formulation of quantum theory. As in the convex operational framework,\nthe difference between classical and quantum theories essentially arises from\ncertain partially ordered vector spaces being either lattices or anti-lattices.\nIf we add the ad hoc ingredient of imposing anti-lattice structures, the\nderivation from first principles may be seen as a reconstruction of quantum\ntheory. Among other things, the positive formalism suggests a statistical\napproach to classical field theories with dynamical metric, provides a common\nground for quantum information theory and quantum field theory, introduces a\nnotion of local measurement into quantum field theory, and suggests a new\nperspective on quantum gravity by removing the incompatibility with general\nrelativistic principles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 01:28:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 15:08:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2019 15:16:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Oeckl", "Robert", "", "CCM-UNAM"]]}, {"id": "1610.09053", "submitter": "Martin Bohmann", "authors": "M.

The first method is an\ninteractive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. The second method is a\nnoninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message\nusing a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error\ncorrecting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)).\nEncryption was shown to be necessary for authentication.\n  We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire\nencryption key provided QA accepts the message. We analyze the resulting\nintegrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we\ncall QA+KG. Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC)\nsecure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). More specifically, this\nimplies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA,\nand (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. For an\nm-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key; but PTC can be performed\nusing only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e. Thus,\nwe reduce the key required for both QA and QEnc, from linear to logarithmic net\nconsumption, at the expense of one bit of back communication which can happen\nany time after the conclusion of QA and before reusing the key. UC-security of\nQA also extends security to settings not obvious from quant-ph/0205128.\n  Our security proof structure is inspired by and similar to that of\nquant-ph/0205128, reducing the security of QA to that of TQA'.
