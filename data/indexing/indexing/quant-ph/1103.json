Using a\ndescription via the delocalized atomic and field modes we observe that for a\nlarge detuning of these two degrees of freedom atomic excitations propagate\nwithout populating the field modes, and vice versa. For the near-resonance\nscenario between these modes the atomic excitations, say, while propagating mix\nwith the photonic states. In the context of the parabolic coupling between\nphotons of adjacent cavities an arbitrary element of the time-dependent\ncorrelation function between two arbitrary cavities may be expressed in closed\nform for dominant values of the detuning parameter, when an exact transmission\nof the quantum state at pre-specified times is realized.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 10:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chakrabarti", "R.", ""], ["Sreekumari", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0649", "submitter": "Ognyan Oreshkov", "authors": "C\\'edric B\\'eny and Ognyan Oreshkov", "title": "Approximate simulation of quantum channels", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The dual problem involves the information obtained by the environment\nthrough the so-called complementary channels M* and N*, and consists in finding\na quantum channel R' such that R'M* is optimally close to N*. It turns out to\nbe easier to find an approximate solution to the dual problem in certain\nimportant situations, notably when M is the identity channel---the problem of\nquantum error correction---yielding a good near-optimal worst-case entanglement\nfidelity as well as the corresponding near-optimal correcting channel.

Moreover the opening chapter argues that although\nexplanatory narratives are essentially epistemological constructions, they\nrequire a general metaphysical backing through the explainer's and explainee's\ncommitments to take the concepts and higher structures composed of them as\ndirectly referential. Two methodological perspectives on theory construction,\nEinstein's division into principle and constructive theories, are then\ndelineated along the lines of their metaphysical and explanatory potential, and\npresented as the research instrument with which to approach the\nspecific-case-study instances of quantum theory reconstruction. A specific\nstrategy of arguing for scientific realism ('the simple transcendental\nstrategy') is then presented and connected to the challenges that the phenomena\n(EPR correlations and 'teleportation') from the domain of contemporary quantum\ntheory pose for it. The opening chapter concludes with a survey of the general\nmodels of explanation and their position with respect to the\nprinciple-constructive dichotomy introduced above. Finally, an explanatory\nmodel containing extended material-like entities along with further primitives,\nuniversal laws of temporal evolution, is argued for. Consequently, in the\ninterest of a wholesome realistic response to the sceptical challenge about the\nexplanatory aims of science, we recommend that even the common sense conceptual\nframework replaces the extended material structure with 'generalised things' as\nre-identifiable invariants through change as the fundamental unit of the\nrealist ontology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2011 11:44:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Domazet", "Mladen", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0886", "submitter": "Levan Chotorlishvili L", "authors": "L.

A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally\npumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,\nintrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In\nthis case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a\nGaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic\nnon-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit\nproperties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the\ncomplexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger. The qubit as a\nmeter of the photon dynamics is considered, and it is shown that qubit\ndephasing, originating for example from non-demolition measurements, results in\nan exponential destruction of the oscillations which manifests the\ncollectiveness of the Josephson effect. Non-selective qubit measurements, on\nthe other hand, render a Zeno effect seen in a slowing down of the Josephson\noscillations. Contrary to dephasing, cavity dissipation results in a Gaussian\ndecay of the scaled Josephson oscillations. Finally, following Ponomarev et al.\n[Phys. Rev.

The two-point correlation of this phase factor is\nassociated with the probability of the formation of defects. In this framework,\nwe have estimated the density of defects produced in several one dimensional\nspin chains. At the critical region, the entanglement entropy of a block of $L$\nspins with the rest of the system is also estimated which is found to increase\nlogarithmically with $L$. The dependence on the quench time puts a constraint\non the block size $L$.

The time\nevolution of a particle distribution initially not equal to the absolute square\nof the wave function is calculated for a particle in a two-dimensional infinite\npotential square well. Under the de Broglie-Bohm ontology, the box contains an\nobjectively-existing 'pilot wave' which guides the electron trajectory, and\nthis is represented mathematically by a Schroedinger wave function composed of\na finite out-of-phase superposition of M energy eigenstates (with M ranging\nfrom 4 to 64). The electron density distributions are found to evolve naturally\ninto the Born-rule ones and stay there; in analogy with the classical case this\nrepresents a decay to 'quantum equilibrium'. The proximity to equilibrium is\ncharacterized by the coarse-grained subquantum H-function which is found to\ndecrease roughly exponentially towards zero over the course of time. The\ntimescale tau for this relaxation is calculated for various values of M and the\ncoarse-graining length epsilon. Its dependence on M is found to disagree with\nan earlier theoretical prediction. A power law - tau inversely proportional to\nM - is found to be fairly robust for all coarse-graining lengths and, although\na weak dependence of tau on epsilon is observed, it does not appear to follow\nany straightforward scaling. A theoretical analysis is presented to explain\nthese results. This improvement in our understanding of timescales for\nrelaxation to quantum equilibrium is likely to be of use in the development of\nmodels of relaxation in the early universe, with a view to constraining\npossible violations of the Born rule in inflationary cosmology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 18:17:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2011 16:29:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Towler", "M.

Long space-time dynamics\nis derived using a perturbation expansion in the ratio of the nearest-neighbor\ndistance to a nanometer-scale characteristic length, and a theorem on the\nequivalence of long-time averages and expectation values. This dynamics is\nshown to satisfy a coarse-grained wave equation (CGWE) which takes a\nSchr\\\"odinger-like form with modified masses and interactions. The scaling of\nspace and time is determined by the orders of magnitude of various\ncontributions to the N-body potential.

The balance of these two extremes\nremoves arbitrariness in the choice of the scaling of space-time. Since the\nlong-scale dynamics of each fermion involves its interaction with many others,\nwe hypothesize that the solutions of the CGWE have mean-field character to good\napproximation, i.e., can be factorized into single-particle functions.

Thus, these devices perform as ideal\nspin filters, and these electrons can be viewed as mobile qubits; the device\nwrites definite quantum information on the spinors of the outgoing electrons.\nThe device can also read the information written on incoming polarized\nelectrons: the charge transmission through the device contains full information\non this polarization.

This points toward the onset of a quantum phase\ntransition that should become infinitely sharp as the system approaches the\nmacroscopic scale.

The method\nhas been first formalized by von Neumann (1951) and has many applications in\nclassical computing. We define a quantum analogue of rejection sampling: given\na black box producing a coherent superposition of (possibly unknown) quantum\nstates with some amplitudes, the problem is to prepare a coherent superposition\nof the same states, albeit with different target amplitudes. The main result of\nthis paper is a tight characterization of the query complexity of this quantum\nstate generation problem. We exhibit an algorithm, which we call quantum\nrejection sampling, and analyze its cost using semidefinite programming. Our\nproof of a matching lower bound is based on the automorphism principle which\nallows to symmetrize any algorithm over the automorphism group of the problem.\nOur main technical innovation is an extension of the automorphism principle to\ncontinuous groups that arise for quantum state generation problems where the\noracle encodes unknown quantum states, instead of just classical data.\nFurthermore, we illustrate how quantum rejection sampling may be used as a\nprimitive in designing quantum algorithms, by providing three different\napplications. We first show that it was implicitly used in the quantum\nalgorithm for linear systems of equations by Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd.\nSecondly, we show that it can be used to speed up the main step in the quantum\nMetropolis sampling algorithm by Temme et al..

It deals with classical and quantum dualities in a unified fashion\nexplaining the precise connection between quantum dualities and the low\ntemperature (strong-coupling)/high temperature (weak-coupling) dualities of\nclassical statistical mechanics (or (Euclidean) path integrals). Its range of\napplications includes discrete lattice, continuum field, and gauge theories.\nDualities are revealed to be local, structure-preserving mappings between\nmodel-specific bond algebras that can be implemented as unitary\ntransformations, or partial isometries if gauge symmetries are involved. This\ncharacterization permits to search systematically for dualities and\nself-dualities in quantum models of arbitrary system size, dimensionality and\ncomplexity, and any classical model admitting a transfer matrix representation.\nDualities like exact dimensional reduction, emergent, and gauge-reducing\ndualities that solve gauge constraints can be easily understood in terms of\nmappings of bond algebras. As a new example, we show that the (\\mathbb{Z}_2)\nHiggs model is dual to the extended toric code model {\\it in any number of\ndimensions}. Non-local dual variables and Jordan-Wigner dictionaries are\nderived from the local mappings of bond algebras. Our bond-algebraic approach\ngoes beyond the standard approach to classical dualities, and could help\nresolve the long standing problem of obtaining duality transformations for\nlattice non-Abelian models. As an illustration, we present new dualities in any\nspatial dimension for the quantum Heisenberg model.

In the\nliterature, these two strands are kept largely separate; both, however suffer\nfrom severe limitations. Laser cooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on\nthe internal level structure of the species being cooled. As a result, only a\nsmall number of elements and a tiny number of molecules can be cooled this way.\nIn the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the engineering of\nmicromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints---these include\na high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality,\nweak coupling to the substrate, etc.---in order to enable efficient cooling.\nDuring the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling\ncloser together by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory\nthat can be used to explain the interaction between light and matter at a very\ngeneral level. I use this `transfer matrix' formalism to explore the use of the\nretarded dipole--dipole interaction as a means of both enhancing the efficiency\nof micromirror cooling systems and rendering the laser cooling of atoms and\nmolecules less species selective. In particular, I identify the `external\ncavity cooling' mechanism, whereby the use of an optical memory in the form of\na resonant element (such as a cavity), outside which the object to be cooled\nsits, can potentially lead to the construction of fully integrated\noptomechanical systems and even two-dimensional arrays of translationally cold\natoms, molecules or even micromirrors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2011 14:24:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2011 08:42:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Xuereb", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3640", "submitter": "Sudha Shenoy", "authors": "A.R.

Since the interactions between system and environment are\nlocal, they can also cause a loss of spatial coherence: correlations between\nspatially distant parts of the system are lost and the equilibrium states can\nbecome localized. This effect limits the distance over which quantum\ninformation can be transmitted, e.g., along a spin chain. We investigate this\nissue in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator, where it is possible\nto monitor the spreading of quantum information in a three-dimensional network:\nstates that are initially localized on individual spins (qubits) spread under\nthe influence of a suitable Hamiltonian apparently without limits. If we add a\nperturbation to this Hamiltonian, the spreading stops and the system reaches a\nlimiting size, which becomes smaller as the strength of the perturbation\nincreases. This limiting size appears to represent a dynamical equilibrium. We\npresent a phenomenological model to describe these results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2011 15:08:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Sep 2011 14:25:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alvarez", "Gonzalo A.", ""], ["Suter", "Dieter", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.4563", "submitter": "Gonzalo Agustin Alvarez", "authors": "Alexandre M.

We then measure the fidelity of state\ntomography, averaged over all possible single-qubit states, which is 0.9979(2).\nWe also fully characterize the detection process using quantum process\ntomography. This readout fidelity is compatible with recent estimates of the\ndetection error-threshold required for fault-tolerant computation, whereas\nhigh-fidelity state tomography opens the way for high-precision quantum process\ntomography.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Mar 2011 21:47:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Keselman", "Anna", ""], ["Glickman", "Yinnon", ""], ["Akerman", "Nitzan", ""], ["Kotler", "Shlomi", ""], ["Ozeri", "Roee", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5256", "submitter": "Tony Hyun Kim", "authors": "Tony Hyun Kim, Peter F.

In the\nspirit of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen it is possible to ask if the\nquantum-mechanical description (of this setup) can be considered complete. This\nquestion will be answered in detail in this paper, by delineating the quite\ncomplicated relation between energy-time entanglement experiments and\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) elements of reality. The mentioned sinusoidal\ninterference pattern is the same as that giving a violation in the usual Bell\nexperiment. Even so, depending on the precise requirements made on the local\nrealist model, this can imply a) no violation, b) smaller violation than usual,\nor c) full violation of the appropriate statistical bound. Alternatives include\na) using only the measurement outcomes as EPR elements of reality, b) using the\nemission time as EPR element of reality, c) using path realism, or d) using a\nmodified setup. This paper discusses the nature of these alternatives and how\nto choose between them. The subtleties of this discussion needs to be taken\ninto account when designing and setting up experiments intended to test local\nrealism.
