From a\ncomputer science perspective, LHV models may be interpreted as classical\ncomputers operating on a potentially infinite number of correlated bits\noriginating from a common source. As such, Bell inequality violations achieved\nthrough entangled states are able to characterise the quantum advantage of\ncertain tasks, so long as the task itself imposes no restriction on the\navailability of correlated bits. However, if the number of shared bits is\nlimited, additional constraints are placed on the possible LHV models and\nseparable, i.e. disentangled, states may become a useful resource. Bell\nviolations are therefore no longer necessary to achieve a quantum advantage.\nHere we show that in particular, separable states may improve the so-called\nrandom access codes, which is a class of communication problems where one party\ntries to read a portion of the data held by another distant party in presence\nof finite shared randomness and limited classical communication. We also show\nhow the bias of classical bits can be used to avoid wrong answers in order to\nachieve the optimal classical protocol and how the advantage of quantum\nprotocols is linked to quantum discord.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2013 12:19:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Apr 2014 07:28:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2014 04:19:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chuan", "T.

Then for the well-known\ntask of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \\textit{almost all}\ntwo-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally\ndiscriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \\textit{any} two\npure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given\nto ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition\nfor when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by\nLOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as \"non-locality\nwithout entanglement\". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each\nshare the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn\nfrom the rotationally invariant \"trine ensemble\", and we establish a tight\nconnection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's \"lifted\" single-copy\nensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the\nstates cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\\to\\infty$, LOCC can indeed\ndiscriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind.\nFinally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower\nbounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states.

Most\nof all, potential is eliminated in our theory, and all kind of the force-free\nAharonov-Bohm effect is understood in a unified framework of the\nLorentz-covariant local interaction of electromagnetic fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 11:29:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Apr 2014 09:21:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2014 09:45:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 02:45:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2018 06:22:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kang", "Kicheon", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2095", "submitter": "Karen Kheruntsyan", "authors": "Wu RuGway, A.

As the temperature is lowered, the specific heat decreases\nfrom the classical value of k_B/2, thereby indicating the appearence of quantum\neffects. However, the classical value of the specific heat is restored as the\ntemperature approaches zero. This surprising behavior is due to the suppressed\ndensity of bath degrees of freedom at low frequencies. For s<2, the specific\nheat at zero temperature increases linearly with s from -k_B/2 to k_B/2. An\nOhmic bath, s=1, is thus very special in the sense that it represents the only\ncase where the specific heat vanishes at zero temperature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2013 07:01:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Spreng", "Benjamin", ""], ["Ingold", "Gert-Ludwig", ""], ["Weiss", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.3079", "submitter": "Martin Schuetz", "authors": "Martin J.

Considering a sequence of\n$n$ pulses and pure dephasing due to quadratic coupling to Gaussian distributed\nnoise $\\xi(t)$, I use the linked-cluster (cumulant) expansion to calculate the\ncoherence decay. Solutions allowing for reconstruction of spectral density of\nnoise are given. For noise with correlation time shorter than the timescale on\nwhich coherence decays, the noise filtered by the dynamical decoupling\nprocedure can be treated as effectively Gaussian at large $n$, and\nwell-established methods of noise spectroscopy can be used to reconstruct the\nspectrum of $\\xi^{2}(t)$ noise. On the other hand, for noise of dominant\nlow-frequency character ($1/f^{\\beta}$ noise with $\\beta \\! > \\! 1$), an\ninfinite-order resummation of the cumulant expansion is necessary, and it leads\nto an analytical formula for coherence decay having a power-law tail at long\ntimes. In this case, the coherence at time $t$ depends both on spectral density\nof $\\xi(t)$ noise at $\\omega \\! = \\! n\\pi/t$, and on the effective\nlow-frequency cutoff of the noise spectrum, which is typically given by the\ninverse of the data acquisition time. Simulations of decoherence due to purely\ntransverse noise show that the analytical formulas derived in this paper apply\nin this often encountered case of an optimal working point, provided that the\nnumber of pulses is not very large, and the longitudinal qubit splitting is\nmuch larger than the transverse noise amplitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2013 12:38:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2014 18:56:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Oct 2014 07:50:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cywi\u0144ski", "\u0141ukasz", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.3109", "submitter": "Tridev Mishra", "authors": "Tridev Mishra, Tapomoy Guha Sarkar, Jayendra N.

Among the\nforbidden theories is a subset of outcome dependent theories showing that\noutcome dependence is not sufficient for explaining a violation of Bell\ninequalities. Non-local theories which can violate Bell inequalities (among\nthem quantum theory) are rather characterised by the fact that at least one of\nthe measurement outcomes in some sense (which is made precise)\nprobabilistically depends both on its local as well as on its distant\nmeasurement setting ('parameter').

The underlying mechanism, unrelated to the chaotic motion in the\nclassical limit but resting on quasi-integrable motion in a pseudoclassical\nlimit, is identified for one special case.

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is\ninfinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they\ndepend only on the particle density and quantum statistics. While the unitary\nFermi gas has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation, the degenerate unitary Bose gas has generally been deemed\nexperimentally inaccessible because of three-body loss rates that increase\ndramatically with increasing $a$. Here, we investigate dynamics of a unitary\nBose gas for timescales that are short compared to the loss. We find that the\nmomentum distribution of the unitary Bose gas evolves on timescales fast\ncompared to losses, and that both the timescale for this evolution and the\nlimiting shape of the momentum distribution are consistent with universal\nscaling with density.

We\nassert that the notion of `levels of structure', the coupling strength between\nconstituents in different levels, and the use of collective variables in each\nlevel are all pertinent factors.

In the 1-1 case with pairwise interactions\nof equal strength, the entanglement is independent of the number of constituent\nparticles $N$ in the macroscopic object.

We provide a proof of the conditions whereby the CoM variable decouples, a\ncause for the special role the CoM variable plays in the entanglement between\nthe two such macroscopic objects.

Their goal is\nfor Bob to learn Alice's input while using the channel as little as possible.\nIn the zero-error regime, the optimal rates of source codes and channel codes\nare given by graph parameters known as the Witsenhausen rate and Shannon\ncapacity, respectively. The Lov\\'asz theta number, a graph parameter defined by\na semidefinite program, gives the best efficiently-computable upper bound on\nthe Shannon capacity and it also upper bounds its entanglement-assisted\ncounterpart. At the same time it was recently shown that the Shannon capacity\ncan be increased if Alice and Bob may use entanglement.\n  Here we partially extend these results to the source-coding problem and to\nthe more general source-channel coding problem. We prove a lower bound on the\nrate of entanglement-assisted source-codes in terms Szegedy's number (a\nstrengthening of the theta number).

It is well understood and characterised, both theoretically and\nexperimentally. We show that it can be a source of continuous variable\nasymmetric Gaussian harmonic steering with fields which have a coherent\nexcitation, hence combining the important effects of harmonic entanglement and\nasymmetric steering in one easily controllable device, adjustable by the simple\nmeans of tuning the cavity loss rates at the fundamental and harmonic\nfrequencies. We find that whether quantum steering is available via the\nstandard measurements of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations can depend on\nwhich quadrature measurements are inferred from output spectral measurements of\nthe fundamental and the harmonic. Altering the ratios of the cavity loss rates\ncan be used to tune the regions where symmetric steering is available, with the\nresults becoming asymmetric over all frequencies as the cavity damping at the\nfundamental frequency becomes significantly greater than at the harmonic.\n  This asymmetry and its functional dependence on frequency is a potential new\ntool for experimental quantum information science, with possible utility for\nquantum key distribution. Although we show the effect here for Gaussian\nmeasurements of the quadratures, and cannot rule out a return of the steering\nsymmetry for some class of non-Gaussian measurements, we note here that the\nsystem obeys Gaussian statistics in the operating regime investigated and\nGaussian inference is at least as accurate as any other method for calculating\nthe necessary correlations. Perhaps most importantly, this system is simpler\nthan any other methods we are aware of which have been used or proposed to\ncreate asymmetric steering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2013 12:56:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Nov 2013 08:00:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Olsen", "M.

The main advantage of\nthese protocols is a smaller vulnerability to imperfect random number\ngenerators made possible by feature (a). We prove the security and the\nrobustness of such protocols. We show that using our method it is possible to\nconstruct a QKD protocol which retains its security even if the source of\nrandomness used by communicating parties is strongly biased. As a proof of\nprinciple, an explicit example of a protocol based on the Hardy's paradox is\npresented. Moreover, in the noiseless case, the protocol is secure in a natural\nway against any type of memory attack, and thus allows to reuse the device in\nsubsequent rounds. We also analyse the robustness of the protocol using\nsemi-definite programming methods. Finally, we present a post-processing\nmethod, and observe a paradoxical property that rejecting some random part of\nthe private data can increase the key rate of the protocol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Aug 2013 12:26:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 14:42:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 17 May 2015 20:04:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Rahaman", "Ramij", ""], ["Parker", "Matthew G.", ""], ["Mironowicz", "Piotr", ""], ["Paw\u0142owski", "Marcin", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6467", "submitter": "Tommaso Tufarelli", "authors": "Tommaso Tufarelli, Alessandro Ferraro, Alessio Serafini, Sougato Bose\n  and M.

Here we identify an additional class of quantum states, for\nwhich bipartite entanglement measures can be efficiently computed, providing\nnew rigorous results. Such states are written in arbitrary $d\\times d$\ndimensions, where each basis state in the subsystem A is paired with only one\nstate in B. This new class, that we refer to as pair basis states, is\nremarkably relevant in many physical situations, including quantum optics. We\nfind that negativity is a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement for\nmixtures of states written in the same pair basis. We also provide analytical\nexpressions for a tight lower-bound estimation of the entanglement of\nformation, a central quantity in quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 16:06:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 09:38:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Roncaglia", "Marco", ""], ["Montorsi", "Arianna", ""], ["Genovese", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6800", "submitter": "Rick Lytel", "authors": "Rick Lytel and Mark G.

We show that structures whose first\nhyperpolarizability is near the maximum are well described by only three\nstates, the so-called three-level Ansatz, while structures with the largest\nsecond hyperpolarizability require four states. We analyze a very large set of\nconfigurations for graphs with quasi-quadratic energy spectra and show how they\nexhibit better response than bare graphs through exquisite optimization of the\nshape of the eigenfunctions enabled by the existence of the finite potentials.\nWe also discover an exception to the universal scaling properties of the\nthree-level model parameters and trace it to the observation that a greater\nnumber of levels are required to satisfy the sum rules even when the\nthree-level Ansatz is satisfied and the first hyperpolarizability is at its\nmaximum value, as specified by potential optimization. This exception in the\nuniversal scaling properties of nonlinear optical structures at the limit is\ntraced to the discontinuity in the gradient of the eigenfunctions at the\nlocation of the delta potential. This is the first time that dressed quantum\ngraphs have been devised and solved for their nonlinear response, and it is the\nfirst analytical model of a confined dynamic system with a simple potential\nenergy that achieves the fundamental limits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:09:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lytel", "Rick", ""], ["Kuzyk", "Mark G.", ""]]}]
