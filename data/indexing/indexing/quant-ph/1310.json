The principle states that even if we have full classical information\nabout the state of a quantum system, it is impossible to deterministically\npredict the outcomes of all possible measurements. In comparison, the\nperspective of a quantum observer allows to have quantum information about the\nstate of a quantum system. This then leads to an interplay between uncertainty\nand quantum correlations. We provide an information theoretic analysis by\ndiscussing entropic uncertainty relations with quantum side information.\n  In the third part, we discuss the concept of randomness extractors. Classical\nand quantum randomness are an essential resource in information theory,\ncryptography, and computation. However, most sources of randomness exhibit only\nweak forms of unpredictability, and the goal of randomness extraction is to\nconvert such weak randomness into (almost) perfect randomness. We discuss\nvarious constructions for classical and quantum randomness extractors, and we\nexamine especially the performance of these constructions relative to an\nobserver with quantum side information.\n  In the fourth part, we discuss channel simulations. Shannon's noisy channel\ntheorem can be understood as the use of a noisy channel to simulate a noiseless\none. Channel simulations as we want to consider them here are about the reverse\nproblem: simulating noisy channels from noiseless ones. Starting from the\npurely classical case (the classical reverse Shannon theorem), we develop\nvarious kinds of quantum channel simulation results.

We provide a\ndefinition together with a simplification, denoted sLTCs, for the special case\nof stabilizer codes, together with some basic results using those definitions.\nThe most crucial parameter of such codes is their soundness, $R(\\delta)$,\nnamely, the probability that a randomly chosen constraint is violated as a\nfunction of the distance of a word from the code ($\\delta$, the relative\ndistance from the code, is called the proximity). We then proceed to study\nlimitations on qLTCs. In our first main result we prove a surprising,\ninherently quantum, property of sLTCs: for small values of proximity, the\nbetter the small-set expansion of the interaction graph of the constraints, the\nless sound the qLTC becomes. This phenomenon, which can be attributed to\nmonogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical setting.\nThe complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an upper bound on the\nsoundness when the code is defined on poor small-set expanders (a bound which\nturns out to be far more difficult to show in the quantum case). Together we\narrive at a quantum upper-bound on the soundness of stabilizer qLTCs set on any\ngraph, which does not hold in the classical case.

For\nmany practical applications, an important criterion is that a particular\nphotonic reagent prescription still produce a good, if not optimal, target\nobjective yield when transferred to a different system or laboratory, {even if\nthe same shaped pulse profile cannot be reproduced exactly. As a specific\nexample, we assess the potential for transferring optimal photonic reagents for\nthe objective of optimizing a ratio of photoproduct ions from a family of\nhalomethanes through three related experiments.} First, applying the same set\nof photonic reagents with systematically varying second- and third-order chirp\non both laser systems generated similar shapes of the associated control\nlandscape (i.e., relation between the objective yield and the variables\ndescribing the photonic reagents). Second, optimal photonic reagents obtained\nfrom the first laser system were found to still produce near optimal yields on\nthe second laser system. Third, transferring a collection of photonic reagents\noptimized on the first laser system to the second laser system reproduced\nsystematic trends in photoproduct yields upon interaction with the homologous\nchemical family. Despite inherent differences between the two systems,\nsuccessful and robust transfer of photonic reagents is demonstrated in the\nabove three circumstances. The ability to transfer photonic reagents from one\nlaser system to another is analogous to well-established utilitarian operating\nprocedures with traditional chemical reagents.

The\ntechniques of logic synthesis reduce the cost of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation by one to two orders of magnitude, depending on which benchmark is\nused.\n  Using resource analysis for $T$ gates and Toffoli gates, several proposals\nfor constructing arbitrary quantum gates are compared, including \"Clifford+$T$\"\nsequences, $V$-basis sequences, phase kickback, and programmable ancilla\nrotations. The application of arbitrary gates to quantum algorithms for\nsimulating chemistry is discussed as well.

The nature of this\ntopological phase transition and its critical property are investigated\nnumerically. Physical properties of topological superconducting phase are also\nexplored. Moreover, the local density of states is calculated, through which\nthe topological feature may be tested experimentally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 15:54:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 06:54:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 18:29:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Tao", ""], ["Gao", "Yi", ""], ["Wang", "Z.

Any nonlocal correlation\nobtained in quantum world can have a local deterministic explanation if there\nis no experimental free-will in choosing the measurement settings. Recently, in\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf105}, 250404 (2010)] it has been shown that to obtain a\nlocal deterministic description for singlet state correlation one does not need\nto give up measurement independence completely, but a partial measurement\ndependence suffices. In three party scenario considering GHZ correlation one\ncan exhibit absolute contradiction between quantum theory and local realism. In\nthis paper we show that such correlation also has local deterministic\ndescription if measurement independence is given up, even if not completely. We\nprovide a local deterministic model for equatorial Von Neumann measurements on\ntripartite GHZ state by sacrificing measurement independence partially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 16:14:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Sep 2014 19:32:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Arup", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Amit", ""], ["Bhattacharya", "Some Sankar", ""], ["Banik", "Manik", ""], ["Das", "Subhadipa", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8600", "submitter": "T.
