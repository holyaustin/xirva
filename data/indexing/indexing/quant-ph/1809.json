An\nimportant recent development in this field is the measurement and manipulation\nof extremely confined phonon-polariton modes in polar dielectrics such as\nsilicon carbide and hexagonal boron nitride, which pave the way for\nnanophotonics and extreme light-matter interactions in the mid-IR to THz\nfrequency range. To further advance this promising field, it is of great\ninterest to predict the optical response of recently discovered and\nyet-to-be-synthesized polaritonic materials alike. Here we develop a unified\nframework based on quantum linear response theory to calculate the spatially\nnon-local dielectric function of a polar lattice in arbitrary dimensions. In\nthe case of a three-dimensional bulk material, the spatially local limit of our\ncalculation reproduces standard results for the dielectric response of a polar\nlattice. Using this framework, we provide ab initio calculations of the\ndielectric permittivity of important bulk polar dielectrics such as silicon\ncarbide and hexagonal boron nitride in good agreement with experiments. From\nthe ab initio theory, we are able to develop a microscopic understanding of\nwhich phonon modes contribute to each component of the dielectric function, as\nwell as predict features in the dielectric function that are a result of weak\nTO phonons. This formalism also identifies regime(s) where quantum nonlocal\neffects may correct the phonon polariton dispersion, extremely relevant in\nrecent atomic-scale experiments which confine electromagnetic fields to the\nscale of 1~nm. Finally, our work points the way towards first principles\ndescriptions of the effect of interface phonons, phonon strong coupling, and\nchiral phonons on the properties of phonon polaritons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 20:51:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Rivera", "Nicholas", ""], ["Coulter", "Jennifer", ""], ["Christensen", "Thomas", ""], ["Narang", "Prineha", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00102", "submitter": "Fu-Guo Deng", "authors": "Hao Zhang, Xue-Ke Song, Qing Ai, Haibo Wang, Guo-Jian Yang, Fu-Guo\n  Deng", "title": "Fast and robust quantum control for multimode interactions by using\n  shortcuts to adiabaticity", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures.

This assumption has come to be known as \"measurement independence\"\n(also referred to as \"freedom of choice\" or \"settings independence\"). For a\ntwo-setting, two-outcome Bell test, we derive modified Bell inequalities that\nrelax measurement independence, for either or both observers, while remaining\nlocally causal. We describe the loss of measurement independence for each\nobserver using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and\nalso by a more complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call\n$\\hat{M}_1$ and $\\hat{M}_2$, deriving a modified Bell inequality for each\ndescription. These \"relaxed\" inequalities subsume those considered in previous\nwork as special cases, and quantify how much the assumption of measurement\nindependence needs to be relaxed in order for a locally causal model to produce\na given violation of the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)\ninequality. We show that both relaxed Bell inequalities are tight bounds on the\nCHSH parameter by constructing locally causal models that saturate them. For\nany given Bell inequality violation, the new two-parameter and four-parameter\nmodels each require significantly less mutual information between the hidden\nvariables and measurement settings than previous models. We conjecture that the\nnew models, with optimal parameters, require the minimum possible mutual\ninformation for a given Bell violation.

By using spin\necho to suppress the blockade error, we propose an easily realizable\ncontrolled-phase Rydberg quantum gate of high intrinsic fidelity. In the\ncontext of spin echo, we show that the fundamental blockade error of the\ntraditional Rydberg gate, on the order of $\\epsilon\\sim10^{-3}$, actually\nresults from two `clockwise' rotations of Rabi frequencies $\\bar\\Omega_\\pm=V\\pm\n\\sqrt{V^2+\\Omega^2}$. In our `echo' sequence, such an error can be suppressed\nto the order of $\\epsilon^2$ by adding two `anticlockwise' rotations with\nfrequencies $-\\bar\\Omega_\\pm$. With the blockade error effectively removed, the\nerror caused by Rydberg state decay becomes the final fundamental limit to the\ngate accuracy, which in principle, can be reduced beyond the level of\n$10^{-5}$. Furthermore, due to the small population $\\epsilon$ involved in the\n`echo' process, the spin-echo gate is robust against the variation of Rydberg\nblockade caused by the drift of the qubits, so that it can still be much more\naccurate than that of a traditional Rydberg gate even for qubits cooled only to\nthe sub-mK regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2018 22:52:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Xiao-Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.01785", "submitter": "Cristina Benea", "authors": "Ileana-Cristina Benea-Chelmus, Francesca Fabiana Settembrini, Giacomo\n  Scalari, and J\\'er\\^ome Faist", "title": "Electric field correlation measurements on the electromagnetic vacuum\n  state", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Nature 568, 202-206 (2019)", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-019-1083-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum mechanics ascribes to the ground state of the electromagnetic\nradiation zero-point electric field fluctuations that permeate empty space at\nall frequencies.

Also, while joint non-measurability of\nobservables is an operational notion, the complementarity in Bohr sense (i.e.\nexcess of information needed to describe the system) has not yet been expressed\nin purely operational terms.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these problems, by introducing an\noperational definition for complementarity, and further postulating uncertainty\nas a necessary price for complementarity in physical theories.

The simultaneous unity and complexity of\nsubjective experience is difficult to understand from a classical physics\nperspective. In contrast, quantum entanglement is naturally both complex and\nunified. Moreover the concept of matter is much more subtle in quantum physics\ncompared to classical physics, and quantum computing shows that quantum effects\ncan be useful for information processing.

Spins in condensed matter systems\nat room or body temperature can have coherence times in the relevant range for\nsubjective experience (milliseconds to seconds). Photons are well suited for\ndistributing entanglement over macroscopic distances. Neurons emit photons,\nreactive oxygen species in the mitochondria being likely sources. Opsins,\nlight-sensitive proteins that are plausible single-photon detectors, exist in\nthe brain and are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that they serve a\nfunction. We have recently shown by detailed numerical modeling that axons can\nplausibly act as photonic waveguides. The oxygen molecule, which has non-zero\nelectronic spin and emits photons, might serve as an interface between photons\nand spins.

Our\nseparation can be formulated in a very general way. It can be applied to very\ndifferent partitionings ranging from those driven by features in the molecular\nstructure (such as a solute surrounded by solvent molecules) to those that aim\nat an orbital separation (such as core-valence separation). Our framework\nembraces recent developments of Manby and Miller as well as older ones of\nHuzinaga and Cantu. Projector-based embedding is simplified and accelerated by\nSSUB. Moreover, it directly relates to decoupling approaches for relativistic\nfour-component many-electron theory. For a Fock operator based on the Dirac\none-electron Hamiltonian, one would like to separate the so-called positronic\n(negative-energy) states from the electronic bound and continuum states. The\nexact two-component (X2C) approach developed for this purpose becomes a special\ncase of the general SSUB framework and may therefore be viewed as a\nsystem-environment decoupling approach. Moreover, for SSUB there exists no\nrestriction with respect to the number of subsystems that are generated - in\nthe limit, decoupling of all single-particle states is recovered, which\nrepresents exact diagonalization of the problem. The fact that a Fock operator\ndepends on its eigenvectors poses challenges to all system-environment\ndecoupling approaches and is discussed in terms of the SSUB framework. Apart\nfrom improved conceptual understanding, these relations bring about technical\nadvances as developments in different fields can immediately cross-fertilize\none another.

Formulated in the\nlanguage of constrained systems, the perspective-neutral structure turns out to\nbe the constraint surface classically and the gauge invariant Hilbert space in\nthe Dirac quantized theory. By contrast, a perspective relative to a specific\nframe corresponds to a gauge choice and the associated reduced phase and\nHilbert space. Quantum reference frame switches thereby amount to a symmetry\ntransformation. In the quantum theory, they require a transformation that takes\none from the Dirac to a reduced quantum theory and we show that it amounts to a\ntrivialization of the constraints and a subsequent projection onto the\nclassical gauge fixing conditions. We illustrate this method in the relational\n$N$-body problem with rotational and translational symmetry. This model is\nparticularly interesting because it features the Gribov problem so that\nglobally valid gauge fixing conditions are impossible which, in turn, implies\nalso that globally valid relational frame perspectives are absent in both the\nclassical and quantum theory.

As a side product, we are able to use\nthis characterization to show that the Hadamard exponential of a Euclidean\ndistance matrix is positive semidefinite.

The main ingredients of our method\nare variational quantum perceptron (VQP) and a quantum generalization of\nclassical ensemble learning. Our VQP employs parameterized quantum circuits to\nlearn a Grover search (or amplitude amplification) operation with classical\noptimization, and can achieve quadratic speedup in query complexity compared to\nits classical counterparts. We show how the trained VQP can be used to predict\nfuture data with $O(1)$ {query} complexity. Ultimately, a stronger nonlinear\nclassifier can be established, the so-called quantum ensemble learning (QEL),\nby combining a set of weak VQPs produced using a subsampling method. The\nsubsampling method has two significant advantages. First, all $T$ weak VQPs\nemployed in QEL can be trained in parallel, therefore, the query complexity of\nQEL is equal to that of each weak VQP multiplied by $T$. Second, it\ndramatically reduce the {runtime} complexity of encoding circuits that map\nclassical data to a quantum state because this dataset can be significantly\nsmaller than the original dataset given to QEL. This arguably provides a most\nsatisfactory solution to one of the most criticized issues in quantum machine\nlearning proposals. To conclude, we perform two numerical experiments for our\nVQP and QEL, implemented by Python and pyQuil library.

Thus our result improves the required depth for this level of\nanti-concentration from linear depth to a sub-linear value, depending on the\ngeometry of the interactions. This is relevant to a recent proposal by the\nGoogle Quantum AI group to perform such a sampling task with 49 qubits on a\ntwo-dimensional lattice and confirms their conjecture that $O(\\sqrt n)$ depth\nsuffices for anti-concentration. We also prove that anti-concentration is\npossible in depth O(log(n) loglog(n)) using a different model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:28:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Harrow", "Aram", ""], ["Mehraban", "Saeed", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.06964", "submitter": "Steven Touzard", "authors": "S.

We introduce two new methods to achieve this, the first method\ninvolving two new versions of convex-split lemma that use small amount of\nadditional resource (in comparison to prior version) and the second method\nbeing inspired by the technique of classical correlated sampling in computer\nscience. These lead to a series of new consequences, as follows.\n  First, we consider the task of quantum decoupling, where the aim is to apply\nan operation on a n-qubit register so as to make it independent of an\ninaccessible quantum system. Many previous works achieve decoupling with the\naid of a random unitary. It is known that random unitaries can be replaced by\nrandom circuits of size O(n\\log n) and depth poly(\\log n), or unitary 2-designs\nbased on Clifford circuits of similar size and depth. We show that given any\nchoice of basis such as the computational basis, decoupling can be achieved by\na unitary that takes basis vectors to basis vectors. Thus, the circuit acts in\na `classical' manner and additionally uses O(n) catalytic qubits in maximally\nmixed quantum state. Our unitary performs addition and multiplication modulo a\nprime and hence achieves a circuit size of O(n\\log n) and logarithmic depth.\nThis shows that the circuit complexity of integer multiplication (modulo a\nprime) is lower bounded by the optimal circuit complexity of decoupling.\n  Next, we construct a new one-shot entanglement-assisted protocol for quantum\nchannel coding that achieves near-optimal communication through a given\nchannel. The number of qubits of pre-shared entanglement is exponentially\nsmaller than that in the previous protocol near-optimal in communication.

Recently,\nit has been shown that the quantum Rabi model, describing the dipolar coupling\nbetween a two-level atom and a quantized electromagnetic field, violates this\nprinciple. This widely used model describes a plethora of quantum systems and\nphysical processes under different interaction regimes. In the ultrastrong\ncoupling regime, it provides predictions which drastically depend on the chosen\ngauge. This failure is attributed to the finite-level truncation of the matter\nsystem. We show that a careful application of the gauge principle is able to\nrestore gauge invariance even for extreme light-matter interaction regimes. The\nresulting quantum Rabi Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge differs significantly\nfrom the standard model and provides the same physical results obtained by\nusing the dipole gauge. It contains field operators to all orders that cannot\nbe neglected when the coupling strength is high.

Their realization,\nhowever, meets a major stumbling block -- the motion-induced dephasing of the\ntransition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using quantum interference\nbetween different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to\nrealize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a\nminimal dephasing error. We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,\nin the form of $\\text{diag}\\{1, e^{i\\alpha}, e^{i\\gamma}, e^{i\\beta}\\}$, where\n$\\alpha, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and\nthe Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a\nsingle off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually\napplying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of\nsimilar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of\nthem are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz.

Recently, we added to\nthis list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner)\ncombined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the\nrealm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other\napplications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum\ncomputers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a\ndesirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics\ndo not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for\neven near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable\nprotocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed\nby experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine\nlearning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device\ncharacteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus\nthe applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for\ngenerating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional\nneural networks.

In this context, a particularly important\ndemonstration has been that non-vanishing discord is the necessary condition\nfor the separable states to be used as resource for remotely preparing any\narbitrary pure target state [Nature Physics $8$, $666$ $(2012)$]. The present\nwork stems from our observation that not only resource states with same discord\ncan imply different efficiencies (in terms of average fidelity) of the remote\nstate preparation (RSP) protocol, but also states with higher discord can imply\nlower RSP efficiency. This, therefore, necessitates identification of the\nrelevant feature of quantum correlations which can appropriately quantify\neffectiveness of the resource state for the RSP protocol.
