A paradigmatic example is the time evolution of a domain-wall state of\na spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the so-called domain-wall melting. The model can\nbe implemented by having two species of bosonic atoms with unity filling and\nstrong on-site repulsion U in an optical lattice.

We show that\nthe dominating effects of holes on observables like the spatially resolved\nmagnetization can be taken account of by a linear combination of spatially\nshifted observables from the clean case. For sufficiently large U, further\neffects due to holes become negligible. In contrast, the effects of spin flips\nare more severe as their dynamics occur on the same time scale as that of the\ndomain-wall melting itself.

In particular, Fulling et al. used the finite energy-momentum-stress\ntensor in the presence of a perfectly conducting wedge, calculated many years\nago by Deutsch and Candelas, to compute the torque on one of the wedge\nboundaries, where the latter was cutoff by integrating the torque density down\nto minimum lower radius greater than zero. They observed that that torque is\nnot equal to the negative derivative of the energy obtained by integrating the\nenergy density down to the same minimum radius. This motivated a calculation of\nthe torque and energy in an annular sector obtained by the intersection of the\nwedge with two coaxial cylinders. In a previous paper we showed that for the\nanalogous scalar case, which also exhibited a torque anomaly in the absence of\nthe cylindrical boundaries, the point-split regulated torque and energy indeed\nexhibit an anomaly, unless the point-splitting is along the axis direction. In\nany case, because of curvature divergences, no unambiguous finite part can be\nextracted. However, that ambiguity is linear in the wedge angle; if the\ncondition is imposed that the linear term be removed, the resulting torque and\nenergy is finite, and exhibits no anomaly. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nsame phenomenon takes place for the electromagnetic field, so there is no\ntorque anomaly present here either. This is a nontrivial generalization, since\nthe anomaly found by Fulling et al. is linear for the Dirichlet scalar case,\nbut nonlinear for the conducting electromagnetic case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 18:23:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Milton", "Kimball A.", ""], ["Parashar", "Prachi", ""], ["Abalo", "E.

The Keldysh rotation that forms the basis\nof RTQFT is shown to be a phase-space mapping of the quantum system based on\nthe symmetric (Weyl) ordering.

Despite of its main role in quantum information processing,\nkinematic non-locality is unable to induce any change in the probability\ndistributions, so that the \"action-at-a-distance\" cannot manifest[5,6].\nConversely, dynamical non-locality does create explicit changes in probability,\nthough in a \"causality-preserving\" manner[6,7].

This\nrelation adds to the more fundamental understanding of the nature of quantum\ndynamics and allows us to establish and identify how the uncertainty and the\nsuperposition principles determine the non-local character of the outcome of a\nquantum measurement.

Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which\ncombines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling\nbetween the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir.

Unlike conventional, measurement-based\nschemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively uses engineered dissipation\nto fight decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback\nloop to correct errors, simplifying implementation. Instead the feedback loop\nis built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the\npresence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block\nstate for quantum information processing.

While the short-distance behavior of\nthis factor is well understood, little is known about the form of f(rij) at\nlarge rij. In this work we investigate the optimal form of f(r12) on the\nexample of the helium atom and helium-like ions and several well-motivated\nmodels of the wave function. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle we\nderive a differential equation for f(r12) and solve it using numerical\npropagation or analytic asymptotic expansion techniques. We found that for\nevery model under consideration, f(r12) behaves at large r12 as r12^{\\rho}\nexp(B r12) and obtained simple analytic expressions for the system dependent\nvalues of {\\rho} and B. For the ground state of the helium-like ions the value\nof B is positive, so that f(r12) diverges as r12 tends to infinity. The\nnumerical propagation confirms this result. When the Hartree-Fock orbitals,\nmultiplied by the correlation factor, are expanded in terms of Slater functions\nr^n exp(-{\\beta}r), the numerical propagation reveals a minimum in f(r12) with\ndepth increasing with N. For the lowest triplet state B is negative. Employing\nour analytical findings, we propose a new 'range-separated' form of the\ncorrelation factor with the short- and long-range r12 regimes approximated by\nappropriate asymptotic formulas connected by a switching function.

For maximally entangled initially\nstate, we show that for fully decohered case every strategy profile results in\neither of the two possible equilibrium outcomes. Two of the four possible\nstrategy profiles become Pareto Optimal and Nash equilibrium and no dilemma is\nleftover. It is shown that other equilibrium points emerge for different region\nof values of decoherence parameter that are either Pareto optimal or Pareto\ninefficient in the quantum strategic spaces.

Although a few numerical works are available in the\nliterature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical\nprescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is\nused to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the\nboundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The\ndeformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation.\nA deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a\nspherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of\nstandard Rayleigh-Schr{\\\"o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed\nequation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at\neach order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which\nmake them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary\nconditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the\nwavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been\ntested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three\ndimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well\nfor these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary\nsurfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and\nalso their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative\nseries for the energy.

It is found that different types of a-balancedness correspond to\ndifferent types of local SU invariants analogously to how different types of\nbalancedness as defined in [New J.

In the case\nof three qubits the different kinds of topological phases are fully\ndistinguished by the three-tangle together with one more invariant. Using this\nwe present a qualitative classification scheme based on balancedness of a\nstate.

A continuous-mode multi-photon state is a state of a travelling light\nwavepacket that contains a definite number of photons and is characterised by a\ntemporal (or equivalently spectral) profile. After the interaction with the\nsystem, the outgoing light can be monitored by means of homodyne detection or\nphotodetection. Filters for both measurement schemes are derived in this paper.\nUnlike the vacuum or the coherent state case, the annihilation operator of the\nlight field acting on a multi-photon state changes the state by annihilating a\nphoton, and this makes the traditional filtering techniques inapplicable. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we adopt a non-Markovian embedding technique\nproposed in \\cite{gough:2013} for the study of the single-photon filtering\nproblem. However, the multi-photon nature of the problem addressed in this\npaper makes the study much more mathematically involved. Moreover, as\ndemonstrated by an example --- a two-level system driven by a continuous-mode\ntwo-photon state, multi-photon filters can reveal interesting strong nonlinear\noptical phenomena absent in both the single-photon state case and the\ncontinuous-mode Fock state case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 14:30:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 00:44:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 08:13:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Hongting", ""], ["Zhang", "Guofeng", ""], ["Xi", "Zairong", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7368", "submitter": "Markus Karl", "authors": "Markus Karl, Boris Nowak, Thomas Gasenzer", "title": "Universal scaling at non-thermal fixed points of a two-component Bose\n  gas", "comments": "13 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The different schemes\ncan be difficult to compare meaningfully. Here we develop a theoretical\nframework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal footing. We\napply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the singlet-triplet (ST)\nand the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We investigate three quantum\ngates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an AC gate based on logical\nqubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known as stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by an exchange\ninteraction that is controlled experimentally using the interdot tunnel\ncoupling $g$ and the detuning $\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference\nbetween the dots. Our procedure has two steps. First, we optimize the gate\nfidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a function of the other control parameters;\nthis yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that is universal for different types of\ngates. Next, we identify physical constraints on the control parameters; this\nyields an upper bound $f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate\ncombination. We show that similar gate fidelities ($ \\sim 99.5$%) should be\nattainable for ST qubits in isotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in\nnatural Si. Considerably lower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to\nthe fluctuating magnetic fields $\\Delta B$ produced by nuclear spins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 17:53:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Dec 2013 20:00:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Koh", "Teck Seng", ""], ["Coppersmith", "S.

In\nfact, we show that a number-conserving GVW is less efficient in capturing the\nground state of a quantum system than a more general MPS which can be optimized\nwith comparable computational resources. Moreover, we suggest a corrected\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm that ensures the\nconservation of the expectation value of the number of particles when a GVW or\na MPS are not explicitly number-conserving. The GVW dynamics obtained with our\nalgorithm compares very well with the exact one in 1D. Most importantly, the\nalgorithm works in any dimension for a GVW.
