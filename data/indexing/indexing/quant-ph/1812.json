In this way, parallel theoretical and experimental\nstudies of few-body models become possible, which may provide a deeper\nunderstanding of correlation effects and give hints for designing and\ncontrolling new experiments. Of particular interest is to explore the physics\nin the strongly correlated regime and in the neighborhood of critical points.\n  Particle correlations in nanostructures may be characterized by their\nentanglement spectrum, i.e. the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of\nthe system partitioned into two subsystems. We will discuss how to determine\nthe entropy of entanglement spectrum of few-body systems in bound and resonant\nstates within the same formalism. The linear entropy will be calculated for a\nmodel of quasi-one dimensional Gaussian quantum dot in the lowest energy\nstates. We will study how the entanglement depends on the parameters of the\nsystem, paying particular attention to the behavior on the border between the\nregimes of bound and resonant states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Dec 2018 17:31:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kuro\u015b", "Arkadiusz", ""], ["Okopi\u0144ska", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.00454", "submitter": "Alessandro Ciani", "authors": "Alessandro Ciani, Barbara M.

Stark tuning is an\nefficient technique to overcome this issue as it can control the emission\nenergy of individual quantum dots through the quantum-confined Stark effect.\nRealizing this technique in InAs/InP quantum dots has previously been limited\nto shifts of less than 0.8 meV due to jumps in the emission energy because of\nadditional charges at high electric field intensities. We demonstrate up to 5.1\nmeV of Stark tuning in the emission wavelength of InAs/InP quantum dots. To\neliminate undesirable jumps to charged state, we use a thin oxide insulator to\nprevent carrier injection from the contacts, thereby significantly improves the\ntuning range of the Stark effect. Moreover, the single-photon nature and narrow\nlinewidth of the quantum dot emission is preserved under a wide range of\napplied electric fields. Using photoluminescence intensity measurements and\ntime-resolved lifetime spectroscopy we confirmed that this Stark tuning range\nis limited by carrier tunneling at high electric fields.

The general\nresults can also be easily applied to other resource theories such as\nentanglement, magic states, and asymmetry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 14:56:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2019 03:50:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Lu", ""], ["Bu", "Kaifeng", ""], ["Liu", "Zi-Wen", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02579", "submitter": "Haozhi Wang", "authors": "H.

It is based on identification of a parameter\nwhich is uniformly small on wide time intervals: the occupation of the virtual\ncloud of quanta. By \"virtual\" we denote those bath excitations which were\nemitted by the system, but eventually will be reabsorbed before any measurement\nof the bath state. A favourable property of the virtual cloud is that the\nnumber of its quanta is expected to saturate on long times, since physically\nthis cloud is a (retarded) polarization of the bath around the system.\nTherefore, the joint state of open system and of virtual cloud (the dressed\nstate) can be accurately represented in a truncated basis of Fock states, on a\nwide time scale. At the same time, there can be arbitrarily large number of\nobservable quanta, especially if the open system is under driving. However, by\nemploying a Monte Carlo sampling of the measurement outcomes of the bath, we\ncan simulate the dynamics of the observable quantum field. In this work we\nconsider the measurement with respect to the coherent states, which yields the\nHusimi function as the positive (quasi)probability distribution of the\noutcomes. The evolution of dressed state which corresponds to a particular\nfixed outcome is called the dressed qauntum trajectory. Therefore, the Monte\nCarlo sampling of these trajectories yields a stochastic simulation method with\npromising convergence properties on wide time scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Polyakov", "Evgeny A.", ""], ["Rubtsov", "Alexey N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.03936", "submitter": "David Poulin", "authors": "David Poulin, Roger G.

It exhibits a\nmaximally chaotic behavior characterized by out-of-time-ordered correlators\n(OTOCs), and is expected to be a holographic dual to black holes. Recently, a\nstriking similarity between the SYK model and the Hund-coupling induced\nspin-freezing crossover in multi-orbital Hubbard models has been pointed out.\nTo further explore this connection, we study OTOCs for fermionic Hubbard\nmodels, which are prototypical models for strongly correlated electrons in\nsolids. We introduce an imaginary-time four-point correlation function with an\nappropriate time ordering, which by means of the spectral representation and\nthe out-of-time-order fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be analytically\ncontinued to real-time OTOCs. Based on this approach, we numerically evaluate\nreal-time OTOCs for Hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit, using the\ndynamical mean-field theory in combination with a numerically exact\ncontinuous-time Monte Carlo impurity solver. The results for the single-orbital\nmodel show that a certain spin-related OTOC captures local moment formation in\nthe vicinity of the metal-insulator transition, while the self-energy does not\nshow SYK-like non-Fermi liquid behavior. On the other hand, for the two- and\nthree-orbital models with nonzero Hund coupling we find that the OTOC exhibits\na rapid damping at short times and an approximate power-law decay at longer\ntimes in the spin-freezing crossover regime characterized by fluctuating local\nmoments and a non-Fermi liquid self-energy $\\Sigma(\\omega) \\sim \\sqrt{\\omega}$.\nThese results are in a good agreement with the behavior of the SYK model,\nproviding firm evidence for the close relation between the spin-freezing\ncrossover physics of multi-orbital Hubbard models and the SYK strange metal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 04:44:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Jun 2019 08:35:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Tsuji", "Naoto", ""], ["Werner", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.04219", "submitter": "Daniel Grier", "authors": "Scott Aaronson, Daniel Grier, Luke Schaeffer", "title": "A Quantum Query Complexity Trichotomy for Regular Languages", "comments": "38 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a trichotomy theorem for the quantum query complexity of regular\nlanguages. Every regular language has quantum query complexity Theta(1),\n~Theta(sqrt n), or Theta(n). The extreme uniformity of regular languages\nprevents them from taking any other asymptotic complexity. This is in contrast\nto even the context-free languages, which we show can have query complexity\nTheta(n^c) for all computable c in [1/2,1]. Our result implies an equivalent\ntrichotomy for the approximate degree of regular languages, and a\ndichotomy---either Theta(1) or Theta(n)---for sensitivity, block sensitivity,\ncertificate complexity, deterministic query complexity, and randomized query\ncomplexity.\n  The heart of the classification theorem is an explicit quantum algorithm\nwhich decides membership in any star-free language in ~O(sqrt n) time. This\nwell-studied family of the regular languages admits many interesting\ncharacterizations, for instance, as those languages expressible as sentences in\nfirst-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation.\nTherefore, not only do the star-free languages capture functions such as OR,\nthey can also express functions such as \"there exist a pair of 2's such that\neverything between them is a 0.\"\n  Thus, we view the algorithm for star-free languages as a nontrivial\ngeneralization of Grover's algorithm which extends the quantum quadratic\nspeedup to a much wider range of string-processing algorithms than was\npreviously known.

This memory has slowly-decaying power-law tails.\nSuch a long-range character of the memory complicates the description of the\nresulting real-time dynamics on large time scales.

Therefore, we introduce the concept of memory\nchannel, to denote such an irreversible information loss process around a\nparticular singular frequency. On a technical side, we begin the treatment by\nnoting that with respect to the memory loss, the quantum field of the bath\nshould be divided into the following two different parts: the observable and\nthe virtual quanta. Information about the former is never lost: they contribute\nto the trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The only way to avoid the\nrevival from the observable quanta is to calculate their dynamics exactly. We\ndo this by employing a stochastic sampling of the Husimi function of the bath.\nThe other part, the virtual quanta, are always annihilated after a certain\ndelay time.

I then, in joint work with Ojas Parekh, analyze the\nperformance of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on a graph\nproblem called Max Cut. Next, I present a new stabilizer simulation algorithm\nthat gives improved runtime performance for topological stabilizer codes. After\nthat, in joint work with Andrew Landahl, I present a new set of procedures for\nperforming logical operations called \"color-code lattice-surgery.\" Finally, I\ndescribe a software package I developed for studying, developing, and\nevaluating quantum error-correcting codes under realistic noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 22:47:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ryan-Anderson", "Ciar\u00e1n", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.04738", "submitter": "Takehisa Iwakoshi", "authors": "Takehisa Iwakoshi", "title": "Guessing probability under unlimited known-plaintext attack on secret\n  keys for Y00 quantum stream cipher by quantum multiple hypotheses testing", "comments": "Not exactly same as the submitted version, rather close to before the\n  revision.

In the former setting, we prove a composite quantum Stein's Lemma. We\nalso discuss how this gives an operational interpretation to several quantities\nof interest. For the latter, we give the optimal asymptotic error rates in\nseveral symmetric and asymmetric settings, and discuss properties and examples\nof these rates.\n  In the second part, the focus is shifted to entropy inequalities. We start\nwith recoverability inequalities. Using tools developed to prove the composite\nStein's Lemma, we give a strengthened lower bound on the conditional quantum\nmutual information (CQMI). Next, we give an operational interpretation to the\nrelative entropy of recovery via hypothesis testing. Then, we discuss some\nrecent counterexamples, which show that the relative entropy of recovery is not\na lower bound on the CQMI; we provide more counterexamples where some systems\nare classical.\n  We then turn to a seemingly different type of entropy inequalities called\nbounds on information combining. Using a particular recoverability inequality,\nwe give a lower bound and additionally conjecture optimal lower and upper\nbounds. Furthermore, we discuss implications of our bounds to the finite\nblocklength behavior of Polar codes.\n  Finally, we discuss Renyi-$2$ entropy inequalities for Gaussian states, by\nexploiting their formulation as log-det inequalities to find recoverability\nrelated bounds on several quantities.

The method is applied to two chemically important molecules:\nO$_2$ (oxygen) and O$_3$ (ozone). The lowest two vibrational states of these\nmolecules are computed using both a hardware quantum annealer and a software\nbased classical annealer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2018 00:46:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Teplukhin", "Alexander", ""], ["Kendrick", "Brian K.", ""], ["Babikov", "Dmitri", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.05226", "submitter": "Xing Rong", "authors": "Yang Wu, Wenqiang Liu, Jianpei Geng, Xingrui Song, Xiangyu Ye,\n  Chang-Kui Duan, Xing Rong and Jiangfeng Du", "title": "Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single spin system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1126/science.aaw8205", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A fundamental axiom of quantum mechanics requires the Hamiltonians to be\nHermitian which guarantees real eigen-energies and probability conservation.\nHowever, a class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with Parity-Time\n($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry can still display entirely real spectra.

On the other hand, the evolution of mutual\ninformation in the ECP depends not only on the relativistic particles but also\non slowly-moving particles. (2) For the CCP, both logarithmic negativity and\nmutual information oscillate in time after the quench. When the subsystems are\nwell-separated, the oscillation of the quantum correlations in the fast limit\nis suppressed, and the time evolution looks similar to that under the ECP in\nthe fast limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Dec 2018 09:03:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2018 10:43:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Fujita", "Hiroyuki", ""], ["Nishida", "Mitsuhiro", ""], ["Nozaki", "Masahiro", ""], ["Sugimoto", "Yuji", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.06276", "submitter": "Vasileios Lembessis Dr.", "authors": "V.

Our algorithm is inspired by particle\nswarm optimization and Bayesian particle-filter based adaptive methods, which\nwe extend and enhance using neural networks. The resampling step, in which a\nbank of candidate solutions -- particles -- is refined, is in our case learned\ndirectly from data, removing the computational bottleneck of standard methods.\nWe successfully replace the Bayesian calculation that requires computational\ntime of $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ with a learned heuristic whose time complexity\nempirically scales as $O(\\log(n))$ with the number of copies measured $n$,\nwhile retaining the same reconstruction accuracy.

Naturally, I try to use the concepts and resources\ndeveloped by the quantum optics community to improve experiment about fluids of\nlight, but I also reverse the approach and ask a very simple question: what\ndoes the concept of fluid of light bring to our understanding of non-linear and\nquantum optics ?

Moreover, the\nentanglement of quantum systems is hard to preserve for a long time period due\nto decoherence and dephasing mainly caused by radiative and nonradiative\nlosses. In this work, we outperform the aforementioned limitations by\npresenting efficient long-range inter-emitter entanglement and large\nenhancement of resonance energy transfer between two optical qubits mediated by\nepsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and other plasmonic waveguide types, such as V-shaped\ngrooves and cylindrical nanorods. More importantly, we explicitly demonstrate\nthat the ENZ waveguide resonant energy transfer and entanglement performance\ndrastically outperforms the other waveguide systems. Only the excited ENZ mode\nhas an infinite phase velocity combined with a strong and homogeneous electric\nfield distribution, which leads to a giant energy transfer and efficient\nentanglement independent to the emitters separation distances and nanoscale\npositions in the ENZ nanowaveguide, an advantageous feature that can\npotentially accommodate multi-qubit entanglement. Moreover, the transient\nentanglement can be further improved and become almost independent of the\ndetrimental decoherence effect when an optically active (gain) medium is\nembedded inside the ENZ waveguide. We also present that efficient steady-state\nentanglement can be achieved by using a coherent external pumping scheme.\nFinally, we report a practical way to detect the steady-state entanglement by\ncomputing the second-order correlation function.

The best general lower bound (due to Orlitsky) and upper bound\n(due to Naor, Orlitsky, and Shor) on the classical communication complexity of\nsuch problems differ only by a constant factor. We exhibit an example showing\nthat, somewhat surprisingly, the four-round protocol used in the bound of Naor\net al. can in fact be optimal. Finally, we pose a conjecture on the\northogonality rank of a certain graph whose truth would imply an intriguing\nimpossibility of round elimination in quantum protocols for list problems,\nsomething that works trivially in the classical case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2018 18:02:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bri\u00ebt", "Jop", ""], ["Buhrman", "Harry", ""], ["Leung", "Debbie", ""], ["Piovesan", "Teresa", ""], ["Speelman", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.09291", "submitter": "Christian Schilling", "authors": "Christian Schilling", "title": "Relating the pure and ensemble density matrix functional", "comments": "version as published in Communications of Journal of Chemical Physics", "journal-ref": "J.

It is found by applying\nFine's theorem that the CGLMP approach involves a LHVT for the joint\nprobabilities associated with the measurement of one observable from each of\nthe two sub-systems, even though the underlying probabilities for joint\nmeasurements of all four observables may involve a non-local HVT. The latter\nHVT probabilities involve simultaneous measurements of observables\ncorresponding to non-commuting quantum operators - allowable in classical\ntheory. Although the CGLMP inequalities involve probabilities for measurements\nof one observable per sub-system and are compatible with the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, there is no unambiguous quantum measurement process\nlinked to the probabilities in the CGLMP inequalities, and these quantum\nmeasurements each have different probabilities. However, violation of a CGLMP\ninequality based on any one of the possible quantum measurement sequences is\nsufficient to show that the Collins et al LHVT predicts different results to\nquantum theory. This occurs for a state considered in their paper - though for\nobservables whose physical interpretation is unclear. In spite of this issue\nand in spite of the contextuality loophole, it is concluded that the CGLMP\ninequalities are indeed suitable for ruling out both local (and non-local)\nhidden variable theories.

Deterministic\ngeneration of ensembles of NV centers can advance the research on quantum\nsensing, many-body quantum systems, multipartite entanglement and so on.

A\nmicrowave-assisted CVD set-up is presented which we constructed for the\npreparation of single-crystalline homoepitaxial diamond films. The films were\nprepared with minimized nitrogen concentration, which is confirmed through\nphotoluminescence measurements. We demonstrate an in situ ultra high vacuum\n(UHV) implantation and heating process for creation of NV centers using a novel\nexperimental set-up. For the first time hot implantation has been shown which\nprevents surface charging effects. We do not observe graphitization due to UHV\nheating. By optimizing the implantation parameters it has been possible to\nimplant NV centers in a precise way. We present large area mapping of the\nsamples to determine the distribution of the centers and describe the\ncharacterization of the centers by spectroscopic techniques. Reducing the\ndecoherence caused by environmental noise is of primary importance for many\napplications in quantum technology.

Related to non-stabilizer state manipulation is\nthe resource theory of non-stabilizer states, for which one of the goals is to\ncharacterize and quantify non-stabilizerness of a quantum state. In this paper,\nwe introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of\nnon-stabilizerness in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures\nto address several open questions in the resource theory of non-stabilizer\nstates. As a first application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as\nan efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable\nnon-stabilizerness, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at\nwhich non-stabilizerness can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of\nmagic-state distillation. We then prove that the max-thauma can be used as an\nefficiently computable tool in benchmarking the efficiency of magic-state\ndistillation and that it can outperform pervious approaches based on mana.\nFinally, we use the min-thauma to bound a quantity known in the literature as\nthe \"regularized relative entropy of magic.\" As a consequence of this bound, we\nfind that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established\nnon-stabilizerness measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime\nat a rate equal to one.

The wave function of the spacetime\nand the matter fields, all together, can then be seen as a super-field that\npropagates in the minisuperspace and the so-called third quantisation procedure\ncan be applied in a parallel way as the second quantisation procedure is\nperformed with a matter field that propagates in the spacetime. The super-field\ncan thus be interpreted as made up of universes propagating, i.e. evolving, in\nthe minisuperspace. The corresponding Fock space for the quantum state of the\nmultiverse is then presented. The analogy can also be used in the opposite\ndirection.

Such instabilities have been extensively studied\nin the context of gravitational wave detectors, and their presence has recently\nbeen reported in Advanced LIGO. Here, we observe experimentally and describe\ntheoretically a new type of optomechanical instability that arises in two-tone\nbackaction-evading (BAE) measurements, designed to overcome the standard\nquantum limit, and demonstrate the effect in the optical domain with a photonic\ncrystal nanobeam, and in the microwave domain with a micromechanical oscillator\ncoupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast to the well-known oscillatory\nparametric instability that occurs in single-tone, blue-detuned pumping, which\nis characterized by a vanishing effective mechanical damping, the parametric\ninstability in balanced two-tone optomechanics is exponential, and is a result\nof small detuning errors in the two pump frequencies. Its origin can be\nunderstood in a rotating frame as the vanishing of the effective mechanical\nfrequency due to an optical spring effect. Counterintuitively, the instability\noccurs even in the presence of perfectly balanced intracavity fields, and can\noccur for both signs of detuning. We find excellent quantitative agreement with\nour theoretical predictions. Since the constraints on tuning accuracy become\nstricter with increasing probe power, it imposes a fundamental limitation on\nBAE measurements, as well as other two-tone schemes. In addition to introducing\na new limitation in two-tone BAE measurements, the results also introduce a new\ntype of nonlinear dynamics in cavity optomechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2018 15:09:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 12:44:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Nov 2019 15:59:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Shomroni", "Itay", ""], ["Youssefi", "Amir", ""], ["Sauerwein", "Nick", ""], ["Qiu", "Liu", ""], ["Seidler", "Paul", ""], ["Malz", "Daniel", ""], ["Nunnenkamp", "Andreas", ""], ["Kippenberg", "Tobias J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11053", "submitter": "Shihai Dong", "authors": "Mario Alberto Mercado Sanchez, Guo-Hua Sun, Shi-Hai Dong", "title": "Application of Flexible Presentation of Quantum Images in Multipartite\n  Correlations", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We apply quantum model inspired on the classical Bayesian method also called\nmutual information to study the multipartite correlation in quantum images by\nusing the flexible representation of quantum images (FRQI).

In this paper we first review the SFA in the form developed by us in the\nlast 25 years. In this approach SFA is a method to solve the TDSE using a\nsystematic perturbation theory in a part of the Hamiltonian describing\ncontinuum-continuum transitions in the presence of the laser field. In this\nreview we focus on recent applications of SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from\nmulti-electron atoms and from multi-atom. The main novel part of the presented\ntheory concerns generalizations of SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of\ntwo-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between Electron\nImpact Ionization (EII) and Resonant Excitation with Subsequent Ionization\n(RESI); (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron (SAE)\napproximation of \"large\" molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing\ndynamics during the HHG or ATI process. In particular, we formulate the general\nexpressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum\nchemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent\nseparable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic\nelectronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 23:41:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2020 21:46:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Amini", "Kasra", ""], ["Biegert", "Jens", ""], ["Calegari", "Francesca", ""], ["Chac\u00f3n", "Alexis", ""], ["Ciappina", "Marcelo F.", ""], ["Dauphin", "Alexandre", ""], ["Efimov", "Dmitry K.", ""], ["Faria", "Carla Figueira de Morisson", ""], ["Giergiel", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Gniewek", "Piotr", ""], ["Landsman", "Alexandra S.", ""], ["Lesiuk", "Micha\u0142", ""], ["Mandrysz", "Micha\u0142", ""], ["Maxwell", "Andrew S.", ""], ["Moszy\u0144ski", "Robert", ""], ["Ortmann", "Lisa", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Jose Antonio", ""], ["Pic\u00f3n", "Antonio", ""], ["Pisanty", "Emilio", ""], ["Prauzner-Bechcicki", "Jakub", ""], ["Sacha", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Su\u00e1rez", "Noslen", ""], ["Za\u00efr", "Amelle", ""], ["Zakrzewski", "Jakub", ""], ["Lewenstein", "Maciej", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11450", "submitter": "Ido Kaminer", "authors": "Jonathan Nemirovsky, Eliahu Cohen, Ido Kaminer", "title": "Spin-Spacetime Censorship", "comments": "61 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "gr-qc quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum entanglement and relativistic causality are key concepts in\ntheoretical works seeking to unify quantum mechanics and gravity.

We show that any spin-related deviation from spherical symmetry\nwould violate relativistic causality. To avoid the violation of causality, the\nmeasurable spacetime around the particle's rest frame must remain spherically\nsymmetric, potentially as a back-action by the act of measurement.

In spite of their weak coupling to the $^{13}$C spins, these far-away\nprotons help produce a network of strongly coupled proton spins with collective\ndynamics, that drives thermalization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 23:48:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 14:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hahn", "Walter", ""], ["Dobrovitski", "V.

Exploiting\nsilicon-based PICs for quantum photonic information processing (or the\nso-called silicon quantum photonics) provides a promising pathway for\nlarge-scale quantum applications. For the development of scalable silicon\nquantum PICs, a major challenge is integrating on-silicon quantum light sources\nthat deterministically emit single photons. In this regard, the use of\nepitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) is a very promising approach, because of\ntheir capability of deterministic single-photon emission with high purity and\nindistinguishability. However, the required hybrid integration is inherently\ndifficult and often lacks the compatibility with CMOS processes. Here, we\ndemonstrate a QD single-photon source (SPS) integrated on a glass-clad silicon\nphotonic waveguide processed by a CMOS foundry. Hybrid integration is performed\nusing transfer printing, which enables us to integrate heterogeneous optical\ncomponents in a simple pick-and-place manner and thus assemble them after the\nentire CMOS process is completed. We observe single-photon emission from the\nintegrated QD and its efficient coupling into the silicon waveguide. Our\ntransfer-printing-based approach is fully compatible with CMOS back-end\nprocesses, and thus will open the possibility for realizing large-scale quantum\nPICs that leverage CMOS technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 02:09:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Katsumi", "Ryota", ""], ["Ota", "Yasutomo", ""], ["Osada", "Alto", ""], ["Yamaguchi", "Takuto", ""], ["Tajiri", "Takeyoshi", ""], ["Kakuda", "Masahiro", ""], ["Iwamoto", "Satoshi", ""], ["Akiyama", "Hidefumi", ""], ["Arakawa", "Yasuhiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11682", "submitter": "Wen Yu Kon", "authors": "W.
