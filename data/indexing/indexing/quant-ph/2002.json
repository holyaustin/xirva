A decoupling theorem takes a bipartite quantum state shared between\na system and a reference, applies some local operation on the system, and under\nsuitable constraints, proves that the resulting state is close to a product\nstate between the output system and the untouched reference. The theorem is\nsaid to be non-catalytic if it does not require an additional input of a\nquantum state, in tensor with the given input state, for the decoupling. Dupuis\nproved an important non-catalytic decoupling theorem where the operation on the\nsystem was a Haar random unitary followed by a fixed superoperator, unifying\nmany decoupling results proved earlier. He also showed a concentration result\nfor his decoupling theorem. In this work we give a new concentration result for\nnon-catalytic decoupling by showing that, for suitably large t, a unitary\nchosen uniformly at random from an approximate t-design gives rise to a state\nclose to a product state with probability $\\exp\\sim 1$. Our concentration,\nthough exponential, is less than that of Dupuis but for many important\napplications it uses less random bits than Dupuis. In particular, we prove that\napproximate $|A_1|$-designs decouple a quantum system in the Fully Quantum\nSlepian Wolf (FQSW) theorem wherein a fixed superoperator traces out the\nsubsystem $A_2$ from a system $A_1\\otimes A_2$. This leads to a saving in the\nnumber of random bits to $O(|A_1| \\log (|A_1| |A_2|))$ from\n$\\Omega(|A_1|^2|A_2|^2\\log (|A_1||A_2|))$ required by Haar random unitaries.\nMoreover, if $|A_1|=poly\\log(|A_2|)$, efficient constructions of approximate\n$|A_1|$-designs exist. This further implies that approximate unitary\n$|A_1|$-designs achieve relative thermalisation in quantum thermodynamics with\n$exp$ high probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Feb 2020 17:42:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2020 02:55:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:36:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 18:23:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2020 15:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2020 10:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Nema", "Aditya", ""], ["Sen", "Pranab", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00255", "submitter": "Sagnik Ghosh", "authors": "Sagnik Ghosh, Swapan K.

As an application, we show that this architecture allows for the\ngeneration of a cubic phase state with an experimentally feasible procedure.\nThis work highlights a practical advantage of microwave circuits with respect\nto optical systems for the purpose of engineering non-Gaussian states, and\nopens the quest for continuous-variable algorithms based on few repetitions of\nelementary gates from the continuous-variable universal set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2020 16:51:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2020 09:45:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hillmann", "Timo", ""], ["Quijandr\u00eda", "Fernando", ""], ["Johansson", "G\u00f6ran", ""], ["Ferraro", "Alessandro", ""], ["Gasparinetti", "Simone", ""], ["Ferrini", "Giulia", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.01417", "submitter": "Lewis Williamson", "authors": "L.

The area of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics\nhas been growing rapidly over the past twenty years. This has been driven by\nthe fact that $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian systems exhibit real\nenergy eigenvalues and unitary time evolution. Historically, the introduction\nof time into the world of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics has been a\nconceptually difficult problem to address, as it requires the Hamiltonian to\nbecome unobservable. We solve this issue with the introduction of a new\nobservable energy operator and explain why its instigation is a necessary and\nnatural progression in this setting. For the first time, the introduction of\ntime has allowed us to make sense of the parameter regime in which the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is spontaneously broken. Ordinarily, in the\ntime-independent setting, the energy eigenvalues become complex and the wave\nfunctions are asymptotically unbounded. We demonstrate that in the\ntime-dependent setting this broken symmetry can be mended and analysis on the\nspontaneously broken $\\mathcal{PT}$ regime is indeed possible. We provide many\nexamples of this mending on a wide range of different systems, beginning with a\n$2\\times2$ matrix model and extending to higher dimensional matrix models and\ncoupled harmonic oscillator systems with infinite Hilbert space. Furthermore,\nwe use the framework to perform analysis on time-dependent quasi-exactly\nsolvable models. We present the \"eternal life\" of entropy in this thesis.\nOrdinarily, for entangled quantum systems coupled to the environments, the\nentropy decays rapidly to zero.

For\ninstance, the maximal quantum violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality certifies that the underlying state contains the two-qubit maximally\nentangled state and the measurements of one party (say, Alice) contains a pair\nof anti-commuting qubit observables. As a consequence, the other party (say,\nBob) automatically verifies his set of states remotely steered by Alice, namely\nthe \"assemblage\", is in the eigenstates of a pair of anti-commuting\nobservables. It is natural to ask if the quantum violation of the Bell\ninequality is not maximally achieved, are we capable of estimating how close\nthe underlying assemblage is to the reference one? In this work, we provide a\nsystematic device-independent estimation by proposing a framework called\n\"robust self-testing of steerable quantum assemblages\". In particular, we\nconsider assemblages violating several paradigmatic Bell inequalities and\nobtain the robust self-testing statement for each scenario. Our result is\ndevice-independent (DI), i.e., no assumption is made on the shared state and\nthe measurement devices involved. Our work thus not only paves a way for\nexploring the connection between the boundary of quantum set of correlations\nand steerable assemblages, but also provides a useful tool in the areas of DI\nquantum certification.

Here, we propose three different classical\nalgorithms for simulating such universal quantum circuits, and characterize\nthem by establishing precise connections with a family of magic monotones. Our\nfirst simulator introduces a new class of quasiprobability distributions and\nconnects its runtime to a generalized notion of negativity. We prove that this\nalgorithm has significantly improved exponential scaling compared to all prior\nquasiprobability simulators for qubits. Our second simulator is a new variant\nof the stabilizer-rank simulation algorithm, extended to work with mixed states\nand with significantly improved runtime bounds. Our third simulator trades\nprecision for speed by discarding negative quasiprobabilities. We connect each\nalgorithm's performance to a corresponding magic monotone and, by\ncomprehensively characterizing the monotones, we obtain a precise understanding\nof the simulation runtime and error bounds. Our analysis reveals a deep\nconnection between all three seemingly unrelated simulation techniques and\ntheir associated monotones. For tensor products of single-qubit states, we\nprove that our monotones are all equal to each other, multiplicative and\nefficiently computable, allowing us to make clear-cut comparisons of the\nsimulators' performance scaling. Furthermore, our monotones establish several\nasymptotic and non-asymptotic bounds on state interconversion and distillation\nrates.

Furthermore, the techniques of message\nstrength normalization can naturally be applied to these single-valued messages\nto improve the performance.

The randomness is implemented via\na telegraph noise protocol in the drive period while the quasi-periodic drive\nis chosen to correspond to a Thue-Morse sequence. The periodically driven tBH\nmodel (with a square pulse protocol characterized by a time period $T$) is\nknown to exhibit transitions from dynamical regimes with long-time coherent\noscillations to those with rapid thermalization. Here we show that starting\nfrom a regime where the periodic drive leads to rapid thermalization, a random\ndrive, which consists of a random sequence of square pulses with period\n$T+\\alpha dT$, where $\\alpha=\\pm 1$ is a random number and $dT$ is the\namplitude of the noise, restores long-time coherent oscillations for special\nvalues of $dT$. A similar phenomenon can be seen for a quasi-periodic drive\nfollowing a Thue-Morse sequence where such coherent behavior is shown to occur\nfor a larger number of points in the $(T, dT)$ plane due to the additional\nstructure of the drive protocol.

Our method relies only on the ability\nto estimate overlap between two states, so it does not restrict to the VQD\neigenstates and applies for general situations. To support the significance of\nour method, we provide a comprehensive comparison of three previously proposed\nmethods to find excited states with numerical simulation of three molecules\n(lithium hydride, diazene, and azobenzene) in a noiseless situation and find\nthat the VQD method exhibits the best performance among the three methods.\nFinally, we demonstrate the validity of our method by calculating the\noscillator strength of lithium hydride, comparing results from numerical\nsimulations and real-hardware experiments on the cloud enabled quantum computer\nIBMQ Rome. Our results illustrate the superiority of the VQD to find excited\nstates and widen its applicability to various quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 May 2021 14:46:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ibe", "Yohei", ""], ["Nakagawa", "Yuya O.", ""], ["Earnest", "Nathan", ""], ["Yamamoto", "Takahiro", ""], ["Mitarai", "Kosuke", ""], ["Gao", "Qi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Takao", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.11725", "submitter": "Sanjay Moudgalya", "authors": "Sanjay Moudgalya, Edward O'Brien, B.

The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED) is to determine which\ncircuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on a\nfixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible\ncomplexity-theoretic assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be\nintractable for polynomial-time quantum computation.

We illustrate\nthis by transforming a plane wave into a vortex beam.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:59:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2020 10:39:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:36:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ballantine", "K.

We propose a mechanism to construct more general non-abelian\nstates by gluing gauge-symmetry-breaking vs gauge-symmetry-extension interfaces\nas extended defects in a cellular network, including defects of\nhigher-symmetries. Our approach also includes the anyonic particle/string\ncondensation and composite string (p-string)/membrane condensations. This also\nshows gluing the familiar extended topological quantum field theory or\nconformal field theory data via topology, geometry, and renormalization\nconsistency criteria (via certain modified group cohomology or cobordism theory\ndata) in a tensor network can still guide us to analyze the non-liquid states.\n(Part of the abelian construction can be understood from the K-matrix\nChern-Simons theory approach and coupled-layer-by-junction constructions.) This\nmay also lead us toward a unifying framework for quantum systems of both\nhigher-symmetries and sub-system/sub-dimensional symmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:59:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 17:59:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Juven", ""]]}]
