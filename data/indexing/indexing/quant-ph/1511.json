However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem.

This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory.

From a mathematical point of view,\nsuperoscillating functions are a superposition of small Fourier components with\na bounded Fourier spectrum, which result, when appropriately summed, in a shift\nthat can be arbitrarily large, and well outside the spectrum. Purpose of this\nwork is twofold: on one hand we provide a self-contained survey of the existing\nliterature, in order to offer a systematic mathematical approach to\nsuperoscillations; on the other hand, we obtain some new and unexpected\nresults, by showing that superoscillating sequences can be seen of as solutions\nto a large class of convolution equations and can therefore be treated within\nthe theory of Analytically Uniform spaces. In particular, we will also discuss\nthe persistence of the superoscillatory behavior when superoscillating\nsequences are taken as initial values of the Schr\\\"odinger equation and other\nequations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 22:31:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Aharonov", "Y.", ""], ["Colombo", "F.", ""], ["Sabadini", "I.", ""], ["Struppa", "D.

For this reason, designing quantum information processes with\nHamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile\nchallenge. Enabling error suppression with two-local Hamiltonians is\nparticularly challenging. A no-go theorem of Marvian and Lidar [Physical Review\nLetters 113(26), 260504 (2014)] demonstrates that, even allowing particles with\nhigh Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information\nfrom single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian\ncontaining only commuting two-local terms.

Of particular relevance in solids is the electric\nquadrupole interaction (QI), which operates on nuclei having spin higher than\n1/2. In its general form, QI involves an electric field gradient (EFG)\nbiaxiality term.

Furthermore,\nthe evolution of squeezing in the presence of a phase-damping channel and an\nexternal magnetic field are investigated. We observe that dephasing drives\ntoward an anti-squeezed terminal state, the degree of which increases with the\nspin angular momentum. Finally, QI squeezing in the limiting case of a\ntwo-dimensional EFG with a perpendicular magnetic field is discussed, which is\nof importance for two-dimensional materials, and the associated beat patterns\nin squeezing are revealed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 08:05:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 16:15:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Korkmaz", "Ya\u011fmur Aksu", ""], ["Bulutay", "Ceyhun", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.03429", "submitter": "Vladislav Terekhovich", "authors": "Vladislav Terekhovich", "title": "Metaphysics of the Principle of Least Action", "comments": "35 pages", "journal-ref": "Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in\n  History and Philosophy of Modern Physics 62:189-201", "doi": "10.1016/j.shpsb.2017.09.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.hist-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite the importance of the variational principles of physics, there have\nbeen relatively few attempts to consider them for a realistic framework.

The reality of\npossible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the\nperspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept\nof essences or possibles striving for existence. I elaborate a modal\ninterpretation of the principle of least action that replaces a classical\nrepresentation of a system's motion along a single history in the actual\nmodality by simultaneous motions along an infinite set of all possible\nhistories in the possible modality. This model is based on an intuition that\ndeep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle\nof least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. I\ninterpret the action as a physical measure of the essence of every possible\nhistory. Therefore only one actual history has the highest degree of the\nessence and minimal action. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that\nthe principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between\nthe laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and certain laws with a\nmetaphysical necessity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 09:53:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 19:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Terekhovich", "Vladislav", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.03433", "submitter": "Elke Neu", "authors": "Carsten Arend, Patrick Appel, Jonas Nils Becker, Marcel Schmidt,\n  Martin Fischer, Stefan Gsell, Matthias Schreck, Christoph Becher, Patrick\n  Maletinsky, and Elke Neu", "title": "Site selective growth of heteroepitaxial diamond nanoislands containing\n  single SiV centers", "comments": "version 2 accepted for publication in APL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.4941804", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall physics.optics quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate the controlled preparation of heteroepitaxial diamond nano-\nand microstructures on silicon wafer based iridium films as hosts for single\ncolor centers.

We also show that $a(\\theta)$ is\nlower-bounded by a non-trivial function multiplied by the central charge $C_T$\n, e.g. $a(\\pi/2) \\geq (\\pi^2 \\ln 2)C_T /6$. This bound for 90-degree corners is\nnearly saturated by all known results, including recent numerics for the\ninteracting Wilson-Fisher quantum critical points (QCPs). A bound is also given\nfor the R\\'enyi entropies. We illustrate our findings using O(N) QCPs, free\nboson and Dirac fermion CFTs, strongly coupled holographic ones, and other\nmodels. Exact results are also given for Lifshitz quantum critical points, and\nfor conical singularities in 3+1d.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 21:00:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 20:56:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bueno", "Pablo", ""], ["Witczak-Krempa", "William", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.04118", "submitter": "Karpov Denis", "authors": "D.

By renormalization group\napproach we derive first the effective theory close to the critical line at\npositive chemical potential. This is the sum of two terms: a Dirac action\n$S_D$, found in the short-range Ising universality class, and a CS breaking\nterm $S_{AN}$. While $S_D$ originates from low-energy excitations, $S_{AN}$\nderives from the higher energy modes where singularities develop, due to the\nlong-range nature of the model. At criticality $S_{AN}$ flows to zero if\n$\\alpha > 2$, while if $\\alpha < 2$ it dominates and determines the breakdown\nof the CS. Out of criticality $S_{AN}$ breaks, in the considered approximation,\nthe effective Lorentz invariance (ELI) for every finite $\\alpha$. As $\\alpha$\nincreases, such ELI breakdown becomes less and less pronounced and in the\nshort-range limit $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ the ELI is restored. To test the validity\nof the effective theory, we compared the two-fermion static correlations and\nthe von Neumann entropy obtained from them with the ones calculated on the\nlattice, finding agreement.

In the Conclusion, I briefly suggest how the\nstrategy for quantum-classical reduction described here might be extended to\nreduction between other classical and quantum theories, including classical and\nquantum field theory and classical and quantum gravity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:12:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Rosaler", "Joshua", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.06458", "submitter": "Nathan Wiebe", "authors": "Nathan Wiebe, Christopher Granade, Ashish Kapoor, Krysta M Svore", "title": "Bayesian inference via rejection filtering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG quant-ph stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a method for approximating Bayesian inference using rejection\nsampling.

In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. We propose here the framework of genuine quantum coherence. This\napproach is based on a simple principle: we demand that a genuinely incoherent\noperation preserves all incoherent states. This framework captures coherence\nunder additional constrains such as energy preservation and all genuinely\nincoherent operations are incoherent regardless of their particular\nexperimental realization. We also introduce the full class of operations with\nthis property, which we call fully incoherent. We analyze in detail the\nmathematical structure of these classes and also study possible state\ntransformations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely limited,\neven in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does not have a\nunique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all other states\ncan be created deterministically with the free operations. This suggests that\nany reasonably powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free\noperations which can potentially create coherence in some experimental\nrealization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 10:35:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 14:33:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["de Vicente", "Julio I.", ""], ["Streltsov", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08362", "submitter": "B  Prasanna Venkatesh", "authors": "B.

The performance of quantum repeaters\ncan be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private\ncapacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way\ncommunication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities.

This bound allows one to benchmark\nthe implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to\nmodel communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to\nthe realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on\nthe input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is\nconvex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical\ncapacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed\nentanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the $d$-dimensional erasure\nchannel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli\nchannels.

This algebra has been used to study the dynamics, in\nparticular small fluctuations in motion around a specific torus. The spatial\nsymmetries of the system have also been studied.\n  In the second part of the paper we have considered the quantum theory of a\ncharge moving in a torus knot in the presence of a uniform magnetic field along\nthe axis of the torus in a semiclassical quantization framework. We exploit the\nEinstein - Brillouin - Keller (EBK) scheme of quantization that is appropriate\nfor multidimensional systems. Embedding of the knot on a specific torus is\ninherently two dimensional that gives rise to two quantization conditions. This\nshows that although the system, after imposing the knot condition reduces to a\none dimensional system, even then it has manifest non-planar features which\nshows up again in the study of fractional angular momentum. Finally we compare\nthe results obtained from EBK (multi-dimensional) and Bohr-Sommerfeld (single\ndimensional) schemes. The energy levels and fractional spin depend on the torus\nknot parameters that specifies its non-planar features.

We evaluate in\nclosed form the reduced density matrix of a block of $L$ spins when the whole\nsystem is in its ground state, and study the corresponding von Neumann and\nR\\'enyi entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. We show that both of\nthese entropies scale as $a\\log L$ when $L$ tends to infinity, where the\ncoefficient $a$ is equal to $(m-k)/2$ in the ground state phase with $k$\nvanishing su$(m+1)$ magnon densities. In particular, our results show that none\nof these generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models are critical, since when\n$L\\to\\infty$ their R\\'enyi entropy $R_q$ becomes independent of the parameter\n$q$. We have also computed the Tsallis entanglement entropy of the ground state\nof these generalized su$(m+1)$ Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, finding that it can\nbe made extensive by an appropriate choice of its parameter only when\n$m-k\\ge3$. Finally, in the su$(3)$ case we construct in detail the phase\ndiagram of the ground state in parameter space, showing that it is determined\nin a simple way by the weights of the fundamental representation of su$(3)$.\nThis is also true in the su$(m+1)$ case; for instance, we prove that the region\nfor which all the magnon densities are non-vanishing is an $(m+1)$-simplex in\n$\\mathbf R^m$ whose vertices are the weights of the fundamental representation\nof su$(m+1)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 15:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 10:27:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Carrasco", "Jose A.", ""], ["Finkel", "Federico", ""], ["Gonzalez-Lopez", "Artemio", ""], ["Rodriguez", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Tempesta", "Piergiulio", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09355", "submitter": "Laura Garc\\'ia-\\'Alvarez M.Sc.", "authors": "L.
