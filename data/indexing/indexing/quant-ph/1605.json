The dual description enables a new\ncharacterization of topological properties of a system by the quantum\nentanglement between degrees of freedom at different length scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 May 2016 17:13:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Yingfei", ""], ["Lee", "Ching Hua", ""], ["Wen", "Xueda", ""], ["Cho", "Gil Young", ""], ["Ryu", "Shinsei", ""], ["Qi", "Xiao-Liang", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.00582", "submitter": "Dennis Raetzel", "authors": "Dennis R\\\"atzel, Martin Wilkens, Ralf Menzel", "title": "The effect of polarization entanglement in photon-photon scattering", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1511.01237", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum\nnoise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that\nwouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses.\n  Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as\nexplained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of\nnoise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small\nscale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum\nevolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational\npower. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior\nof noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow\nreaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy,\nmaking them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel\nimplicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on\nthe behavior of noisy quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2016 17:33:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kalai", "Gil", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.00999", "submitter": "Gaston Garcia-Calderon", "authors": "Gast\\'on Garc\\'ia-Calder\\'on and Lorea Chaos-Cador", "title": "Time evolution of decay for purely absorptive potentials: The effect of\n  spectral singularities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Physical Review A 90, 032109 (2014)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.90.032109", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an analytical approach that involves the complex poles of the\npropagator to investigate the effect due to the lack of time reversal\ninvariance on the time evolution of decay for purely absorptive potentials.

During a dynamical LZ process, due to the\natom-cavity coupling, the cavity field shows dynamical collapse and revivals.\nIn comparison with the symmetric LZ transitions in a classical field, the\nasymmetric LZ transitions in a cavity field originate from the\nphoton-number-dependent Rabi frequency. The asymmetric sequential LZ dynamics\nof Bose condensed atoms in a cavity field may open up a new way to explore the\nfundamental many-body physics in coupled atom-photon systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2016 07:57:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Jiahao", ""], ["Gong", "Pu", ""], ["Qin", "Xizhou", ""], ["Zhong", "Honghua", ""], ["Lee", "Chaohong", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01881", "submitter": "Ying Li", "authors": "Ying Li, Andrew M.

Here we overcome this\nproblem with a robust approach to characterising quantum channels by means of\nclassical light. Using free-space communication in a turbulent atmosphere as an\nexample, we show that the state evolution of classically entangled degrees of\nfreedom is equivalent to that of quantum entangled pho- tons, thus providing\nnew physical insights into the notion of classical entanglement. The analysis\nof quantum channels by means of classical light in real time unravels\nstochastic dynamics in terms of pure state trajectories and thus enables\nprecise quantum error-correction in short and long haul optical communication,\nin both free-space and fibre.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 12:57:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ndagano", "Bienvenu", ""], ["Perez-Garcia", "Benjamin", ""], ["Roux", "Filippus S.", ""], ["McLaren", "Melanie", ""], ["Rosales-Guzman", "Carmelo", ""], ["Zhang", "Yingwen", ""], ["Mouane", "Othmane", ""], ["Hernandez-Aranda", "Raul I.", ""], ["Konrad", "Thomas", ""], ["Forbes", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05148", "submitter": "Zhih-Ahn Jia", "authors": "Zhih-Ahn Jia, Yu-Chun Wu and Guang-Can Guo", "title": "Monogamy Relation in No-disturbance Theories", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

We present a tripartite communication task for which\nsuch a superposition allows for an exponential saving in communication,\ncompared to one-way quantum (or classical) communication; the advantage also\nholds when we allow for protocols with bounded error probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 10:58:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 13:32:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Gu\u00e9rin", "Philippe Allard", ""], ["Feix", "Adrien", ""], ["Ara\u00fajo", "Mateus", ""], ["Brukner", "\u010caslav", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.07375", "submitter": "Ievgen Arkhipov", "authors": "Ievgen I.

By exciting the QDisks with a nanometric electron beam at\ncurrents spanning over 3 orders of magnitude, strong non-linearities (energy\nshifts) in the light emission are observed. In particular, we find that the\namount of energy shift depends on the emission rate and on the QDisk morphology\n(size, position along the NW and shell thickness). For thick QDisks (>4nm), the\nQDisk emission energy is observed to blue-shift with the increase of the\nemission intensity. This is interpreted as a consequence of the increase of\ncarriers density excited by the incident electron beam inside the QDisks, which\nscreens the internal electric field and thus reduces the quantum confined Stark\neffect (QCSE) present in these QDisks. For thinner QDisks (<3 nm), the\nblue-shift is almost absent in agreement with the negligible QCSE at such\nsizes.

This phenomenon has a rather general nature, equally applicable to\nsound and all other waves. It enables resonators of unique properties\nattractive both in science and engineering. Very high quality factors of\noptical WGM resonators persisting in a wide wavelength range spanning from\nradio frequencies to ultraviolet light, their small mode volume, and tunable\nin- and out- coupling make them exceptionally efficient for nonlinear optical\napplications. Nonlinear optics facilitates interaction of photons with each\nother and with other physical systems, and is of prime importance in quantum\noptics. In this paper we review numerous applications of WGM resonators in\nnonlinear and quantum optics.

The key concept in many photonic applications is the \"critical\ncoupling\" condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an\ninput channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was\ncrucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in\nthe context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this\nso-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are\nin fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called\npolaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the\ncritical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we\nterm strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into\npolaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or\nmechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special\ncurve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more\ngeneral case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology\ndisplayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally\nunderstood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most\nimportantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based\nintersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator.

Considering a weak\natom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity\nmode ($\\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the\nwhole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of\ncorrelations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the\ncavity field even in the limit of $\\bar{n} \\gg 1$ [Phys. Rev.

We have shown that the relaxation time of\nthe system varies proportionally to $\\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but it is\ninversely proportional to $\\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time\nrequired to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field\non the atomic correlations diverges as $\\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values\ndue to a coherent driving, while it goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a\ncoherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability,\ni.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for\na long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have\nalso discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady\ncorrelations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity\nfield is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times.\nThen, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness\nof a cavity field in a certain time interval.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 02:50:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 17:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Rossatto", "D.

The initial state can be thought as the result of joining\nchains with different global properties. Through dephasing, at late times the\nstate becomes locally equivalent to a stationary state which explicitly depends\non position and time. We propose a kinetic theory of elementary excitations and\nderive a continuity equation which fully characterizes the thermodynamics of\nthe model. We restrict ourselves to the gapless phase and consider cases where\nthe chains are prepared: 1) at different temperatures; 2) in the ground state\nof two different models; 3) in the \"domain wall\" state. We find excellent\nagreement (any discrepancy is within the numerical error) between theoretical\npredictions and numerical simulations of time evolution based on TEBD\nalgorithms. As a corollary, we unveil an exact expression for the expectation\nvalues of the charge currents in a generic stationary state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 19:59:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:57:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 13:19:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 19:26:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bertini", "Bruno", ""], ["Collura", "Mario", ""], ["De Nardis", "Jacopo", ""], ["Fagotti", "Maurizio", ""]]}]
