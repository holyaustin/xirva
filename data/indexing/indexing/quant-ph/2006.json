By taking quantum Fisher information\n(QFI) as the metric of projective Hilbert spaces, estimating a small parameter\nshift is equivalent to distinguishing neighboring quantum states along a given\ncurve. Henceforth, information geometry plays a significant role in the single\nparameter estimation. However, the absence of high dimensional measures limits\nits applications in studying the multi-parameter systems. In this paper, we\nwill discuss the physical implications of the volume element of QFI. It\nmeasures the intrinsic density of quantum states (IDQS) in projective Hilbert\nspaces, which is, then, a measure to define the (over) completeness relation of\na class of quantum states. As an application, IDQS can be used in quantum\nmeasurement and multi-parameter estimation. We find the density of\ndistinguishable states (DDS) for a set of efficient estimators is measured by\nthe invariant volume of the classical Fisher information, which is the\nclassical counterpart of QFI and serves as the metric of statistical manifolds.\nCorrespondingly, a determinant form of quantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao inequality is\nproposed to quantify the ability to infer the IDQS via quantum measurement. As\na result, we find a gap between IDQS and maximal DDS over the measurements. The\ngap has tight connections with the uncertainty relationship.

Rep. 9, 14169]: after a slow cyclic\nsweep of a control parameter, the probability that a microcanonical ensemble\nreturns to the neighborhood of its initial energy is significantly below one. A\nsimilar phenomenon has recently been confirmed in a corresponding quantum\nsystem for not too small particle number $N$. Quantum-classical correspondence\nhas been found to be non-trivial in this case, however; the rate at which the\ncontrol parameter changes must not be extremely slow and the initial\ndistribution of energies must not be too narrow. In this paper we directly\ncompare the quantum and classical forms of probabilistic hysteresis by making\nuse of the Husimi quantum phase space formalism. In particular we demonstrate\nthat the classical ergodization mechanism, which is a key ingredient in\nclassical probabilistic hysteresis, can lead to a breakdown of\nquantum-classical correspondence rather than to quantum ergodization. As a\nresult strong quantum effects in the long-term evolution are present, even\nthough the quantum corrections in the equations of motion are proportional to\n$1/N$ and therefore would naively seem to be small. We also show, however, that\nquantum ergodization is restored by averaging over energies, so that for\nsufficient initial energy width and not-too-slow sweep rate the classical\nresults are recovered after all. Finally we show that the formal\nincommutability of the classical and adiabatic limits in our system, leading to\nthe breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in the quasi-static limit, is\ndue to macroscopic quantum tunneling through a large energetic barrier.

In this context, quantum\ncommunication complexity (QCC) has recently drawn earnest research attention as\na tool to optimize the amounts of transmitted qubits and energy that are\nrequired to implement distributed computational tasks. On this matter, we\nintroduce a novel multi-user quantum fingerprinting protocol that is ready to\nbe implemented with existing technology. Particularly, we extend to the\nmulti-user framework a well-known two-user coherent-state fingerprinting\nscheme. This generalization is highly non-trivial for a twofold reason, as it\nrequires not only to extend the set of protocol rules but also to specify a\nprocedure for designing the optical devices intended for the generalized\nprotocol. Much of the importance of our work arises from the fact that the\nobtained QCC figures of merit allow direct comparison with the best-known\nclassical multi-user fingerprinting protocol, of significance in the field of\ncomputer technologies and networking. Furthermore, as one of the main\ncontributions of the manuscript, we deduce innovative analytical upper bounds\non the amount of transmitted quantum information that are even valid in the\ntwo-user protocol as a particular case. Ultimately, comparative results are\nprovided to contrast different protocol implementation strategies and,\nimportantly, to show that, under realistic circumstances, the multi-user\nprotocol can achieve tasks that are impossible by using classical communication\nalone.

Even\nthough the concept of the QFM presented here is very general and can be\nimplemented in any many body quantum system that can be described by a quantum\nfield theory. We provide here a detailed proposal how to realize a quantum\nmachine in one-dimensional ultra-cold atomic gases, which consists of a set of\nmodular operations giving rise to a piston. These can then be coupled\nsequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation that a quantum field takes\nup the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for\ncompression on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that\ngives rise to a valve controlling heat flow. These models are derived within\nBogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational primitives\nnumerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modelled\noperational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are\nshown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator.\nThe active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing\ncooling methods become ineffective.

Metastability is a consequence of a large separation in timescales in\nthe dynamics, leading to the existence of a regime when states of the system\nappear stationary, before eventual relaxation toward a true stationary state at\nmuch larger times. In this work, we focus on the emergence of classical\nmetastability, i.e., when metastable states of an open quantum system with\nseparation of timescales can be approximated as probabilistic mixtures of a\nfinite number of states. We find that a number of classical features follow\nfrom this approximation, for the manifold of metastable states, long-time\ndynamics between them, and symmetries of the dynamics. Namely, those states are\napproximately disjoint and thus play the role of metastable phases, the\nrelaxation toward the stationary state is approximated by a classical\nstochastic dynamics between them, and weak symmetries correspond to their\npermutations. Importantly, the classical dynamics is observed not only on\naverage, but also at the level of individual quantum trajectories: We show that\ntime coarse-grained continuous measurement records can be viewed as noisy\nclassical trajectories, while their statistics can be approximated by that of\nthe classical dynamics. Among others, this explains how first-order dynamical\nphase transitions arise from metastability. Finally, to verify the presence of\nclassical metastability in a given open quantum system, we develop an efficient\nnumerical approach that delivers the set of metastable phases together with the\neffective classical dynamics. Since the proximity to a first-order dissipative\nphase transition manifests as metastability, the theory and tools introduced in\nthis work can be used to investigate such transitions through the metastable\nbehavior of many-body systems of moderate sizes accessible to numerics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2020 20:00:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:59:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Macieszczak", "Katarzyna", ""], ["Rose", "Dominic C.", ""], ["Lesanovsky", "Igor", ""], ["Garrahan", "Juan P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.01258", "submitter": "Valentin Kasper", "authors": "Valentin Kasper, Gediminas Juzeliunas, Maciej Lewenstein, Fred\n  Jendrzejewski, Erez Zohar", "title": "From the Jaynes-Cummings model to non-Abelian gauge theories: a guided\n  tour for the quantum engineer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "New J.

The presence of the qubit results in four points where CPT\nand CPS can be realized compared to the pure optomechanical case (i.e. in the\nabsence of qubit) where only three points are attained. This shows that the\npresence of the qubit gives us more flexibility in choosing the appropriate\nparameter regime where CPT and CPS can be attained and controlled. We also find\nthat OMIA shows three distinct peaks both in the linear and nonlinear cases. In\nthe absence of the qubit, OMIA is converted to optomechanically induced\ntransmission (OMIT).

In a perturbative regime the influence of the environment on\nthe system dynamics can effectively be described by a unitary and a dissipative\ncontribution. For the two-spin Boson model with (sub-) Ohmic spectral density\nconsidered here, the particular unitary contribution (Lamb shift) easily\nexplains the buildup of entanglement between the two qubits. Furthermore it has\nbeen argued that in the adiabatic limit, adding the so-called counterterm to\nthe microscopic model compensates the unitary influence of the environment and,\nthus, inhibits the generation of entanglement. Investigating this assertion is\none of the main objectives of the work presented here. Using the hierarchy of\npure states (HOPS) method to numerically calculate the exact reduced dynamics,\nwe find and explain that the degree of inhibition crucially depends on the\nparameter $s$ determining the low frequency power law behavior of the spectral\ndensity $J(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^s e^{-\\omega/\\omega_c}$.

The purpose of this paper is to initiate a dialogue within the\ncommunity of quantum computing scientists and potential end users on what\nquestions should be asked when developing real world use cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2020 14:23:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chancellor", "Nicholas", ""], ["Cumming", "Robert", ""], ["Thomas", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.05855", "submitter": "Grigori Amosov", "authors": "Grigori Amosov", "title": "On classical capacity of Weyl channels", "comments": "12 pages, new version contains a concrete example", "journal-ref": "Quantum Information Processing, 19, 401 (2020)", "doi": "10.1007/s11128-020-02900-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The additivity of minimal output entropy is proved for the Weyl channel\nobtained by the deformation of a q-c Weyl channel.

For such problems, realizing quantum\nadvantage will require methods which dramatically reduce this cost. Previous\nquantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g. quantum amplitude and\nphase estimation) require error rates that are too low for near-term\nimplementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available\nquantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum\ndevices, reducing measurement number and runtime compared to the standard\nsampling method of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our scheme\nderives inspiration from quantum metrology, phase estimation, and the more\nrecent \"alpha-VQE\" proposal, arriving at a general formulation that is robust\nto error and does not require ancilla qubits. The central object of this method\nis what we call the \"engineered likelihood function\" (ELF), used for carrying\nout Bayesian inference. We show how the ELF formalism enhances the rate of\ninformation gain in sampling as the physical hardware transitions from the\nregime of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers into that of quantum error\ncorrected ones.

As a result, these amplitudes are\ncontrolled by dimensional confinement rather than tunneling through energy\nbarriers.

The underlying physical\nmechanism promoted by NQE depends on the particular interaction under\nconsideration. First, the effective reduction of interatomic distances between\nfunctional groups within a molecule can enhance the $n\\to\\pi^*$ interaction by\nincreasing the overlap between molecular orbitals or by strengthening\nelectrostatic interactions between neighboring charge densities. Second, NQE\ncan localize methyl rotors by temporarily changing molecular bond orders and\nleading to the emergence of localized transient rotor states. Third, for\nnoncovalent van der Waals interactions the strengthening comes from the\nincrease of the polarizability given the expanded average interatomic distances\ninduced by NQE. The implications of these boosted interactions include\ncounterintuitive hydroxyl--hydroxyl bonding, hindered methyl rotor dynamics,\nand molecular stiffening which generates smoother free-energy surfaces.

Qubits based on\nhole spins offer, through their strong spin-orbit interaction, a way to\nimplement fast quantum gates. Strikingly, for hole spins in one-dimensional\ngermanium and silicon devices, the spin-orbit interaction has been predicted to\nbe exceptionally strong yet highly tunable with gate voltages. Such electrical\ncontrol would make it possible to switch on demand between qubit idling and\nmanipulation modes. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast and universal quantum\ncontrol of a hole spin qubit in a germanium/silicon core/shell nanowire, with\nRabi frequencies of several hundreds of megahertz, corresponding to\nspin-flipping times as short as ~1 ns - a new record for a single-spin qubit.\nNext, we show a large degree of electrical control over the Rabi frequency,\nZeeman energy, and coherence time - thus implementing a switch toggling from a\nrapid qubit manipulation mode to a more coherent idling mode. We identify an\nexceptionally strong but gate-tunable spin-orbit interaction as the underlying\nmechanism, with a short associated spin-orbit length that can be tuned over a\nlarge range down to 3 nm for holes of heavy-hole mass.

The KER-dependent photoion angular distribution reveals\nthe underlying two-photon absorption dynamics involved in the ion-pair\nproduction mechanism and indicates the existence of two nearly degenerate\ncontinuum resonances possessing different symmetries, which can both decay by\ncoupling to ion-pair states of the same total symmetry through internal\nconversion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 03:34:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 18:26:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Larsen", "Kirk A.", ""], ["Lucchese", "Robert R.", ""], ["Slaughter", "Daniel S.", ""], ["Weber", "Thorsten", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.11490", "submitter": "Aranya Bhattacherjee Dr.", "authors": "Vijay Bhatt, Pradip K.

Recent experiments create cat states in a\nmicrowave cavity field using superconducting circuits. As with degenerate\nparametric oscillation (DPO) in an adiabatic and highly nonlinear limit, the\nstates are formed in a signal cavity mode via a two-photon dissipative process\ninduced by the down conversion of a pump field to generate pairs of signal\nphotons. The damping of the signal and the presence of thermal fluctuations\nrapidly decoheres the state, and the effect on the dynamics is to either\ndestroy the possibility of a cat state, or else to sharply reduce the lifetime\nand size of the cat-states that can be formed. In this paper, we study the\neffect on both the DPO and microwave systems of a squeezed reservoir coupled to\nthe cavity. While the threshold nonlinearity is not altered, we show that the\nuse of squeezed states significantly lengthens the lifetime of the cat states.\nThis improves the feasibility of generating cat states of large amplitude and\nwith a greater degree of quantum macroscopic coherence, which is necessary for\nmany quantum technology applications. Using current experimental parameters for\nthe microwave set-up, which requires a modified Hamiltonian, we further\ndemonstrate how squeezed states enhance the quality of the cat states that\ncould be formed in this regime. Squeezing also combats the significant\ndecoherence due to thermal noise, which is relevant for microwave fields at\nfinite temperature. By modeling a thermal squeezed reservoir, we show that the\nthermal decoherence of the dynamical cat states can be inhibited by a careful\ncontrol of the squeezing of the reservoir.

The derivation is based on\nadiabatic turning on of the perturbation as used, for instance, in some formal\ndevelopments of scattering theory. Energy conservation is expressed in terms of\nan intuitively and physically appealing Lorentzian line shape rather than the\nartificial, oscillatory sin(x)=x type line shape that appears in conventional\nderivations. The conditions for the derivation's validity are compactly and\nconveniently expressed in the frequency/energy domain rather than in the usual\ntime domain. The derivation also highlights how, along with energy\nconservation, the transition rate faithfully and instantaneously follows the\nvariations in the square of the perturbing potential as one may expect in the\nadiabatic limit. In the first instance, the adiabatic turning on is achieved,\nas usual, by a single exponential time variation. But we demonstrate that the\ninstantaneous following of the square of the perturbing potential by the\ntransition rate is more general and that one can derive the Golden Rule for a\ngeneral slowly varying time dependent perturbation. This allows one to derive\ngeneralisations of the simple decay law, originally derived in the classic\npaper by Weisskopf and Wigner; a tutorial exposition of the essence of this\nclassic work is provided. The Oppenheimer method for applying the Golden rule\nto problems, such as the electric field ionisation of atoms, in which the\nperturbing potential can also create the final states, is reviewed.

Here, I show that a direct evaluation of measurement\nuncertainties is possible when the measurement outcomes are used to compensate\nthe small amount of decoherence induced in a probe qubit by carefully\ncontrolled interactions with the system. Since the original uncertainty of the\ntarget observable causes fluctuating phase shifts in the probe qubit, any\nadditional information obtained about the target observable can be used to\ncompensate a part of the decoherence by applying a conditional phase shift to\nthe reference qubit. The magnitude of this negative feedback corresponds to an\nestimate of the target observable, and the uncompensated decoherence defines\nthe uncertainty of that estimate. The results of the analysis show that the\nuncertainties of the estimates are given by the uncertainties introduced by\nOzawa in Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105 (2003) and the optimal estimates are given by\nthe weak values associated with the different measurement outcomes. Feedback\ncompensation of decoherence therefore demonstrates the empirical validity of\ndefinitions of errors and estimates that combine the initial information of the\ninput state with the additional information provided by each measurement\noutcome.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:33:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:58:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 01:44:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:19:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Hofmann", "Holger F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13440", "submitter": "Takayuki Suzuki", "authors": "Takayuki Suzuki, Hiromichi Nakazato", "title": "A proposal of noise suppression for quantum annealing", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A method to suppress noise, which is one of the major obstacles to obtain an\noptimal solution in quantum annealers, is proposed.

Despite its\nintrinsic value for quantum computing, the widespread use of magic state\ndistillation, which is closely related to this model, emphasizes the importance\nof comprehending the hierarchy. There is currently a limited understanding of\nthe structure of this hierarchy, apart from the case of diagonal unitaries (Cui\net al., 2017; Rengaswamy et al. 2019). We explore the structure of the second\nand third levels of the hierarchy, the first level being the ubiquitous Pauli\ngroup, via the Weyl (i.e., Pauli) expansion of unitaries at these levels. In\nparticular, we characterize the support of the standard Clifford operations on\nthe Pauli group. Since conjugation of a Pauli by a third level unitary produces\ntraceless Hermitian Cliffords, we characterize their Pauli support as well.\nSemi-Clifford unitaries are known to have ancilla savings in the teleportation\nmodel, and we explore their Pauli support via symplectic transvections.\nFinally, we show that, up to multiplication by a Clifford, every third level\nunitary commutes with at least one Pauli matrix. This can be used inductively\nto show that, up to a multiplication by a Clifford, every third level unitary\nis supported on a maximal commutative subgroup of the Pauli group.\nAdditionally, it can be easily seen that the latter implies the generalized\nsemi-Clifford conjecture, proven by Beigi and Shor (2010).

The\npresent limitations of MCMC techniques may be overcome by Hamiltonian-based\nsimulations on classical or quantum devices, which further provide the\npotential to address questions that lay beyond the capabilities of the current\napproaches. However, for continuous gauge groups, Hamiltonian-based\nformulations involve infinite-dimensional gauge degrees of freedom that can\nsolely be handled by truncation. Current truncation schemes require\ndramatically increasing computational resources at small values of the bare\ncouplings, where magnetic field effects become important. Such limitation\nprecludes one from `taking the continuous limit' while working with finite\nresources. To overcome this limitation, we provide a resource-efficient\nprotocol to simulate LGTs with continuous gauge groups in the Hamiltonian\nformulation. Our new method allows for calculations at arbitrary values of the\nbare coupling and lattice spacing. The approach consists of the combination of\na Hilbert space truncation with a regularization of the gauge group, which\npermits an efficient description of the magnetically-dominated regime. We focus\nhere on Abelian gauge theories and use $2+1$ dimensional quantum\nelectrodynamics as a benchmark example to demonstrate this efficient framework\nto achieve the continuum limit in LGTs. This possibility is a key requirement\nto make quantitative predictions at the field theory level and offers the\nlong-term perspective to utilise quantum simulations to compute physically\nmeaningful quantities in regimes that are precluded to quantum Monte Carlo.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2020 04:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:14:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:23:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Haase", "Jan F.", ""], ["Dellantonio", "Luca", ""], ["Celi", "Alessio", ""], ["Paulson", "Danny", ""], ["Kan", "Angus", ""], ["Jansen", "Karl", ""], ["Muschik", "Christine A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.14162", "submitter": "Sheir Yarkoni", "authors": "Sheir Yarkoni, Florian Neukart, Eliane Moreno Gomez Tagle, Nicole\n  Magiera, Bharat Mehta, Kunal Hire, Swapnil Narkhede, Martin Hofmann", "title": "Quantum Shuttle: Traffic Navigation with Quantum Computing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3412451.3428500", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal, is one of the biggest\ntechnology conferences in Europe, attended by tens of thousands of people every\nyear.

This measurement is also subject to quantum\nback-action, caused by the radiation pressure force fluctuations produced by\nthe amplitude uncertainty (QRPN). In order to lower this quantum noise, GW\ndetectors plan to use squeezed light injection. In this thesis, I focus on\nusing radiation-pressure-mediated optomechanical (OM) interaction to generate\nsqueezed light. Creating squeezed states by using OM interaction enables\nwavelength-independent squeezed light sources that may also be more compact and\nrobust than traditionally used non-linear crystals. We analyze the system with\nrealistic imperfections (losses & classical noise), and use the concepts to\ndesign an experiment to obtain the most possible squeezing in a broad\naudio-frequency band at room temperature.

We then show its experimental implementation, and subsequent\nobservation of QRPN as well as OM squeezing. These are the first ever direct\nobservations of a room temperature oscillator's motion being overwhelmed by\nvacuum fluctuations. This is shown in the low frequency band, which is relevant\nto GW detectors, but poses its own technical challenges, and hence has not been\ndone before. Being in the back-action dominated regime along with optimized\noptical properties has also enabled us to observe OM squeezing.

In this article, we\npresent the co-design framework, namely QuantumFlow, to provide such a missing\nlink. QuantumFlow consists of novel quantum-friendly neural networks (QF-Nets),\na mapping tool (QF-Map) to generate the quantum circuit (QF-Circ) for QF-Nets,\nand an execution engine (QF-FB). We discover that, in order to make full use of\nthe strength of quantum representation, it is best to represent data in a\nneural network as either random variables or numbers in unitary matrices, such\nthat they can be directly operated by the basic quantum logical gates. Based on\nthese data representations, we propose two quantum friendly neural networks,\nQF-pNet and QF-hNet in QuantumFlow. QF-pNet using random variables has better\nflexibility, and can seamlessly connect two layers without measurement with\nmore qbits and logical gates than QF-hNet. On the other hand, QF-hNet with\nunitary matrices can encode 2^k data into k qbits, and a novel algorithm can\nguarantee the cost complexity to be O(k^2). Compared to the cost of O(2^k)in\nclassical computing, QF-hNet demonstrates the quantum advantages. Evaluation\nresults show that QF-pNet and QF-hNet can achieve 97.10% and 98.27% accuracy,\nrespectively. Results further show that for input sizes of neural computation\ngrow from 16 to 2,048, the cost reduction of QuantumFlow increased from 2.4x to\n64x. Furthermore, on MNIST dataset, QF-hNet can achieve accuracy of 94.09%,\nwhile the cost reduction against the classical computer reaches 10.85x.

It is known that optimal protocol parameters,\nsuch as the number of decoy states and their intensities, can be found by\nsolving a nonlinear optimization problem. The complexity of this optimization\nproblem is typically handled by making an number of heuristic assumptions. For\ninstance, the number of decoy states is restricted to only one or two, with one\nof the decoy intensities set to a fixed value, and vacuum states are ignored as\nthey are assumed to contribute only marginally to the secure key-rate. These\nassumptions simplify the optimization problem and reduce the size of search\nspace significantly.

It is\nknown that if the underlying graph contains a cycle, e.g. as in projected\nentangled pair states (PEPS), then the set of tensor network states of given\nbond dimension is not closed. Its closure is the tensor network variety. Recent\nwork has shown that states on the boundary of this variety can yield more\nefficient representations for states of physical interest, but it remained\nunclear how to systematically find and optimize over such representations. We\naddress this issue by defining a new ansatz class of states that includes\nstates at the boundary of the tensor network variety of given bond dimension.\nWe show how to optimize over this class in order to find ground states of local\nHamiltonians by only slightly modifying standard algorithms and code for tensor\nnetworks. We apply this new method to a different of models and observe\nfavorable energies and runtimes when compared with standard tensor network\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:58:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2021 09:29:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Christandl", "Matthias", ""], ["Gesmundo", "Fulvio", ""], ["Franca", "Daniel Stilck", ""], ["Werner", "Albert H.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16985", "submitter": "Alexander I.
