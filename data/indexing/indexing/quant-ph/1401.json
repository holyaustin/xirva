The basis of our analysis is the\nlinearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability\ninterpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\\geq\n3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical\nprobability measure in the sense $\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle+\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot\n{\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes{\\bf b}^{\\prime}\\cdot {\\bf\n\\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle=\\langle\\psi|{\\bf a}\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}\\otimes ({\\bf b}+{\\bf\nb}^{\\prime})\\cdot {\\bf \\sigma}|\\psi\\rangle$ for non-collinear ${\\bf b}$ and\n${\\bf b}^{\\prime}$. It is then shown that Hardy's model in $d=4$ does not lead\nto a unique mathematical expression in the demonstration of the discrepancy of\nlocal realism (hidden-variables model) with entanglement and thus his proof is\nincomplete. We identify the origin of this non-uniqueness with the\nnon-uniqueness of translating quantum mechanical expressions into expressions\nin hidden-variables models, which results from the failure of the above\nlinearity of the probability measure.

First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock\ncontaining a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock\ncontains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of\nspace time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a\nsmaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation.\nConsidering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces\nan ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states.

We first revisit in a pedagogical\nway the single-channel case, where the supersymmetric approach is shown to\nprovide a complete solution to the inverse-scattering problem. A special\nemphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative\ntransformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a\nnon-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative\ntransformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion\nof the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then\nsummarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress\nremaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel\nexamples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple\nas possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the\nequal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds,\nconservative transformations can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering\nmatrices. Iterations of such transformations are shown to lead to practical\nalgorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is\nfitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs\nof conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D\nscattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are\nconstructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem\nto be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a\nsingle non-conservative transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials\nstarting from the zero potential and is a promising first step towards a full\nsolution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold differences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 13:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 08:21:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Baye", "Daniel", ""], ["Sparenberg", "Jean-Marc", ""], ["Pupasov-Maksimov", "Andrey M", ""], ["Samsonov", "Boris F", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0449", "submitter": "Tolga Birkandan", "authors": "Pelin Aydiner, Tolga Birkandan", "title": "Physical Problems Admitting Heun-to-Hypergeometric Reduction", "comments": "12 pages, references corrected, DOI added.

Tests performed by different research teams\nhave shown that, indeed, the machine seems to exploit quantum effects. However\nexperiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an\nadvantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer\nhardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These\nengineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a\ndecohering thermal bath.

We simulate both random-bond Ising\nmodels and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave\nChimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of\nfinding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not\npolynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin\nglasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that\nbenchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might\nnot be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose\nalternative benchmarks by embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera\ntopology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant) disorder-temperature phase\ndiagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show that a\nfinite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)%\nantiferromagnetic bonds.

To evaluate the performance of the NV-MRI technique, we image the\nthree-dimensional landscape of dark electronic spins at and just below the\ndiamond surface and achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution (0.8 nm\nlaterally and 1.5 nm vertically) and single-spin sensitivity. Our measurements\nuncover previously unidentified electronic spins on the diamond surface, which\ncan potentially be used as resources for improved magnetic imaging of samples\nproximal to the NV-diamond sensor. This three-dimensional NV-MRI technique is\nimmediately applicable to diverse systems including imaging spin chains,\nreadout of individual spin-based quantum bits, and determining the precise\nlocation of spin labels in biological systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 21:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 16:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Grinolds", "M.

This method,\nhowever, suffers from an efficiency that depends on the orbital angular\nmomentum of the initial mode and on the presence of higher order radial modes.\nThe reason is that once the phase has been flattened, the field retains its\nringed intensity pattern and is therefore a nontrivial superposition of purely\nradial modes, of which only the fundamental one couples to a single mode\noptical fiber. In this paper, we study the efficiency of this technique both\ntheoretically and experimentally. We find that even for low values of the OAM,\na large amount of light can fall outside the fundamental mode of the fiber, and\nwe quantify the losses as functions of the waist of the coupling beam of the\norbital angular momentum and radial indices. Our results can be used as a tool\nto remove the efficiency bias where fair-sampling loopholes are not a concern.\nHowever, we hope that our study will encourage the development of better\ndetection methods of the orbital angular momentum content of a beam of light.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 08:15:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 19:50:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Qassim", "Hammam", ""], ["Miatto", "Filippo M.", ""], ["Torres", "Juan P.", ""], ["Padgett", "Miles J.", ""], ["Karimi", "Ebrahim", ""], ["Boyd", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3536", "submitter": "Antonio Khoury", "authors": "A.

The research\nis explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We\ngive an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the\ntransmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific\nclass of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the\ndeterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is,\nat the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its\npositivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted\ncapacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the\ndeterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous\nonly in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is\nnonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that\nshows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The\ncontinuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had,\namong others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP\nHannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous. We also\nquantify the interplay between the distribution of finite amounts of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver, the (nonzero) decoding error with\nrespect to the average error criterion that can be achieved over a finite\nnumber of channel uses and the number of messages that can be sent.

The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games,\nwhich follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on\nsubsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be\nclosely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 13:48:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Aaronson", "Scott", ""], ["Impagliazzo", "Russell", ""], ["Moshkovitz", "Dana", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6859", "submitter": "Sylvia Bratzik", "authors": "Sylvia Bratzik, Hermann Kampermann, Dagmar Bru{\\ss}", "title": "Secret key rates for an encoded quantum repeater", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

We clearly show that there exists a natural algebraic structure\ncalled the teleportation operator in terms of the Bell transform to catch\nessential points of quantum teleportation, and hence we expect that there would\nalso exist interesting algebraic structures in terms of the GHZ transform to\nplay important roles in quantum information and computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 13:03:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 06:10:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 10:47:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 12:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yong", ""], ["Zhang", "Kun", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7018", "submitter": "Chiu Man Ho", "authors": "Chiu Man Ho and Stephen D.H.

Since the three types of\ncorrelations mentioned lead to different signatures in terms of the natural\norbital (NO) amplitudes in two-electron systems we make an analysis of the wave\nfunction in terms of the NO amplitudes for a model system of a diatomic\nmolecule. In our numerical implementation we fully optimize the orbitals and\nthe correlation function on a spatial grid without restrictions on their\nfunctional form. Due to this particular form of the wave function, we can prove\nthat none of the amplitudes vanishes and moreover that it displays a distinct\nsign pattern and a series of avoided crossings as a function of the bond\ndistance in agreement with the exact solution. This shows that the wave\nfunction Ansatz correctly incorporates the long range Van der Waals\ninteractions. We further show that the approximate wave function gives an\nexcellent binding curve and is able to describe static correlations. We show\nthat in order to do this the correlation function $f(r_{12})$ needs to diverge\nfor large $r_{12}$ at large internuclear distances while for shorter bond\ndistances it increases as a function of $r_{12}$ to a maximum value after which\nit decays exponentially.

This\nphenomenon is known as the dynamical Casimir effect, and it was recently\nrealized experimentally in systems of superconducting circuits, for example by\nusing modulated resonators made of coplanar waveguides, or arrays of\nsuperconducting quantum intereference devices (SQUIDs) forming a Josephson\nmetamaterial. In this paper, we consider a simple electrical circuit model for\ndynamical Casimir effects, consisting of an LC resonator, with the inductor\nmodulated externally at 10.8 GHz and with the resonant frequency tunable over a\nrange of $\\pm$ 400 MHz around 5.4 GHz. The circuit is analyzed classically\nusing a circuit simulator (APLAC). We demonstrate that if an additional source\nof classical noise couples to the resonator (on top of the quantum vacuum), for\nexample via dissipative \"internal modes\", then the resulting spectrum of the\nphotons in the cavity will present two strongly asymmetric branches. However,\naccording to the theory of the dynamical Casimir effect, these branches should\nbe symmetric, a prediction which is confirmed by our experimental data. The\nsimulation presented here therefore shows that the origin of the photons\ngenerated in our experiment with Josephson metamaterials is the quantum vacuum,\nand not a spurious classical noise source.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 15:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki", "P.", ""], ["Paraoanu", "G.

Here, we show that a more general and relevant question is \"when does a\nsystem thermalize relative to a particular reference?\" By relative\nthermalization we mean that, as well as being in a local thermal state, the\nsystem is uncorrelated with the reference. We argue that this is necessary in\norder to apply standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction\nbetween a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition for\nrelative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an arbitrary\nenvironment. This condition has two components: the first is state-independent,\nreflecting the structure of invariant subspaces, like energy shells, and the\nrelative sizes of system and environment; the second depends on the initial\ncorrelations between reference, system and environment, measured in terms of\nconditional entropies. Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large\nenvironment is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if,\ninitially, the reference was not highly correlated with the system and\nenvironment. Our statement makes this intuition precise, and we show that in\nmany natural settings this thermalization condition is approximately tight.\nEstablished results on thermalization, which usually ignore the reference,\nfollow as special cases of our statements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 21:00:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["del Rio", "Lidia", ""], ["Hutter", "Adrian", ""], ["Renner", "Renato", ""], ["Wehner", "Stephanie", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8000", "submitter": "Hauke Traulsen", "authors": "Hauke Traulsen", "title": "Faster Communication Using Probabilistic Swapped-Bell-States Analysis", "comments": "7 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, a procedure called Probabilistic Swapped-Bell-States\nAnalysis (PSBA) is proposed.

Such a framework is based on the notion of local quantum\nmeasurements, but, in order to account for beyond-quantum correlations, global\npseudo-states that are not positive semidefinite are allowed. After a short\nreview of the formalism, we consider its use in the quantification of both\ngeneral non-local and beyond-quantum correlations. We argue that the unified\nframework for correlations provides a simple approach to such a quantification,\nin particular when the quantification is meant to be operational and meaningful\nin a resource-theory scenario, i.e., when considering the processing of\nresources by means of non-resources. We relate different notions of robustness\nof correlations, both at the level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability\ndistributions, with particular focus on the beyond-quantum robustness of\ncorrelations and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue that, within\nthe unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that of operators\nand that of probability distributions---is very strict. We point out how the\nconsideration of robustness at the two levels leads to a natural framework for\nthe quantification of entanglement in a device-independent way. Finally, we\nshow that the beyond-quantum robustness of the non-positive operators needed to\nachieve beyond-quantum correlations coincides with their negativity and their\ndistance from the set of quantum states. As an example, we calculate the\nbeyond-quantum robustness for the case of a noisy Popescu-Rohrlich box.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 15:37:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 19:49:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Geller", "J.", ""], ["Piani", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8215", "submitter": "Srinivasan Sivakumar", "authors": "S.

Such response is quantified by\nthe distance between the unperturbed and perturbed states, minimized with\nrespect to suitably identified sets of local unitary operations. In order to be\na bona fide measure of quantum correlations, the distance function must be\nchosen among those that are contractive under completely positive and trace\npreserving maps. The most relevant instances of such physically well behaved\nmetrics include the trace, the Bures, and the Hellinger distance. To each of\nthese metrics one can associate the corresponding discord of response, namely\nthe trace, or Hellinger, or Bures minimum distance from the set of unitarily\nperturbed states. All these three discords of response satisfy the basic axioms\nfor a proper measure of quantum correlations. In the present work we focus in\nparticular on the Bures distance, which enjoys the unique property of being\nboth Riemannian and contractive under completely positive and trace preserving\nmaps, and admits important operational interpretations in terms of state\ndistinguishability. We compute analytically the Bures discord of response for\ntwo-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals and we compare it with the\ncorresponding Bures geometric discord, namely the geometric measure of quantum\ncorrelations defined as the Bures distance from the set of classically\ncorrelated quantum states.
