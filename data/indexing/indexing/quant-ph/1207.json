The lowest energy\nstates, corresponding to a single electron located on either of the two donors,\nform a two-level system (TLS) well separated from all other electronic levels.\nGigahertz driving of this TLS results in a quantum interference pattern\nassociated with the absorption or the stimulated emission of up to ten\nmicrowave photons. We estimate a charge dephasing time of 0.3 nanoseconds,\nconsistent with other types of charge quantum bits. Here, however, the\nrelatively short coherence time can be counterbalanced by fast operation\nsignals (in principle up to 1 terahertz) as allowed by the large empty energy\nwindow separating ground and excited states in donor atoms. The demonstrated\ncoherent coupling of two donors constitutes an essential step towards\ndonor-based quantum computing devices in silicon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jul 2012 16:11:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dupont-Ferrier", "E.", ""], ["Roche", "B.", ""], ["Voisin", "B.", ""], ["Jehl", "X.", ""], ["Wacquez", "R.", ""], ["Vinet", "M.", ""], ["Sanquer", "M.", ""], ["De Franceschi", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1901", "submitter": "Timothy Harrison Mr.", "authors": "Timothy Harrison", "title": "Towards in-situ cleaning of a trapped ion quantum computer", "comments": "A Part III Project at the University of Cambridge Physics department\n  under the supervision of Prof. Michael K\\\"ohl in the Atomic and Optical\n  Physics department: http://www.quantumoptics.eu Thanks is given to Prof.\n  Michael K\\\"ohl,Matthias Steiner and Hendrik Meyer for their help and advice.\n  SEE VIDEOS: http://youtu.be/8rUrHVuBlc8 SEE HIGH RES PDF:\n  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/79619909/th347project.pdf", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.plasm-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A plasma glow discharge system was created using a conventional microwave\noven to ignite and maintain the plasma.

This scenario is phenomenologically very\nappealing as it solves the puzzles of the standard hot big bang model and\nnaturally explains why the spectrum of cosmological perturbations is almost\nscale invariant. It is also an ideal playground to discuss deep questions among\nwhich is the quantum measurement problem in a cosmological context. Although\nthe large squeezing of the quantum state of the perturbations and the\nphenomenon of decoherence explain many aspects of the quantum to classical\ntransition, it remains to understand how a specific outcome can be produced in\nthe early universe, in the absence of any observer. The Continuous Spontaneous\nLocalization (CSL) approach to quantum mechanics attempts to solve the quantum\nmeasurement question in a general context. In this framework, the wavefunction\ncollapse is caused by adding new non linear and stochastic terms to the\nSchroedinger equation. In this paper, we apply this theory to inflation, which\namounts to solving the CSL parametric oscillator case.

It is\nfound that inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions in the two methods\nresults in significant increases in intra- or inter-ring exciton transfer\nefficiency. The dependence of exciton transfer efficiency on trapping positions\non single rings of LH2 (B850) and LH1 is similar to that in toy models with\nnearest-neighbor coupling only. However, owing to the symmetry breaking caused\nby the dimerization of BChls and dipolar couplings, such dependence has been\nlargely suppressed. In the studies of coupled-ring systems, both methods reveal\ninteresting role of dipolar interaction in increasing energy transfer\nefficiency by introducing multiple intra/inter-ring transfer paths.\nImportantly, the time scale (~4ps) of inter-ring exciton transfer obtained from\npolaron dynamics is in good agreement with previous studies. In a double-ring\nLH2 system, dipole-induced symmetry breaking leads to global minima and local\nminima of the average trapping time when there is a finite value of non-zero\ndephasing rate, suggesting that environment plays a role in preserving quantum\ncoherent energy transfer. In contrast, dephasing comes into play only when the\nperfect cylindrical symmetry in the hypothetic system is broken.

Such novel ground states cannot be described within the\nconventionally used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees\nof freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled,\nspin-orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become crucial for a\ncorrect description of physical properties at finite temperature.

The computational\nresults for the Casimir-Polder free energy obtained in the framework of\nhydrodynamic model of graphene are several times larger than in the Dirac model\nwithin the separation region below 2$\\mu$m.

While\nsmall quantum systems with discrete energy levels are noiseless and stay\ncoherent forever in the absence of any coupling to external world, most\nlarge-scale quantum systems are able to produce thermal bath and excitation\ndecay. This intrinsic decoherence is manifested by a broadening of energy\nlevels which aquire a finite width. The important question is what is the\ndriving force and the mechanism of transition(s) between two different types of\nmany-body systems - with and without intrinsic decoherence? Here we address\nthis question via the numerical study of energy level statistics of a system of\nspins-1/2 with anisotropic exchange interactions and random transverse fields.\nOur results present the first evidence for a well-defined quantum phase\ntransition between domains of discrete and continous many-body spectra in a\nclass of random spin models.

The paper starts with a proof of a\nstrong, finite sample, version of Bell's inequality and thereby also of Bell's\ntheorem, which states that quantum theory is incompatible with the conjunction\nof three formerly uncontroversial physical principles, here referred to as\nlocality, realism and freedom. Locality is the principle that the direction of\ncausality matches the direction of time, and that causal influences need time\nto propagate spatially. Realism and freedom are directly connected to\nstatistical thinking on causality: they relate to counterfactual reasoning, and\nto randomisation, respectively. Experimental loopholes in state-of-the-art Bell\ntype experiments are related to statistical issues of post-selection in\nobservational studies, and the missing at random assumption. They can be\navoided by properly matching the statistical analysis to the actual\nexperimental design, instead of by making untestable assumptions of\nindependence between observed and unobserved variables.

The Quantum Randi Challenge (QRC) is a DRC designed to reject\nhidden variable models by simply teaching QM; there is no bet or interaction\nwith challengers. The QRC is a computer game that anybody can modify. The\npresent version includes a simulation of true QM behavior that violates Bell\n99% of the time, hidden variables that violate the Bell and CHSH inequality\nwith 50% probability, and ones which violate Bell 85% of the time when missing\n13% anti-correlation. The DRC challenge is to modify the hidden variables so\nthat the predicted QM behavior arises, including anti-correlation. If such were\npossible, the presented programs would make it trivial to meet the challenge.\nThis fact and the whole QRC can be taught to a wide audience via the presented\nheuristics.

Hence it can be characterized from the point of\nview of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its ability to transfer\ninformation. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the\nproper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of\ncodes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them\nfrom the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error\ncorrection. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the\nchannel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which,\nwhen properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by\nthe physical process under consideration. While most of the work produced so\nfar has been focused on the case in which a given channel transformation acts\nidentically and independently on the various elements of the sequence\n(memoryless configuration in jargon), correlated error models appear to be a\nmore realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly different, yet\nconceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum\nsystem which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external\ndisturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the\nstudy of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile ground where interesting\nnovel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory and\nother branches of physics.

We assume that the direction of the magnetic field changes with time in a\ngeneral way, so the Heisenberg equations of motion cannot be solved by\nquadrature. Also, the potential is assumed to be of a general form. We use the\nrotation operator associated with the solid angle Berry phase to transform the\nproblem to a rotating reference frame that follows the direction of the\nmagnetic field. In the rotating reference frame, we derive a natural\nfactorization of the time evolution operator by recognizing the crucial role\nplayed by a gauge transformation. The major complexity of the problem arises\nfrom the coupling between motion in the direction of the magnetic field and\nmotion perpendicular to the field. In the factorization, this complexity is\nconsolidated into a single operator that approaches the identity operator when\nthe potential confines the particle sufficiently close to a plane perpendicular\nto the magnetic field. The structure of this operator is clarified by deriving\nan expression for its generating Hamiltonian. The magnetic translation is the\nmost notable physical consequence in the adiabatic limit. This and the\nnon-adiabatic effects are studied as consequences of the general factorization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2012 09:25:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 02:47:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 14:08:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chee", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6505", "submitter": "Georgios Kavoulakis", "authors": "E. \\\"O.

Such\nquasi-uniform matrices occur in several physical contexts, both classical and\nquantum, where one-dimensional interactions prevail. These include magnetic\nchains, 1D arrays of Josephson junctions or of quantum dots, boson and fermion\nhopping models, random walks, and so on. In such systems the bulk interactions\nare uniform, and differences may occur around the boundaries of the arrays.\nSince in the uniform case the spectrum consists of a band, we exploit the bulk\nuniformity of quasi-uniform tridiagonal matrices in order to express the\nspectral problem in terms of a variation of the distribution of eigenvalues in\nthe band and of the corresponding eigenvectors. In the limit of large matrices\nthis naturally leads to a deformation of the density of states which can be\nexpressed analytically; a few out-of-band eigenvalues can show up and have to\nbe accounted for separately. The general procedure is illustrated with some\nexamples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 16:33:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Banchi", "Leonardo", ""], ["Vaia", "Ruggero", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7340", "submitter": "David Viennot", "authors": "David Viennot and Jos\\'e Lages", "title": "C\\ast-geometric phase for mixed states: entanglement, decoherence and\n  spin system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.
