It follows that for the purpose of understanding the consequences of\nsymmetries of dynamics, in particular, complicated and open-system dynamics, it\nis useful to introduce the notion of a state's asymmetry properties, which\nincludes the type and measure of its asymmetry. We demonstrate and exploit the\nfact that the asymmetry properties of a state can also be understood in terms\nof information-theoretic concepts, for instance in terms of the state's ability\nto encode information about an element of the symmetry group. We show that the\nasymmetry properties of a pure state psi relative to the symmetry group G are\ncompletely specified by the characteristic function of the state, defined as\nchi_psi(g)=<psi|U(g)|psi> where g\\in G and U is the unitary representation of\ninterest. For a symmetry described by a compact Lie group G, we show that two\npure states can be reversibly interconverted one to the other by symmetric\noperations if and only if their characteristic functions are equal up to a\n1-dimensional representation of the group. Characteristic functions also allow\nus to easily identify the conditions for one pure state to be converted to\nanother by symmetric operations (in general irreversibly) for the various\nparadigms of single-copy transformations: deterministic, state-to-ensemble,\nstochastic and catalyzed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 20:07:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 05:45:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Marvian", "Iman", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0024", "submitter": "Haitan Xu", "authors": "Haitan Xu and J.

We\ninvestigate, in particular, the effects of a Coulomb type potential of the form\n$\\xi/r$ on the energy spectrum of Dirac electrons in the graphene ring in two\ndifferent ways: one for the scalar coupling and the other for the vector\ncoupling. It is found that, since the potential in the scalar coupling breaks\nthe time-reversal symmetry between the two valleys as well as the effective\ntime-reversal symmetry in a single valley, the energy spectrum of one valley is\nseparated from that of the other valley, demonstrating a valley polarization.\nIn the vector coupling, however, the potential does not break either of the two\nsymmetries and its effect appears only as an additive constant to the spectrum\nof Aharonov-Bohm potential. The corresponding persistent currents, the\nobservable quantities of the symmetry-breaking energy spectra, are shown to be\nasymmetric about zero magnetic flux in the scalar coupling, while symmetric in\nthe vector coupling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Apr 2011 09:47:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Jan 2012 07:09:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Jung", "Eylee", ""], ["Hwang", "Mi-Ra", ""], ["Park", "ChangSoo", ""], ["Park", "DaeKil", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0374", "submitter": "Motoaki Bamba", "authors": "Motoaki Bamba and Hajime Ishihara", "title": "Theoretical framework of entangled-photon generation from biexcitons in\n  nano-to-bulk crossover regime with planar geometry", "comments": "18 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

However, this is not\nthe only aspect of entanglement theory where local unitaries play a relevant\nrole. In the present work we show that the application of suitable local\nunitary operations defines a family of bipartite entanglement monotones,\ncollectively referred to as \"mirror entanglement\". They are constructed by\nfirst considering the (squared) Hilbert-Schmidt distance of the state from the\nset of states obtained by applying to it a given local unitary. To the action\nof each different local unitary there corresponds a different distance. We then\nminimize these distances over the sets of local unitaries with different\nspectra, obtaining an entire family of different entanglement monotones. We\nshow that these mirror entanglement monotones are organized in a hierarchical\nstructure, and we establish the conditions that need to be imposed on the\nspectrum of a local unitary for the associated mirror entanglement to be\nfaithful, i.e. to vanish on and only on separable pure states. We analyze in\ndetail the properties of one particularly relevant member of the family, the\n\"stellar mirror entanglement\" associated to traceless local unitaries with\nnondegenerate spectrum and equispaced eigenvalues in the complex plane.

Projective\nsimulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are\nelementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes\ndynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional\nprinciples of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened\nfor specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is\ndifferent from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a\nnew element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and\nlearning.

In the second part we prove that classical\nmathematics is a special degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal\nlimit when the characteristic $p$ of the field or ring in the latter goes to\ninfinity. {\\bf This implies that mathematics describing nature at the most\nfundamental level involves only a finite number of numbers while the notions of\nlimit and infinitely small/large and the notions constructed from them (e.g.\ncontinuity, derivative and integral) are needed only in calculations describing\nnature approximately}. In a quantum theory based on finite mathematics, the de\nSitter gravitational constant depends on $p$ and disappears in the formal limit\n$p\\to\\infty$, i.e. gravity is a consequence of finiteness of nature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Apr 2011 19:29:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2011 01:02:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2011 16:44:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 04:52:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 06:21:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2019 18:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2020 15:54:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lev", "Felix M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4648", "submitter": "Gijs  de Lange", "authors": "G. de Lange, T. van der Sar, M.

We do this by explicitly introducing what we call the k-model and\nby proving that its processes cannot be modelized by a classical or quantum\nscattering system.

Both\ndiscrete and continuous groups are considered. It is shown how each symmetry\ngroup restricts arbitrariness in the parameters of the channel to a very small\nset. Although the explicit examples are related to qutrit channels, the\nformalism is sufficiently general to be applied to qudit channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 17:07:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2011 08:03:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Karimipour", "Vahid", ""], ["Mani", "Azam", ""], ["Memarzadeh", "Laleh", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5694", "submitter": "Juan Mauricio Matera", "authors": "Juan Mauricio Matera and Raul Rossignoli and Norma Canosa", "title": "Thermal entanglement in fully connected spin systems and its RPA\n  description", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Physical Review A 78, 012316 (2008)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevA.78.012316", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine the thermal pairwise entanglement in a symmetric system of $n$\nspins fully connected through anisotropic $XYZ$-type couplings embedded in a\ntransverse magnetic field.

The latter is shown to provide an accurate analytic\ndescription of both the parallel and antiparallel thermal concurrence in large\nsystems.
