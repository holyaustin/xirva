A\nmajor obstacle is the requirement of a large number of clean ancilla states of\ndifferent types without correlated errors inside each block. These ancilla\nstates are usually logical stabilizer states of the data code blocks, which are\ngenerally difficult to prepare if the code size is large. Previously we have\nproposed an ancilla distillation protocol for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)\ncodes by classical error-correcting codes. It was assumed that the quantum\ngates in the distillation circuit were perfect; however, in reality, noisy\nquantum gates may introduce correlated errors that are not treatable by the\nprotocol. In this paper, we show that additional postselection by another\nclassical error-detecting code can be applied to remove almost all correlated\nerrors. Consequently, the revised protocol is fully fault-tolerant and capable\nof preparing a large set of stabilizer states sufficient for FTQC using large\nblock codes. At the same time, the yield rate can be boosted from $O(t^{-2})$\nto $O(1)$ in practice for an $[[n,k,d=2t+1]]$ CSS code. Ancilla preparation for\nthe $[[23,1,7]]$ quantum Golay code is numerically studied in detail through\nMonte Carlo simulation. The results support the validity of the protocol when\nthe gate failure rate is reasonably low.

To this end we study the impact of\nincomplete event logs for the extraction and analysis of business processes. It\nis quite common that event logs are incomplete with several amounts of missing\ninformation (for instance, workers forget to register their tasks). Absence of\ndata is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the\ndecision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We investigate\nhow classical probabilistic models are affected by incomplete event logs and we\nexplore quantum-like probabilistic inferences as an alternative mathematical\nmodel to classical probability. This work represents a first step towards\nsystematic investigation of the impact of quantum interference in a real life\nlarge scale decision scenario. The results obtained in this study indicate\nthat, under high levels of uncertainty, the quantum-like models generate\nquantum interference terms, which allow an additional non-linear\nparameterisation of the data. Experimental results attest the efficiency of the\nquantum-like Bayesian networks, since the application of interference terms is\nable to reduce the error percentage of inferences performed over quantum-like\nmodels when compared to inferences produced by classical models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 05:28:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Moreira", "Catarina", ""], ["Haven", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""], ["Wichert", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.00500", "submitter": "David Moss", "authors": "Lucia Caspani, Christian Reimer, Michael Kues, Piotr Roztocki, Matteo\n  Clerici, Benjamin Wetzel, Yoann Jestin, Marcello Ferrera, Marco Peccianti,\n  Alessia Pasquazi, Luca Razzari, Brent E.

Here, we introduce a new representation of states\nbased on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of\ngenerative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this\nrepresentation by encoding probability distributions associated with states\nfrom different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better\nrepresentation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no\nbenefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions\nassociated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can\nbe exploited by layered neural networks. Specifically, we consider the\nlearnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans.\nSuch states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for\nquantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions.

The\ndescribed method can be similarly applied to other complex (bio-) molecular\nsystems, characterised by a rich manifold of electronic states and vibronic\ncoupling driving non-adiabatic dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 19:44:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Schr\u00f6der", "Florian A.

While quantum information science has relied on\nsystems with entanglement in 2D degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum bits with\npolarization states, the field is moving towards ever-higher dimensions of\nentanglement. Increasing the dimensionality enhances the channel capacity and\nsecurity of quantum communication protocols, gives rise to exponential speed-up\nof quantum computation, and is necessary for quantum imaging. Yet,\ncharacterization of even bipartite quantum states of high-dimensional\nentanglement remains a prohibitively time-consuming challenge, as the\ndimensionality of the joint Hilbert space scales quadratically with the number\nof modes. Here, we develop and experimentally demonstrate a new, more complete\ntheory of detection in CCD cameras for rapid measurement of the full joint\nprobability distribution of high-dimensional quantum states. The theory spans\nthe intensity range from low photon count to saturation of the detector, while\nthe massive parallelization inherent in the pixel array makes measurements\nscale favorably with dimensionality.

We prove that, for most of the values of the\nOhmicity parameter, a simple probe such as a single qubit is already optimal\nfor the precise estimation of the cutoff frequency. Indeed for those values,\nupon considering a two-qubit probe either in a Bell or in separable state, we\ndo not find improvement to the estimation precision. However, we also showed\nthat there exist few conditions where employing two qubits in a Bell state\ninteracting with a common bath is more suitable for precisely estimating the\ncutoff frequency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Oct 2017 14:42:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Feb 2018 10:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Benedetti", "Claudia", ""], ["Sehdaran", "Fahimeh Salari", ""], ["Zandi", "Mohammad H.", ""], ["Paris", "Matteo G.

We present a machine learning approach that utilizes an\nautoencoder that is trained to find a low-dimensional representation of a set\nof molecular configurations. These configurations are generated by trajectory\ncalculations performed on the reactive molecular systems of interest. The\nresulting low-dimensional representation can be used to generate a potential\nenergy surface grid in the desired subspace. Using the G-matrix formalism to\ncalculate the kinetic energy operator, QD calculations can be carried out on\nthis grid. In addition to step-by-step instructions for the grid construction,\nwe present the application to a test system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 14:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zauleck", "Julius P.

The cavity\nis stabilized by applying external feedback in a frequency band around the\noptical spring resonance. The error signal is sensed in the amplitude\nquadrature of the transmitted beam with a photodetector. An amplitude modulator\nin the input path to the cavity modulates the light intensity to provide the\nstabilizing radiation pressure force.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 19:40:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 16:31:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Cripe", "Jonathan", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Nancy", ""], ["Singh", "Robinjeet", ""], ["Lanza", "Robert", ""], ["Libson", "Adam", ""], ["Yap", "Min Jet", ""], ["Cole", "Garrett D.", ""], ["McClelland", "David E.", ""], ["Mavalvala", "Nergis", ""], ["Corbitt", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.04710", "submitter": "Denis Rosset", "authors": "Denis Rosset, Francesco Buscemi, Yeong-Cherng Liang", "title": "A resource theory of quantum memories and their faithful verification\n  with minimal assumptions", "comments": "Addition of a quantitative study of memories as resources, and\n  reformulated part of the results in that light", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Here we study the interplay between orbital degenerescence and particle\nnumber admixture in atomic states, beyond the usual classical spin\napproximation. We model the atom as a generalized Anderson model interacting\nwith a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. In the limit of zero on-site\nCoulomb repulsion ($U=0$), we obtain YSR subgap energy levels that are\nidentical to the ones obtained from the classical spin model. When $\\Delta$ is\nlarge and $U>0$, the YSR spectra is no longer quasiparticle-like, and the\nhighly degenerate orbital subspaces are split according to their spin, orbital,\nand number-parity symmetry. We show that $U>0$ activates additional poles in\nthe atomic Green's function, suggesting an alternative explanation for the peak\nsplittings recently observed in scanning tunneling microscopy of\norbitally-degenerate impurities in superconductors.

While, however,\nthis organization can, along with the observed behavior of measuring\ninstruments, be described by means of classical physics, it cannot be predicted\nby means of classical physics, but only, probabilistically or statistically, by\nmeans of quantum mechanics, or in high-energy physics, by means of quantum\nfield theory (or possibly some alternative theories within each scope). By\ncontrast, the emergences of this information and of this structure cannot, in\nthe present view, be described by either classical or quantum theory, or\npossibly by any other means, which leads to the concept of \"structure without\nlaw\" and the viewpoint of structural nnnrealism.

We do this by considering local random unitary\ncircuits with a conserved U$(1)$ charge and argue, with numerical and\nanalytical evidence, that the presence of a conservation law slows relaxation\nin both time ordered {\\textit{and}} out-of-time-ordered correlation functions,\nboth can have a diffusively relaxing component or \"hydrodynamic tail\" at late\ntimes. We verify the presence of such tails also in a deterministic,\nperidocially driven system. We show that for OTOCs, the combination of\ndiffusive and ballistic components leads to a wave front with a specific,\nasymmetric shape, decaying as a power law behind the front. These results also\nexplain existing numerical investigations in non-noisy ergodic systems with\nenergy conservation. Moreover, we consider OTOCs in Gibbs states, parametrized\nby a chemical potential $\\mu$, and apply perturbative arguments to show that\nfor $\\mu\\gg 1$ the ballistic front of information-spreading can only develop at\ntimes exponentially large in $\\mu$ -- with the information traveling\ndiffusively at earlier times. We also develop a new formalism for describing\nOTOCs and operator spreading, which allows us to interpret the saturation of\nOTOCs as a form of thermalization on the Hilbert space of operators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Oct 2017 17:46:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 13:02:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 17:38:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Rakovszky", "Tibor", ""], ["Pollmann", "Frank", ""], ["von Keyserlingk", "C.

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a\npower law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of\nthe conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator\n(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival\nof the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,\nit develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only\nas a power of time instead of exponentially. We also derive these results\nwithin an effective hydrodynamic description which contains multiple coupled\ndiffusion equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Oct 2017 17:59:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 19:27:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2018 12:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Khemani", "Vedika", ""], ["Vishwanath", "Ashvin", ""], ["Huse", "D.

The\nquantum f-divergence of Petz is one generalization of the quantum relative\nentropy, and it also leads to other relative entropies, such as the Petz-Renyi\nrelative entropies.

We also extend our\nanalysis to general machines.} Our work provides a unified picture of the\ndifferent approaches to quantum refrigeration developed in the literature,\nincluding algorithmic cooling, autonomous quantum refrigerators, and the\nresource theory of quantum thermodynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 17:58:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Nov 2017 13:07:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:56:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Clivaz", "Fabien", ""], ["Silva", "Ralph", ""], ["Haack", "G\u00e9raldine", ""], ["Brask", "Jonatan Bohr", ""], ["Brunner", "Nicolas", ""], ["Huber", "Marcus", ""]]}]
