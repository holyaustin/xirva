Despite considerable research into the underlying mechanisms\nbehind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated by this,\nwe put forth a detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase\nspace and entropy production, a key concept in thermodynamics. We focus on the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use spin coherent states to construct the\ncorresponding Husimi-$Q$ quasi-probability distribution. The entropy of the\n$Q$-function, known as Wehrl entropy, provides a measure of the coarse-grained\ndynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves non-trivially even for closed\nsystems. We show that critical quenches lead to a quasi-monotonic growth of the\nWehrl entropy in time, combined with small oscillations. The former reflects\nthe information scrambling characteristic of these transitions and serves as a\nmeasure of entropy production. On the other hand, the small oscillations imply\nnegative entropy production rates and, therefore, signal the recurrences of the\nLoschmidt echo. Finally, we also study a Gaussification of the model based on a\nmodified Holstein-Primakoff approximation. This allows us to identify the\nrelative contribution of the low energy sector to the emergence of DPTs.

We describe a table-top test of QG that uses our\nnon-Gaussianity signature and which is based on just a single quantum system, a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in a single location. In contrast to proposals\nbased on opto-mechanical setups, BECs have already been manipulated into\nmassive non-classical states, aiding the prospect of testing QG in the near\nfuture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2020 12:36:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 09:40:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 16:32:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 15:38:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:16:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:22:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Howl", "Richard", ""], ["Vedral", "Vlatko", ""], ["Naik", "Devang", ""], ["Christodoulou", "Marios", ""], ["Rovelli", "Carlo", ""], ["Iyer", "Aditya", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.01194", "submitter": "Yuan Liu", "authors": "Yuan Liu, Tong Shen, Hang Zhang, Brenda Rubenstein", "title": "Unveiling the Finite Temperature Physics of Hydrogen Chains via\n  Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo", "comments": "52 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

Nonetheless, there remain comparatively few\nmany-body techniques capable of elucidating the finite temperature physics of\nsolids from first principles. In this work, we take a significant step towards\ndeveloping such a technique by generalizing our previous, fully ab initio\nfinite temperature Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC) method to\nmodel periodic solids and employing it to uncover the finite temperature\nphysics of periodic hydrogen chains. Based upon our calculations of these\nchains' many-body thermodynamic quantities and correlation functions, we\noutline their metal-insulator and magnetic ordering as a function of both H-H\nbond distance and temperature. At low temperatures approaching the ground\nstate, we observe both metal-insulator and ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic\ncrossovers at bond lengths between 0.5 and 0.75 {\\AA}. We then demonstrate how\nthis low-temperature ordering evolves into a metallic phase with decreasing\nmagnetic order at higher temperatures. By comparing the features we observe to\nthose previously seen in one-dimensional, half-filled Hubbard models at finite\ntemperature and in ground state hydrogen chains, interestingly, we identify\nsignatures of the Pomeranchuk effect in hydrogen chains for the first time and\nshow that spin and charge excitations that typically arise at distinct\ntemperatures in the Hubbard model are indistinguishably coupled in these\nsystems.

Under\nthe resonant conditions within the laser field the intermediate virtual\nelectron transforms into the real particle. As a result, the accomplished\nanalysis defines that the polar emission angle characterizes the frequency of a\nspontaneous photon. The study derives the expressions for the resonant\ndifferential cross-sections of the represented processes that realize\nsimultaneous registration of the frequency and radiation angle in correlation\nto the momentum of the initial electron (for the channel A) and of the final\nelectron (for the channel B) of the spontaneous photon with absorption of $r$\nwave photons ($r = 1, 2, 3,... $ - the number of a resonance). Additionally,\nthe distribution of the resonant differential cross-section as a function of\nthe angle of the spontaneous photon emission for the higher numbers of\nresonance ($r = 2, 3,... $) delineates a dependency with a sharp peak maximum\nthat coordinates to the particle radiation at the most probable frequency.

A key measure of the performance of a quantum gate is the\nminimum gate fidelity, i.e., the fidelity of the gate, minimized over all input\nstates. Conventionally, the minimum fidelity is estimated by first accurately\nreconstructing the full gate process matrix using the experimental procedure of\nquantum process tomography (QPT). Then, a numerical minimization is carried out\nto find the minimum fidelity. QPT is, however, well known to be costly, and it\nmight appear that we can do better, if the goal is only to estimate one single\nnumber. In this work, we propose a hybrid numerical-experimental scheme that\nemploys a numerical gradient-free minimization (GFM) and an experimental\ntarget-fidelity estimation procedure to directly estimate the minimum fidelity\nwithout reconstructing the process matrix. We compare this to an alternative\nscheme, referred to as QPT fidelity estimation, that does use QPT, but directly\nemploys the minimum gate fidelity as the termination criterion.

In each case, the\ngap equation is derived and the effects of the non-Hermitian terms on the\ngenerated mass are studied. We have several findings: in previous calculations\nfor the free Dirac equation modified to include non-Hermitian bilinear terms,\ncontrary to expectation, no real mass spectrum can be obtained in the chiral\nlimit; in these cases a nonzero bare fermion mass is essential for the\nrealization of PT symmetry in the unbroken regime.

Thus, the four-point interaction overrides the effects leading to PT\nsymmetry-breaking for these parameter values. Further, we find that in both\ncases, in 3+1 and in 1+1 dimensions, the inclusion of a non-Hermitian bilinear\nterm can contribute to the generated mass. In both models, this contribution\ncan be tuned to be small; we thus fix the fermion mass to its value when\n$m_0=0$ in the absence of the non-Hermitian term, and then determine the value\nof the coupling required so as to generate a bare fermion mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2020 14:29:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Felski", "Alexander", ""], ["Beygi", "Alireza", ""], ["Klevansky", "S.

Given an upper\nbound $\\alpha$ on $\\|H_0\\|$ and $\\|H_1\\|$ along with the promise that the $k$th\neigenstate $|\\psi_k(s)\\rangle$ of $H(s) \\equiv (1-s)H_0 + sH_1$ is separated\nfrom the rest of the spectrum by a gap of at least $\\gamma > 0$ for all $s \\in\n[0,1]$, this algorithm implements an operator $\\widetilde{U}$ such that $\\|\n|\\psi_k(1)\\rangle - \\widetilde{U}|\\psi_k(s)\\rangle\\| \\leq \\epsilon$ using\n$\\mathcal{O}(({\\alpha^2}/{\\gamma^2})\\mathrm{polylog}(\\alpha/\\gamma\\epsilon))$\nqueries to block-encodings of $H_0$ and $H_1$. Our second algorithm is\napplicable only to ground states and requires multiple queries to an oracle\nthat prepares $|\\psi_0(0)\\rangle$, but has slightly better scaling in all\nparameters. We also show that the costs of both algorithms can be further\nreduced under certain reasonable conditions, such as when $\\|H_1 - H_0\\|$ is\nsmall compared to $\\alpha$, or when more information about the gap of $H(s)$ is\navailable. For certain problems, the scaling can even be improved to linear in\n$\\|H_1 - H_0\\|/\\gamma$ up to polylogarithmic factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Wan", "Kianna", ""], ["Kim", "Isaac", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.04170", "submitter": "Kianna Wan", "authors": "Kianna Wan", "title": "Exponentially faster implementations of Select(H) for fermionic\n  Hamiltonians", "comments": "15 pages; added some comments, including about other fermion-to-qubit\n  mappings", "journal-ref": "Quantum 5, 380 (2021)", "doi": "10.22331/q-2021-01-12-380", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We present a simple but general framework for constructing quantum circuits\nthat implement the multiply-controlled unitary $\\text{Select}(H) \\equiv\n\\sum_\\ell |\\ell\\rangle\\langle\\ell|\\otimes H_\\ell$, where $H = \\sum_\\ell H_\\ell$\nis the Jordan-Wigner transform of an arbitrary second-quantised fermionic\nHamiltonian. $\\text{Select}(H)$ is one of the main subroutines of several\nquantum algorithms, including state-of-the-art techniques for Hamiltonian\nsimulation.

By taking a\ndynamical systems approach, we perform a comprehensive analysis of these\nequations to reveal an abundance of novel and complex dynamics. Examples of the\nnovel phenomena that we observe are the emergence of superradiant oscillations\narising due to Hopf bifurcations, and the appearance of a pair of chaotic\nattractors arising from period-doubling cascades, followed by their collision\nto form a single, larger chaotic attractor via a sequence of infinitely many\nhomoclinic bifurcations.

We use this phase information to\nidentify states embedded in a dense molecular energy-level structure and to\nmonitor state-to-state inelastic scattering processes. This method can also be\nused to exclude a large number of states in a single measurement when the\ninitial state preparation is imperfect and information on the molecular\nproperties is incomplete. While the present experiments focus on N$_2^+$, the\nmethod is general and is expected to be of particular benefit for polyatomic\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 04:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Najafian", "Kaveh", ""], ["Meir", "Ziv", ""], ["Sinhal", "Mudit", ""], ["Willitsch", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.05313", "submitter": "Xiangyu Cao", "authors": "Jaewon Kim and Xiangyu Cao", "title": "Comment on \"Chaotic-Integrable Transition in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\n  Model\"", "comments": "1 page, 1 figure; accepted version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The quantum version of a probability distribution is a\ndensity operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called\nthe partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability\ndistribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability\ndistribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By\napplying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals\nrecover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities\nwill have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will\ncontain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by\nstatistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional\nprobability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture\n\"concepts\" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then\nillustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more\ntheoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling\nentailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing\nexpressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this\nthesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels\nwith the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common\nblueprint is found in category theory.

Furthermore, we also\nillustrate our proposal on a chain of three coupled superconducting transmons,\nwhich can lead to a non-reciprocal circulator with high fidelity without a ring\ncoupling configuration as in the previous schemes or implementations.\nTherefore, our protocol provides a promising way to explore fundamental\nnon-reciprocal quantum physics as well as realize non-reciprocal quantum\ndevice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Apr 2020 08:56:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Mar 2021 06:11:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Sai", ""], ["Chen", "Tao", ""], ["Liu", "Jia", ""], ["Xue", "Zheng-Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.05831", "submitter": "Xiaojun Jia", "authors": "Juan Yu, Yue Qin, Jinliang Qin, Hong Wang, Zhihui Yan, Xiaojun Jia,\n  and Kunchi Peng", "title": "Quantum enhanced optical phase estimation with a squeezed thermal state", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We find that for\nclasses known to be in P, such as $2$SAT and \\#XORSAT, the existence of\nappropriate rewrite rules allows for efficient simplification of the diagram,\nproducing the solution in polynomial time. In contrast, for classes known to be\nNP-complete, such as $3$SAT, or \\#P-complete, such as \\#$2$SAT, the\ncorresponding rewrite rules introduce hyperedges to the diagrams, in numbers\nwhich are not easily bounded above by a polynomial. This diagrammatic approach\nunifies the diagnosis of the complexity of CSPs and \\#CSPs and shows promise in\naiding tensor network contraction-based algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 12:50:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["de Beaudrap", "Niel", ""], ["Kissinger", "Aleks", ""], ["Meichanetzidis", "Konstantinos", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.06516", "submitter": "Ashley Montanaro", "authors": "Noah Linden, Ashley Montanaro and Changpeng Shao", "title": "Quantum vs. classical algorithms for solving the heat equation", "comments": "37 pages, 0 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computers are predicted to outperform classical ones for solving\npartial differential equations, perhaps exponentially.

It is shown that the time-dependent Stokes parameters defining the\npolarization state of HHG can be tuned by varying the waist of the driving\nfield which in turn, changes the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse\nelectric-field components of the driving laser. In addition, employing a\nmultipole expansion of the produced harmonics exposes the specific multipolar\ncharacter and the relation to the spatial structure of the driving field\npolarization states. The scheme proposed here allows a full polarization\ncontrol of the emitted harmonics by only one driving laser. A tighter focusing\nof the driving pulse renders possible the emission of harmonics with both even\nand odd spatial symmetry. The underlying mechanism is due to the fundamental\ninterplay between the transverse and longitudinal components of the laser's\nelectromagnetic vector potential.

Switching\nbetween different driving protocols then suggests a dynamical control of the\nlocalization and stability of topological edge modes, with possible\napplications in quantum computation.

We find that, surprisingly, EPTs are possible even in the absence\nof scrambling unitary dynamics, where they are best understood as arising from\nmeasurements alone.

In the standard\ntreatments, these features arise from properties of mode functions of quantum\nfields in (near) de Sitter space-time. Therefore, the three notions are often\nassumed to be essentially equivalent, representing different facets of the same\nphenomenon. We analyze them in general Friedmann-Lemaitre- Robertson-Walker\nspace-times, through the lens of geometric structures on the classical phase\nspace. The analysis shows that: (i) inflation does not play an essential role;\nclassical behavior can emerge much more generally; (ii) the three notions are\nconceptually distinct; classicality can emerge in one sense but not in another;\nand, (iii) the third notion is realized in a surprisingly strong sense; there\nis exact equality between completely general $n$-point functions in the\nclassical theory and those in the quantum theory, provided the quantum\noperators are Weyl ordered.

These operators, when augmented with a non-Gaussian\ntransformation such as the Kerr gate, achieve universal quantum computation.\nOur approach brings two advantages: first, by computing the matrix elements of\nGaussian operators directly, we don't need to construct them by combining\nseveral other operators; second, we can use any variant of the gradient descent\nalgorithm by plugging our gradients into an automatic differentiation framework\nsuch as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Our results will find applications in quantum\noptical hardware research, quantum machine learning, optical data processing,\ndevice discovery and device design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 07:02:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 16:14:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2020 10:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 6 Nov 2020 23:01:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:40:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Miatto", "Filippo M.", ""], ["Quesada", "Nicol\u00e1s", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.11003", "submitter": "Wenyuan Wang", "authors": "Wenyuan Wang", "title": "Adaptive Techniques in Practical Quantum Key Distribution", "comments": "Wenyuan Wang's PhD thesis submitted to University of Toronto", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide information-theoretically secure\ncommunications and is a strong candidate for the next generation of\ncryptography.

We pursue a totally\ndifferent approach based on topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and\nprove that a lattice implementation of the disk axiom and annulus axiom in\nTQFTs as essentially the equivalence of TQO1 and TQO2 conditions. We confirm\nthe error correcting properties of ground subspaces for topological lattice\nHamiltonian schemas of the Levin-Wen model and Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFTs by\nproviding a lattice version of the disk axiom and annulus of the underlying\nTQFTs. The error correcting property of ground subspaces is also shared by\ngapped fracton models such as the Haah codes.

This problem, first raised by Broadbent,\nFitzsimons and Kashefi [FOCS09, arXiv:0807.4154], has become fundamental to the\nstudy of quantum cryptography, not only because of its own importance, but also\nbecause it provides a testbed for new techniques that can be later applied to\nrelated problems (for example, quantum computation verification).

We give a new universal blind quantum computation protocol.\nSimilar to previous works on IT-secure protocols (for example, BFK [FOCS09,\narXiv:0807.4154]), our protocol can be divided into two phases.

We prove that\nQKD maintains the security of the SPIR protocol and that it is also secure\nagainst any external eavesdropper.

We show that\nwhen the number of repetitions of the experiment is small, there is significant\nprobability of achieving a sub-unit experimentally achieved quantum\nteleportation fidelity that uses entanglement, even classically, i.e., without\nusing entanglement. We further show that only when the number of repetitions of\nthe experiment is of the order of a few thousands, the probability of a\nclassical teleportation process to reach the currently achieved experimental\nquantum teleportation fidelities becomes negligibly small, and hence ensure\nthat the experimentally obtained fidelities are due to genuine use of the\nshared entanglements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 18:18:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "C S Sudheer", ""], ["Sen", "Ujjwal", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14847", "submitter": "Jacques Pienaar", "authors": "Jacques Pienaar", "title": "Extending the Agent in QBism", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10701-020-00375-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  According to the subjective Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics\n(QBism), the instruments used to measure quantum systems are to be regarded as\nan extension of the senses of the agent who is using them, and quantum states\ndescribe the agent's expectations for what they will experience through these\nextended senses.
