We have previously used this fact\nto classify self-dual additive codes over GF(4). In this paper we classify\nself-dual additive codes over GF(9), GF(16), and GF(25). Assuming that the\nclassical MDS conjecture holds, we are able to classify all self-dual additive\nMDS codes over GF(9) by using an extension technique. We prove that the minimum\ndistance of a self-dual additive code is related to the minimum vertex degree\nin the associated graph orbit. Circulant graph codes are introduced, and a\ncomputer search reveals that this set contains many strong codes. We show that\nsome of these codes have highly regular graph representations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Jan 2008 14:43:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2008 11:06:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2009 12:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Danielsen", "Lars Eirik", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3793", "submitter": "Pedro Sancho", "authors": "Pedro Sancho", "title": "Second order contributions to the absorption of massive particles", "comments": "Corrected typos.
