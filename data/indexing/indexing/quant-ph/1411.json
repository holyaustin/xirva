Our result is the first parallel repetition theorem for\nentangled games involving more than two players.

Despite this negative result, the particles'\nstates leave no doubt that a peculiar interaction has occurred: One particle's\nmomentum changes while the other's remains unaffected, in apparent violation of\nmomentum conservation. Revisiting the foundations of the quantum measurement\nprocess offers the resolution. Prior to the macroscopic recording of no\ninteraction, a brief Critical Interval prevails, during which the particles and\nthe detector's pointer form a subtle entanglement which immediately dissolves.\nIt is this self-cancellation, henceforth \"Quantum Oblivion (QO),\" that lies at\nthe basis of some well-known intriguing quantum effects. Such is\nInteraction-Free Measurement (IFM) [1] and its more paradoxical variants, like\nHardy's Paradox [2] and the Quantum Liar Paradox [3]. Even the Aharonov-Bohm\n(AB) effect [4] and weak measurement [5] turn out to belong to this group. We\nnext study interventions within the Critical Interval that produce some other\npeculiar effects. Finally we discuss some of the conceptual issues involved.\nUnder the time-resolution of the Critical Interval, some nonlocal phenomena\nturn out to be local. Momentum is conserved due to the quantum uncertainties\ninflicted by the particle-pointer interaction, which sets the experiment's\nfinal boundary condition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 20:33:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Elitzur", "Avshalom C.", ""], ["Cohen", "Eliahu", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2285", "submitter": "Matteo Ippoliti", "authors": "Matteo Ippoliti, Leonardo Mazza, Matteo Rizzi, Vittorio Giovannetti", "title": "A Perturbative Approach to Continuous-Time Quantum Error Correction", "comments": "14 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this\ninterpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different\n\"topological spin\" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct\nparticles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the\nexistence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particular\nthe ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximal\nanalytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr-Newman\nspacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, \"zero-gravity\" means the limit $G\\to\n0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel\ninterpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be\ncapable of describing both the electron and the positron in \"external\" fields\nin many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a\nsingle position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were a\ntwo-particle equation! A Dirac equation is formulated for a ring-like\nbi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere in\nthe topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ring\nbi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-Broglie-Bohm type law extracted\nfrom the Dirac equation. As an application, the pertinent general-relativistic\nzero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr-Newman\nmagnetic moment be identified with the so-called \"anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe physical electron,\" not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is\nonly a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 23:04:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 May 2015 16:00:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 17:58:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:05:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 02:37:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kiessling", "M.

Generally, the\ndescribed approach provides a viable route to exploring quantum magnetism with\ndynamically tuneable (an)isotropic interactions as well as variable space- and\nspin-dimensions in cold-atom experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Nov 2014 10:07:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2015 09:55:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["van Bijnen", "R.

The standard\nform of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons)\nmove in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials.\nWhen a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase,\nwhich can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with\nitself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has\nquasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter\nfringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the\nelectric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB\neffect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell,\nand potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar AB\neffect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region\nbut subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system\nwill not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB\nexperiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a\nspatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal\ninterference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are\nnon-classical. We present two versions of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal\ninterferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical shell with a\ntime-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the\natomic spectrum acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical\nshell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally varying with time.

Tunneling has been hypothesized\nas an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we present the\nfirst experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum\ntunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer. We develop a\ntheoretical model based on a NIBA Quantum Master Equation to describe the\nmultiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise\ncharacteristics of such quantum devices.

The quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global\nminimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum.\nIn our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of\nqubit clusters with strong intra-cluster coupling. We show that the collective\neffect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the \"critical\" phase during\nthe evolution where quantum tunneling \"decides\" the right path to solution. In\na later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the\nsolution state.

As an example, the\nsemi-relativistic oscillator as a descriptive of the Landau levels for\nrelativistic electron in magnetic field is solved as an $f$-oscillator. By\nusing dispersion relation for $q$-oscillator we solve the linear\nq-Schr\\\"odinger equation and corresponding nonlinear complex q-Burgers\nequation.

A future fault-tolerant quantum computer\nwill use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the\ntwo parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit\nrepetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We\nconstruct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using\nancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating\nthree-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate\nstabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to\ncoherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits.\nWhile increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are\nrequired to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a\ncritical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 13:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rist\u00e8", "D.", ""], ["Poletto", "S.", ""], ["Huang", "M. -Z.", ""], ["Bruno", "A.", ""], ["Vesterinen", "V.", ""], ["Saira", "O. -P.", ""], ["DiCarlo", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.5546", "submitter": "Fabian Wolfgang G\\\"unter Transchel", "authors": "F.

The central\ntechnical contribution of the paper is a new uncertainty principle for the\nSchatten norm, which is based on the uniform convexity inequality of Ball,\nCarlen, and Lieb (Inventiones mathematicae, 115:463-482, 1994).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 20:47:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 22:49:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 17:22:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Carl A.", ""], ["Shi", "Yaoyun", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.6613", "submitter": "Uta Naether", "authors": "Uta Naether, Fernando Quijandr\\'ia, Juan Jos\\'e Garc\\'ia-Ripoll, and\n  David Zueco", "title": "Stationary discrete solitons in circuit QED", "comments": "10 pages including appendix, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this paper, we explore whether the\nedge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically,\nwe consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The\nunperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and\nentanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat\nand equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic\ncalculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the\neffective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement\ncut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and\nH_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk\ntopological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy\nspectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement\nthe Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance\nalong the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry\nenriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian\nspace in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model,\nwhose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT. This is achieved\nbecause the presence of the global symmetry implies that both Hamiltonians, in\naddition to being Z_2 symmetric, are Kramers-Wannier self-dual.

Numerical simulations of small systems suggest that the decay of the\ndensity in one dimension, in both the open quantum $A+A \\to \\varnothing$ and\n$A+A \\to A$ cases, may go asymptotically as $t^{-b}$ with $1/2 < b < 1$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 15:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["van Horssen", "Merlijn", ""], ["Garrahan", "Juan P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7925", "submitter": "David Sutter", "authors": "Joseph M.

Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular\ninput to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient\nto determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete\nmemoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the\nother. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is\ndirectly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which\nare essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast\nchannels.
