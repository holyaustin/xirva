Defined by\nanalogy to classical random walk, a quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum\nprocess on a graph. Both random and quantum walks can be defined either in\ncontinuous or discrete time. But whereas a continuous-time random walk can be\nobtained as the limit of a sequence of discrete-time random walks, the two\ntypes of quantum walk appear fundamentally different, owing to the need for\nextra degrees of freedom in the discrete-time case.\n  In this article, I describe a precise correspondence between continuous- and\ndiscrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs. Using this correspondence, I\nshow that continuous-time quantum walk can be obtained as an appropriate limit\nof discrete-time quantum walks. The correspondence also leads to a new\ntechnique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, giving efficient simulations\neven in cases where the Hamiltonian is not sparse. The complexity of the\nsimulation is linear in the total evolution time, an improvement over\nsimulations based on high-order approximations of the Lie product formula. As\napplications, I describe a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm for element\ndistinctness and show how to optimally simulate continuous-time query\nalgorithms of a certain form in the conventional quantum query model.

The atoms enter and exit the cavity at different times. Instead of\nusing constant coupling, we use time dependent couplings which represent the\nspatial dependence of the mode. Although the system evolution is adiabatic for\nmost of the time, a previously unstudied energy crossing plays a key role in\nthe system dynamics when the atoms have a time delay. We show that conditional\natom-cavity entanglement can be generated, while for large photon numbers the\nentangled system has a behaviour which can be mapped onto the single atom\nJaynes-Cummings model. Exploring the main features of this system we propose\nsimple and fairly robust methods for entangling atoms independently of the\ncavity, for quantum state mapping, and for implementing SWAP and C-NOT gates\nwith atomic qubits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 13:54:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lazarou", "C.", ""], ["Garraway", "B.

First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially\nsmall soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest\nprovers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use\narbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time\nhierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still\nadvantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use\nquantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round\ninteractive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query\nprobabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even\nagainst dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a\nconsequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap\nbetween completeness and soundness, in which each prover responds with only two\nbits. In other words, it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse-polynomial\nthe value of a classical two-prover one-round game, even when provers are\nentangled and each sends a two-bit answer to a verifier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 18:24:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Tsuyoshi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hirotada", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Keiji", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.0698", "submitter": "Kaveh Khodjasteh", "authors": "Kaveh Khodjasteh, Lorenza Viola", "title": "Dynamically Error-Corrected Gates for Universal Quantum Computation", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.Rev.Lett.102:080501,2009", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.080501", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Scalable quantum computation in realistic devices requires that precise\ncontrol can be implemented efficiently in the presence of decoherence and\noperational errors.

In previous works this approach has been\nused to derive upper bounds to fault tolerance thresholds - usually by\nidentifying a privileged resource, such as an entangling gate or a non-Clifford\noperation, and then deriving the noise levels required to make it\n`unprivileged'. In this work we consider extensions of this approach where\nnoise is added to Clifford gates too, and then `commuted' around until it\nconcentrates on attacking the non-Clifford resource. While commuting noise\naround is not always straightforward, we find that easy instances can be\nidentified in popular fault tolerance proposals, thereby enabling sharper upper\nbounds to be derived in these cases. For instance we find that if we take\nKnill's high threshold proposal together with the ability to prepare any\npossible state in the $XY$ plane of the Bloch sphere, then no more than 3.69%\nerror-per-gate noise is sufficient to make it classical, and 13.71% of Knill's\ngamma noise model is sufficient. These bounds have been derived without noise\nbeing added to the decoding parts of the circuits. Introducing such noise in a\ntoy example suggests that the present approach can be optimised further to\nyield tighter bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2008 20:34:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Plenio", "M.
