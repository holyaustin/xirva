We introduce two types of models: I) open, dimerized XX chains,\nand II) open XX chains with small end bonds. For both models we obtain the\nexact expressions for the end-to-end correlations and the scaling of the energy\ngap with the length of the chain. We determine the end-to-end concurrence and\nshow that model I) supports true long-distance entanglement at zero\ntemperature, while model II) supports {\\it ``quasi long-distance''}\nentanglement that slowly falls off with the size of the chain.

This enables to derive the renormalized\nquantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the\nform of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been\nused to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the\nCasimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for\nboundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld\nscenarios. This allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values of local\nphysical observables the parts corresponding to the geometry without boundaries\nand to present the boundary-induced parts in terms of integrals strongly\nconvergent for the points away from the boundaries. As a result, the\nrenormalization procedure for these observables is reduced to the corresponding\nprocedure for bulks without boundaries. The present paper reviews these\nresults.

This paper explores the experimentally relevant\nrange of measurement strategies between the two, where the rate of inconclusive\nresults is minimized for a bounded-error rate. We first provide some\nconstraints on the problem that apply to generalized measurements (POVMs). We\nthen provide the theory for the optimal projective measurement (PVM) in this\nrange. Through analytical and numerical results we investigate this family of\nprojective, bounded-error strategies and compare it to the POVM family as well\nas to experimental implementation of UD using POVMs. We also discuss a possible\napplication of these bounded-error strategies to quantum key distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2007 17:13:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2007 20:44:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Touzel", "M.

The crossover is\ncharacterized by collective effects. Here, the conductance is plateau-like\nenhanced in some energy regions of finite length while corridors with zero\ntransmission (total reflection) appear in other energy regions. This\ntransmission picture depends only weakly on the spectrum of the closed system.\nIt is caused by the alignment of some resonance states of the system with the\npropagating modes $\\xi^E_C$ in the leads. The alignment of resonance states\ntakes place stepwise by resonance trapping, i.e. it is accompanied by the\ndecoupling of other resonance states from the continuum of propagating modes.\nThis process is quantitatively described by the phase rigidity $\\rho$ of the\nscattering wave function. Averaged over energy in the considered energy window,\n$<G>$ is correlated with $1-<\\rho>$. In the regime of strong coupling, only two\nshort-lived resonance states survive each aligned with one of the channel wave\nfunctions $\\xi^E_C$. They may be identified with traveling modes through the\nsystem. The remaining $M-2$ trapped narrow resonance states are well separated\nfrom one another.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Aug 2007 14:56:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2007 14:27:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bulgakov", "E.

Quantum\nstates of an elementary particle due to such a weak field is certainly very\nshallow and would therefore be an experimental challenge to detect. Recently an\nexperimental attempt was made by V. V. Nesvizhevsky et al., Nature 415, 297\n(2002), to measure the quantum states of a neutron, which shows that ground\nstate and few excited states are \\sim 10^{-12}eV. We show that the energy of\nthe ground state of a neutron confined above Earth's surface should be \\sim\n10^{-37}eV. The experimentally observed energy levels are 10^{25} times deeper\nthan the actual energy levels it should be and thus certainly not due to\ngravitational effect of Earth. Therefore the correct interpretation for the\npainstaking experimental results of Ref. \\cite{nes1} is due to the confinement\npotential of a one dimensional box of length L \\sim 50\\mu m, generated from the\nexperimental setup as commented before \\cite{hansoon}. Our results thus creates\na new challenge to the experimentalist to resolve the shallow energy levels of\nthe neutron in Earth's gravitational field in future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2007 12:57:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Aug 2007 14:18:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Giri", "Pulak Ranjan", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.2657", "submitter": "Daniel Burgarth", "authors": "Daniel Burgarth, Vittorio Giovannetti", "title": "Mediated Homogenization", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
