In\nfinite-length chains, the interplay between disorder-induced localization and\ndecoherence yields a natural optimal channel fidelity, which we calculate.\nLong-range dipolar couplings induce a finite intrinsic lifetime for the\nmediating eigenmode; extensive numerical simulations of dipolar chains of\nlengths up to L=12 show remarkably high fidelity despite these decay processes.\nWe further consider the extension of the protocol to bosonic systems of coupled\noscillators.

While this dramatically increases the number of qubits\navailable, the composite operations required to manipulate \"dark\" spin qubits\nsignificantly raise the error threshold for robust operation.

Including the second perturbation at $t=\\tau$, we find\ntemporally localized responses, revival echoes, both before and after $t\\approx\nmT_x$, e.g., at $t\\approx m T_x-n \\tau$ (pre-revival echoes) and at $t\\approx\nmT_x+n\\tau$, (post-revival echoes), where $m$ and $n$ are $1,2,...$ .

In the early 80s researchers began to\nask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of\na classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of\ncomputation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel\ncryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication.

Even apart from the existence of these devices,\nthe quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight\ninto the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of\nthe physics of our universe and its connections with computation.\n  We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of\na quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of\na number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and\nhighlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena\ndescribed were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics.

For defining\ninertial mass of a particle we need to know its acceleration under some force\nin an inertial reference frame, which itself is defined by the motion of its\nbackground objects.

But the background of a particle keeps on fluctuating randomly due to\ndifferent physical phenomenon in the universe.

This simple gate often plays an important role in quantum\ninformation theory, typically in situations for which Pauli and Clifford gates\nare insufficient. Most notably, when it supplements the set of Clifford gates\nthen universal quantum computation can be achieved. The \"pi-over-eight\" gate is\nthe simplest example of an operation from the third level of the Clifford\nhierarchy (i.e., it maps Pauli operations to Clifford operations under\nconjugation). Here we derive explicit expressions for all qudit (d-level, where\nd is prime) versions of this gate and analyze the resulting group structure\nthat is generated by these diagonal gates. This group structure differs\ndepending on whether the dimensionality of the qudit is two, three or greater\nthan three. We then discuss the geometrical relationship of these gates (and\nassociated states) with respect to Clifford gates and stabilizer states. We\npresent evidence that these gates are maximally robust to depolarizing and\nphase damping noise, in complete analogy with the qubit case. Motivated by this\nand other similarities we conjecture that these gates could be useful for the\ntask of qudit magic-state distillation and, by extension, fault-tolerant\nquantum computing.

Most calculations of eta_{crit} assume that\nthe noise is random and can be modeled as white noise. However, most sources\nsuffer from colored noise. Indeed, since entangled states are usually created\nas a superposition of two possible deexcitation paths, a partial\ndistinguishability between the two processes leads to the appearance of colored\nnoise in the generated state. Recently, there was a proposal for a\nloophole-free Bell test [A. Cabello and F. Sciarrino, Phys. Rev.

Here we obtain eta_{crit}, the optimal quantum\nstates, and the local settings for a loophole-free Bell test as a function of\nthe amount of colored noise.

Based on the GHZ paradox arising from a GHZ graph, we derive a Bell\ninequality with two $d$-outcome observables for each observer, whose maximal\nviolation attained by the corresponding graph state, and a Kochen-Specker\ninequality testing the quantum contextuality in a state-independent fashion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 05:22:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 20:31:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Weidong", ""], ["Yu", "Sixia", ""], ["Oh", "C.

This special class has attracted strong interest\nvery recently. The communication cost of each derived simulation is given by\nthe mutual information between the quantum state and the classical state of the\nparent hidden variable theory. Finally, we find that the communication\ncomplexity for single qubits is smaller than 1.28 bits.

An exemplary Gedanken experiment, emphasizing such a\nmeasurement-dependent nature, was suggested by Wheeler using single photons.\nThe subtleness of the idea lies in the fact that the output beam-splitter of a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer is put in or removed after a photon has already\nentered the interferometer, thus performing a delayed test of the wave-particle\ncomplementary behavior. Recently, it was proposed that using a quantum analogue\nof the output beam-splitter would permit carrying out this type of test after\nthe detection of the photon and observing wave-particle superposition. In this\npaper we describe an experimental demonstration of these predictions using\nanother extraordinary property of quantum systems, entanglement. We use a pair\nof polarization entangled photons composed of one photon whose nature (wave or\nparticle) is tested, and of a corroborative photon that allows determining\nwhich one, or both, of these two aspects is being tested. This corroborative\nphoton infers the presence or absence of the beam-splitter and until it is\nmeasured, the beam-splitter is in a superposition of these two states, making\nit a quantum beam-splitter. When the quantum beam-splitter is in the state\npresent or absent, the interferometer reveals the wave or particle nature of\nthe test photon, respectively. Furthermore, by manipulating the corroborative\nphoton, we can continuously morph, via entanglement, the test photon from wave\nto particle behavior even after it was detected.

In contrast, quantum theory provides an effective\ndescription of physics at small length scales. Direct tests of quantum theory\nhave been performed at the smallest probeable scales at the Large Hadron\nCollider, ${\\sim} 10^{-20}$ meters, up to that of hundreds of kilometers.

Finally, we propose\nmeasurements of the quasiparticle residue and the average number of phonons in\nthe ground state, experimental probes validating the polaronic character of the\nphonon-dressed excitation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 13:04:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 22:10:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Stojanovic", "Vladimir M.", ""], ["Shi", "Tao", ""], ["Bruder", "C.", ""], ["Cirac", "J.

The magnetic moments are associated to 3d electrons which interact\nwith conduction band electrons and with phonons. We study each interaction\nseparately and then collect the results assuming that the electron-phonon\ninteraction can be neglected. For the case of the spin-phonon interaction, we\nstudy the derivation of the equations of motion for the classical spin vector\nand find that the correct behaviour, as given by the Brown equation for the\nspin vector and the Bloch equation, using the results obtained by D. A. Garanin\nfor the average over fluctuations of the spin vector, can be obtained in the\nhigh temperature limit. At finite temperatures we show that the Markovian\napproximation for the fluctuations is not correct for time scales below some\nthermal correlation time $\\tau_{Th}$. For the case of electrons we workout a\nperturbative expansion of the Feynman-Vernon functional. We find the expression\nfor the random field correlation function. The composite model (as well as the\nindividual models) is shown to satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation theorem for\nall temperature regimes if the behaviour of the coupling constants of the\nphonon-spin interaction remains unchanged with the temperature. The equations\nof motion are derived.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 18:26:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mera", "B.", ""], ["Vieira", "V.
