These\nrequirements and their justification are fully discussed. In the second\nquantisation approach used, both the system and the sub-systems are modes (or\nsets of modes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different\noccupancies of the modes. The definition of entangled states is based on first\ndefining the non-entangled states - after specifying which modes constitute the\nsub-systems. This paper mainly focuses on two mode entanglement for massive\nbosons. Several inequalities involving variances and mean values of operators\ninvolving mode annihilation, creation operators have been proposed as tests for\ntwo mode entangled states, including the inequalities that define spin\nsqueezing. Spin squeezing criteria in two mode systems are examined, and spin\nsqueezing is best considered for principle spin operator components where the\ncovariance matrix is diagonal. It is shown that the presence of spin squeezing\nin at least one of the spin components requires entanglement of the relevant\npair of modes. Several of the other proposed tests for entanglement, including\nones based on the sum of the variances for two spin components are considered.\nAll of the tests are still valid when the present concept of entanglement based\non the symmetrisation and super-selection rule criteria is applied, but further\ntests have been obtained here.

This is because the effect\nof the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large\ndispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling. This causes the\nspatio-temporal asymmetry, which is necessary for ratchet current, to be weak,\nand as a result, the net current is suppressed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2013 04:38:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kato", "Akihito", ""], ["Tanimura", "Yoshitaka", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.1458", "submitter": "Martin G\\\"arttner", "authors": "Martin G\\\"arttner and J\\\"org Evers", "title": "Non-linear absorption and density dependent dephasing in Rydberg\n  EIT-media", "comments": "10 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We consider the decay of a light\nscalar field with mass $M\\ll H$ with a cubic coupling in de Sitter space-time.\nRadiative corrections feature an infrared enhancement manifest as poles in\n$\\Delta=M^2/3H^2$ and we obtain the quantum state in an expansion in $\\Delta$.\nTo leading order in $\\Delta$ the pure state density matrix describing the decay\nof a particle with sub-horizon wavevector is dominated by the emission of\nsuperhorizon quanta, describing \\emph{entanglement between superhorizon and\nsubhorizon fluctuations and correlations across the horizon}. Tracing over the\nsuperhorizon degrees of freedom yields a mixed state density matrix from which\nwe obtain the entanglement entropy. Asymptotically this entropy grows with the\n\\emph{physical} volume as a consequence of more modes of the decay products\ncrossing the Hubble radius. A generalization to localized wave packets is\nprovided. The cascade decay of single particle states into many particle states\nis discussed. We conjecture on \\emph{possible} impact of these results on\nnon-gaussianity and on the ``low multipole anomalies'' of the CMB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2013 21:11:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Mar 2014 21:05:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lello", "Louis", ""], ["Boyanovsky", "Daniel", ""], ["Holman", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.2443", "submitter": "Stefan Natu", "authors": "Stefan S.

While the width of the wave packet may reach a stationary\nregime, its quantum trajectories converge exponentially in time to classical\ntrajectories.

Finally, we are led to\nconsider one more framework, with further restrictions on the finite fields,\nthat recovers a local transitive order and a locally-consistent notion of inner\nproduct with a new notion of cardinal probability. In this framework,\nconventional quantum mechanics and quantum computation emerge locally (though\nnot globally) as the size of the underlying field increases. Interestingly, the\nframework allows one to choose separate finite fields for system description\nand for measurement: the size of the first field quantifies the resources\nneeded to describe the system and the size of the second quantifies the\nresources used by the observer. This resource-based perspective potentially\nprovides insights into quantitative measures for actual computational power,\nthe complexity of quantum system definition and evolution, and the independent\nquestion of the cost of the measurement process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2013 20:26:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Hanson", "Andrew J.", ""], ["Ortiz", "Gerardo", ""], ["Sabry", "Amr", ""], ["Tai", "Yu-Tsung", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3298", "submitter": "Jason Hogan", "authors": "Alex Sugarbaker, Susannah M.

In the Alice-Bob EPR paradigm, non-contextuality means that\nthe identity of Alice's spin (i.e., the probability space on which it is\ndefined as a random variable) is determined only by the axis \\alphai chosen by\nAlice, irrespective of Bob's axis \\betaj (and vice versa). Here, we study\ncontextual KPT models, with two properties: (1) Alice's and Bob's spins are\nidentified as Aij and Bij, even though their distributions are determined by,\nrespectively, \\alphai alone and \\betaj alone, in accordance with the\nno-signaling requirement; and (2) the joint distributions of the spins Aij,Bij\nacross all values of \\alphai,\\betaj are constrained by fixing distributions of\nsome subsets thereof. Of special interest among these subsets is the set of\nprobabilistic connections, defined as the pairs \\left(Aij,Aij'\\right) and\n\\left(Bij,Bi'j\\right) with \\alphai\\not=\\alphai' and \\betaj\\not=\\betaj' (the\nnon-contextuality assumption is obtained as a special case of connections, with\nzero probabilities of Aij\\not=Aij' and Bij\\not=Bi'j).

We show, however, that quantum-mechanical (QM)\nconstraints are special. No-forcing theorem says that if a set of probabilistic\nconnections is not compatible with correlations violating QM, then it is\ncompatible only with the classical-mechanical correlations.

The probability that Charlie's measurement succeeds depends\non how much information about the state Alice sent is left in the qubit after\nBob's measurement, and this information can be quantified by the overlap\nbetween the two possible states in which Bob's measurement leaves the qubit.\nThis paper is a first step toward developing a theory of nondestructive\nsequential quantum measurements, which could be useful in quantum communication\nschemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 May 2013 18:50:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 17:59:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bergou", "Janos", ""], ["Feldman", "Edgar", ""], ["Hillery", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4325", "submitter": "Shu Tanaka", "authors": "Issei Sato, Shu Tanaka, Kenichi Kurihara, Seiji Miyashita, and Hiroshi\n  Nakagawa", "title": "Quantum Annealing for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models with Applications\n  to Network Clustering", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures, accepted in Neurocomputing", "journal-ref": "Neurocomputing, Vol. 121, 523 (2013)", "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2013.05.019", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech quant-ph stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We developed a new quantum annealing (QA) algorithm for Dirichlet process\nmixture (DPM) models based on the Chinese restaurant process (CRP).

The observable value as a function of the\nfield constitutes a quantum control landscape. Previous works have shown, under\nspecified conditions, that the quantum control landscape should be free of\nsuboptimal critical points. This favorable landscape topology is one factor\ncontributing to the efficiency of climbing the landscape. An additional,\ncomplementary factor is the landscape \\textit{structure}, which constitutes all\nnon-topological features. If the landscape's structure is too complex, then\nclimbs may be forced to take inefficient convoluted routes to finding optimal\ncontrols. This paper provides a foundation for understanding control landscape\nstructure by examining the linearity of gradient-based optimization\ntrajectories through the space of control fields. For this assessment, a metric\n$R\\geq 1$ is defined as the ratio of the path length of the optimization\ntrajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial control field and the\nresultant optimal control field that takes an observable from the bottom to the\ntop of the landscape. Computational analyses for simple model quantum systems\nare performed to ascertain the relative abundance of nearly straight control\ntrajectories encountered when optimizing a state-to-state transition\nprobability. The collected results indicate that quantum control landscapes\nhave very simple structural features. The favorable topology and the\ncomplementary simple structure of the control landscape provide a basis for\nunderstanding the generally observed ease of optimizing a state-to-state\ntransition probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 May 2013 22:57:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Nanduri", "Arun", ""], ["Donovan", "Ashley", ""], ["Ho", "Tak-San", ""], ["Rabitz", "Herschel", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4695", "submitter": "W.

Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism (KZM). By contrast, distribution of individual vortices with randomly\nassigned topological charges would result in the dispersion of W scaling with\nthe square root of the area inside C. Scaling of the dispersion of W and of the\nprobability of detection of non-zero W with C can be also studied for loops so\nsmall that non-zero windings are rare. In this case I show a doubling of the\nscaling of dispersion with C when compared to the scaling of dispersion in the\nlarge W regime. Moreover, probability of trapping of a non-zero W becomes, in\nthis case, proportional to the area subtended by C (hence, to the square of\ncircumference). This quadruples, as compared with large winding numbers regime,\nthe exponent in the power law dependence of the frequency of trapping of W=+1\nor W=-1 on C. Such change of the power law exponent by a FACTOR OF FOUR implies\nquadrupling of the scaling of the frequency of winding number trapping with the\nquench rate, and is of key importance for experimental tests of KZM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2013 02:34:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 20:51:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zurek", "Wojciech H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4706", "submitter": "Craig Clark", "authors": "Craig R.

We make no additional\nassumptions nor introduce extra ingredients, as is often done in alternative\nquantum theories. When the quantum matter field is projected to a one-particle\nstate, the master equation for a non-relativistic quantum particle in a weak\ngravitational field predicts decoherence in the energy basis, in contrast to\nmost existing theories of gravitational decoherence. We point out the gauge\nnature of time and space reparameterizations in matter-gravity couplings, and\nwarn that `intrinsic' decoherence or alternative quantum theories invoking\nstochastic dynamics arising from temporal or spatial fluctuations violate this\nfundamental symmetry of classical general relativity. Interestingly we find\nthat the decoherence rate depends on extra parameters other than the Planck\nscale, an important feature of gravitational decoherence. This is similar to\nthe dependence of the decoherence rate of a quantum Brownian particle to the\ntemperature and spectral density of the environment it interacts with. The\ncorresponding features when gravity acts as an environment in decohering\nquantum objects are what we call the `textures' of spacetime. We point out the\nmarked difference between the case when gravity is represented as a background\nspacetime versus the case when gravity acts like a thermodynamic bath to\nquantum particles.

The second law applies to systems composed of many particles\ninteracting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics\nin the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a\nheat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we\nfind that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second\nlaw for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the\nmacroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state\ntransformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In\nparticular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional\none, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are\nthree regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state\ntransitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can\ncause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of\nembezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its\noriginal state.

In atomic systems, where interactions\nrequire wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be\nrealized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to\nnearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the\nabsence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent\nspin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects\nof dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited\nto the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of\ndipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We\nrealize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared\nand probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the\nresonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules. We\nobserve clear oscillations in the evolution of the spin coherence in addition\nto an overall decay. The frequency of these oscillations, the strong dependence\nof the spin coherence time on the lattice filling, and the effect of a\nmulti-pulse sequence designed to reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange\ninteractions all provide evidence of dipolar interactions. We also demonstrate\nsuppression of loss in weak lattices due to a quantum Zeno mechanism.\nMeasurements of these tunneling-induced losses allow us to independently\ndetermine the lattice filling factor.

This non-locality allows\nusers to transfer, in effect, locally accessible energy between sites of\ndifferent system components by LOCC (local operations and classical\ncommunication). Quantum energy teleportation is a three-step LOCC protocol,\naccomplished without an external energy carrier, for effectively transferring\nenergy between two physically separated, but correlated, sites. We apply this\nLOCC teleportation protocol to a model Heisenberg spin particle pair initially\nin a quantum thermal Gibbs state, making temperature an explicit parameter. We\nfind in this setting that energy teleportation is possible at any temperature,\neven at temperatures above the threshold where the particles' entanglement\nvanishes. This shows for Gibbs spin states that entanglement is not\nfundamentally necessary for energy teleportation; correlation other than\nentanglement can suffice. Dissonance---quantum correlation in separable\nstates---is in this regard shown to be a quantum resource for energy\nteleportation, more dissonance being consistently associated with greater\nenergy yield. We compare energy teleportation from particle A to B in Gibbs\nstates with direct local energy extraction by a general quantum operation on B\nand find a temperature threshold below which energy extraction by a local\noperation is impossible. This threshold delineates essentially two regimes: a\nhigh temperature regime where entanglement vanishes and the teleportation\ngenerated by other quantum correlations yields only vanishingly little energy\nrelative to local extraction and a second low-temperature teleportation regime\nwhere energy is available at B only by teleportation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 May 2013 20:19:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 16:04:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Frey", "Michael", ""], ["Gerlach", "Karl", ""], ["Hotta", "Masahiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.5869", "submitter": "Andrew Ludlow", "authors": "N.

Theoretical estimates show that the tunneling should be\nhighly coherent but too fast to be measured by any conventional techniques. Our\napproach is instead to measure the time-averaged charge distribution of our\ndangling-bond pair by a capacitively coupled atomic-force-microscope tip in the\npresence of both a surface-parallel electrostatic potential bias between the\ntwo dangling bonds and a tunable midinfrared laser capable of inducing Rabi\noscillations in the system. With a nonresonant laser, the time-averaged charge\ndistribution in the dangling-bond pair is asymmetric as imposed by the bias.\nHowever, as the laser becomes resonant with the coherent electron tunneling in\nthe biased pair the theory predicts that the time-averaged charge distribution\nbecomes symmetric. This resonant symmetry effect should not only reveal the\ntunneling rate, but also the nature and rate of decoherence of single-electron\ndynamics in our system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2013 04:00:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 17:26:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shaterzadeh-Yazdi", "Zahra", ""], ["Livadaru", "Lucian", ""], ["Taucer", "Marco", ""], ["Mutus", "Josh", ""], ["Pitters", "Jason", ""], ["Wolkow", "Robert A.", ""], ["Sanders", "Barry C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6366", "submitter": "Linping Huai", "authors": "Lin-Ping Huai, Bo Li, Shi-Xian Qu, Heng Fan", "title": "Quantum advantage by weak measurements", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures, comments are welcome", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Weak measurements may result in extra quantity of quantumness of correlations\ncompared with standard projective measurement on a bipartite quantum state.

These results can act as a\ndirect guide for the generation of large-scale entanglement in such\nexperiments, towards a regime where the entanglement growth can render existing\nclassical simulations inefficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 17:41:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2013 23:56:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Schachenmayer", "J.", ""], ["Lanyon", "B.

A three-dimensional gapped lattice spin model is found\nwhich demonstrates for the first time that a reliable quantum memory at finite\ntemperature is possible, at least to some extent. When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological\nquantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales\nexponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,\nin which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are\nimmobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the\nHamiltonian. The degeneracy of the ground state, though also insensitive to\nperturbations, is a complicated number-theoretic function of the system size,\nand the system bifurcates into multiple noninteracting copies of itself under\nreal-space renormalization group transformations. The degeneracy, the\nexcitations, and the renormalization group flow can be analyzed using a\nframework that exploits the spin model's symmetry and some associated free\nresolutions of modules over polynomial algebras.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 23:18:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Haah", "Jeongwan", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6994", "submitter": "Konstantin Dorfman", "authors": "Konstantin E.

Here we address the question of\nhow the mean-field description is modified in the presence of a complex-valued\nparticle interaction term for a Bose-Hubbard dimer. We derive the mean-field\nequations of motion leading to nonlinear dissipative Bloch dynamics, related to\na nontrivial complex generalisation of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nThe resulting dynamics are analysed in detail. It is shown that depending on\nthe parameter values there can be up to six stationary states, and for small\nvalues of the interaction strength there are limit cycles. Furthermore, we show\nhow a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a complex interaction term can be derived\nas the mean-field approximation of a Bose-Hubbard dimer with an additional\nLindblad term modelling two-particle losses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 16:51:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 21:58:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Graefe", "Eva-Maria", ""], ["Liverani", "Chiara", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7188", "submitter": "Ram\\'on L\\'opez-Pe\\~na Dr.", "authors": "S.

The operation time does not increase with the number of cavities,\nand there is no need of applying classic pulses during the entire operation.\nMoreover, the approach can be also applied to realize quantum state exchange or\ntransfer between two sets of qubits, such as that between two multi-qubit\nquantum registers.

It is known that for a bipartite system of\nparticles $1,2$ with a Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$,\na UE exists when $\\min{(d_1,d_2)}\\geq 3$ and $(d_1,d_2)\\neq (3,3)$. It is also\nknown that whenever a UE exists, almost all unitaries are UEs; however to\nverify whether a given unitary is a UE is very difficult since solving a\nquadratic system of equations is NP-hard in general. This work examines the\nexistence and construction of UEs of bipartite bosonic/fermionic systems whose\nwave functions sit in the symmetric/antisymmetric subspace of\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$. The development of a theory of UEs for\nthese types of systems needs considerably different approaches from that used\nfor UEs of distinguishable systems. This is because the general entanglement of\nidentical particle systems cannot be discussed in the usual way due to the\neffect of (anti)-symmetrization which introduces \"pseudo entanglement\" that is\ninaccessible in practice. We show that, unlike the distinguishable particle\ncase, UEs exist for bosonic/fermionic systems with Hilbert spaces which are\nsymmetric (resp. antisymmetric) subspaces of\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d}$ if and only if $d\\geq 3$ (resp. $d\\geq\n8$). To prove this we employ algebraic geometry to reason about the different\nalgebraic structures of the bosonic/fermionic systems. Additionally, due to the\nrelatively simple coherent state form of unentangled bosonic states, we are\nable to give the explicit constructions of two bosonic UEs. Our investigation\nprovides insight into the entanglement properties of systems of\nindisitinguishable particles, and in particular underscores the difference\nbetween the entanglement structures of bosonic, fermionic and distinguishable\nparticle systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 17:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Klassen", "Joel", ""], ["Chen", "Jianxin", ""], ["Zeng", "Bei", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7490", "submitter": "Zahra Shadman", "authors": "Zahra Shadman, Hermann Kampermann, Chiara Macchiavello, Dagmar Bruss", "title": "A review on super dense coding over covariant noisy channels", "comments": "11 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1107.3591", "journal-ref": "Quantum Measurements and Quantum Metrology, Volume 1, pp. 21-33\n  (2013)", "doi": "10.2478/qmetro-2013-0004", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the performance of the super dense coding protocol in the presence\nof quantum channels with covariant noise.

We show\nthat these advantages are offset by a potential reduction in coherence time due\nto the non-uniformity of the magnetic field experienced by a nuclear-spin bath\ninteracting with the spin qubit. We theoretically study spins confined to\nquantum dots or at single donor impurities, considering both free-induction and\nspin-echo decay. For quantum dots in GaAs, we find that, in a realistic\nsetting, a magnetic-field gradient can reduce the Hahn-echo coherence time by\nalmost an order of magnitude. This problem can, however, be resolved by\napplying a moderate external magnetic field to enter a motional averaging\nregime. For quantum dots in silicon, we predict a cross-over from non-Markovian\nto Markovian behavior that is unique to these devices. Finally, for very small\nsystems such as single phosphorus donors in silicon, we predict a breakdown of\nthe common Gaussian approximation due to finite-size effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 19:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Mar 2014 18:22:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Beaudoin", "F\u00e9lix", ""], ["Coish", "W.
