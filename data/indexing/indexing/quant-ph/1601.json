In a sense, QM therefore\nhas the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to\nderive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,\nphilosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated\nepistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on\nentities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like\nknowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the\npotential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges\nfrom this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities\nare defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means\nthat the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of\ndescription, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These\nelements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.\nThe evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution\nof the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase\nspace. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in\n\\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\\rightarrow n+1$ each\ntime an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes.

Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 14:57:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 12:06:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2016 15:22:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["\u0160upi\u0107", "Ivan", ""], ["Hoban", "Matty J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01554", "submitter": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Grosshans", "authors": "Ruben Y.

They have been used to construct\nexplicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator\nreconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models\nnaturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk\ncorrelation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling\ndimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small\nnumber of low-dimension operators and the rest.

Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation\nwe show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the\nexcited atomic and light modes.

The quantitative\ndetermination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue\nin a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to\nquantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here,\nwe establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the\ndopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface\ndopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM\nimages of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in\nordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip\norbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We\ndemonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the\nfirst where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second\ncontaining randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement\nbetween STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise\nlattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology\nworks to depths of about 36 lattice planes. The ability to uniquely determine\nthe exact positions of sub-surface dopants down to depths of 5 nm will provide\ncritical knowledge in the design and optimisation of nanoscale devices for both\nclassical and quantum computing applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 05:30:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Usman", "Muhammad", ""], ["Bocquel", "Juanita", ""], ["Salfi", "Joe", ""], ["Voisin", "Benoit", ""], ["Tankasala", "Archana", ""], ["Rahman", "Rajib", ""], ["Simmons", "Michelle Y.", ""], ["Rogge", "Sven", ""], ["Hollenberg", "Lloyd L.

For enhanced mechanical\ndisplacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the\nphoton counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor.

Using a microwave cavity optomechanical\nsystem, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily\naccompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying\nboth the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental\ntrade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance\nwith the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement\nis further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the\nmechanical motion.

In this paper, we evaluate the one-way\ndeficit of two adjacent spins in the bulk for the XX model. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the XX model undergoes a first order transition from fully\npolarized to a critical phase with quasi-long-range order with decrease of\nquantum parameter. We find that the one-way deficit becomes nonzero after the\ncritical point. Therefore, the one-way deficit characterizes the quantum phase\ntransition in the XX model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 07:13:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yao-Kun", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.02765", "submitter": "Juliane Klatt", "authors": "Juliane Klatt, Robert Bennett, and Stefan Yoshi Buhmann", "title": "Spectroscopic signatures of quantum friction", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a\ncomparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA\nefficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of\nthis spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the\ngrowing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of\ntunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over\nclassical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling.

The pair-eigenstates exhibit numerous\nintersections, which become avoided for pair-eigenstates comprised of\nindividual states that meet the selection rules $\\Delta J_{i}=0,\\pm 1$, $\\Delta\nN_{i}=0,\\pm 2$, and $\\Delta M_{i}=0,\\pm 1$ imposed by the electric\ndipole-dipole operator. Here $J_{i}$, $N_{i}$ and $M_{i}$ are the total,\nrotational and projection angular momentum quantum numbers of molecules $i=1,2$\nin the absence of the electric dipole-dipole interaction. We evaluate the\nmutual alignment of the pair-eigenstates and find it to be independent of the\nmagnetic field, except for states that undergo avoided crossings, in which case\nthe alignment of the interacting states is interchanged at the magnetic field\ncorresponding to the crossing point. We present an analytic model which\nprovides ready estimates of the pairwise alignment cosine that characterises\nthe mutual alignment of the coupled rotors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 10:14:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 11:12:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Ketan", ""], ["Friedrich", "Bretislav", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.04864", "submitter": "Alessandro Bisio", "authors": "Alessandro Bisio, Giulio Chiribella, Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano, and Paolo\n  Perinotti", "title": "Quantum Networks: general theory and applications", "comments": "118 pages, review article", "journal-ref": "Acta Physica Slovaca 61, No.3, 273-390 (2011)", "doi": "10.2478/v10155-011-0003-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we present a general mathematical framework to deal with Quantum\nNetworks, i.e. networks resulting from the interconnection of elementary\nquantum circuits.

Firstly, we highlight the\nsimilarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional\ninterpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's\ntransactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement\ninterpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry\nbreaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of\nincipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain\nwhy the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born\nrule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a\nquantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure\nstate to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently\nderived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI\n- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative\ndescription of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden\nmeasurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of\nthe values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of\nprobabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide\nthe missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,\nEBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific\nnotion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical\nmechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 10:05:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["de Bianchi", "Massimiliano Sassoli", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.05234", "submitter": "Max Strau{\\ss}", "authors": "M.

Three different kinds of important quantum\namplifications, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum amplification, probabilistic\nnoiseless quantum amplification, and deterministic noiseless quantum\namplification are identified and discussed. For deterministic quan- tum\namplification, the linearity of amplification is proven to be incompatible with\nthe noiseless amplification while it is not true for probabilistic quantum\namplification.

Particular interest is given to phase-preserving quantum\namplication of Gaussian states which has been shown of theoretical interest and\nof practical importance in quantum information and quantum communication\nrecently.

We generate photons with temporal durations varying over three orders of\nmagnitude up to 10 {\\mu}s without a significant change of the read-out\nefficiency. We prove the non-classicality of the emitted photons by measuring\ntheir antibunching, showing near single photon behavior at low excitation\nprobabilities. We also show that the photons are emitted in a pure state by\nmeasuring unconditional autocorrelation functions. Finally, to demonstrate the\nusability of the source for realistic applications, we create ultra-long single\nphotons with a rising exponential or doubly peaked wave shape which are\nimportant for several quantum information tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 19:35:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Farrera", "Pau", ""], ["Heinze", "Georg", ""], ["Albrecht", "Boris", ""], ["Ho", "Melvyn", ""], ["Ch\u00e1vez", "Mat\u00edas", ""], ["Teo", "Colin", ""], ["Sangouard", "Nicolas", ""], ["de Riedmatten", "Hugues", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07169", "submitter": "R.

The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from\nany reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement.\nThe combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer\nbetween the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is\ncontrolled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy\nsplitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter\nsplitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite\nvalue by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that\nthe oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to\nreadout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot\npotential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity\nparity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS,\nand that there is a tradeoff between required precisions of temporal and\nspatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus\nseparation would present a clear signature of topological order, and could be\nused to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement\nin certain schemes for scalable topological qubits.
