Of particular interest is a stochastic\napproach which involves (i) sampling from the free theory Gaussian\napproximation to the Wigner distribution in order to obtain stochastic initial\nconditions for the field and momentum conjugate, then (ii) evolving under the\nclassical field equations of motion, which leads to random bubble formation.\nPrevious work showed parametric agreement between the logarithm of the\ntunneling rate in this stochastic approach and the usual instanton\napproximation. However, recent work [1] claimed excellent agreement between\nthese methods. Here we show that this approach does not in fact match\nprecisely; the stochastic method tends to overpredict the instanton tunneling\nrate. To quantify this, we parameterize the standard deviations in the initial\nstochastic fluctuations by $\\epsilon \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the actual\nstandard deviation of the Gaussian distribution and $\\epsilon$ is a fudge\nfactor; $\\epsilon = 1$ is the physical value. We numerically implement the\nstochastic approach to obtain the bubble formation rate for a range of\npotentials in 1+1-dimensions, finding that $\\epsilon$ always needs to be\nsomewhat smaller than unity to suppress the otherwise much larger stochastic\nrates towards the instanton rates; for example, in the potential of [1] one\nneeds $\\epsilon \\approx 1/2$. We find that a mismatch in predictions also\noccurs when sampling from other Wigner distributions, and in single particle\nquantum mechanics even when the initial quantum system is prepared in an exact\nGaussian state. If the goal is to obtain agreement between the two methods, our\nresults show that the stochastic approach would be useful if a prescription to\nspecify optimal fudge factors for fluctuations can be developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2020 02:53:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hertzberg", "Mark P.", ""], ["Rompineve", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Shah", "Neil", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00019", "submitter": "Dong Yuan", "authors": "Dong Yuan, He-Ran Wang, Zhong Wang, Dong-Ling Deng", "title": "Solving the Liouvillian Gap with Artificial Neural Networks", "comments": "16 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

However, for methods\ncurrently used in quantum computing such as select configuration interaction\n(CI) and coupled cluster (CC) methods, it is necessary to have a virtual space\nthat is able to capture a significant amount of electron-electron correlation\nin the system. The virtual orbitals in a pseudopotential plane-wave\nHartree--Fock calculation, because of Coulomb repulsion, are often scattering\nstates that interact very weakly with the filled orbitals. As a result, very\nlittle correlation energy is captured from them. The use of virtual spaces\nderived from the one-electron operators have also been tried, and while some\ncorrelation is captured, the amount is quite low. To overcome these\nlimitations, we have been developing new classes of algorithms to define\nvirtual spaces by optimizing orbitals from small pairwise CI Hamiltonians,\nwhich we term as correlation optimized virtual orbitals with the abbreviation\nCOVOs.

Compared to contemporary\nallocation methods available in t|ket$\\rangle $ and Qiskit, the QUBO method\nyields allocations with improved circuit depth for $>$50% of a large set of\nbenchmark circuits, with many also requiring fewer CX gates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:06:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2020 22:09:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dury", "Bryan", ""], ["Di Matteo", "Olivia", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00159", "submitter": "David Davalos", "authors": "David Davalos", "title": "Divisibility classes of qubit maps and singular Gaussian channels", "comments": "PhD thesis, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

In the first\none we study quantum channels, which are the most general operations mapping\nquantum states into quantum states, from the point of view of their\ndivisibility properties. We introduced tools to test if a given quantum channel\ncan be implemented by a process described by a Lindblad master equation. This\nin turn defines channels that can be divided in such a way that they form a\none-parameter semigroup, thus introducing the most restricted studied\ndivisibility type of this work. Using our results, together with the study of\nother types of divisibility that can be found in the literature, we\ncharacterized the space of qubit quantum channels. We found interesting results\nconnecting the concept of entanglement-breaking channel and infinitesimal\ndivisibility. Additionally we proved that infinitely divisible channels are\nequivalent to the ones that are implementable by one-parameter semigroups,\nopening this question for more general channel spaces. In the second project we\nstudy the functional forms of one-mode Gaussian quantum channels in the\nposition state representation, beyond Gaussian functional forms. We perform a\nblack-box characterization using complete positivity and trace preserving\nconditions, and report the existence of two subsets that do not have a\nfunctional Gaussian form. The study covers as particular limit the case of\nsingular channels, thus connecting our results with the known classification\nscheme based on canonical forms. Our full characterization of Gaussian channels\nwithout Gaussian functional form is completed by showing how Gaussian states\nare transformed under these operations, and by deriving the conditions for the\nexistence of master equations for the non-singular cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 00:53:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Davalos", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00199", "submitter": "Hong-Fu Wang", "authors": "Lu Qi, Guo-Li Wang, Shutian Liu, Shou Zhang, and Hong-Fu Wang", "title": "Dissipation-induced topological phase transition and\n  periodic-driving-induced photonic topological state transfer in a small\n  optomechanical lattice", "comments": "11 pages, 10 figures, to appear in Frontiers of Physics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11467-020-0983-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a scheme to investigate the topological phase transition and the\ntopological state transfer based on the small optomechanical lattice under the\nrealistic parameters regime.

In this paper, we\nprovide a duality, which keeps entanglement spectrum invariant, in order to\ndiagnose quantum entanglement of non-Hermitian non-interacting fermionic\nsystems. We limit our attention to non-Hermitian systems with a complete set of\nbiorthonormal eigenvectors and an entirely real energy spectrum. The original\nsystem has a reduced density matrix $\\rho_\\mathrm{o}$ and the real space is\npartitioned via a projecting operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm o}$. After\ndualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix $\\rho_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and a\nnew real space projector $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm d}$. Remarkably, entanglement\nspectrum and entanglement entropy keep invariant. Inspired by the duality, we\ndefined two types of non-Hermitian models, upon $\\mathcal R_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is\ngiven. In type-I exemplified by the ``non-reciprocal model'', there exists at\nleast one duality such that $\\rho_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is Hermitian. In other words,\nentanglement information of type-I non-Hermitian models with a given\n$\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{o}}$ is entirely controlled by Hermitian models with\n$\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{d}}$. As a result, we are allowed to apply known results\nof Hermitian systems to efficiently obtain entanglement properties of type-I\nmodels. On the other hand, the duals of type-II models, exemplified by\n``non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model'', are always non-Hermitian. For the\npractical purpose, the duality provides a potentially \\textit{efficient}\ncomputation route to entanglement of non-Hermitian systems.

The basic circuit used consisted of operations to create a Bell State,\nfollowed by the inverse operations so as to return the qubits to their initial\nstate in the absence of errors (Hadamard + CNOT + barrier + CNOT + Hadamard).\nThe circuit depth was varied using multiples of this basic circuit. An\nasymmetry in the error of the final state was observed that increased with the\ncircuit depth. The strength and direction of the asymmetry was unique but\nrepeatable for each pair of coupled qubits tested. This observation suggests\nthat the asymmetry in CNOT implementation should be characterized for the\nqubits of interest and incorporated into circuit transpilation to obtain the\nbest accuracy for a particular computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2020 20:42:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hurant", "Travis", ""], ["Stancil", "Daniel D.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.01373", "submitter": "Alexander Teplukhin", "authors": "Alexander Teplukhin, Brian K.

At the level of\nstates, we show how several well-studied quantifiers of chaos are, in fact,\nquantum coherence measures in disguise (or closely related to them). We further\nthis connection for all quantum coherence measures by using tools from\nmajorization theory. Then, we numerically study the coherence of\nchaotic-vs-integrable eigenstates and find excellent agreement with random\nmatrix theory in the bulk of the spectrum. At the level of channels, we show\nthat the coherence-generating power (CGP) -- a measure of how much coherence a\ndynamical process generates on average -- emerges as a subpart of the\nout-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a measure of information scrambling in\nmany-body systems. Via numerical simulations of the (nonintegrable)\ntransverse-field Ising model, we show that the OTOC and CGP capture quantum\nrecurrences in quantitatively the same way. Moreover, using random matrix\ntheory, we analytically characterize the CGP-OTOC connection for the Haar and\nGaussian ensembles. In closing, we remark on how our coherence-based signatures\nof chaos relate to other diagnostics, namely the Loschmidt echo, OTOC, and the\nSpectral Form Factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Sep 2020 15:54:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 00:06:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 08:41:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Anand", "Namit", ""], ["Styliaris", "Georgios", ""], ["Kumari", "Meenu", ""], ["Zanardi", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.02801", "submitter": "Roie Dann", "authors": "Roie Dann, Ronnie Kosloff and Peter Salamon", "title": "Quantum finite-time thermodynamics: insight from a single qubit engine", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Entropy 2020, 22, 1255", "doi": "10.3390/e22111255", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Incorporating time into thermodynamics allows addressing the tradeoff between\nefficiency and power.

Second, we show that compatible\nmeasure-and-prepare channels (i.e., entanglement-breaking channels) do not\nnecessarily have a measure-and-prepare compatibilizing channel. Third, we\nextend the notion of the Jordan product of matrices to quantum channels and\npresent sufficient conditions for channel compatibility. These Jordan products\nand their generalizations might be of independent interest. Last, we formulate\nthe different notions of compatibility as semidefinite programs and numerically\ntest when families of partially dephasing-depolaring channels are compatible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Girard", "Mark", ""], ["Pl\u00e1vala", "Martin", ""], ["Sikora", "Jamie", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.03283", "submitter": "Pablo De La Hoz Iglesias", "authors": "P. de la Hoz, A.

When a\nsubsystem is singled out as reference - {\\it observer} - and another as {\\it\nclock}, two more continuous parameters arise, which can be interpreted as\ndistance and time. We identify the classical spacetime with parameter space of\nthe Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless.\nIn this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics\nin the Hilbert space into its parameter space.

Here, assuming nothing about\nthe laser operation, only that it produces a beam with certain properties close\nto those of an ideal laser beam, and that it does not have external sources of\ncoherence, we derive an upper bound: $\\mathfrak{C} = O(\\mu^4)$. Moreover, using\nthe matrix product states (MPSs) method [6,7,8,9], we find a model that\nachieves this scaling, and show that it could in principle be realised using\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) [10]. Thus $\\mathfrak{C} = O(\\mu^2)$ is\nonly a standard quantum limit (SQL); the ultimate quantum limit, or Heisenberg\nlimit, is quadratically better.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2020 08:57:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2020 12:59:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Baker", "Travis J.", ""], ["Saadatmand", "S.

Dynamical\nvariables are described by odd-grade (fermionic) and even-grade (bosonic)\nGrassmann matrices. Evolution takes place in Connes time. At energies much\nlower than Planck scale, trace dynamics reduces to quantum field theory. In the\npresent paper we explain that the correct understanding of spin requires us to\nformulate the theory in 8-D octonionic space. The automorphisms of the octonion\nalgebra, which belong to the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$, replace\nspace-time diffeomorphisms and internal gauge transformations, bringing them\nunder a common unified fold. Building on earlier work by other researchers on\ndivision algebras, we propose the Lorentz-weak unification at the Planck scale,\nthe symmetry group being the stabiliser group of the quaternions inside the\noctonions. This is one of the two maximal subgroups of $G_2$, the other one\nbeing $SU(3)$, the element preserver group of octonions. This latter group,\ncoupled with $U(1)_{em}$, describes the electro-colour symmetry, as shown\nearlier by Furey. We predict a new massless spin one boson [the Lorentz boson]\nwhich should be looked for in experiments. Our Lagrangian correctly describes\nthree fermion generations, through three copies of the group $G_2$, embedded in\nthe exceptional Lie group $F_4$. This is the unification group for the four\nfundamental interactions, and it also happens to be the automorphism group of\nthe exceptional Jordan algebra. Gravitation is shown to be an emergent\nclassical phenomenon. Whereas at the Planck scale, there is present a quantised\nversion of the Lorentz symmetry, mediated by the Lorentz boson.

This theory however is based on the algorithm\nof the scattering matrix where all participating particles are free in the\nremote past and in the remote future. We thus need, in addition, a\nLorentz-covariant theory of bound state which will address the question of how\nthe hydrogen atom would look to moving observers. The question is then whether\nthis Lorentz-covariant theory of bound states can be synthesized with the field\ntheory into a Lorentz-covariant quantum mechanics. This article reviews the\nprogress made along this line. This integrated Kant-Hegel process is\nillustrated in terms of the way in which Americans practice their democracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 04:56:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2020 09:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Y.

The central object in our approach is the\ninfluence matrix (IM), which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics\nof a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a\nself-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values\nof the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect\ndephaser (PD).

In the vicinity of PD\npoints, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a\nshort memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency\nequation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the IM\ntemporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS\ncomputations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in\nterms of an effective \"statistical-mechanics\" description.

Water outgassing rates were measured as a function of\ntime using the throughput technique. The water outgassing results for the 316L,\n316LN, 316L-XHV, 316LN-XHV were all similar, but lower than those of 304L by a\nfactor of 3 to 5 lower at 10^4 s.

It assumes two sets of states wherein any state in the\nfirst set can be coupled to any state in the second set but the states within\neach set are not coupled between themselves. Another important condition is the\ndegeneracy of the states in each set, although all couplings between the states\nfrom different sets can be detuned from resonance by the same detuning. The\ndegeneracy condition limits the application of the MS transformation in various\nphysically interesting situations, e.g. in the presence of electric and/or\nmagnetic fields or light shifts, which lift the degeneracy in each set of\nstates, e.g. when these sets comprise the magnetic sublevels of levels with\nnonzero angular momentum. This paper extends the MS transformation to such\nsituations, in which the states in each of the two sets are nondegenerate. To\nthis end, we develop an alternative way for the derivation of Morris-Shore\ntransformation, which can be applied to non-degenerate sets of states. We\npresent a generalized eigenvalue approach, by which, in the limit of small\ndetunings from degeneracy, we are able to generate an effective Hamiltonian\nthat is dynamically equivalent to the non-degenerate Hamiltonian.

Starting from clearly spelled-out\nassumptions, employing a framework of geometric background structures defining\nthe notion of a post-Newtonian expansion, our systematic approach allows to\nproperly derive the post-Newtonian coupling of quantum-mechanical systems to\ngravity based on first principles. This sets it apart from more heuristic\napproaches that are commonly employed, for example, in the description of\nquantum-optical experiments under gravity.\n  Regarding single particles, we compare simple canonical quantisation of a\nfree particle in curved spacetime to formal expansions of the minimally coupled\nKlein-Gordon equation, which may be motivated from QFT in curved spacetimes.\nSpecifically, we develop a general WKB-like post-Newtonian expansion of the KG\nequation to arbitrary order in $c^{-1}$. Furthermore, for stationary\nspacetimes, we show that the Hamiltonians arising from expansions of the KG\nequation and from canonical quantisation agree up to linear order in particle\nmomentum, independent of any expansion in $c^{-1}$.\n  Concerning composite systems, we perform a fully detailed systematic\nderivation of the first order post-Newtonian quantum Hamiltonian describing the\ndynamics of an electromagnetically bound two-particle system situated in\nexternal electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the latter being described\nby the Eddington-Robertson PPN metric.\n  In the last, independent part of the thesis, we prove two uniqueness results\ncharacterising the Newton--Wigner position observable for Poincar\\'e-invariant\nclassical Hamiltonian systems: one is a direct classical analogue of the\nquantum Newton--Wigner theorem, and the other clarifies the geometric\ninterpretation of the Newton--Wigner position as `centre of spin', as proposed\nby Fleming in 1965.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 18:03:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2020 14:26:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Schwartz", "Philip K.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.11324", "submitter": "Stefano Scali", "authors": "Stefano Scali, Janet Anders, Luis A.

Most practical devices are made up of interacting\nsub-system, and are often modelled using either local master equations (LMEs)\nor global master equations (GMEs). While the limiting cases in which either the\nLME or the GME breaks down are well understood, there exists a 'grey area' in\nwhich both equations capture steady-state heat currents reliably, but predict\nvery different transient heat flows. In such cases, which one should we trust?\nHere, we show that, when it comes to dynamics, the local approach can be more\nreliable than the global one for weakly interacting open quantum systems. This\nis due to the fact that the secular approximation, which underpins the GME, can\ndestroy key dynamical features. To illustrate this, we consider a minimal\ntransport setup and show that its LME displays exceptional points (EPs). These\nsingularities have been observed in a superconducting-circuit realisation of\nthe model [1]. However, in stark contrast to experimental evidence, no EPs\nappear within the global approach. We then show that the EPs are a feature\nbuilt into the Redfield equation, which is more accurate than the LME and the\nGME. Finally, we show that the local approach emerges as the weak-interaction\nlimit of the Redfield equation, and that it entirely avoids the secular\napproximation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 18:08:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:14:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Scali", "Stefano", ""], ["Anders", "Janet", ""], ["Correa", "Luis A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.11328", "submitter": "Yan Liu", "authors": "Ya Yang, Yan Liu, Jing Lu, Lan Zhou", "title": "Entanglement of Two Jaynes-Cummings Atoms In Single Excitation Space", "comments": "7 pages, 17 figures, conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1572-9494/abd0ea", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the entanglement dynamics of two atoms coupled to their own\nJaynes-Cummings cavities in single-excitation space.

This paper is a first step toward\naddressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs, which further require\nthe imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing\nadditional computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1+1 D\ncoupled to matter, a number of different formulations of the original\nKogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the dependence of the\ndimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system's size,\nand the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons.

For systems with\nconserved higher moments, we derive a field theory for the corresponding\nRK-Hamiltonian by proposing a generalized height field representation for the\nHilbert space of the effective spin chain. Using the field theory formulation,\nwe obtain the dispersion of the low-lying excitations of the RK-Hamiltonian in\nthe continuum limit, which allows us to extract $t_{\\mathrm{Th}}$. In\nparticular, we analytically argue that in a system of length $L$ that conserves\nthe $m^{th}$ multipole moment, $t_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ scales subdiffusively as\n$L^{2(m+1)}$. We also show that our formalism directly generalizes to higher\ndimensional circuits, and that in systems that conserve any component of the\n$m^{th}$ multipole moment, $t_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ has the same scaling with the\nlinear size of the system. Our work therefore provides a general approach for\nstudying spectral statistics in constrained many-body chaotic systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2020 17:59:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2021 23:45:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Moudgalya", "Sanjay", ""], ["Prem", "Abhinav", ""], ["Huse", "David A.", ""], ["Chan", "Amos", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.11864", "submitter": "Beilei Zhu", "authors": "Beilei Zhu, Vijay Pal Singh, Junichi Okamoto, Ludwig Mathey", "title": "Dynamical control of the conductivity of an atomic Josephson junction", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We then make\nuse of measurable operators to define the states of the network in a manner\nconsistent with a Markov process. This yields a Dirac-Von Neumann formulation\nconsistent with quantum mechanics. Moreover, the formulation presented here has\nthe advantage of having a computational efficiency devoid of the number of\nlayers in the network. This, paired with the natural efficiency of quantum\ncomputing, can imply a significant improvement in efficiency, particularly for\ndeep networks.

In this work, we\ndiscuss hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for skewed linear systems for\nover-determined and under-determined cases. Our input model is such that the\ncolumns or rows of the matrix defining the linear system are given via quantum\ncircuits of poly-logarithmic depth and the number of circuits is much smaller\nthan their Hilbert space dimension. Our algorithms have poly-logarithmic\ndependence on the dimension and polynomial dependence in other natural\nquantities. In addition, we present an algorithm for the special case of a\nfactorized linear system with run time poly-logarithmic in the respective\ndimensions. At the core of these algorithms is the Hadamard test and in the\nsecond part of this paper we consider the optimization of the circuit depth of\nthis test.

We\nprove a no-go theorem for learning an unknown scrambling process with QML,\nshowing that \\textit{any variational ansatz} is highly probable to have a\nbarren plateau landscape, i.e., cost gradients that vanish exponentially in the\nsystem size. \\new{This implies that the required resources scale exponentially\neven when strategies to avoid such scaling (e.g., from ansatz-based barren\nplateaus or No-Free-Lunch theorems) are employed.} Furthermore, we numerically\nand analytically extend our results to approximate scramblers. Hence, our work\nplaces generic limits on the learnability of unitaries when lacking prior\ninformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:31:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 May 2021 20:45:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Holmes", "Zo\u00eb", ""], ["Arrasmith", "Andrew", ""], ["Yan", "Bin", ""], ["Coles", "Patrick J.", ""], ["Albrecht", "Andreas", ""], ["Sornborger", "Andrew T.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14825", "submitter": "Natalia Ares", "authors": "V.

It offers many advantages in automating decision\nprocesses to navigate large parameter spaces. This paper proposes a novel\napproach to the efficient measurement of quantum devices based on deep\nreinforcement learning. We focus on double quantum dot devices, demonstrating\nthe fully automatic identification of specific transport features called bias\ntriangles. Measurements targeting these features are difficult to automate,\nsince bias triangles are found in otherwise featureless regions of the\nparameter space. Our algorithm identifies bias triangles in a mean time of less\nthan 30 minutes, and sometimes as little as 1 minute. This approach, based on\ndueling deep Q-networks, can be adapted to a broad range of devices and target\ntransport features. This is a crucial demonstration of the utility of deep\nreinforcement learning for decision making in the measurement and operation of\nquantum devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:55:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "V.", ""], ["Orbell", "S.
