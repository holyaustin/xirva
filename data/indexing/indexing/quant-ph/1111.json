CQED has\nrecently received renewed attention due to its implementation with\nsuperconducting artificial atoms and coplanar resonators in the so-called\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. In cQED, the couplings can\nbe much stronger than in CQED due to the design flexibility of superconducting\ncircuits and to the enhanced field confinement in one-dimensional cavities.\nThis enabled the realization of fundamental quantum physics and quantum\ninformation processing experiments with a degree of control comparable to that\nobtained in CQED.\n  The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the situation where the\nresonator to which the atom is coupled is made nonlinear with a Kerr-type\nnonlinearity, causing its energy levels to be nonequidistant. The system is\nthen described by a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This considerably\nenriches the physics since a pumped nonlinear resonator displays bistability,\nparametric amplification, and squeezing. The interplay of strong coupling and\nthese nonlinear effects constitutes a novel model system for quantum optics\nthat can be implemented experimentally with superconducting circuits.\n  This chapter is organized as follows. In a first section we present the\nsystem consisting of a superconducting Kerr nonlinear resonator strongly\ncoupled to a transmon qubit. In the second section, we describe the response of\nthe sole nonlinear resonator to an external drive. In the third section, we\nshow how the resonator bistability can be used to perform a high-fidelity\nreadout of the transmon qubit. In the last section, we investigate the quantum\nbackaction exerted by the intracavity field on the qubit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 13:48:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bertet", "P.", ""], ["Ong", "F.

The term steering was introduced by\nSchr\\\"odinger in 1935 for the fact that entanglement would seem to allow an\nexperimenter to remotely steer the state of a distant system as in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument. Einstein called this \"spooky action at\na distance\". EPR-Steering has recently been rigorously formulated as a quantum\ninformation task opening it up to new experimental tests. Here, we present the\nfirst loophole-free demonstration of EPR-steering by violating three-setting\nquadratic steering inequality, tested with polarization entangled photons\nshared between two distant laboratories. Our experiment demonstrates this\neffect while simultaneously closing all loopholes: both the locality loophole\nand a specific form of the freedom-of-choice loophole are closed by having a\nlarge separation of the parties and using fast quantum random number\ngenerators, and the fair-sampling loophole is closed by having high overall\ndetection efficiency. Thereby, we exclude - for the first time loophole-free -\nan important class of local realistic theories considered by EPR. As well as\nits foundational importance, loop-hole-free steering also allows the\ndistribution of quantum entanglement secure from an untrusted party.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2011 09:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Dec 2011 16:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 11:49:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wittmann", "Bernhard", ""], ["Ramelow", "Sven", ""], ["Steinlechner", "Fabian", ""], ["Langford", "Nathan K.", ""], ["Brunner", "Nicolas", ""], ["Wiseman", "Howard", ""], ["Ursin", "Rupert", ""], ["Zeilinger", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.0776", "submitter": "Marc Cheneau", "authors": "Marc Cheneau, Peter Barmettler, Dario Poletti, Manuel Endres, Peter\n  Schau\\ss, Takeshi Fukuhara, Christian Gross, Immanuel Bloch, Corinna Kollath\n  and Stefan Kuhr", "title": "Light-cone-like spreading of correlations in a quantum many-body system", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Nature 481, 484--487 (2012)", "doi": "10.1038/nature10748", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.quant-gas quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How fast can correlations spread in a quantum many-body system?

We study its influence on the properties of the\nground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the\nnumerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states\nwith higher angular momentum. Thus, we propose generalized wave functions\narising from the Laughlin and Pfaffian wave function by including components,\nwhere extra Jastrow factors appear, while preserving important features of\nthese states.

We show\nthat, by adjusting the value of $\\theta$, the average number of the key bits\nAlice obtains can be located on any fixed value the users wanted for any\ndatabase size. And the parameter $k$ is generally smaller (even $k=1$ can be\nachieved) when $\\theta<\\pi/4$, which implies lower complexity of both quantum\nand classical communications. Furthermore, the users can choose a smaller\n$\\theta$ to get better database security, or a larger $\\theta$ to obtain a\nlower probability with which Bob can correctly guess the address of Alice's\nquery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2011 09:09:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Fei", ""], ["Liu", "Bin", ""], ["Wen", "Qiao-Yan", ""], ["Chen", "Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1520", "submitter": "Tom\\'as  Gonz\\'alez-Lezana", "authors": "C.

Here we introduce a new route to enhancing necessary conditions\nfor $N$-representability through rank restriction of the 2-RDM.

Because the\n2-positivity conditions are exact for quantum systems with AGP ground states,\nthe rank of the particle-hole 2-RDM from the AGP ansatz provides a minimum for\nits value in variational 2-RDM calculations of general quantum systems. To\nimplement the rank-restricted conditions, we extend a first-order algorithm for\nlarge-scale semidefinite programming. The rank-restricted conditions\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of the energies; for example, the\npercentages of correlation energies recovered for HF, CO, and N$_{2}$ improve\nfrom 115.2%, 121.7%, and 121.5% without rank restriction to 97.8%, 101.1%, and\n100.0% with rank restriction. Similar results are found at both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium geometries. While more accurate, the rank-restricted\n$N$-representability conditions are less expensive computationally than the\nfull-rank conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 17:15:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Naftchi-Ardebili", "Kasra", ""], ["Hau", "Nathania W.", ""], ["Mazziotti", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1979", "submitter": "Igor Pikovski", "authors": "Igor Pikovski, Michael R.

As shown by Bell [1] and Kochen-Specker [2], quantum mechanics\nportrays a picture of the world in which reality loses its objectivity and is\nin fact created by observation. Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena which\ncannot be explained by any theory with objective realism, although our everyday\nexperience supports the hypothesis that macroscopic objects, despite being made\nof quantum particles, exist independently of the act of observation; in this\npaper we identify this behavior as classical. Here we show that this seemingly\nobvious classical behavior of the macroscopic world cannot be experimentally\ntested and belongs to the realm of ontology similar to the dispute on the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics [3,4]. For small systems such as a single\nphoton [5] or a pair [6], it has been experimentally proven that a classical\ndescription cannot be sustained. Recently, there have also been experiments\nthat claim to have demonstrated quantum behavior of relatively large objects\nsuch as interference of fullerenes [7], the violation of Leggett-Garg\ninequality in Josephson junction [8], and interference between two condensed\nclouds of atoms [9], which suggest that there is no limit to the size of the\nsystem on which the quantum-versus-classical question can be tested.

More precisely, it is impossible to\nreproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions using a non-contextual realist\nmodel, i.e., a model where the outcome of one measurement is independent of the\nchoice of compatible measurements performed in the measurement context. There\nhas been several attempts to quantify the amount of contextuality for specific\nquantum systems, for example, in the number of rays needed in a KS proof, or\nthe number of terms in certain inequalities, or in the violation, noise\nsensitivity, and other measures. This paper is about another approach: to use a\nsimple contextual model that reproduces the quantum-mechanical contextual\nbehaviour, but not necessarily all quantum predictions. The amount of\ncontextuality can then be quantified in terms of additional resources needed as\ncompared with a similar model without contextuality. In this case the\ncontextual model needs to keep track of the context used, so the appropriate\nmeasure would be memory. Another way to view this is as a memory requirement to\nbe able to reproduce quantum contextuality in a realist model.

Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and\ntheir natural 2-dimensional nearest neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an\nobvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems.\nWhile fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants,\ntwo of which are the planar- and defect- based codes. Planar codes require\nfewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are\nrestricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between\nencoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the\ninherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique\nenabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations,\nmaintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique\ncomprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform\nuniversal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing\nthe need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the\noverall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further\nreduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding.

Finally, another type of \"no-go\" tests (an instance\nof which we examine here) also present subtleties which call for serious\nexamination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2011 13:37:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 11:41:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sun, 22 Apr 2012 07:37:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 17:07:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2012 04:47:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v14", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2012 13:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v15", "created": "Sun, 20 May 2012 13:58:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v16", "created": "Sat, 8 Sep 2012 10:59:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v17", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2012 05:38:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v18", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 14:52:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v19", "created": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 11:38:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Nov 2011 20:34:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v20", "created": "Thu, 14 Mar 2013 03:23:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v21", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 15:28:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v22", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2013 14:14:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v23", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 02:43:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v24", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2013 11:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v25", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 11:31:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v26", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 13:44:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v27", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 14:58:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v28", "created": "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 02:18:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v29", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 13:04:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2011 20:09:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v30", "created": "Sun, 28 Apr 2013 01:52:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v31", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 09:16:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v32", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2013 03:28:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v33", "created": "Thu, 16 May 2013 01:32:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v34", "created": "Thu, 23 May 2013 07:47:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v35", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 01:30:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v36", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2013 10:45:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v37", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:12:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v38", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 01:12:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v39", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:15:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 27 Nov 2011 11:48:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v40", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 09:59:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v41", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 09:53:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v42", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 14:39:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v43", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 00:16:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v44", "created": "Sat, 6 Jul 2013 13:04:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v45", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 03:20:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v46", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 10:18:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v47", "created": "Wed, 21 Aug 2013 11:52:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v48", "created": "Wed, 25 Sep 2013 05:44:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v49", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 03:16:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Mar 2012 15:21:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v50", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 02:31:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:39:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2012 14:43:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2012 14:58:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 06:54:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Rodr\u00edguez", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4095", "submitter": "Andreas Christ", "authors": "Andreas Christ and Christine Silberhorn", "title": "Limits on the deterministic creation of pure single-photon states using\n  parametric down-conversion", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be\nalgebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor\nelectrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe\nindependent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical\nsimplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For\nexample, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the\nwave function as the guiding field. It is also shown that for these equations,\ngeneralized Carleman embedding generates systems of linear equations in the\nHilbert space, which look like second-quantized theories and are equivalent to\nthe original nonlinear systems on the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the\nrelevant local realistic models can be embedded into quantum field theories.\nThese models are equivalent to scalar electrodynamics and spinor\nelectrodynamics, so they correctly describe a large body of experimental data.\nAlthough they may need some modifications for better agreement with\nexperiments, they may be of great interest as \"no drama quantum theories\", as\nsimple (in principle) as classical electrodynamics.

We show that in most respects, it would appear\nto us as quantum. The statistical theory of classical mechanics, which\nspecifies how probability distributions over phase space evolve under\nHamiltonian evolution and under measurements, is typically called Liouville\nmechanics, so the theory we explore here is Liouville mechanics with an\nepistemic restriction. The particular epistemic restriction we posit as our\nfoundational postulate specifies two constraints. The first constraint is a\nclassical analogue of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- the second-order\nmoments of position and momentum defined by the phase-space distribution that\ncharacterizes an agent's knowledge are required to satisfy the same constraints\nas are satisfied by the moments of position and momentum observables for a\nquantum state. The second constraint is that the distribution should have\nmaximal entropy for the given moments. Starting from this postulate, we derive\nthe allowed preparations, measurements and transformations and demonstrate that\nthey are isomorphic to those allowed in Gaussian quantum mechanics and generate\nthe same experimental statistics. We argue that this reconstruction of Gaussian\nquantum mechanics constitutes additional evidence in favour of a research\nprogram wherein quantum states are interpreted as states of incomplete\nknowledge, and that the phenomena that do not arise in Gaussian quantum\nmechanics provide the best clues for how one might reconstruct the full quantum\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Nov 2011 23:14:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2012 23:26:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bartlett", "Stephen D.", ""], ["Rudolph", "Terry", ""], ["Spekkens", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5074", "submitter": "Cai Chengyun Mr.", "authors": "C.

These\nare utilized to obtain an operational definition of relative phase-measurement\nsensitivity, via analysis of phase measurement in interferometry. We show that\nthese measures are proportional to enhanced phase-measurement sensitivity. The\nphase-entanglement criterion is a hallmark for a new type of quantum squeezing,\nnamely planar quantum squeezing. This has the property that it squeezes two\northogonal spin directions simultaneously, which is possible owing to the fact\nthat the SU(2) group that describes spin symmetry has a three-dimensional\nparameter space, of higher dimension than the group for photonic quadratures.\nThe practical advantage of planar quantum squeezing is that, unlike\nconventional spin-squeezing, it allows noise reduction over all phase-angles\nsimultaneously. The application of this type of squeezing is to quantum\nmeasure- ment of an unknown phase. We show that a completely unknown phase\nrequires two orthogonal measurements, and that with planar quantum squeezing it\nis possible to reduce the measurement uncertainty independently of the unknown\nphase value. This is a different type of squeezing to the usual spin-squeezing\ninterferometric criterion, which is only applicable when the measured phase is\nalready known to a good approximation, or can be measured iteratively.

Nanotubes orthogonal to the fiber are found to perform much better than\nparallel nanotubes when they are short. As the nanotube gets longer the\nabsorption of parallel nanotubes is found to exceed the orthogonal nanotubes\nand approach 100% for extremely long nanotubes. In addition, we show that if\nthe nanotube is wrapped around the fiber in an appropriate way the absorption\nis enhanced. We find that optical and near infrared photons could be converted\nto excitations with efficiencies that may exceed 90%. This may provide\nopportunities for future photodetectors and we discuss possible setups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2011 16:35:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Broadfoot", "S.", ""], ["Dorner", "U.", ""], ["Jaksch", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5247", "submitter": "Or Sattath", "authors": "Andr\\'e Chailloux and Or Sattath", "title": "The Complexity of the Separable Hamiltonian Problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc. of IEEE 27th Annual Conference on Computational Complexity\n  (CCC), 2012. pp 32 - 41", "doi": "10.1109/CCC.2012.42", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study variants of the canonical Local-Hamiltonian problem\nwhere, in addition, the witness is promised to be separable.

This\nis, in general, a very time-consuming task that requires a large number of\nmeasurements. There are, however, systems in which the data acquisition can be\ndone more efficiently. In fact, an ensemble of quantum systems can be prepared\nand manipulated by external fields while being continuously and collectively\nprobed, producing enough information to estimate its state. This provides a\nbasis for continuous measurement quantum tomography. In this protocol, an\nensemble of identically prepared systems is collectively probed and controlled\nin a time-dependent manner to create an informationally complete continuous\nmeasurement record. The measurement history is then inverted to determine the\nstate at the initial time. We use two different estimation methods: maximum\nlikelihood and compressed sensing.

First, we point out that in most real,\npractical situations, where the concept of device-independence is used as a\nprotection against unintentional flaws or failures of the quantum apparatuses,\nit is sufficient to show that the generated string is random with respect to an\nadversary that holds only classical-side information, i.e., proving randomness\nagainst quantum-side information is not necessary. Furthermore, the initial\nrandom seed does not need to be private with respect to the adversary, provided\nthat it is generated in a way that is independent from the measured systems.\nThe devices, though, will generate cryptographically-secure randomness that\ncannot be predicted by the adversary and thus one can, given access to free\npublic randomness, talk about private randomness generation.\n  The theoretical tools to quantify the generated randomness according to these\ncriteria were already introduced in [S.

The demand that nature be rational, in\nthe sense that it be compatible with the principle of sufficient reason,\nconflicts with a basic feature of contemporary orthodox physical theory, namely\nthe notion that nature's response to the probing action of an observer is\ndetermined by pure chance, and hence on the basis of absolutely no reason at\nall. This appeal to pure chance can be deemed to have no rational fundamental\nplace in reason-based Western science. It is argued here, on the basis of the\nother basic principles of quantum physics, that in a world that conforms to the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, the usual quantum statistical rules will\nnaturally emerge at the pragmatic level, in cases where the reason behind\nNature's choice of response is unknown, but that the usual statistics can\nbecome biased in an empirically manifest and apparently retrocausal way when\nthe reason for the choice is empirically identifiable.

Focusing on the case where the initial photon is\nentangled with another photon, we study the conditions under which entanglement\ncan be proven in the final state. The proposed experiment would provide a clear\ndemonstration that quantum information is preserved in quantum cloning. It\nwould furthermore allow a definitive experimental proof for micro-macro\nentanglement in the intermediate multiphoton state, which is still an\noutstanding challenge. Finally, it might provide a quantum detection technique\nfor small differences in transmission (e.g., in biological samples), whose\nsensitivity scales better with the number of photons used than a classical\ntransmission measurement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 19:33:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Mar 2012 19:57:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Raeisi", "Sadegh", ""], ["Tittel", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Simon", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7315", "submitter": "\\c{S}\\\"ukr\\\"u Ekin Kocaba\\c{s}", "authors": "\\c{S}\\\"ukr\\\"u Ekin Kocaba\\c{s}, Eden Rephaeli, Shanhui Fan", "title": "Resonance fluorescence in a waveguide geometry", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures and supplementary material (Mathematica code).\n  This is the published version: typos are fixed, conclusion section is\n  expanded, references are updated", "journal-ref": "Phys.
