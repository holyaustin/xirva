This broadening is essential for true multimode memories,\nbut induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a\ncavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time.

Recombination of electrons with holes in a\nquantum dot of the coupled system leads to an unusual negative diamagnetic\neffect, which is five times stronger than that in a pure quantum dot system.\nThis effect can be attributed to the expansion of the wavefunction of remaining\nelectrons in the wetting layer or the spread of electrons in the excited states\nof the quantum dot to the wetting layer after recombination. In this case, the\nwavefunction extent of the final states in the quantum dot plane is much larger\nthan that of the initial states because of the absence of holes in the quantum\ndot to attract electrons.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 21:00:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 12:17:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Shamik", ""], ["Paul", "Partha", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.02240", "submitter": "Christopher Portmann", "authors": "Christopher Portmann, Christian Matt, Ueli Maurer, Renato Renner,\n  Bj\\\"orn Tackmann", "title": "Causal Boxes: Quantum Information-Processing Systems Closed under\n  Composition", "comments": "44+24 pages, 16 figures. v3: minor edits based on referee comments,\n  matches published version up to layout. v2: definition of causality weakened,\n  new references", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 63(5):3277-3305, May 2017", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2017.2676805", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Complex information-processing systems, for example quantum circuits,\ncryptographic protocols, or multi-player games, are naturally described as\nnetworks composed of more basic information-processing systems.

In this work we bring together these two lines of\nresearch by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a\nsequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions.\nIn this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics\nof quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be\nwell described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable\nequilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i)\nthe time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised\nGibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable\nmodels. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy\nproduction, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of\noptimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much\nroom is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic\nquantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with\nrespect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has\nimplications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as\nsuggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external\nheat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of\nfreedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 21:01:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 11:48:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 08:54:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Perarnau-Llobet", "M.", ""], ["Riera", "A.", ""], ["Gallego", "R.", ""], ["Wilming", "H.", ""], ["Eisert", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03824", "submitter": "Alex Bocharov", "authors": "Alex Bocharov, Shawn X.

The main difference to the\nbinary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to\nhigher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set.\nOur ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only\n$1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than\nprevious constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth\nof only $O(\\log\\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on\ntwo levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic\ncircuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of\nnon-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections\nfurther by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the\nnon-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\\rangle \\mapsto |i, j + \\delta_{i,2} \\mod\n3\\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate\n$P_9=\\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \\pi \\, i/9},1,e^{2 \\pi \\, i/9})$.

The dynamics resulting from changes in the\ntransition frequency is a problem studied since the early days of quantum\nmechanics. It has been of constant interest both experimentally and\ntheoretically since, with the simple two-state model providing an inexhaustible\nsource of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is\nmodulated, several phenomena can be observed, such as\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana interference, motional averaging and\nnarrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the presence of sidebands\nin the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric\nphases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an\nexquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the\nparameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed\nthe state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments\nwere made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting\nqubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a\nresult of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the\nfundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition\nfrequencies are modulated.

Observables, including\npositions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting\non such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very\ninvolved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical\nvariables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum\nobservables acting on the \"superspace\" of all metrics, regardless of whether\nthey play any role in the description of a specific physical system.

His choice of\nproblems to pursue, which for the most part involved epistemology and the\nrelationships between mind, matter and space-time, was visionary. Undoubtedly,\nmost of the discussions of Abner Shimony's work in future will center on his\nenormous contribution to the investigation of the significance to physics, both\ntheoretical and experimental, of quantum entanglement, the characteristic of\nphysical entities on which his work came to concentrate, well represented in\nthe Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt inequality. Also significant for physics is\nhis pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the\nearly-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship\nbetween knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical\nconcerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.\nIndeed, the most well known phrase he coined is \"experimental metaphysics.\" He\nis also known for the reapplication of the expression \"peaceful coexistence\" as\npertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special\nrelativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the\nquestion of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few\nphysicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more\nphilosophical and less mathematically tractable character. This appreciation\nreflects all these aspects of Abner Shimony's long and successful intellectual\ncareer, in addition to details of his education, including mention of some of\nhis teachers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 17:17:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 12:18:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 12:00:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Jaeger", "Gregg", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.04330", "submitter": "Andrea Crespi", "authors": "Fulvio Flamini, Lorenzo Magrini, Adil S.

In the process we find that functional form proposed\nfits the viscosity data of a diverse group of 45 liquids exceptionally well\nover a wide temperature range, and uncover a number of interesting correlations\nof the single parameter with various thermodynamic quantities, ultimately\nallowing for the prediction of low temperature viscosity from high temperature\ndata. Additionally, we find that similar physical reasoning can be used to\nderive a similar, single parameter form for the viscosity of hard-sphere/jammed\nliquids. We demonstrate that this form accurately reproduces the viscosity of\nhard-spheres, suggesting an underlying universality in metastable dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 21:32:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 16:29:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 23:53:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:42:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 18:18:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Weingartner", "Nicholas B.", ""], ["Pueblo", "Chris", ""], ["Kelton", "K.

However, such theories can also admit of\nenergy spectra in which energies come in complex conjugate pairs, and can even\nadmit of Hamiltonians that cannot be diagonalized at all. Hermiticity is just a\nparticular realization of $PT$ symmetry, with $PT$ symmetry being the more\ngeneral. These $PT$ theories are themselves part of an even broader class of\ntheories, theories that can be characterized by possessing some general\nantilinear symmetry, as that requirement alone is a both necessary and\nsufficient condition for the time-independent evolution of scalar products,\nwith all the different realizations of the $PT$ symmetry program then being\nobtained. Use of complex Lorentz invariance allows us to show that the\nantilinear symmetry is uniquely specified to be $CPT$, with the $CPT$ theorem\nthus being extended to the non-Hermitian case. For theories that are separately\ncharge conjugation invariant, the results of the $PT$-symmetry program then\nfollow. We show that in order to construct the correct classical action needed\nfor a path integral quantization one must impose $CPT$ symmetry on each\nclassical path, a requirement that has no counterpart in any Hermiticity\ncondition since Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is only definable after the\nquantization has been performed and the quantum Hilbert space has been\nconstructed. We show that whether or not a $CPT$-invariant Hamiltonian is\nHermitian is a property of the solutions to the theory and not of the\nHamiltonian itself.

We allow for two sources\nof noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the\nenvironment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation\nrooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical\nstatistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms\nof a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,\nnoise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error\nmitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the\nsought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error\nmitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,\nthose that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the\ncontrol fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in\nterms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the\n`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with\nrespect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation\nof constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that\nthey feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by\nconsidering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$\narbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal\nerror-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is\nvalid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,\n$s \\to \\infty$) limit.

Starting from a minimal case with spins of dimension 6 and\nthreshold lattice size 15 x 15, we show that the latter grows faster than any\ncomputable function with increasing local spin dimension.

We demonstrate that, in a proper geometrical setting, this orbital\nangular momentum can be transferred to the internal degrees of freedom of the\natoms, thus violating the standard dipolar selection rules. Higher orbital\nangular momentum states become accessible through a single photon excitation\nprocess. We investigate how the spacial structure of the Laguerre-Gauss beam\naffects the radial coupling strength, assuming the simplest case of\nhydrogen-like wavefunctions. Finally we discuss a generalization of the angular\nmomentum coupling, in order to include the effects of the fine and hyperfine\nsplitting, in the context of the Wigner-Eckart theorem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 13:00:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rodrigues", "J.

In this paper, we construct a locally\nindistinguishable and completable orthogonal product basis with $4p-4$ members\nin a general $m\\otimes n$ ($3\\leq m \\leq n$) quantum system, where $p$ is an\narbitrary integer from $3$ to $m$, and give a very simple but quite effective\nproof for its local indistinguishability. Specially, we get a completable\northogonal product basis with $8$ members that cannot be locally distinguished\nin $m\\otimes n$ ($3\\leq m \\leq n$) when $p=3$. It is so far the smallest\ncompletable orthogonal product basis that cannot be locally distinguished in a\n$m\\otimes n$ quantum system. On the other hand, we construct a small locally\nindistinguishable orthogonal product basis with $2p-1$ members, which is maybe\nuncompletable, in $m\\otimes n$ ($3\\leq m \\leq n$ and $p$ is an arbitrary\ninteger from $3$ to $m$). We also prove its local indistinguishability. As a\ncorollary, we give an uncompletable orthogonal product basis with $5$ members\nthat are locally indistinguishable in $m\\otimes n$ ($3\\leq m \\leq n$). All the\nresults can lead us to a better understanding of the structure of a locally\nindistinguishable product basis in $m \\otimes n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 03:50:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 07:24:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Guang-Bao", ""], ["Yang", "Ying-Hui", ""], ["Wen", "Qiao-Yan", ""], ["Qin", "Su-Juan", ""], ["Gao", "Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06487", "submitter": "Wei Qin", "authors": "Wei Qin and Franco Nori", "title": "Controllable single-photon transport between remote coupled-cavity\n  arrays", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

The development\nof quantum information science has lead to renewed interest in properly\napproaching the coherence at the quantum level. Various measures could be\nproposed to quantify coherence of a quantum state with respect to the\nprescribed orthonormal basis. To be a proper measure of coherence, each\ncandidate should enjoy certain properties. It seems that the monotonicity\nproperty plays a crucial role here. Indeed, there is known an intuitive measure\nof coherence that does not share this condition. We study coherence measures\ninduced by quantum divergences of the Tsallis type.

Despite the nonlinear contribution from the\nself-interaction, the corresponding classical dynamics allows for a largely\nanalytical treatment of the semiclassical propagator.

Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two\nparties, when measured suitably, achieve the maximum non-local correlations\nallowed by quantum mechanics. Conversely, Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013)\nshowed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated\nmeasurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor\nproduct of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured\naccording to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a\nhigh price, requiring a large number of entangled pairs to be tested. In this\npaper, we present a significant improvement in terms of the overhead by instead\nconsidering quantum steering where the device of the one side is trusted. We\nfirst demonstrate a robust one-sided device-independent version of\nself-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of\ntwo parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to\nconstant factors and we generalise the results for the most general attacks.\nThis leads us to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As a key\napplication we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable\ndelegated quantum computation, and compare it to other existing protocols, to\nhighlight the cost of trust assumptions. Finally, we show that under reasonable\nassumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification\nprotocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 09:21:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 17:45:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:39:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:28:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Gheorghiu", "Alexandru", ""], ["Wallden", "Petros", ""], ["Kashefi", "Elham", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.07402", "submitter": "Mohammad Javad Dousti", "authors": "Mohammad Javad Dousti, Alireza Shafaei, and Massoud Pedram", "title": "Squash 2: A Hierarchical Scalable Quantum Mapper Considering Ancilla\n  Sharing", "comments": "To appear in Quantum Information Computation Vol.16 No. 3&4,\n  pp0332-0356. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1412.8004", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called\nRequp, which supports a hierarchical approach to mapping a quantum algorithm\nwhile sharing physical and logical ancilla qubits.

Many of the existing control techniques are based on smooth\nHamiltonian modulations involving repeated calculations of basic unitaries\nresulting in time complexities scaling rapidly with the length of the control\nsequence. On the other hand, the bang-bang controls need one-time calculation\nof basic unitaries and hence scale much more efficiently. By employing a global\noptimization routine such as the genetic algorithm, it is possible to\nsynthesize not only highly intricate unitaries, but also certain nonunitary\noperations. Here we demonstrate the unitary control through the first\nimplementation of the optimal fixed-point quantum search algorithm in a\nthree-qubit NMR system. More over, by combining the bang-bang pulses with the\ntwirling process, we also demonstrate a nonunitary transformation of the\nthermal equilibrium state into an effective pure state in a five-qubit NMR\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 12:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bhole", "Gaurav", ""], ["S.", "Anjusha V.", ""], ["Mahesh", "T.

Finally, we continue discussion on\ninterrelation of quantum and classical randomness and information\ninterpretation of QM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 05:16:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Khrennikov", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08893", "submitter": "Mikhail Lebedev", "authors": "M.V.
