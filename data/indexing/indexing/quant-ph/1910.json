This is\nproved using the Q-function of quantum theory with time-symmetric diffusion,\nthat is equivalent to a forward-backward stochastic process in both the\ndirections of time. The resulting probability distribution has a positive,\ntime-symmetric action principle and path integral, whose solution corresponds\nto a classical field equilibrating in an additional dimension. Comparisons are\nmade to stochastic quantization and other higher dimensional physics proposals.\nFive-dimensional space-time was originally introduced by Kaluza and Klein, and\nis now widely proposed in cosmology and particle physics. Time-symmetric action\nprinciples for quantum fields are also related to electrodynamical absorber\ntheory, which is known to be capable of violating a Bell inequality. We give\nnumerical methods and examples of solutions to the resulting stochastic partial\ndifferential equations in a higher time-dimension, giving agreement with exact\nsolutions for soluble boson field quantum dynamics.

This dephasing is a major issue that limits the realizable fidelity of a\nquantum entangling gate with neutral atoms when there is a {\\it gap} time for\nthe Rydberg atom to drift freely. We find that such a dephasing can be largely\nsuppressed by using a transition in a `V'-type dual-rail configuration. The\nleft~(right) arm of this `V' represents a transition to a Rydberg state\n$|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ with a Rabi frequency $\\Omega e^{ikz}~(\\Omega e^{-ikz})$,\nwhere $z$ is frozen without atomic drift, but changes linearly in each\nexperimental cycle. Such a configuration is equivalent to a transition between\nthe ground state and a hybrid and time-dependent Rydberg state with a Rabi\nfrequency $\\sqrt2\\Omega$, such that there is no phase error whenever the state\nreturns to the ground state. We study two applications of this method. First,\nit is possible to faithfully transfer the atomic state between a hyperfine\nground state $|1\\rangle$ and Rydberg states $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ with no {\\it\ngap} time between the excitation and deexcitation. Second, by adding infrared\nlaser fields to induce transition between $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ and a nearby\nRydberg state $|r_3\\rangle$ via a largely detuned low-lying intermediate state\nin the {\\it gap} time, the atom can keep its internal state in the Rydberg\nlevel as well as adjust the population branching in $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ during\nthe {\\it gap} time. This allows an almost perfect Rydberg deexcitation after\nthe {\\it gap} time, making it possible to recover a high fidelity in the\nRydberg blockade gate.

In this work we present a family of Bell inequalities which are\nmaximally violated by multiple inequivalent quantum realisations. We completely\ncharacterise the quantum realisations achieving the maximal violation and we\nshow that each of them requires a maximally entangled state of two qubits. This\nimplies the existence of a new, weak form of self-testing in which the maximal\nviolation allows us to identify the state, but does not fully determine the\nmeasurements. From the geometric point of view the set of probability points\nthat saturate the quantum bound is a line segment. We then focus on a\nparticular member of the family and show that the self-testing statement is\nrobust, i.e. that observing a non-maximal violation allows us to make a\nquantitative statement about the unknown state. To achieve this we present a\nnew construction of extraction channels and analyse their performance. For\ncompleteness we provide two independent approaches: analytical and numerical.\nThe noise robustness, i.e. the amount of white noise at which the bound becomes\ntrivial, of the analytical bound is rather small (~0.06%), but the numerical\nmethod takes us into an experimentally-relevant regime (~5%). We conclude by\ninvestigating the amount of randomness that can be certified using these Bell\nviolations.

Every quantum system that interacts with the\nenvironment is doomed to decohere. The preservation of quantum coherence is one\nof the major challenges faced in quantum technologies, but its use as a\nresource is very promising and can lead to various operational advantages, for\nexample in quantum algorithms. Hence, much work has been devoted in recent\nyears to quantify the coherence present in a system. In the present paper, we\nformulate the quantum resource theory of dynamical coherence. The underlying\nphysical principle we follow is that the free dynamical objects are those that\ncannot preserve or distribute coherence. This leads us to identify classical\nchannels as the free elements in this theory. Consequently, even the quantum\nidentity channel is not free as all physical systems undergo decoherence and\nhence, the preservation of coherence should be considered a resource. In our\nwork, we introduce four different types of free superchannels (analogous to\nMIO, DIO, IO, and SIO) and discuss in detail two of them, namely,\ndephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC), maximally incoherent\nsuperchannels (MISC). The latter consists of all superchannels that do not\ngenerate non-classical channels from classical ones. We quantify dynamical\ncoherence using channel-divergence-based monotones for MISC and DISC. We show\nthat some of these monotones have operational interpretations as the exact, the\napproximate, and the liberal coherence cost of a quantum channel. Moreover, we\nprove that the liberal asymptotic cost of a channel is equal to a new type of\nregularized relative entropy.

We\npropose new, simple, but very effective smoothing techniques to classically\nmitigate physical noise effects such as e.g. IBM Q's bias towards the\n$0$-qubit.\n  After smoothing, our noisy quantum device provides us a statistical\ndistribution that we can easily transform into an LPN instance with parameters\n$n$ and $\\tau(n)$. Hence, in the noisy case we may not hope to find periods in\ntime polynomial in $n$. However, we may still obtain a quantum advantage if the\nerror $\\tau(n)$ does not grow too large. This demonstrates that quantum devices\nmay be useful for period finding, even before achieving the level of full error\ncorrection capability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2019 07:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 13:18:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2021 16:39:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["May", "Alexander", ""], ["Schlieper", "Lars", ""], ["Schwinger", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00815", "submitter": "Poramet Pathumsoot", "authors": "Poramet Pathumsoot, Takaaki Matsuo, Takahiko Satoh, Michal\n  Hajdu\\v{s}ek, Sujin Suwanna, Rodney Van Meter", "title": "Modeling of Measurement-based Quantum Network Coding on IBM Q Experience\n  Devices", "comments": "10 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In the presence of the signal loss, this is no\nlonger true over timescales much longer than the damping time. However, for\nsufficient parametric nonlinearity, a cat-state can exist as a transient state.\nIn this paper, we study the dynamics of the creation and decoherence of\ncat-states in degenerate parametric oscillation, both with and without the\neffect of a Kerr nonlinearity that applies to recent superconducting-circuit\nexperiments generating cat-states in microwave cavities. We determine the time\nof formation and the lifetime of a cat-state in terms of three dimensionless\nparameters $\\lambda$, $g$ and $\\chi$. These relate to the driving strength, the\nparametric nonlinearity, and the Kerr nonlinearity, respectively. We find that\nthe Kerr nonlinearity has little effect on the threshold parametric\nnonlinearity ($g>1$) required for the formation of cat-states, and does not\nsignificantly alter the decoherence time of the cat-state, but can reduce the\ntime of formation. The quality of the cat-state increases with the value $g$,\nand can also improved by the Kerr nonlinearity. To verify the existence and\nquality of the cat-state, we consider several signatures, including\ninterference fringes and negativity, and show how they can be computed.

The transition to this state is\nsignalled by an inversion in the average momentum from being dominated by\ncentre-of-mass momentum to relative momentum and also affects the global\nentanglement shared between the real- and pseudo-spin spaces. Indeed,\ncompetition between the interactions can also result in avoided crossings in\nthe groundstate which further enhances these correlations. However, we find\nthat correlations shared between the pseudo-spin states are strongly depressed\ndue to the spin-orbit coupling and therefore the system does not contain\nspin-spin entanglement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Oct 2019 08:52:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 18:15:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Usui", "Ayaka", ""], ["Fogarty", "Thom\u00e1s", ""], ["Campbell", "Steve", ""], ["Gardiner", "Simon A.", ""], ["Busch", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.02427", "submitter": "Yuji Nozawa", "authors": "Yuji Nozawa, Hirokazu Tsunetsugu", "title": "Generalized Hydrodynamic approach to charge and energy currents in the\n  one-dimensional Hubbard model", "comments": "18 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

A similar analytical proof is also\ngiven for a clogged region of spin current when magnetic field is applied to\none and only one of the two initial states. A universal proportionality of\ncharge and spin currents is also proved for a special region, for general\ninitial conditions of electron density and magnetic field. Except for the\nclogged region, charge and energy densities are in good proportion to each\nother, and their ratio depends on the initial conditions.

We axiomatically\nformulate this ability as the resource preservability, which is constructed as\na channel resource theory induced by a state resource theory. We provide two\ngeneral classes of resource preservability monotones: One is based on state\nresource monotones, and another is based on channel distance measures.\nSpecifically, the latter gives the robustness monotone, which has been recently\nfound to have an operational interpretation. As examples, we show that\nathermality preservability of a Gibbs-preserving channel can be related to the\nsmallest bath size needed to thermalize all its outputs, and it also bounds the\ncapacity of a classical communication scenario under certain thermodynamic\nconstraints. We further apply our theory to the study of entanglement\npreserving local thermalization (EPLT) and provide a new family of EPLT which\nadmits arbitrarily small nonzero entanglement preservability and free\nentanglement preservation at the same time.

The main argument we use in this paper to assess the\nperformance of a QA algorithm is the presence or absence of an anti-crossing\nduring quantum evolution. For this purpose, we introduce a new parametrization\ndefinition of the anti-crossing. Using the Maximum-weighted Independent Set\n(MIS) problem in which there are flexible parameters (energy penalties J\nbetween pairs of edges) in an Ising formulation as the model problem, we\nconstruct examples to show that by changing the value of J, we can change the\nquantum evolution from one that has an anti-crossing (that results in an\nexponential small min-gap) to one that does not have, or the other way around,\nand thus drastically change (increase or decrease) the min-gap. However, we\nalso show that by changing the value of $J$ alone, one can not avoid the\nanti-crossing. We recall a polynomial reduction from an Ising problem to an MIS\nproblem to show that the flexibility of changing parameters without changing\nthe problem to be solved can be applied to any Ising problem. As an example, we\nshow that by such a reduction alone, it is possible to remove the anti-crossing\nand thus increase the min-gap. Our anti-crossing definition is necessarily\nscaling invariant as scaling the problem Hamiltonian does not change the nature\n(i.e. presence or absence) of an anti-crossing. As a side note, we show exactly\nhow the min-gap is scaled if we scale the problem Hamiltonian by a constant\nfactor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2019 18:12:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2019 22:57:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Vicky", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.02998", "submitter": "Leonardo Chataignier", "authors": "Leonardo Chataignier", "title": "Construction of quantum Dirac observables and the emergence of WKB time", "comments": "v2: references updated, minor typos corrected, title slightly\n  changed, conceptual clarifications added, published in Physical Review D", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Given the inevitability of unwanted physical\nnoise in quantum systems and the propensity for errors to spread as\ncomputations proceed, computational outcomes can become substantially\ncorrupted.

In the context of photonic quantum information processing,\nthere has recently been much interest in passive linear optics quantum\ncomputing, which includes boson-sampling, as this model eliminates the\nhighly-challenging requirements for feed-forward via fast, active control. That\nis, these systems are passive by definition. In usual scenarios, error\ndetection and correction techniques are inherently active, making them\nincompatible with this model, arousing suspicion that physical error processes\nmay be an insurmountable obstacle. Here we explore a photonic error-detection\ntechnique, based on W-state encoding of photonic qubits, which is entirely\npassive, based on post-selection, and compatible with these near-term photonic\narchitectures of interest. We show that this W-state redundant encoding\ntechniques enables the suppression of dephasing noise on photonic qubits via\nsimple fan-out style operations, implemented by optical Fourier transform\nnetworks, which can be readily realised today.

The unperturbed medium (bulk) is modeled by a\nhoneycomb Schroedinger operator, which is periodic with respect to the\ntriangular lattice, invariant under parity, P, and complex-conjugation, C. A\nhoneycomb operator has Dirac points: two dispersion surfaces touch conically at\nan energy level, $E_D$ [25,27]. Periodic perturbations which break P or C open\na gap in the essential spectrum about energy $E_D$. Such operators model an\ninsulator near energy $E_D$. Our edge operator is a small perturbation of the\nbulk and models a transition (via a domain wall) between distinct periodic, P\nor C breaking perturbations. The edge operator permits energy transport along\nthe line-defect. The associated energy channels are called edge states. They\nare time-harmonic solutions which are localized near and propagating along the\nline-defect. We completely characterize the edge state spectrum within the bulk\nspectral gap about $E_D$. At the center of our analysis is an expansion of the\nedge operator resolvent for energies near $E_D$. The leading term features the\nresolvent of an effective Dirac operator.

In this work we prove that two graphs are\nquantum isomorphic (in the commuting operator framework) if and only if they\nadmit the same number of homomorphisms from any planar graph. As there exist\npairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are quantum isomorphic, this implies that\nhomomorphism counts from planar graphs do not determine a graph up to\nisomorphism. Another immediate consequence is that determining whether there\nexists some planar graph that has a different number of homomorphisms to two\ngiven graphs is an undecidable problem, since quantum isomorphism is known to\nbe undecidable. Our characterization of quantum isomorphism is proven via a\ncombinatorial characterization of the intertwiner spaces of the quantum\nautomorphism group of a graph based on counting homomorphisms from planar\ngraphs. This result inspires the definition of \"graph categories\" which are\nanalogous to, and a generalization of, partition categories that are the basis\nof the definition of easy quantum groups. Thus we introduce a new class of\n\"graph-theoretic quantum groups\" whose intertwiner spaces are spanned by maps\nassociated to (bi-labeled) graphs. Finally, we use our result on quantum\nisomorphism to prove an interesting reformulation of the Four Color Theorem:\nthat any planar graph is 4-colorable if and only if it has a homomorphism to a\nspecific Cayley graph on the symmetric group $S_4$ which contains a complete\nsubgraph on four vertices but is not 4-colorable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Oct 2019 17:53:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Oct 2019 00:14:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Man\u010dinska", "Laura", ""], ["Roberson", "David E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.06969", "submitter": "Zeki Seskir", "authors": "Zeki C.

As its major non-perturbative\napproach, lattice gauge theory is traditionally implemented using Monte Carlo\nsimulation, consequently it usually suffers such problems as the Fermion sign\nproblem and the lack of real-time dynamics. Hopefully they can be avoided by\nusing quantum simulation, which simulates quantum systems by using controllable\ntrue quantum processes. The field of quantum simulation is under rapid\ndevelopment. Here we present a circuit-based digital scheme of quantum\nsimulation of quantum $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ and $3+1$\ndimensions, using quantum adiabatic algorithms implemented in terms of\nuniversal quantum gates. Our algorithm generalizes the Trotter and symmetric\ndecompositions to the case that the Hamiltonian varies at each step in the\ndecomposition. Furthermore, we carry through a complete demonstration of this\nscheme in classical GPU simulator, and obtain key features of quantum\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, including quantum phase transitions,\ntopological properties, gauge invariance and duality.

In this work, we study the QAOA applied to the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, which can be understood as energy\nminimization of $n$ spins with all-to-all random signed couplings. There is a\nrecent classical algorithm by Montanari that, assuming a widely believed\nconjecture, can be tailored to efficiently find an approximate solution for a\ntypical instance of the SK model to within $(1-\\epsilon)$ times the ground\nstate energy. We hope to match its performance with the QAOA. Our main result\nis a novel technique that allows us to evaluate the typical-instance energy of\nthe QAOA applied to the SK model. We produce a formula for the expected value\nof the energy, as a function of the $2p$ QAOA parameters, in the infinite size\nlimit that can be evaluated on a computer with $O(16^p)$ complexity. We\nevaluate the formula up to $p=12$, and find that the QAOA at $p=11$ outperforms\nthe standard semidefinite programming algorithm.

As an algorithm running on a quantum computer, there is no need to\nsearch for optimal parameters on an instance-by-instance basis since we can\ndetermine them in advance.

In this way, the\nexperimental results resolve the problem of definite outcomes (\"Schrodinger's\ncat\"), leading to a resolution of the measurement problem. However, this\nargument does not yet resolve the measurement problem because it is based on\nthe results of experiments, while measurement is a theoretical problem: How can\nstandard quantum theory explain the definite outcomes seen experimentally?\nThus, we summarize the nonlocality experiments' supporting theory, which\nrigorously predicts the experimental results directly from optical paths.\nSeveral previous theoretical analyses of the measurement problem have relied on\nthe reduced density operators derived from the measurement state, but these\nsolutions have been rejected due to criticism of reduced density operators.\nBecause it avoids reduced density operators, the optical-path analysis is\nimmune to such criticism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2019 19:12:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Hobson", "Art", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.08637", "submitter": "Zahra Saghafi Vishkaei", "authors": "Z.

Our Heisenberg\nperspective reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the\ndesign of certain classical codes.

Phases of matter are classified\nby symmetry breaking, topological phases are characterized by non-local\nsymmetries, and point group symmetries are critical to our understanding of\ncrystalline materials. Symmetries could then be used as a criterion to engineer\nquantum systems with targeted properties. Toward that end, we have developed a\nnovel approach, the symmetric Hamiltonian construction (SHC), that takes as\ninput symmetries, specified by integrals of motion or discrete symmetry\ntransformations, and produces as output all local Hamiltonians consistent with\nthese symmetries (see github.com/ClarkResearchGroup/qosy for our open-source\ncode). This approach builds on the slow operator method [PRE 92, 012128]. We\nuse our new approach to construct new Hamiltonians for topological phases of\nmatter.\n  Topological phases of matter are exotic quantum phases with potential\napplications in quantum computation. In this work, we focus on two types of\ntopological phases of matter: superconductors with Majorana zero modes and\n$Z_2$ quantum spin liquids. In our first application of the SHC approach, we\nanalytically construct a large and highly tunable class of superconducting\nHamiltonians with Majorana zero modes with a given targeted spatial\ndistribution.

This interaction results in a local and gauge-independent phase\ngeneration for the particle propagation in each path of the interferometer.\nHere we improve the cited treatments by using the quantum electrodynamics\nformalism in the Lorentz gauge, with a manifestly gauge-independent Hamiltonian\nfor the interaction and the presence of virtual longitudinal photons. Only with\nthis more complete and gauge-independent treatment it is possible to justify\nthe acquired phases for interferometers with arbitrary geometries, and this is\nan advantage of our treatment. We also extend the results to the electric\nversion of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Finally, we propose an experiment that\ncould test the locality of the Aharonov-Bohm phase generation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:15:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2020 20:27:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:45:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:15:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Saldanha", "Pablo L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.10675", "submitter": "Joseph Gomes", "authors": "Joseph Gomes, Keri A.

However, their sensitivities are\nlimited by their short coherence times relative to NVs in bulk diamond. A more\ncomplete understanding of the origins of decoherence in nanodiamonds is\ncritical to improving their performance. Here we present measurements of fast\nspin relaxation on qutrit transitions between the energy eigenstates composed\nof the $m_s = \\pm1$ states of the NV$^-$ electronic ground state in $\\sim40$-nm\nnanodiamonds under ambient conditions.

Because this semi classical\nmethod was able to find new solutions to a heavily studied problem the results\nin this paper represent significant progress in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach to\nquantum cosmology and in the application of Euclidean-signature semi classical\nmethods to Lorentzian signature problems in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Oct 2019 00:50:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Berkowitz", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.12009", "submitter": "Shovon Biswas", "authors": "Shovon Biswas", "title": "Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem in non-commutative space", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": "Physics Letters A 381 (2017) 3723-3725", "doi": "10.1016/j.physleta.2017.10.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem has been studied in non-commutative space where the\nspace coordinates do not commute.

However, not all domains of\nmachine learning have benefited equally from quantum enhancements.

Arguably, one reason behind this is the\nsystematic use in these domains of models and methods without prominent\ncomputational bottlenecks, leaving little room for quantum improvements.

Our\napproach features the distribution of complex-valued ratios between nearest-\nand next-to-nearest neighbor spacings.

First, we show that, if eigenvalues are\nuncorrelated, the distribution of complex spacing ratios is flat within the\nunit circle, whereas random matrices show a strong angular dependence in\naddition to the usual level repulsion. The universal fluctuations of Gaussian\nUnitary and Ginibre Unitary universality classes in the large-matrix-size limit\nare shown to be well described by Wigner-like surmises for small-size matrices\nwith eigenvalues on the circle and on the two-torus, respectively. To study the\nlatter case, we introduce the Toric Unitary Ensemble, characterized by a flat\njoint eigenvalue distribution on the two-torus.

The proposed QC-based solution\nstrategies enjoy high computational efficiency in terms of solution quality and\ncomputation time, by utilizing the unique features of both classical and\nquantum computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 02:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ajagekar", "Akshay", ""], ["Humble", "Travis", ""], ["You", "Fengqi", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.13088", "submitter": "Tuhin Sahai", "authors": "Tuhin Sahai, Anurag Mishra, Jose Miguel Pasini, and Susmit Jha", "title": "Estimating the Density of States of Boolean Satisfiability Problems on\n  Classical and Quantum Computing Platforms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.AI cs.LO quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a Boolean formula $\\phi(x)$ in conjunctive normal form (CNF), the\ndensity of states counts the number of variable assignments that violate\nexactly $e$ clauses, for all values of $e$.

Even though the peptide's\nde Broglie wavelength is as tiny as 350~fm, the molecular coherence is\ndelocalized over more than 20 times the molecular size in our all-optical\ntime-domain Talbot-Lau interferometer. We compare the observed interference\nfringes for two different interference orders with a model that includes both a\nrigorous treatment of the peptide's quantum wave nature as well as a quantum\nchemical assessment of its optical properties to distinguish our result from\nclassical predictions. The successful realization of quantum optics with this\npolypeptide as a prototypical biomolecule paves the way for quantum-assisted\nmolecule metrology and in particular the optical spectroscopy of a large class\nof biologically relevant molecules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:33:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Shayeghi", "Armin", ""], ["Rieser", "Philipp", ""], ["Richter", "Georg", ""], ["Sezer", "Ugur", ""], ["Rodewald", "Jonas H.", ""], ["Geyer", "Philipp", ""], ["Martinez", "Todd.
