The unitary operator implementing\nthis transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit\nelementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum\nIsing model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions,\nexactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use\nof postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the\nfamed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they\npermit to completely {\\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}. The\nnumber of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature,\nthe accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious\ntemperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the\ncomplexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of\npatterns polynomial in the number of qubits.

Here we present a test of the CHSH Bell inequality on photon pairs\nin maximally entangled states of polarization in which a value 2.82759+-0.00051\nis observed, violating Grinbaum's bound by 4.3 standard deviations and\nproviding the smallest distance with respect to Tsirelson's bound ever\nreported, namely, 0.00084+-0.00051. This sets a new lower experimental bound\nfor Tsirelson's bound, strengthening the value of principles that predict\nTsirelson's bound as possible explanations of all natural limits of\ncorrelations, and has important consequences for cryptographic security,\nrandomness certification, characterization of physical properties in\ndevice-independent scenarios, and certification of quantum computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 11:10:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2015 21:28:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Poh", "Hou Shun", ""], ["Joshi", "Siddarth K.", ""], ["Cer\u00e9", "Alessandro", ""], ["Cabello", "Ad\u00e1n", ""], ["Kurtsiefer", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.01889", "submitter": "Charbel Tannous", "authors": "C.

Here we\nintroduce a family of models that is able to interpolate between a recently\nproposed set of lattice models with Laughlin-like ground states constructed\nfrom conformal field theory and models with ground states that are practically\nthe usual bosonic/fermionic Laughlin states in the continuum. Both the ground\nstate and the Hamiltonian are known analytically, and we find that the\nHamiltonian in the continuum limit does not coincide with the usual delta\ninteraction Hamiltonian for the Laughlin states. We introduce quasiholes into\nthe models and show analytically that their braiding properties are as expected\nif the quasiholes are screened. We demonstrate screening numerically for the\n1/3 Laughlin model and find that the quasiholes are slightly smaller in the\ncontinuum than in the lattice. Finally, we compute the effective magnetic field\nfelt by the quasiholes and show that it is close to uniform when approaching\nthe continuum limit. The techniques presented here to interpolate between the\nlattice and the continuum can also be applied to other fractional quantum Hall\nstates that are constructed from conformal field theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:18:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 19:31:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Ivan D.", ""], ["Nielsen", "Anne E.

To identify the key issues and the contributing\nfactors that may permit `hot entanglement' to exist, or the lack thereof, we\ncarry out a model study of two spatially-separated, coupled oscillators in a\nshared bath depicted by a finite-temperature scalar field.

In the\nconstruction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly\nused to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic\ngates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and\nFredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be\nexpensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla\nbits a practical topic.\n  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single\nbase gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of\nthe 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three\nmain results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can\ngenerate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated\nToffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations\nusing no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative\nreversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known\nresult for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known\nresult for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is\ntrivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove\ntheir optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible\ngates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We\nalso explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new\nconcept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an\nunlimited number of borrowed bits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 19:12:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Siyao", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03791", "submitter": "Avik Dutt", "authors": "Avik Dutt, Steven Miller, Kevin Luke, Jaime Cardenas, Alexander L.\n  Gaeta, Paulo Nussenzveig, Michal Lipson", "title": "Tunable Squeezing Using Coupled Ring Resonators on a Silicon Nitride\n  Chip", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Optics Letters, Vol. 41, Issue 2, pp. 223-226 (2016)", "doi": "10.1364/OL.41.000223", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate continuous tuning of the squeezing level generated in a\ndouble-ring optical parametric oscillator by externally controlling the\ncoupling condition using electrically controlled integrated microheaters.

In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of\nthe data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably\ncontains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness\ncan be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to\nproper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in\nprinciple be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as\nlong as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all\nthe information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of\nextracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it\nreduces the computational time of the extraction.\n  Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices\nand the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies. We show that indeed\nalmost all the randomness is present in the pair of outcomes for which at least\none detection happened. We further show that in some cases applying a\npre-processing on the data can capture features that an analysis based on\nglobal frequencies only misses, thus resulting in the certification of more\nrandomness.

Using two complimentary\nvariational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics\ndriven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to\ndestroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest\nneighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where\nthe total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is\nmodulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields,\nnext nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder\nphase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is\nmodulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection\nsymmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space.

We consider the\ngeneral multipartite case and take into account the possibility for dynamical\ncausal order, where the order of a set of events can depend on other events in\nthe past. Starting from a general definition of causality, we derive an\niteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal\nprocesses, and show that for a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each\nparty, the respective correlations form a polytope whose facets define causal\ninequalities. In the case of quantum processes, we investigate the link between\ncausality and the theory-dependent notion of causal separability, which we here\nextend to the multipartite case based on concrete principles. We show that\ncausality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an\nexample of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal\nbut not causally separable. We also show that there exist causally separable\n(and hence causal) quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by\nsupplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This example of activation of\nnon-causality motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly\ncausally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains\ninvariant under extension with arbitrary ancillas. We characterize the class of\ntripartite ECS processes in terms of simple conditions on the form of the\nprocess matrix, which generalize the form of bipartite causally separable\nprocess matrices.

We also present a\ngreedy quantum measurement scheme to efficiently procure the alignment from the\noutput state of the phase estimation algorithm where the eigenvector is encoded\nas the amplitudes of this state.

One fundamental aspect of\nresonance fluorescence, reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon\nstream from an atom in free space, was predicted more than 30 years ago.\nHowever, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together\nwith the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection\nefficiencies, has continued to cast stringent experimental conditions for the\nobservation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to\nsacrifice antibunching due to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic\nensembles or multiphoton transitions inside optical cavities. Here, we use an\nartificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of\nthe photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart and reach the\nnecessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single\nresonance-fluorescence photons.

An\nalternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the\nnoise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem.

Therefore,\nthe increased complexity of the fluxonium qubit does not constitute by itself a\nmajor obstacle for its use in quantum computation architectures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 12:10:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Viola", "G.", ""], ["Catelani", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08608", "submitter": "Sergey Knysh", "authors": "Sergey Knysh", "title": "Computational Bottlenecks of Quantum Annealing", "comments": "9 pages of main text + 3 pages of supplementary info, 5 figures;\n  added discussion, updated references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.dis-nn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A promising approach to solving hard binary optimisation problems is quantum\nadiabatic annealing (QA) in a transverse magnetic field.

Our work lays the ground for\nfuture quantum simulations of other, more involved, impurity models with\nsuperconducting circuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 15:03:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Haeberlein", "Max", ""], ["Deppe", "Frank", ""], ["Kurcz", "Andreas", ""], ["Goetz", "Jan", ""], ["Baust", "Alexander", ""], ["Eder", "Peter", ""], ["Fedorov", "Kirill", ""], ["Fischer", "Michael", ""], ["Menzel", "Edwin P.", ""], ["Schwarz", "Manuel J.", ""], ["Wulschner", "Friedrich", ""], ["Xie", "Edwar", ""], ["Zhong", "Ling", ""], ["Solano", "Enrique", ""], ["Marx", "Achim", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Ripoll", "Juan-Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Gross", "Rudolf", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.09131", "submitter": "Sebastian Deffner", "authors": "Sebastian Deffner and Avadh Saxena", "title": "Quantum work statistics of charged Dirac particles in time-dependent\n  fields", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures; published version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The variational principle of this model has a specific form which\nis characteristic for extremal four-dimensional hypersurface or hyper-film in\nfive-dimensional space-time. Obtained solutions are singular solitons\npropagating with speed of light and having energy, momentum, and angular\nmomentum which can be calculated for explicit conditions. Such solitons will be\ncalled the lightlike ones. The soliton singularity has a form of moving\ntwo-dimensional surface or shell. The lightlike soliton can have a set of\ntubelike singular shells with the appropriate cavities. A twisted lightlike\nsoliton is considered. It is notable that its energy is proportional to its\nangular momentum in high-frequency approximation. A case with one tubelike\ncavity is considered. In this case the soliton shell is diffeomorphic to a\ncylindrical surface with threads by multifilar helix. The shell transverse size\nof the appropriate finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity.\nThe ideal gas of such lightlike solitons with minimal twist parameter is\nconsidered in a finite volume. Explicit conditions provide that the angular\nmomentum of each soliton in the volume equals Planck constant. The equilibrium\nenergy spectral density for the solitons is obtained. It has the form of Planck\ndistribution in some approximation. A beam of the twisted lightlike solitons is\nconsidered. The representation of arbitrary polarization for the beam with the\ntwisted lightlike solitons is discussed. It is shown that the effect of\nmechanical angular momentum transfer to absorbent by the circularly polarized\nbeam can be provided. This effect is well known for photon beam. Thus the\nsoliton solution which have determinate likeness with photon is obtained in\nparticular.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 16:07:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2015 18:16:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 06:24:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2015 19:22:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2015 18:52:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 12:18:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:01:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2019 12:56:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chernitskii", "Alexander A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.09149", "submitter": "Ranchu Mathew", "authors": "Ranchu Mathew, Avinash Kumar, Stephen Eckel, Fred Jendrzejewski,\n  Gretchen K.
