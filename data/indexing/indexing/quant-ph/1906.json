On one hand, when compared with the scheme that has taking\nfully consideration of classical side information but not quantum one, our\nscheme achieves higher fidelity. Inversely, when the scheme with quantum side\ninformation but not classical one is considered, our scheme also has nontrivial\nimprovement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 07:29:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Ya", ""], ["Gao", "Fei", ""], ["Li", "DanDan", ""], ["Wen", "QiaoYan", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.00610", "submitter": "Peng Wang", "authors": "P.

In large ensembles, their\ncontrol and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, e.g. in\nchemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear spins also featured\nin early ideas and demonstrations of quantum information processing. Scaling up\nthese ideas requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when\ncoupled to an electron. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating\nmagnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices,\nbecause the field cannot be localized or screened. Control via electric fields\nwould resolve this problem, but previous methods relied upon transducing\nelectric signals into magnetic fields via the electron-nuclear hyperfine\ninteraction, which severely affects the nuclear coherence.

The spin\ndephasing time, 0.1 seconds, surpasses by orders of magnitude those obtained\nvia methods that require a coupled electron spin for electrical drive.

This speedup in the\nquantum setting contrasts with the case of the standard CONGEST model, for\nwhich Elkin et al. (PODC 2014) showed that quantum communication does not offer\nsignificant advantages over classical communication.\n  Our quantum algorithm is based on a relationship discovered by Vassilevska\nWilliams and Williams (JACM 2018) between the APSP and the detection of\nnegative triangles in a graph. The quantum part of our algorithm exploits the\nframework for quantum distributed search recently developed by Le Gall and\nMagniez (PODC 2018). Our main technical contribution is a method showing how to\nimplement multiple quantum searches (one for each edge in the graph) in\nparallel without introducing congestions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2019 07:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Izumi", "Taisuke", ""], ["Gall", "Fran\u00e7ois Le", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.02518", "submitter": "Anne Ersbak Bang Nielsen", "authors": "L.

For general systems, it is proved that M-contextuality is\nequivalent to the property that any model of a system must contain \"hidden\ninfluences\", meaning direct influences that go in opposite directions for\ndifferent latent states, or equivalently signaling between observers that\ncarries no information.

A chief concern is the detection of\nprimordial `quantum nonequilibrium', since this is observably distinct from\ntextbook quantum physics. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 are adaptations of references\n[1,2,3], and [4] respectively.\n  Chapter 2 proposes (information) entropy conservation as a minimal\nrequirement for a theory to feature classical-style thermodynamic relaxation.\nThe resulting structure is dubbed `the iRelax framework'. Both classical\nmechanics and de Broglie-Bohm quantum theory are shown to be special cases.\nIndications for a possible extension or unification of de Broglie-Bohm theory\nare briefly highlighted.\n  Chapter 3 examines ways in which quantum relaxation may be prevented. The\nmethod of the drift-field is introduced. A systematic treatment of nodes is\ngiven. A category of quantum states is found for which relaxation is\nsignificantly impeded, and may not complete at all.\n  Chapters 4 and 5 consider the possibility that primordial quantum\nnonequilibrium may be conserved in the statistics of a species of relic\ncosmological particle. Necessary factors for this to be the case are discussed\nand illustrative scenarios are given both in terms of nonequilibrium particles\ncreated by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes for species that\ndecoupled close to the Planck temperature.

Properties (iii)-(iv) establish a firm connection\nbetween cMERA and cMPS wavefunctionals, opening the path to applying powerful\ncMPS numerical techniques, valid for interacting QFTs, also to cMERA\ncalculations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2019 18:26:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zou", "Yijian", ""], ["Ganahl", "Martin", ""], ["Vidal", "Guifre", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.04234", "submitter": "Dana Faiez", "authors": "Dana Faiez and Dominik \\v{S}afr\\'anek", "title": "How much entanglement can be created in a closed system?", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures. v2: extended numerical simulations, now including\n  cases with no interaction and no hopping, extended discussion, added\n  evaluation of the bound in the thermodynamic limit", "journal-ref": "Phys.

For two\ndifferent drivings (harmonic driving and periodic kicking through pulses) of\nsystems with linear dispersion we demonstrate the existence of such\noscillations, both by directly propagating wave packets and based on a\ncomplementary Floquet analysis. The Floquet oscillations feature richer\noscillation patterns than their Bloch counterpart and enable the imaging of\nFloquet bands. Moreover, their period can be directly tuned through the driving\nfrequency. Such oscillations should be experimentally observable in effective\nDirac systems, such as graphene, when illuminated with circularly polarized\nlight.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jun 2019 08:49:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 12:17:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Junk", "Vanessa", ""], ["Reck", "Phillipp", ""], ["Gorini", "Cosimo", ""], ["Richter", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.04478", "submitter": "Daniel Manzano", "authors": "Daniel Manzano", "title": "A short introduction to the Lindblad Master Equation", "comments": "Pedagogical paper, aimed to people which knowledge about quantum\n  mechanics but not previous background about quantum master equations", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.5115323", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The theory of open quantum system is one of the most essential tools for the\ndevelopment of quantum technologies.

We present a proof\nof Fine's theorem for the case of measurements on a dichotomic variable at an\nabitrary number of times, thereby generalizing the familiar proofs for three\nand four times. We demonstrate how the LG framework and Fine's theorem can be\nextended to the case in which all possible two-time correlation functions are\nmeasured (instead of the partial set of two-time correlators normally studied).\nWe examine the limit of a large number of measurements for both of the above\ncases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:01:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:26:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Halliwell", "J.

A sample containing nuclear spins is\ndirectly attached on the FQ, and the FQ is used as a magnetometer to detect\nmagnetic fields from the nuclear spins.

Such an inhomogeneity causes a change\nin the DC magnetic flux penetrating a loop of the FQ, which can be detected by\na standard Ramsey measurement on the FQ. The other approach is to use a\ndynamical decoupling on the FQ to measure AC magnetic fields induced by Larmor\nprecession of the nuclear spins.

The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all\nregimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in the area of quantum\ntechnologies.

In order to distill more\ncoherence from a state of interest, a catalytic system can be involved and a\njointly free operation is applied to both systems. The joint output state\nshould be a maximally coherent state in tensor product with the unchanged\ncatalysts, with some allowable fidelity error. We consider several different\ndefinitions of this problem. Firstly, with a small fidelity error in both\nsystems, we show that, even via the smallest free operation class (PIO), the\ndistillable coherence of any state with no restriction on the catalysts is\ninfinite, which is a \"coherence embezzling phenomenon\". We then define and\ncalculate a lower bound for the distillable coherence when the dimension of\ncatalysts is restricted. Finally, in consideration of physical relevance, we\ndefine the \"perfect catalysts\" scenario where the catalysts are required to be\npure and precisely unchanged. Interestingly, we show that in this setting\ncatalysts basically provide no advantages in pure state distillation via IO and\nSIO under certain smoothing restriction. Our work enhances the understanding of\ncatalytic effect in quantum resource theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:10:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Senrui", ""], ["Zhang", "Xingjian", ""], ["Zhou", "You", ""], ["Zhao", "Qi", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.09091", "submitter": "Pavel Exner", "authors": "Pavel Exner and Jiri Lipovsky", "title": "Spectral asymptotics of the Laplacian on Platonic solids graphs", "comments": "25 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.5116100", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.SP math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the high-energy eigenvalue asymptotics quantum graphs\nconsisting of the vertices and edges of the five Platonic solids considering\ntwo different types of the vertex coupling.

Yet, quantum teleportation in principle\nallows for a faithful and disembodied transmission of unknown quantum states\nbetween distant quantum systems using entanglement. There have been numerous\nexperiments on teleportation of quantum states of single photons, atoms,\ntrapped ions, defects in solid states, and superconducting circuits. However,\nall demonstrations to date were limited to a two-dimensional\nsubspace$-$so-called qubit$-$of the quantized multiple levels of the quantum\nsystems. In general, a quantum particle can naturally possess not only multiple\ndegrees of freedom, but also, many degrees of freedom can have high quantum\nnumber beyond the simplified two-level subspace. Here, making use of multiport\nbeam-splitters and ancillary single photons, we propose a resource-efficient\nand extendable scheme for teleportation of arbitrarily high-dimensional\nphotonic quantum states. We report the first experimental teleportation of a\nqutrit, which is equivalent to a spin-1 system. Measurements over a complete\nset of 12 states in mutually unbiased bases yield a teleportation fidelity of\n0.75(1), well above the optimal single-copy qutrit-state-estimation limit of\n1/2. The fidelity also exceeds the limit of 2/3, the maximum possible for\nexplanation through qubits only. Thus, we strictly prove a genuine\nthree-dimensional, universal, and highly non-classical quantum teleportation.\nCombining previous methods of teleportation of two-particle composite states\nand multiple degrees of freedom, our work provides a complete toolbox for\nteleporting a quantum particle intact. We expect that our results will pave the\nway for quantum technology applications in high dimensions, since teleportation\nplays a central role in quantum repeaters and quantum networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2019 03:06:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2019 02:05:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Yi-Han", ""], ["Zhong", "Han-Sen", ""], ["Erhard", "Manuel", ""], ["Wang", "Xi-Lin", ""], ["Peng", "Li-Chao", ""], ["Krenn", "Mario", ""], ["Jiang", "Xiao", ""], ["Li", "Li", ""], ["Liu", "Nai-Le", ""], ["Lu", "Chao-Yang", ""], ["Zeilinger", "Anton", ""], ["Pan", "Jian-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.09737", "submitter": "Thomas Guff", "authors": "Thomas Guff, Yuval R.

Following Allen et\nal., Phys. Rev.

We show that any unitary\nquantum circuit has a causal structure corresponding to a directed acyclic\ngraph, and that when marginalising over local noise sources, the resulting\nquantum process satisfies a Markov condition with respect to the graph. We also\nprove a converse to this statement. We introduce an intrinsically quantum\nnotion that plays a role analogous to the conditional independence of classical\nvariables, and (generalizing a central theorem of the classical framework) show\nthat d-separation is sound and complete for it in the quantum case. We present\ngeneralizations of the three rules of the classical do-calculus, in each case\nrelating a property of the causal structure to a formal property of the quantum\nprocess, and to an operational statement concerning the outcomes of\ninterventions.

This code\noutperforms the previous 9-qutrit code in (i) the number of qutrits required\nfor encoding, (ii) our code can correct any arbitrary $(3 \\times 3)$ error,\n(ii) our code can readily correct bit errors in a single step as opposed to the\ntwo-step correction used previously, and (iii) phase error correction does not\nrequire correcting individual subspaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2019 14:49:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2019 05:28:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2019 03:07:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 02:23:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Majumdar", "Ritajit", ""], ["Sur-Kolay", "Susmita", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11146", "submitter": "Danna Rosenberg", "authors": "D.

Thus, deviation of the estimated single photon yield and single photon\nerror rate from their respective true values due to finite sample size can\nseriously lower the provably secure key rate $R$. Current method to obtain a\nlower bound of $R$ follows an indirect path by first bounding the yields and\nerror rates both conditioned on the type of decoy used. These bounds are then\nused to deduce the single photon yield and error rate, which in turn are used\nto calculate a lower bound of the key rate $R$. Here we report an improved\nversion of McDiarmid inequality in statistics and show how use it to directly\ncompute a lower bound of $R$ via the so-called centering sequence. A novelty in\nthis work is the optimization of the bound through the freedom of choosing\npossible centering sequences. The provably secure key rate of realistic 100~km\nlong quantum channel obtained by our method is at least twice that of the\nstate-of-the-art procedure when the raw key length $\\ell_\\text{raw}$ is\n$\\approx 10^5$ to $10^6$.
