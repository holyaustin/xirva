To illustrate the point I introduce\na toy model of a detector. The form of the model follows common practice in\nquantum optics and cavity QED. Each detector atom can be resonantly excited by\nthe incoming particle, and then emit a detection signature (e.g. bright flash\nof light) or dissipate its energy thermally. Different atoms have slightly\ndifferent resonant energies per the isolated-levels assumption, and the\nprojectile preferentially excites the atom with the closest energy match.

However, it is unclear how much this improvement\npersists when realistic circuit level noise is taken into account. This is\nbecause implementations of gates which do not commute with the dominant error\nun-bias the noise channel. In particular, a native bias-preserving\ncontrolled-NOT (CX) gate, which is an essential ingredient of stabilizer codes,\nis not possible in strictly two-level systems. Here we overcome the challenge\nof implementing a bias-preserving CX gate by using stabilized cat qubits in\ndriven nonlinear oscillators. The physical noise channel of this qubit is\nbiased towards phase-flips, which increase linearly with the size of the cat,\nwhile bit-flips are exponentially suppressed with cat size. Remarkably, the\nerror channel of this native CX gate between two such cat qubits is also\ndominated by phase-flips, while bit-flips remain exponentially suppressed. This\nCX gate relies on the topological phase that arises from the rotation of the\ncat qubit in phase space. The availability of bias-preserving CX gates opens a\npath towards fault-tolerant codes tailored to biased-noise cat qubits with high\nthreshold and low overhead. As an example, we analyze a scheme for concatenated\nerror correction using cat qubits. We find that the availability of CX gates\nwith moderately sized cat qubits, having mean photon number <10, improves a\nrigorous lower bound on the fault-tolerance threshold by a factor of two and\ndecreases the overhead in logical Clifford operations by a factor of 5. We\nexpect these estimates to improve significantly with further optimization and\nwith direct use of other codes such as topological codes tailored to biased\nnoise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 18:57:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Puri", "Shruti", ""], ["St-Jean", "Lucas", ""], ["Gross", "Jonathan A.", ""], ["Grimm", "Alexander", ""], ["Frattini", "N.

Thus it\nbecomes important to generate contextual sets of arbitrary structure and\ncomplexity to enable a variety of implementations. In recent years, such\ngeneration has been done for contextual sets known as Kochen-Specker sets. Up\nto now, two approaches have been used for massive generation of non-isomorphic\nKochen-Specker sets: exhaustive generation up to a given size and downward\ngeneration from master sets and their associated coordinatizations. Master sets\nwere obtained earlier from serendipitous or intuitive connections with\npolytopes or Pauli operators, and more recently from arbitrary vector\ncomponents using an algorithm that generates orthogonal vector groupings from\nthem.

Our method provides a\nframework for studying the role of quantum correlations other than quantum\nentanglement for machine learning applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 23:44:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2019 04:15:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ghobadi", "Roohollah", ""], ["Oberoi", "Jaspreet S.", ""], ["Zahedinejhad", "Ehsan", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01394", "submitter": "Olivier Dore", "authors": "Roland de Putter, Olivier Dor\\'e", "title": "In search of an observational quantum signature of the primordial\n  perturbations in slow-roll and ultra slow-roll inflation", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures.

A key role in this transition is played by\nsqueezing of the quantum state, which is a result of the strong suppression of\nthe decaying mode component of the perturbations. Motivated by ever improving\nmeasurements of the cosmological perturbations, we ask whether there are\nscenarios where this decaying mode is nevertheless still observable in the late\nUniverse, ideally leading to a ``smoking gun'' signature of the quantum nature\nof the perturbations. We address this question by evolving the quantum state of\nthe perturbations from inflation into the post-inflationary Universe. After\nrecovering the standard result that in slow-roll (SR) inflation the decaying\nmode is indeed hopelessly suppressed by the time the perturbations are observed\n(by $\\sim 115$ orders of magnitude), we turn to ultra slow-roll (USR)\ninflation, a scenario in which the usual decaying mode actually grows on\nsuper-horizon scales. Despite this drastic difference in the behavior of the\nmode functions, we find also in USR that the late-Universe decaying mode\namplitude is dramatically suppressed, in fact by the same $\\sim 115$ orders of\nmagnitude. We finally explain that this large suppression is a general result\nthat holds beyond the SR and USR scenarios considered and follows from a\nmodified version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the observed\namplitude of the primordial power spectrum. The classical behavior of the\nperturbations is thus closely related to the classical behavior of macroscopic\nobjects drawing an analogy with the position of a massive particle, the\ncurvature perturbations today have an enormous effective mass of order $m_{\\rm\npl}^2/H_0^2 \\sim 10^{120}$, making them highly classical.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 May 2019 00:26:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["de Putter", "Roland", ""], ["Dor\u00e9", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01406", "submitter": "Nuno Dias", "authors": "Nuno Costa Dias and Joao Nuno Prata", "title": "Uncertainty relations for a non-canonical phase-space noncommutative\n  algebra", "comments": "32 pages", "journal-ref": "J.

Till now, the qubit initialization, control and\nreadout can be realized with relatively high fidelity and a programmable\ntwo-qubit quantum processor was even demonstrated. However, to further improve\nthe qubit quality and scale it up, there are still some challenges to resolve\nsuch as the improvement of readout method, material development and scalable\ndesigns. We discuss these issues and introduce the forefronts of progress.\nFinally, considering the positive trend of the research on semiconductor\nquantum devices and recent theoretical work on the applications of quantum\ncomputation, we anticipate that semiconductor quantum computation may develop\nfast and will have a huge impact on our lives in the near future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2019 03:38:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xin", ""], ["Li", "Hai-Ou", ""], ["Cao", "Gang", ""], ["Xiao", "Ming", ""], ["Guo", "Guang-Can", ""], ["Guo", "Guo-Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01609", "submitter": "Chu Guo", "authors": "Chu Guo, Dario Poletti", "title": "Matrix Product States with adaptive global symmetries", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The protocols achieving\nthe best compression use many more qubits of shared entanglement than the\nnumber of qubits in the states in the ensemble. Other compression protocols,\nwith potentially larger communication cost, have entanglement cost bounded by\nthe number of qubits in the given states. This motivates the question as to\nwhether entanglement is truly necessary for compression, and if so, how much of\nit is needed.\n  Motivated by questions in communication complexity, we lift certain\nrestrictions that are placed on compression protocols in tasks such as\nstate-splitting and channel simulation. We show that an ensemble of the form\ndesigned by Jain, Radhakrishnan, and Sen (ICALP'03) saturates the known bounds\non the sum of communication and entanglement costs, even with the relaxed\ncompression protocols we study.\n  The ensemble and the associated one-way communication protocol have several\nremarkable properties. The ensemble is incompressible by more than a constant\nnumber of qubits without shared entanglement, even when constant error is\nallowed.

The correlated and entangled\nsingle photons and single phonons, i.e., single entangled photon-phonon pairs,\ncan be generated in both the weak and strong tripartite interaction regimes.\nOur results may have important applications in the development of highly\ncomplex quantum networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2019 10:25:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Xun-Wei", ""], ["Shi", "Hai-Quan", ""], ["Liao", "Jie-Qiao", ""], ["Chen", "Ai-Xi", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.02457", "submitter": "Emil Prodan Dr.", "authors": "Yifei Liu, Yingkai Liu, Emil Prodan", "title": "Braiding Flux-Tubes in Topological Quantum and Classical Lattice Models\n  from Class-D", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Annals of Physics 414, 168089 (2020)", "doi": "10.1016/j.aop.2020.168089", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use magnetic flux-tubes to stabilize zero-energy modes in a lattice\nrealization of a 2-dimensional superconductor from class D of classification\ntable of topological condensed matter systems.

P. Feynman. However, the huge computation time\nrequired for the PIMD reduces its range of applicability. Another drawback is\nthe requirement of additional techniques to access time correlation functions\n(ring polymer MD or centroid MD). We developed an alternative technique based\non a quantum thermal bath (QTB) which reduces the computation time by a factor\nof ~20. The QTB approach consists in a classical Langevin dynamics in which the\nwhite noise random force is replaced by a Gaussian random force having the\npower spectral density given by the quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\nThe method has yielded satisfactory results for weakly anharmonic systems: the\nquantum harmonic oscillator, the heat capacity of a MgO crystal, and isotope\neffects in 7 LiH and 7 LiD. Unfortunately, the QTB is subject to the problem of\nzero-point energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonic systems, which is\ninherent in the use of classical mechanics. Indeed, a part of the energy of the\nhigh-frequency modes is transferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a\nwrong energy distribution. We have shown that in order to reduce or even\neliminate ZPEL, it is sufficient to increase the value of the frictional\ncoefficient. Another way to solve the ZPEL problem is to combine the QTB and\nPIMD techniques. It requires the modification of the power spectral density of\nthe random force within the QTB. This combination can also be seen as a way to\nspeed up the PIMD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2019 13:05:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Dammak", "H.", "", "SPMS"], ["Hayoun", "M.", "", "LSI"], ["Brieuc", "F", "", "SPMS"], ["Geneste", "G.", "", "SPMS"]]}, {"id": "1905.02554", "submitter": "Anindya Banerji", "authors": "Anindya Banerji, Ali Anwar, Hrushikesh Sable, Nijil Lal and Ravindra\n  P.

This\nmodel illustrates the existence a new class of exactly solvable, interacting\nquantum systems specific to the Floquet setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2019 18:00:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Friedman", "Aaron J.", ""], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Sarang", ""], ["Vasseur", "Romain", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.03268", "submitter": "Alexander Jahn", "authors": "Alexander Jahn, Marek Gluza, Fernando Pastawski, Jens Eisert", "title": "Majorana dimers and holographic quantum error-correcting codes", "comments": "42 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This result, as well as a third order\nlinear recurrence in initial position $m$ of $P_n^{(m)}(1,0)$, was later proved\nby Bach and Borisov \\cite{bach09} using techniques from complex analysis. In\nthis paper we extend these results to general two state quantum walks and\nthree-state Grover walks, while providing a partial calculation for absorption\nin $d$-dimensional Grover walks by a $d-1$-dimensional wall. In the\none-dimensional cases, we prove partial reflection of information, a linear\nfractional recurrence in lattice size, and a linear recurrence in initial\nposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2019 16:14:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kuklinski", "Parker", ""], ["Kon", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.04250", "submitter": "Detlev Buchholz", "authors": "Detlev Buchholz and Klaus Fredenhagen", "title": "From path integrals to dynamical algebras: a macroscopic view of quantum\n  physics", "comments": "9 pages, no figures; v2: exposition improved, reference added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10701-020-00345-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph math-ph math.MP physics.hist-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The essence of the path integral method in quantum physics can be expressed\nin terms of two relations between unitary propagators, describing perturbations\nof the underlying system.

In the second set we use this trace\nestimation algorithm to distinguish between knots, a classically difficult task\nwhich is known to be complete for DQC1. Our results indicate that the main\nlimiting factor is the length of the circuit, and that both random and\nsystematic errors become an issue when the gate count increases. Surprisingly,\nwe find that at the same gate count wider circuits perform better, probably due\nto randomization of coherent errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2019 18:00:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00f6kta\u015f", "Oktay", ""], ["Tham", "W.

In this work we report on our investigation of\nthe quantum many-body dynamics of a large ensemble of bosonic magnetic chromium\natoms with spin S = 3 in a three-dimensional lattice as a function of lattice\ndepth. Using extensive theory and experimental comparisons we study the\ndynamics of the population of the different Zeeman levels and the total\nmagnetization of the gas across the superfluid to the Mott insulator\ntransition. We are able to identify two distinct regimes: At low lattice\ndepths, where atoms are in the superfluid regime, we observe that the spin\ndynamics is strongly determined by the competition between particle motion,\nonsite interactions and external magnetic field gradients. Contact spin\ndependent interactions help to stabilize the collective spin length, which sets\nthe total magnetization of the gas. On the contrary, at high lattice depths,\ntransport is largely frozen out. In this regime, while the spin populations are\nmainly driven by long range dipolar interactions, magnetic field gradients also\nplay a major role in the total spin demagnetization. We find that dynamics at\nlow lattice depth is qualitatively reproduced by mean-field calculations based\non the Gutzwiller ansatz; on the contrary, only a beyond mean-field theory can\naccount for the dynamics at large lattice depths. While the cross-over between\nthese two regimes does not correspond to sharp features in the observed\ndynamical evolution of the spin components, our simulations indicate that it\nwould be better revealed by measurements of the collective spin length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2019 03:53:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Fersterer", "Petra", ""], ["Safavi-Naini", "Arghavan", ""], ["Zhu", "Bihui", ""], ["Gabardos", "Lucas", ""], ["Lepoutre", "Steven", ""], ["Vernac", "L.", ""], ["Laburthe-Tolra", "B.", ""], ["Blakie", "P.

In this study, a harmonic driving field is added to a Rabi\ndimer to engineer photon and qubit dynamics in a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics device. To model environmental effects, qubits in the Rabi\ndimer are coupled to a phonon bath with a sub-Ohmic spectral density. A\nnon-perturbative treatment, the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational\nprinciple together with the multiple Davydov D$_2$ {\\it Ansatz} is employed to\nexplore the dynamical behavior of the tunable Rabi dimer. In the absence of the\nphonon bath, the amplitude damping of the photon number oscillation is greatly\nsuppressed by the driving field, and photons can be created thanks to\nresonances between the periodic driving field and the photon frequency.

In the quantum realm, the many-body\nlocalization (MBL) was proposed to be the paradigmatic ergodicity breaking\nphenomenon, which extends the concept of Anderson localization to interacting\nsystems. At the same time, random matrix theory has established a powerful\nframework for characterizing the onset of quantum chaos and ergodicity (or the\nabsence thereof) in quantum many-body systems. Here we numerically study the\nspectral statistics of disordered interacting spin chains, which represent\nprototype models expected to exhibit MBL. We study the ergodicity indicator\n$g=\\log_{10}(t_{\\rm H}/t_{\\rm Th})$, which is defined through the ratio of two\ncharacteristic many-body time scales, the Thouless time $t_{\\rm Th}$ and the\nHeisenberg time $t_{\\rm H}$, and hence resembles the logarithm of the\ndimensionless conductance introduced in the context of Anderson localization.\nWe argue that the ergodicity breaking transition in interacting spin chains\noccurs when both time scales are of the same order, $t_{\\rm Th} \\approx t_{\\rm\nH}$, and $g$ becomes a system-size independent constant. Hence, the ergodicity\nbreaking transition in many-body systems carries certain analogies with the\nAnderson localization transition. Intriguingly, using a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless correlation length we observe a scaling\nsolution of $g$ across the transition, which allows for detection of the\ncrossing point in finite systems.

In this paper, a space of\ninaccessible conceptual variables is defined, and group actions are defined on\nthis space. Accessible functions are then defined on the same space. Assuming\nthis structure, the basic Hilbert space structure of quantum theory is derived:\nOperators on a Hilbert space corresponding to the accessible variables are\nintroduced; when these operators have a discrete spectrum, a natural model\nreduction implies a new model in which the values of the accessible variables\nare the eigenvalues of the operator. The principle behind this model reduction\ndemands that a group action may also be defined also on the accessible\nvariables; this is possible if the corresponding functions are permissible, a\nterm that is precisely defined. The following recent principle from statistics\nis assumed: every model reduction should be to an orbit or to a set of orbits\nof the group.

In recent years, there has been\nmuch effort to understand the process of thermalization in strongly interacting\nquantum systems that often lack an obvious semiclassical limit. Time-dependent\nvariational principle (TDVP) allows to systematically derive an effective\nclassical (nonlinear) dynamical system by projecting unitary many-body dynamics\nonto a manifold of weakly-entangled variational states. We demonstrate that\nsuch dynamical systems generally possess mixed phase space. When TDVP errors\nare small, the mixed phase space leaves a footprint on the exact dynamics of\nthe quantum model. For example, when the system is initialized in a state\nbelonging to a stable periodic orbit or the surrounding regular region, it\nexhibits persistent many-body quantum revivals. As a proof of principle, we\nidentify new types of \"quantum many-body scars\", i.e., initial states that lead\nto long-time oscillations in a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in one and\ntwo dimensions. Intriguingly, the initial states that give rise to most robust\nrevivals are typically entangled states. On the other hand, even when TDVP\nerrors are large, as in the thermalizing tilted-field Ising model, initializing\nthe system in a regular region of phase space leads to slowdown of\nthermalization. Our work establishes TDVP as a method for identifying\ninteracting quantum systems with anomalous dynamics in arbitrary dimensions.\nMoreover, the mixed-phase space classical variational equations allow to find\nslowly-thermalizing initial conditions in interacting models.

Also, since the spatial degrees of freedom can be viewed as a noisy\nchannel for the two-spin part, one may wonder how other nonclassical aspects,\nsuch as Bell nonlocality, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, quantum discord,\nand symmetrical quantum discord, evolve in time during the walk.

Here, we theoretically analyze and optimize the\ndispersive readout of a single spin in a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD)\ncoupled to a microwave resonator via its electric dipole moment. The strong\nspin-photon coupling arises from the motion of the electron spin in a local\nmagnetic field gradient.

We find that while the cooperativity increases with the\nstrength of the dipole coupling between the DQD and the resonator, it does not\ndepend on the strength of the magnetic field gradient. We then optimize the SNR\nas a function of experimentally tunable DQD parameters. We identify wide\nregions of parameter space where the unwanted backaction of the resonator\nphotons on the qubit is small.

For some special cases and small systems, such as two-qubit\nsystems and some X-states, the explicit solutions have been calculated.\nHowever, for general cases, we still know very little. Therefore, we study the\nfeasibility of estimating quantum discord by machine learning method on\ntwo-qubit systems. In order to get an interpretable and high performance model,\nwe modify the ordinary neural network by introducing some prior knowledge which\ncome from the analysis about quantum discord. Our results show that prior\nknowledge actually improve the performance of neural network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 May 2019 10:31:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yong-Lei", ""], ["Wang", "An-Min", ""], ["Wang", "Guo-Dong", ""], ["Sun", "Yi", ""], ["Zhang", "Peng-Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.10791", "submitter": "Mark Jen-Hao Ku", "authors": "Mark J.H.

Here, we observe both a\nspin-dependent torque and spin-cooling of the motion of a trapped microdiamond.\nUsing a combination of microwave and laser excitation enables the spin of\nnitrogen-vacancy centers to act on the diamond orientation and to cool the\ndiamond libration via a dynamical back-action. Further, driving the system in\nthe non-linear regime, we demonstrate bistability and self-sustained coherent\noscillations stimulated by the spin-mechanical coupling, which offers prospects\nfor spin-driven generation of non-classical states of motion. Such a levitating\ndiamond operated as a compass with controlled dissipation has implications in\nhigh-precision torque sensing, emulation of the spin-boson problem and probing\nof quantum phase transitions. In the single spin limit and employing ultra-pure\nnano-diamonds, it will allow quantum non-demolition read-out of the spin of\nnitrogen-vacancy centers under ambient conditions, deterministic entanglement\nbetween distant individual spins and matter-wave interferometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2019 21:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2019 17:05:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Delord", "T.", ""], ["Huillery", "P.", ""], ["Nicolas", "L.", ""], ["H\u00e9tet", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11521", "submitter": "Bruno Amorim", "authors": "Beatriz A.

The key constituents of this resource theory are\nquantum boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum states, which can be manipulated\nfor free by means of an arbitrary quantum channel. We introduce bits of\nasymmetric distinguishability as the basic currency in this resource theory,\nand we prove that it is a reversible resource theory in the asymptotic limit,\nwith the quantum relative entropy being the fundamental rate of resource\ninterconversion. The distillable distinguishability is the optimal rate at\nwhich a quantum box consisting of independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) states can be converted to bits of asymmetric distinguishability, and\nthe distinguishability cost is the optimal rate for the reverse transformation.\nBoth of these quantities are equal to the quantum relative entropy. The exact\none-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the min-relative entropy,\nand the exact one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the max-relative\nentropy. Generalizing these results, the approximate one-shot distillable\ndistinguishability is equal to the smooth min-relative entropy, and the\napproximate one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the smooth\nmax-relative entropy. As a notable application of the former results, we prove\nthat the optimal rate of asymptotic conversion from a pair of i.i.d. quantum\nstates to another pair of i.i.d. quantum states is fully characterized by the\nratio of their quantum relative entropies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 06:30:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2019 01:18:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:21:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11635", "submitter": "Matthew Coudron", "authors": "Matthew Coudron, William Slofstra", "title": "Complexity lower bounds for computing the approximately-commuting\n  operator value of non-local games to high precision", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of approximating the commuting-operator value of a\ntwo-player non-local game.

The ground state is a\nmacroscopic quantum superposition, or cat state, of two many-body states\ncollectively occupying opposite momentum eigenstates. Interactions give rise to\na reduction (or modified depletion) cloud that is common to both\nmacroscopically distinct states. Symmetry arguments permit a precise\nidentification of the two orthonormal macroscopic many-body branches which\ncombine to yield the ground state. In the ring, the system is sensitive to\nvariations of the effective flux but in such a way that the macroscopic\nsuperposition is preserved. We discuss other physical aspects that contribute\nto protect the cat-like nature of the ground state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 13:03:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2019 14:07:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Pieplow", "G.", ""], ["Creffield", "C.

In essence, it aims\nto mimic the original problem by means of an 'augmented system', which includes\na suitably chosen collective environmental coordinate---the 'reaction\ncoordinate'. This composite then couples to a simpler 'residual reservoir' with\nshort-lived correlations. If, in addition, the residual coupling is weak, a\nsimple quantum master equation can be rigorously applied to the augmented\nsystem, and the solution of the original problem just follows from tracing out\nthe reaction coordinate. But, what if the residual dissipation is strong? Here\nwe consider an exactly solvable model for heat transport---a two-node linear\n\"quantum wire\" connecting two baths at different temperatures. We allow for a\nstructured spectral density at the interface with one of the reservoirs and\nperform the reaction-coordinate mapping, writing a perturbative master equation\nfor the augmented system. We find that: (a) strikingly, the stationary state of\nthe original problem can be reproduced accurately by a weak-coupling treatment\neven when the residual dissipation on the augmented system is very strong; (b)\nthe agreement holds throughout the entire dynamics under large residual\ndissipation in the overdamped regime; (c) and that such master equation can\ngrossly overestimate the stationary heat current across the wire, even when its\nnon-equilibrium steady state is captured faithfully. These observations can be\ncrucial when using the reaction-coordinate mapping to study the largely\nunexplored strong-coupling regime in quantum thermodynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 15:27:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2019 18:32:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2019 09:10:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Correa", "Luis A.", ""], ["Xu", "Buqing", ""], ["Morris", "Benjamin", ""], ["Adesso", "Gerardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.13712", "submitter": "Bradley Christensen", "authors": "B.
