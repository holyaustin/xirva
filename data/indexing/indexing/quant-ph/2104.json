Hybrid classical quantum algorithms such as\nthe variational quantum algorithms have been proposed to effectively use\ncurrent term quantum devices. One promising approach to quantum simulation in\nthe noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the diagonalisation based\napproach, with some of the promising examples being the subspace Variational\nQuantum Simulator (SVQS), Variational Fast Forwarding (VFF), fixed-state\nVariational Fast Forwarding (fs-VFF), and the Variational Hamiltonian\nDiagonalisation (VHD) algorithms. However, these algorithms require a feedback\nloop between the classical and quantum computers, which can be a crucial\nbottleneck in practical application. Here, we present the Classical Quantum\nFast Forwarding (CQFF) as an alternative diagonalisation based algorithm for\nquantum simulation. CQFF shares some similarities with SVQS, VFF, fs-VFF and\nVHD but removes the need for a classical-quantum feedback loop and controlled\nmulti-qubit unitaries. The CQFF algorithm does not suffer from the barren\nplateau problem and the accuracy can be systematically increased. Furthermore,\nif the Hamiltonian to be simulated is expressed as a linear combination of\ntensored-Pauli matrices, the CQFF algorithm reduces to the task of sampling\nsome many-body quantum state in a set of Pauli-rotated bases, which is easy to\ndo in the NISQ era. We run the CQFF algorithm on existing quantum processors\nand demonstrate the promise of the CQFF algorithm for current-term quantum\nhardware.

We detail methods for efficiently obtaining one- and two-point\ncorrelation functions of the decision boundary vectors of the quantum model,\nwhich can be used for model interpretability, as well as methods for obtaining\nclassifications from partial data vectors. Further, we show that the use of\nisometric tensors can significantly aid in the human interpretability of the\ncorrelation functions extracted from the decision weights, and may produce\nmodels that are less susceptible to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate\nour methodologies in applications utilizing the MNIST handwritten digit dataset\nand a multivariate timeseries dataset of human activity recognition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 02:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wall", "Michael L.", ""], ["D'Aguanno", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.02311", "submitter": "Inori Ueba", "authors": "Tomonori Inoue, Makoto Sakamoto, Inori Ueba", "title": "Instantons and Berry's connections on quantum graph", "comments": "18 pages, 3figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "KOBE-TH-21-01", "categories": "hep-th quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study non-Abelian Berry's connections in the parameter\nspace of boundary conditions for Dirac zero modes on quantum graphs.

It is\ntherefore imperative to understand how these fluctuations affect multi-qubit\ninteractions and, more importantly, to mitigate their influence. In this study,\nwe demonstrate how to implement dynamical-decoupling techniques to suppress the\ntwo-qubit analogue of the dephasing on a superconducting quantum device\nfeaturing a compact tunable coupler, a trending technology that enables the\nfast manipulation of qubit--qubit interactions. The pure-dephasing time shows\nan up to ~14 times enhancement on average when using robust sequences. The\nresults are in good agreement with the noise generated from room-temperature\ncircuits. Our study further reveals the decohering processes associated with\ntunable couplers and establishes a framework to develop gates and sequences\nrobust against two-qubit errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 16:58:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Qiu", "Jiawei", ""], ["Zhou", "Yuxuan", ""], ["Hu", "Chang-Kang", ""], ["Yuan", "Jiahao", ""], ["Zhang", "Libo", ""], ["Chu", "Ji", ""], ["Huang", "Wenhui", ""], ["Liu", "Weiyang", ""], ["Luo", "Kai", ""], ["Ni", "Zhongchu", ""], ["Pan", "Xianchuang", ""], ["Yang", "Zhixuan", ""], ["Zhang", "Yimeng", ""], ["Chen", "Yuanzhen", ""], ["Deng", "Xiu-Hao", ""], ["Hu", "Ling", ""], ["Li", "Jian", ""], ["Niu", "Jingjing", ""], ["Xu", "Yuan", ""], ["Yan", "Tongxing", ""], ["Zhong", "Youpeng", ""], ["Liu", "Song", ""], ["Yan", "Fei", ""], ["Yu", "Dapeng", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.02673", "submitter": "Thomas Barbara", "authors": "Thomas M.

With antilinear symmetry one must\ninstead build inner products out of ket vectors and their antilinear\nconjugates, and it is these inner products that would be time independent in\nthe non-Hermitian but antilinearly symmetric case even as the standard Dirac\ninner products would not be.

One\nexpects nonlocal correlations to fade away as $\\alpha$ increases, so the\nnatural question to ask is: what is the value of $\\alpha$ required to restore\nlocality, marking the quantum-to-classical transition? In a previous work [M.\nNavascu\\'{e}s and H. Wunderlich, Proc. R. Soc. A. $\\textbf{466}$: 881 (2010)]\nit was demonstrated that locality is restored at $\\alpha=1/2$ in the case of\n$independent$ $and$ $identically$ $distributed$ (IID) entangled pairs. Here we\nshow that this is no longer the case in the generic (non-IID) scenario, where\nthe Hilbert space structure of quantum theory, along with the superposition\nprinciple and the Born rule, can survive in the macroscopic limit. This leads\nstraightforwardly to a Bell violation for macroscopic observables, and thus the\nquestion of the quantum-to-classical transition remains open.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Apr 2021 18:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Gallego", "Miguel", ""], ["Daki\u0107", "Borivoje", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.04014", "submitter": "Ceyhun Bulutay", "authors": "Beyza S\\\"utl\\\"uo\\u{g}lu and Ceyhun Bulutay", "title": "Static synthetic gauge field control of double optomechanically induced\n  transparency in a closed-contour interaction scheme", "comments": "14 pages, 10 figures; two new appendices, 30 more references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph physics.optics", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We theoretically study an optical cavity and a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric pair\nof mechanical resonators, where all oscillators are pairwise coupled, forming\nan optomechanical system with a closed-contour interaction.

Furthermore, we study\ntwo-photon quantum correlations between 9 LG mode groups, demonstrating a\ncorrelation structure related to mode group order and inter-modal cross-talk.\nIn addition, we show how the noise-robustness of high-dimensional entanglement\ncertification can be significantly increased by using measurements in multiple\nLG mutually unbiased bases.

The key premise is\nthat physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as\ndevices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed.\nHowever, energetic impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate\nboth of these assumptions. An impinging particle ionizes the substrate,\nradiating high energy phonons that induce a burst of quasiparticles, destroying\nqubit coherence throughout the device.

Their analyses revealed highly non-trivial $m$-dependent rotational\ndynamics of the Landau electron, but the problem is that their papers give an\nimpression that the quantum number $m$ in the Landau eigen-states corresponds\nto a genuine observable. This compatibility problem between the gauge principle\nand the observability of the quantum number $m$ in the Landau eigen-states was\nattacked in our previous letter paper. In the present paper, we try to give\nmore convincing answer to this delicate problem of physics, especially by\npaying attention not only to the {\\it particle-like} aspect but also to the\n{\\it wave-like} aspect of the Landau electron.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 06:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wakamatsu", "M.", ""], ["Kitadono", "Y.", ""], ["Zou", "L. -P.", ""], ["Zhang", "P. -M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.10913", "submitter": "Dion Hartmann", "authors": "Dion Hartmann and Kevin Kavanagh and Stefan Vandoren", "title": "Entanglement Entropy with Lifshitz Fermions", "comments": "19 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph hep-th", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate fermions with Lifshitz scaling symmetry and study their\nentanglement entropy in 1+1 dimensions as a function of the scaling exponent\n$z$.

We analyze both non-relativistic and relativistic effects induced by\nthe underlying curved background on a superposed quantum system. In the\nnon-relativistic regime, it is possible to come across a gravitational\ncounterpart of the Bohm-Aharonov effect, which results in a phase shift\nproportional to the derivative of the modified Newtonian potential. On the\nother hand, beyond the Newtonian approximation, the relativistic nature of\ngravity plays a crucial r\\^ole. Indeed, the existence of a gravitational time\ndilation between the two arms of the interferometer causes a loss of coherence\nthat is in principle observable in quantum interference patterns. We work in\nthe context of generalized quadratic theories of gravity to compare their\nphysical predictions with the analogous outcomes in general relativity.

In this Tutorial, we provide a roadmap for the physics of\nnon-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the phase-space representations as a\nframework to describe the different properties of quantum states in\ncontinuous-variable systems. We then use this framework in various ways to\nexplore the structure of the state space. We explain how non-Gaussian states\ncan be characterised not only through the negative values of their Wigner\nfunction, but also via other properties such as quantum non-Gaussianity and the\nrelated stellar rank. For multimode systems, we are naturally confronted with\nthe question of how non-Gaussian properties behave with respect to quantum\ncorrelations. To answer this question, we first show how non-Gaussian states\ncan be created by performing measurements on a subset of modes in a Gaussian\nstate. Then, we highlight that these measured modes must be correlated via\nspecific quantum correlations to the remainder of the system to create quantum\nnon-Gaussian or Wigner-negative states. On the other hand, non-Gaussian\noperations are also shown to enhance or even create quantum correlations.\nFinally, we will demonstrate that Wigner negativity is a requirement to violate\nBell inequalities and to achieve a quantum computational advantage.

Here, we present a new\napproach for quantum self-testing in Bell non-locality scenarios, motivated by\nthe following observation: the quantum maximum of a given Bell inequality is,\nin general, difficult to characterize.

This graph-theoretic\nframework allows us to (i) recover the self-testability of several quantum\ncorrelations that are known to permit self-testing (like those violating the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and three-party Mermin Bell inequalities for\nprojective measurements of arbitrary rank, and chained Bell inequalities for\nrank-one projective measurements), (ii) prove the self-testability of quantum\ncorrelations that were not known using existing self-testing techniques (e.g.,\nthose violating the Abner Shimony Bell inequality for rank-one projective\nmeasurements).

One of the most important\nproblems in quantum causality is linked to this prominent aphorism that states\ncorrelation does not mean causation. A direct generalization of the existing\ncausal inference techniques to the quantum domain is not possible due to\nsuperposition and entanglement. We put forth a new theoretical framework for\nmerging quantum information science and causal inference by exploiting entropic\nprinciples. For this purpose, we leverage the concept of conditional density\nmatrices to develop a scalable algorithmic approach for inferring causality in\nthe presence of latent confounders (common causes) in quantum systems. We apply\nour proposed framework to an experimentally relevant scenario of identifying\nmessage senders on quantum noisy links, where it is validated that the input\nbefore noise as a latent confounder is the cause of the noisy outputs. We also\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the results of classical\ncausal inference even when the variables are classical by exploiting quantum\ndependence between variables through density matrices rather than joint\nprobability distributions. Thus, the proposed approach unifies classical and\nquantum causal inference in a principled way. This successful inference on a\nsynthetic quantum dataset can lay the foundations of identifying originators of\nmalicious activity on future multi-node quantum networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Apr 2021 22:45:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Javidian", "Mohammad Ali", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""], ["Jacob", "Zubin", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.13237", "submitter": "Hong-Bin Chen", "authors": "Hong-Bin Chen", "title": "Effects of symmetry breaking of the structurally-disordered Hamiltonian\n  ensembles on the anisotropic decoherence", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  It is commonly known that the dephasing in open quantum systems is due to the\nestablishment of bipartite correlations with an environment.
