Each visual modality captures\nspatial information at a particular spatial scale (such as motion of the upper\nbody or a hand), and the whole system operates at three temporal scales. Key to\nour technique is a training strategy which exploits: i) careful initialization\nof individual modalities; and ii) gradual fusion involving random dropping of\nseparate channels (dubbed ModDrop) for learning cross-modality correlations\nwhile preserving uniqueness of each modality-specific representation. We\npresent experiments on the ChaLearn 2014 Looking at People Challenge gesture\nrecognition track, in which we placed first out of 17 teams. Fusing multiple\nmodalities at several spatial and temporal scales leads to a significant\nincrease in recognition rates, allowing the model to compensate for errors of\nthe individual classifiers as well as noise in the separate channels.\nFuthermore, the proposed ModDrop training technique ensures robustness of the\nclassifier to missing signals in one or several channels to produce meaningful\npredictions from any number of available modalities. In addition, we\ndemonstrate the applicability of the proposed fusion scheme to modalities of\narbitrary nature by experiments on the same dataset augmented with audio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Dec 2014 09:55:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Jun 2015 14:46:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Neverova", "Natalia", ""], ["Wolf", "Christian", ""], ["Taylor", "Graham W.", ""], ["Nebout", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00149", "submitter": "Antonio Abreu", "authors": "Edson Lopes and Jos\\'e Caetano and Ant\\'onio Abreu and Frederico Grilo", "title": "iReclass - An automatic system for recording classes", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents the details of a system capable of recording on video a\ntraditional class.

The proposed three stage filter\nconsisting of partial differential equation based denoising, Kalman filter and\nmoving average method provides ~25% better noise reduction than other methods\naccording to Mean Squared Error (MSE) criterion in highly noise susceptible\nenvironments. Apart from synthetic data, we also obtained real world data like\nhand writing, finger/stylus drags etc. on touch screens in the presence of high\nnoise such as unauthorized charger noise or display noise and validated our\nalgorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs qualitatively better\nthan the existing solutions for touch panels of the high end hand held devices\navailable in the consumer electronics market qualitatively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 05:24:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Vanga", "Sandeep", ""], ["Jaganade", "Sachin", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05696", "submitter": "Panos Sakkos", "authors": "Panos Sakkos, Dimitrios Kotsakos, Ioannis Katakis, Dimitrios Gunopulos", "title": "Anima: Adaptive Personalized Software Keyboard", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a Software Keyboard for smart touchscreen devices that learns its\nowner's unique dictionary in order to produce personalized typing predictions.\nThe learning process is accelerated by analysing user's past typed\ncommunication.

Do recent events on the Comoros effect you in\nany subtle way? Who in your extended social network is in Croatia?

In this work we propose a recommendation\ntask of creating interest in little-known content by building personalized\n\"bridges\" to users. We consider an example task of interesting users in\nlittle-known countries, and propose a system which aggregates a user's Twitter\nprofile, network, and tweets to create an interest model, which is then matched\nto a library of knowledge about the countries. We perform a user study of 69\nparticipants and conduct 11 in-depth interviews in order to evaluate the\nefficacy of the proposed approach and gather qualitative insight into the\neffect of multi-faceted use of Twitter on the perception of the bridges. We\nfind the increase in interest concerning little-known content to greatly depend\non the pre-existing disposition to it. Additionally, we discover a set of vital\nproperties good bridges must possess, including recency, novelty, emotiveness,\nand a proper selection of language. Using the proposed approach we aim to\nharvest the \"invisible connections\" to make explicit the idea of a \"small\nworld\" where even a faraway country is more closely connected to you than you\nmight have imagined.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 09:37:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mejova", "Yelena", ""], ["Borge-Holthoefer", "Javier", ""], ["Weber", "Ingmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06313", "submitter": "Ioanna Lykourentzou", "authors": "Ioanna Lykourentzou, Angeliki Antoniou and Yannick Naudet", "title": "Matching or Crashing?
