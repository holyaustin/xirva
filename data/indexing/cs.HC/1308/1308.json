Previous research has suggested the importance of the first\nday to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth\nwithin that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The\nanalysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure\nof success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an\nofficial response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a\nparliamentary debate. We analyze the data through a multiplicative process\nmodel framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of signatures at the\npopulation level. We define and measure an average outreach factor for\npetitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1% after 10 hours).\nAfter 24 hours, a petition's fate is virtually set.

The popularity and promise of crowdsourcing\nmarkets has led to both empirical and theoretical research on the design of\nalgorithms to optimize various aspects of these markets, such as the pricing\nand assignment of tasks. Much of the existing theoretical work on crowdsourcing\nmarkets has focused on problems that fall into the broad category of online\ndecision making; task requesters or the crowdsourcing platform itself make\nrepeated decisions about prices to set, workers to filter out, problems to\nassign to specific workers, or other things. Often these decisions are complex,\nrequiring algorithms that learn about the distribution of available tasks or\nworkers over time and take into account the strategic (or sometimes irrational)\nbehavior of workers.\n  As human computation grows into its own field, the time is ripe to address\nthese challenges in a principled way.

In data acquisition, we conduct experiments based on two\ndifferent mental tasks: one on pure motor imagery, and another on combined\nmotor imagery and action observation. The experiments were conducted in both\noffline and online modes. In the signal preprocessing, we use localization\nmethod to eliminate channels that are irrelevant to the mental task, as well as\nperform feature extraction for subsequent classification. We propose multiple\nsupport vector machine classifiers with a majority-voting scheme for improved\nclassification results. And lastly, we present test results to demonstrate the\nefficacy of our proposed approach to possible stroke rehabilitation practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 13:31:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 09:32:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 08:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Abibullaev", "Berdakh", ""], ["An", "Jinung", ""], ["Lee", "Seung-Hyun", ""], ["Moon", "Jeon-Il", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.4965", "submitter": "Maurice Margenstern", "authors": "Maurice Margenstern, Lan Wu", "title": "A proposal for a Chinese keyboard for cellphones, smartphones, ipads and\n  tablets", "comments": "28 pages, 40 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate the possibility to use two tilings of the\nhyperbolic plane as basic frame for devising a way to input texts in Chinese\ncharacters into messages of cellphones, smartphones, ipads and tablets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Aug 2013 17:53:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Margenstern", "Maurice", ""], ["Wu", "Lan", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.5841", "submitter": "Yusuff Akingboye A", "authors": "Olatunde Olabiyisi, Yusuff Akingboye, Adebayo Abayomi-Alli, Fred\n  Izilein, Iyiola Adeleke", "title": "An Investigation of the Incidences of Repetitive Strain Injury among\n  computer Users in Nigeria", "comments": "8 pages, 7 Tables", "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 10,\n  Issue 4, No 1, July 2013 ISSN (Print): 1694-0814 | ISSN (Online): 1694-0784\n  www.IJCSI.org", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computer has been incorporated into day to day activities of almost every\nfield of human endeavour, offices to different shops. Therefore many people are\nnow working with computer for longer hours of time. There is no doubt that this\nincorporation of computer has helped users a lot but it also brings problems to\nthe users. One of the problems is Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Five hundred\nand thirty one (531) questionnaires were personally administered to different\ncategories of people that use computer in various works of life, ranging from\nbanking sector, civil service, educational sector, health sector to private\nsector. The distribution cut across different professions. A statistical\nanalysis was conducted on the data obtained using frequency distribution,\nPearson Correlation and Linear Regression. The result obtained showed that\n94.3% of the respondents suffered pain from one or more parts of the body.\n86.8% of the respondents suffered from eyestrain, 63.9% suffered from low back\npain, 67.4% with wrist pain, 64.7% finger pain while the least suffered pain\nwas foot pain which only 19% responded positively to it. There are significant\nrelationships between duration of computer usage, type of chair used, type and\nsize of monitor used and the incidence of RSI. RSI modeled was formulated\nthrough linear regression which showed that a unit change in computer will\nresult in corresponding 1.76 unit increases in RSI and a unit change in\nergonomic deficiency will also result in corresponding 0.66 increases in RSI.\nThe existence of RSI was established and it was discovered that the more time\nspent on the computer system, the more the proximity of having strain or pain\nin one or more part(s) of the body.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2013 12:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Olabiyisi", "Olatunde", ""], ["Akingboye", "Yusuff", ""], ["Abayomi-Alli", "Adebayo", ""], ["Izilein", "Fred", ""], ["Adeleke", "Iyiola", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6368", "submitter": "Steve Kieffer", "authors": "Steve Kieffer and Tim Dwyer and Kim Marriott and Michael Wybrow", "title": "Incremental Grid-like Layout Using Soft and Hard Constraints", "comments": "Accepted to Graph Drawing 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We explore various techniques to incorporate grid-like layout conventions\ninto a force-directed, constraint-based graph layout framework.

In this paper, we present an alternative yet\ngeneric PCG framework, named learning-based procedure content generation\n(LBPCG), to provide potential solutions to several challenging problems in\nexisting PCG techniques. By exploring and exploiting information gained in game\ndevelopment and public beta test via data-driven learning, our framework can\ngenerate robust content adaptable to end-user or target players on-line with\nminimal interruption to their experience. Furthermore, we develop enabling\ntechniques to implement the various models required in our framework. For a\nproof of concept, we have developed a prototype based on the classic open\nsource first-person shooter game, Quake.
