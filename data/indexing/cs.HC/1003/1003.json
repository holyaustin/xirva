We analyze the manner and\nextent to which the current W3C Geolocation API provides mechanisms to support\nprivacy.

In contrast to\nthe bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on\npositive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay\nbetween positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line\nsocial networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from\nsocial psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance\ntends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at\nodds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe --- particularly related\nto the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an\nalternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and\nprovides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one\nof the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using\non-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social\nmedia sites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2010 21:11:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Leskovec", "Jure", ""], ["Huttenlocher", "Daniel", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Jon", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2456", "submitter": "Sugata Sanyal", "authors": "Rolly Seth, Rishi Kapoor, Hameed Al-Qaheri, Sugata Sanyal", "title": "Piecemeal Journey To 'HALCYON' World Of Pervasive Computing : From past\n  progress to future challenges", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although 'Halcyon' means serene environment which pervasive computing aims\nat, we have tried to present a different interpretation of this word.

The proposed system\nutilizes data of a community's social network to reconstruct the social space,\nwhich is otherwise not physically perceptible but imaginary, experiential, yet\nlearnable. The social space is modeled with an agent network, where each agent\nstands for a member of the community and has knowledge about expertise and\npersonal characteristics of some other members. An agent can gather\ninformation, using its social \"connections\", to find community members most\nsuitable to communicate to in a specific situation defined by the system's\nuser. The system then deploys its multimodal interface, which \"maps\" the social\nspace onto a representation of the relevant physical space, to locate the\npotential interlocutors and advise the user on an efficient communication\nstrategy for the given community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 03:55:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kryssanov", "Victor V.", ""], ["Kumokawa", "Shizuka", ""], ["Goncharenko", "Igor", ""], ["Ogawa", "Hitoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.4924", "submitter": "Amine Chellali", "authors": "Amine Chellali (IRCCyN), C\\'edric Dumas (IRCCyN), Isabelle\n  Milleville-Pennel (IRCCyN), Eric Nouri (IRCCyN)", "title": "Common Frame of reference in collaborative virtual environments and\n  their impact on presence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "The 10th Annual International Workshop on Presence, Barcelone :\n  Spain (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Virtual collaborative environment are 3D shared spaces in which people can\nwork together.

Further, many aspects of the browsing behavior of individual\nusers can be approximated by log-normal distributions even though their\naggregate behavior is scale-free. Finally, we show that users' click streams\ncannot be cleanly segmented into sessions using timeouts, affecting any attempt\nto model hypertext navigation using statistics of individual sessions. We\npropose a strictly logical definition of sessions based on browsing activity as\nrevealed by referrer URLs; a user may have several active sessions in their\nclick stream at any one time. We demonstrate that applying a timeout to these\nlogical sessions affects their statistics to a lesser extent than a purely\ntimeout-based mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Mar 2010 21:53:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Meiss", "Mark", ""], ["Duncan", "John", ""], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Bruno", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jos\u00e9 J.", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}]
