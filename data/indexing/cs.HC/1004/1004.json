This paper builds upon and extends prior work in an area for\nwhich we would like to coin the term \"affective ludology.\" The area is\nconcerned with the affective measurement of player-game interaction. The\nexperimental study reported here investigated different traits of gameplay\nexperience using subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e.,\npsychophysiological) measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game level\ndesign modifications while measures such as electromyography (EMG),\nelectrodermal activity (EDA) were taken and questionnaire responses were\ncollected. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated\nsignificant high-arousal positive affect emotions. This method shows that\nemotional patterns emerge from different level designs, which has great\npotential for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be\ngenerated together with self- reported subjective player experience\ndescriptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2010 22:24:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Nacke", "Lennart E.", ""], ["Lindley", "Craig A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.0256", "submitter": "Lennart Nacke Ph.D.", "authors": "Lennart E.

The\nunderlying objective is to understand how to select search results presentation\nfor tasks and user contexts. Twenty three participants conducted four search\ntasks of two types and used two interfaces (List and Overview) to refine and\nexamine search results. Clickthrough data were recorded. This controlled study\nemployed a mixed model design with two within-subject factors (task and\ninterface) and two between-subject factors (two cognitive abilities: memory\nspan and verbal closure). Quantitative analyses were carried out by means of\nthe statistical package SPSS. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance\nwith repeated measures and non-parametric tests were performed on the collected\ndata. The overview of search results appeared to have benefited searchers in\nseveral ways. It made them faster; it facilitated formulation of more effective\nqueries and helped to assess search results. Searchers with higher cognitive\nabilities were faster in the Overview interface and in less demanding\nsituations (on simple tasks), while at the same time they issued about the same\nnumber of queries as lower-ability searchers. In more demanding situations (on\ncomplex tasks and in the List interface), the higher ability searchers expended\nmore search effort, although they were not significantly slower than the lower\nability people in these situations. The higher search effort, however, did not\nresult in a measurable improvement of task outcomes for high-ability searchers.\nThese findings have implications for the design of search interfaces. They\nsuggest benefits of providing result overviews. They also suggest the\nimportance of considering cognitive abilities in the design of search results'\npresentation and interaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2010 16:07:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gwizdka", "Jacek", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.2931", "submitter": "John Horton", "authors": "John J.

In this paper, we first describe the\nbenefits of conducting experiments in online labor markets; we then use one\nsuch market to replicate three classic experiments and confirm their results.\nWe confirm that subjects (1) reverse decisions in response to how a\ndecision-problem is framed, (2) have pro-social preferences (value payoffs to\nothers positively), and (3) respond to priming by altering their choices. We\nalso conduct a labor supply field experiment in which we confirm that workers\nhave upward sloping labor supply curves. In addition to reporting these\nresults, we discuss the unique threats to validity in an online setting and\npropose methods for coping with these threats. We also discuss the external\nvalidity of results from online domains and explain why online results can have\nexternal validity equal to or even better than that of traditional methods,\ndepending on the research question. We conclude with our views on the potential\nrole that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and then\nrecommend software development priorities and best practices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2010 22:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Horton", "John J.", ""], ["Rand", "David G.", ""], ["Zeckhauser", "Richard J.", ""]]}]
