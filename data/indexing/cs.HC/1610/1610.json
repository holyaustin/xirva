In\ncontrast to the classical bar charts, line plots and other statistics based\ngraph, our approach delivers more intuitive visualization that better preserves\nboth the temporal dependency and frequency structures. It provides a natural\ninverse operation to map the graph back to raw signals, making it possible to\nuse graph statistics to characterize time series for better visual exploration\nand statistical analysis. Our experimental results suggest the effectiveness on\nvarious tasks such as pattern discovery and classification on both synthetic\nand the real time series and sensor data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 03:39:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 00:05:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 19:52:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:54:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Lu", ""], ["Wang", "Zhiguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.07365", "submitter": "Thierry Poibeau", "authors": "Thierry Poibeau (LaTTICe), Shravan Vasishth", "title": "Introduction: Cognitive Issues in Natural Language Processing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Traitement Automatique des Langues, ATALA, 2014, Traitement\n  Automatique des Langues et Sciences Cognitives, 55 (3), pp.7-19", "doi": "10.1201/b21583-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This special issue is dedicated to get a better picture of the relationships\nbetween computational linguistics and cognitive science.

In 2016,\nBioPortal represents one of the largest portals for exploration of semantic\nbiomedical vocabularies and terminologies, which is used by many researchers\nand practitioners.

To that end, we study and group users\naccording to their browsing behavior on BioPortal using data mining techniques.\nAdditionally, we use the obtained groups to characterize and compare\nexploration strategies across ontologies.
