We conducted an experiment\nexploring social media usage during disaster scenarios, combining\nelectroencephalogram (EEG), personality surveys, and prompts to share social\nmedia, we show how personality not only drives willingness to engage with\nsocial media but also helps to determine what type of content users find\ncompelling. As expected, extroverts are more likely to share content. In\ncontrast, one of our central results is that individuals with depressive\npersonalities are the most likely cohort to share informative content, like\nnews or alerts.

A common\ncharacteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,\nand hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any\npractical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG\nsensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the\nclassification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose\na directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve\nthis objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete\nundirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between\nany two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying\nthe system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a\nweight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed\nacyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the\nchannel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm\nutilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight\nof this path satisfies a predefined threshold. It has been demonstrated\nexperimentally that channel utilization has been reduced by 50% in the worst\ncase scenario for a three-state system and an EEG sensor with 14 channels; and\nthe best classification accuracy obtained is 81%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Sep 2016 12:10:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Mohamed", "Abduljalil", ""], ["Shaban", "Khaled Bashir", ""], ["Mohamed", "Amr", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.03050", "submitter": "Malay Bhattacharyya", "authors": "Malay Bhattacharyya", "title": "Dropout Prediction in Crowdsourcing Markets", "comments": "Works in Progress, Third AAAI Conference on Human Computation and\n  Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2015), San Diego, USA", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Paper ID: 56", "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Crowdsourcing environments have shown promise in solving diverse tasks in\nlimited cost and time.

In the\nproposed approach, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are designed and tuned\nbased on these characteristics while also incorporating harmonic SSVEP\nresponses. This method not only improves the accuracy but also increases the\navailable number of commands by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies elicit\nweak SSVEP responses.

In dealing with uncertainty in sensor data and high-dimensional\nphysiological records, we must seek to improve current tools that make sense of\nhealth data from traditional perspectives in event-based trend discovery. With\nChronodes, a system developed to help researchers collect, interpret, and model\nmobile health (mHealth) data, we posit a series of interaction techniques that\nenable new approaches to understanding and exploring event-based data. From\nnumerous and discontinuous mobile health data streams, Chronodes finds and\nvisualizes frequent event sequences that reveal common chronological patterns\nacross participants and days. By then promoting the sequences as interactive\nelements, Chronodes presents opportunities for finding, defining, and comparing\ncohorts of participants that exhibit particular behaviors. We applied Chronodes\nto a real 40GB mHealth dataset capturing about 400 hours of data. Through our\npilot study with 20 behavioral and biomedical health experts, we gained\ninsights into Chronodes' efficacy, limitations, and potential applicability to\na wide range of healthcare scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 17:05:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Polack", "Peter J", "Jr"], ["Chen", "Shang-Tse", ""], ["Kahng", "Minsuk", ""], ["de Barbaro", "Kaya", ""], ["Sharmin", "Moushumi", ""], ["Basole", "Rahul", ""], ["Chau", "Duen Horng", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.08881", "submitter": "Paul Issartel", "authors": "Paul Issartel (LIMSI, UP11), Lonni Besan\\c{c}on (UP11, AVIZ),\n  Florimond Gu\\'eniat (LIMSI), Tobias Isenberg (AVIZ), Mehdi Ammi (UP11, LIMSI)", "title": "Preference Between Allocentric and Egocentric 3D Manipulation in a\n  Locally Coupled Configuration", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction, Oct 2016, Tokyo, Japan", "doi": "10.1145/2983310.2985750", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study user preference between allocentric and egocentric 3D manipulation\non mobile devices, in a configuration where the motion of the device is applied\nto an object displayed on the device itself.

The performance of MI based BCI\nmainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper\ntraining can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.\nHowever, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is\ntime-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor\nimagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to\nmodulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left\nor right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.\nFourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)\nparticipated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese\ncharacter. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the\nsequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant\nto find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide\nthem with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain\nactivity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly\nbetter performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p<0.001). Questionnaire\nreplies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and\nmore comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects\nto help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there\nwere significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification\naccuracy and usability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 03:02:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Qiu", "Zhaoyang", ""], ["Allison", "Brendan Z.", ""], ["Jin", "Jing", ""], ["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["Wang", "Xingyu", ""], ["Li", "Wei", ""], ["Cichocki", "Andrzej", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09761", "submitter": "Mohammad Soleymani", "authors": "Mohammad Soleymani", "title": "Detecting Cognitive Appraisals from Facial Expressions for Interest\n  Recognition", "comments": "6 pages, discussions and analysis were added.

Automatic\nrecognition of interest has numerous applications in human-computer\ninteraction. In this paper, we study the facial expressions associated with\ninterest and its underlying and closely related components, namely, curiosity,\ncoping potential, novelty and complexity. To this end, we conducted an\nexperiment in which participants watched images and micro-videos while a\nfront-facing camera recorded their expressions. After watching each item they\nself-reported their level of interest, curiosity, coping potential and\nperceived novelty and complexity. Using an automated method, we tracked facial\naction units (AU) and studied the relationship between the presence of facial\nmovements with interest and its related components. We then tracked the facial\nlandmarks, e.g., corners of lips, and extracted features from each response. We\ntrained random forests regression models to detect the level of interest,\ncuriosity, and appraisals. We found a large difference between the way people\nreport and react to interesting visual content. The expressions in response to\nimages and micro-videos were not always pronounced depending on the\nparticipants. This makes the direct detection of interest from facial\nexpressions a challenging problem. With this work, for the first time, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of detecting cognitive appraisals from facial\nexpressions which will open the door for appraisal-driven emotion recognition\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 14:49:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 21:25:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Soleymani", "Mohammad", ""]]}]
