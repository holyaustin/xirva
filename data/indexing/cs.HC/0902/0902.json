How to measure this happiness (or\nbitterness)? How does the profile of happiness grow and decay during the course\nof web-browsing? We propose a probabilistic framework that models evolution of\nuser satisfaction, on top of his/her continuous frustration at not finding the\nrequired information. It is found that the cumulative satisfaction profile of a\nweb-searching individual can be modeled effectively as the sum of random number\nof random terms, where each term is mutually independent random variable,\noriginating from 'memoryless' Poisson flow. Evolution of satisfaction over the\nentire time interval of user's browsing was modeled with auto-correlation\nanalysis. A utilitarian marker, magnitude of greater than unity of which\ndescribe happy web-searching operations; and an empirical limit that connects\nuser's satisfaction with his frustration level - are proposed too. Presence of\npertinent information in the very first page of a web-site and magnitude of the\ndecay parameter of user satisfaction (frustration, irritation etc.), are found\nto be two key aspects that dominate web-browser's psychology. The proposed\nmodel employed different combination of decay parameter, searching time and\nnumber of helpful web-sites. Obtained results are found to match the results\nfrom three real-life case-studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2009 14:55:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2011 11:06:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2011 07:39:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Banerji", "Anirban", ""], ["Magarkar", "Aniket", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2186", "submitter": "Travis Deyle", "authors": "Young Sang Choi, Travis Deyle, Charles C.
