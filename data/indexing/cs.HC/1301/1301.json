A key characteristic of\nsuch systems is the presence of the human (drivers) in the control loop. To\nensure safety, both the driver needs to be aware of the autonomous aspects of\nthe vehicle and the automated features of the vehicle built to enable safer\ncontrol. In this paper we propose a framework to combine empirical models\ndescribing human behaviour with the environment and system models. We then\nanalyse, via model checking, interaction between the models for desired safety\nproperties. The aim is to analyse the design for safe vehicle-driver\ninteraction. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using a case\nstudy involving semi-autonomous vehicles where the driver fatigue are factors\ncritical to a safe journey.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2013 01:54:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shaikh", "Siraj", "", "Coventry University"], ["Krishnan", "Padmanabhan", "", "Bond\n  University"]]}, {"id": "1301.0503", "submitter": "Charles Sutton", "authors": "Quim Castella and Charles Sutton", "title": "Word Storms: Multiples of Word Clouds for Visual Comparison of Documents", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Word clouds are a popular tool for visualizing documents, but they are not a\ngood tool for comparing documents, because identical words are not presented\nconsistently across different clouds.

We\npresent a novel algorithm that creates a coordinated word storm, in which words\nthat appear in multiple documents are placed in the same location, using the\nsame color and orientation, in all of the corresponding clouds. In this way,\nsimilar documents are represented by similar-looking word clouds, making them\neasier to compare and contrast visually. We evaluate the algorithm in two ways:\nfirst, an automatic evaluation based on document classification; and second, a\nuser study. The results confirm that unlike standard word clouds, a coordinated\nword storm better allows for visual comparison of documents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 17:02:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Castella", "Quim", ""], ["Sutton", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.0573", "submitter": "Eric J.
