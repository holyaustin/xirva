The workshop took place on\nJune 20, 2008 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, in conjunction with the JCDL\n2008 conference.\n  The workshop was organized around three themes: practices, models, and\nevaluation.

We also wanted to\nmotivate our modeling and design discussions with real-world examples of\ncollaboration. We discussed examples from the healthcare domain, students,\nfaculty members, the military, and businesses such as pharmaceutical companies\nthat conduct research.\n  We discussed several models of collaborative information seeking, including\nsense-making, communication, and information seeking theory based on Marcia\nBates' Berrypicking theory.\n  Finally, presenters described several systems that implement various aspects\nof collaboration, including using search paths, simulations of user behavior to\nmodel system performance, and characterizing properties of groups that lead to\nmore effective collaboration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2009 04:32:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 18:23:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Aug 2009 21:52:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Pickens", "Jeremy", ""], ["Golovchinsky", "Gene", ""], ["Morris", "Meredith Ringel", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0586", "submitter": "Gene Golovchinsky", "authors": "Meredith Ringel Morris and Jaime Teevan", "title": "Understanding Groups' Properties as a Means of Improving Collaborative\n  Search Systems", "comments": "Presented at 1st Intl Workshop on Collaborative Information Seeking,\n  2008 (arXiv:0908.0583)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "JCDL2008CIRWS/2008/mortee", "categories": "cs.IR cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the similar properties of people involved in group search\nsessions has the potential to significantly improve collaborative search\nsystems; such systems could be enhanced by information retrieval algorithms and\nuser interface modifications that take advantage of important properties, for\nexample by re-ordering search results using information from group members'\ncombined user profiles.

From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT\ndistribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing\nperformed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the\nconventional interpretation of individual RTs being either long or short, into\ntheir distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new\napproach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without\nreference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus\nproviding a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different\nsources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The\npaper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical\nvalidation using a database of human RTs in lexical tasks (visual lexical\ndecision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of RTs\nis more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical\nestimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads\nsharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it\nprovides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes\ninformation. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated\nempirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that\nsystematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular\ndemands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law,\nwhich posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental\ncontext.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 17:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00edn", "Ferm\u00edn Moscoso del Prado", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3361", "submitter": "Gene Golovchinsky", "authors": "Laurent Denoue, Scott Carter, John Adcock, Gene Golovchinsky, and\n  Andreas Girgensohn", "title": "WebNC: efficient sharing of web applications", "comments": "Presented at WWW 2009, Madrid, Spain", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  WebNC is a system for efficiently sharing, retrieving and viewing web\napplications.
