In order to test this system a pilot study\nhas been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand\nthe potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists\nwho 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional\nrehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another\nusing a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown\nthe MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Nov 2010 12:58:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ines", "Ines Di Loreto", ""], ["Goua\u00efch", "Abdelkader", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.2042", "submitter": "Sergey Andreyev", "authors": "Sergey Andreyev", "title": "Excerpt from the book World of Movable Objects", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This book is about the transformation of screen objects into movable and\nresizable and about the design of applications entirely on the basis of such\nelements.

The\nnumber of unique users in a thread normalized by the thread length decays with\nthread length, suggesting that thread life is sustained by mutual discussions\nrather than by independent comments. Automatic sentiment analysis shows that\nmost posts contain negative emotions and the most active users in individual\nthreads express predominantly negative sentiments. It follows that the average\nemotion of longer threads is more negative and that threads can be sustained by\nnegative comments.
