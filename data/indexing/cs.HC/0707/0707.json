The second part is devoted to the IRVO model, its notation\nand some examples.

Fast and correct\nanalysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social\nvisualization applications. Information visualization researchers have\npreviously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in\nrevealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument\nis based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed\nsimultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other\nrepresentations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time\ncube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has\nnot been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a\nbetween-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response\ntimes when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a\nbaseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were\nlower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the\nparticipants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of\nthe dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as\nfast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.\nThese results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space\ntime cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal\npatterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2007 13:39:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kristensson", "Per Ola", ""], ["Dahlback", "Nils", ""], ["Anundi", "Daniel", ""], ["Bjornstad", "Marius", ""], ["Gillberg", "Hanna", ""], ["Haraldsson", "Jonas", ""], ["Martensson", "Ingrid", ""], ["Nordvall", "Matttias", ""], ["Stahl", "Josefin", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3559", "submitter": "Wilson Wong", "authors": "Wilson Wong", "title": "Practical Approach to Knowledge-based Question Answering with Natural\n  Language Understanding and Advanced Reasoning", "comments": "Master of Science thesis, National Technical University College of\n  Malaysia, 2005", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This research hypothesized that a practical approach in the form of a\nsolution framework known as Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning for\nIntelligence (NaLURI), which combines full-discourse natural language\nunderstanding, powerful representation formalism capable of exploiting\nontological information and reasoning approach with advanced features, will\nsolve the following problems without compromising practicality factors: 1)\nrestriction on the nature of question and response, and 2) limitation to scale\nacross domains and to real-life natural language text.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 14:30:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Wilson", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3638", "submitter": "Vita Hinze-Hoare", "authors": "V.
