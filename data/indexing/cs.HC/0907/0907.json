In this paper, we explain how AceWiki\nuses controlled English - concretely Attempto Controlled English (ACE) - to\nprovide a natural and intuitive interface while supporting a high degree of\nexpressivity. We introduce recent improvements of the AceWiki system and user\nstudies that indicate that AceWiki is usable and useful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2009 15:59:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kuhn", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.1251", "submitter": "Tobias Kuhn", "authors": "Tobias Kuhn", "title": "How to Evaluate Controlled Natural Languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "In Pre-Proceedings of the Workshop on Controlled Natural Language\n  (CNL 2009), CEUR Workshop Proceedings, Volume 448, 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a general framework how controlled natural languages can\nbe evaluated and compared on the basis of user experiments.

To prevent any malicious\ncontrol of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to\nbe authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure\ncommunication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred\nto as \"Secure Device Pairing\". When there is no prior security context, e.g.,\nshared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing\nrequires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves\nleveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data\nexchanged over the insecure wireless channel.\n  We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to\npairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,\nwe consider more general and emerging \"two-user\" scenarios, where two different\nusers establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of\npairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are\napplicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the\nmethods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate\nthe usability of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for\nusers, in terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our\nwork sheds light on the applicability and usability of pairing methods for\nemerging two-user scenarios, a topic largely ignored so far.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:34:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Arun", ""], ["Saxena", "Nitesh", ""], ["Uzun", "Ersin", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5500", "submitter": "Laurent Bougrain", "authors": "Nanying Liang (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Laurent Bougrain (INRIA\n  Lorraine - LORIA)", "title": "Decoding Finger Flexion using amplitude modulation from band-specific\n  ECoG", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks (ESANN) (2009)\n  467-472", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  EEG-BCIs have been well studied in the past decades and implemented into\nseveral famous applications, like P300 speller and wheelchair controller.\nHowever, these interfaces are indirect due to low spatial resolution of EEG.\nRecently, direct ECoG-BCIs attract intensive attention because ECoG provides a\nhigher spatial resolution and signal quality.
