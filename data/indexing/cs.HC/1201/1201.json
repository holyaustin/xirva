For\nthat purpose, we propose a general model of Interconnection of Communities of\nPractice (ICP), based on the concept of Constellation of Practice (CCP)\ndeveloped by Wenger (1998). The model of ICP was implemented and has been used\nto develop the TE-Cap 2 platform which has, as its field of application,\neducational tutoring activities. In particular, we propose an indexation and\nsearch tool for the ICP knowledge base. The TE-Cap 2 platform has been used in\nreal conditions.

The proposed\napproach is dynamic in nature as it is sensitive to the behaviour of advisors,\nvalue of the current transaction and encourages the cooperation among buyers as\nadvisors.
