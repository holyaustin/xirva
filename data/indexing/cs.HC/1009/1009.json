Based on psychological\nstudies, we propose a multistage categorization strategy which allows\nestablishing an automatic categorization model flexibly for a given emotional\nspeech categorization task. We apply the strategy to the Serbian Emotional\nSpeech Corpus (GEES) and the Danish Emotional Speech Corpus (DES), where human\nperformance was reported in previous psychological studies. Our work is the\nfirst attempt to apply machine learning to the GEES corpus where the human\nrecognition rates were only available prior to our study. Unlike the previous\nwork on the DES corpus, our work focuses on a comparison to human performance\nunder the same experimental settings. Our studies suggest that\npsychology-inspired systems yield behaviours that, to a great extent, resemble\nwhat humans perceived and their performance is close to that of humans under\nthe same experimental setup. Furthermore, our work also uncovers some\ndifferences between machine and humans in terms of emotional state recognition\nfrom speech.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Sep 2010 07:51:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Shaukat", "Arslan", ""], ["Chen", "Ke", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.0433", "submitter": "Dipa Santosh Dixit", "authors": "Dipa Dixit, Jayant Gadge", "title": "Automatic Recommendation for Online Users Using Web Usage Mining", "comments": "10 PAGES Paper of web usage mining;\n  http://airccse.org/journal/ijmit/jmit_current10.html)", "journal-ref": "IJMIT Journal August 2010, Volume 2, Number 3", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A real world challenging task of the web master of an organization is to\nmatch the needs of user and keep their attention in their web site. So, only\noption is to capture the intuition of the user and provide them with the\nrecommendation list. Most specifically, an online navigation behavior grows\nwith each passing day, thus extracting information intelligently from it is a\ndifficult issue. Web master should use web usage mining method to capture\nintuition. A WUM is designed to operate on web server logs which contain user's\nnavigation. Hence, recommendation system using WUM can be used to forecast the\nnavigation pattern of user and recommend those to user in a form of\nrecommendation list. In this paper, we propose a two tier architecture for\ncapturing users intuition in the form of recommendation list containing pages\nvisited by user and pages visited by other user's having similar usage profile.\nThe practical implementation of proposed architecture and algorithm shows that\naccuracy of user intuition capturing is improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Sep 2010 14:15:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dixit", "Dipa", ""], ["Gadge", "Jayant", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.0842", "submitter": "Jin-Li Guo", "authors": "Jin-Li Guo", "title": "Empirical study and modeling of human behaviour dynamics of comments on\n  Blog posts", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.HC physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  On-line communities offer a great opportunity to investigate human dynamics,\nbecause much information about individuals is registered in databases.

We give a rigorous analysis on the\nmodel by non-homogeneous Poisson processes and obtain an analytic expression of\nthe interval distribution. Our analysis indicates that the time interval\nbetween two consecutive events follows the power-law distribution with a\ntunable exponent, which can be controlled by the model parameters and is in\ninterval (1,+{\\infty}). The analytical result agrees with the empirical results\nwell, obeying an approximately power-law form.

The current architecture does not\nprovide flexibility although the users are accustomed to the currently\navailable multi-tapping keypad.
