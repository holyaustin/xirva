An ontology translation in French is automatically proposed and\ncan be based on Web 2.0 enhanced by a community of users. A visualization and\nnavigation model is proposed to make it more accessible and examples are given\nto show the interface of the tool. This model offers the possibility of cross\nlanguage query. Users deeply interact with the translation by providing\nalternative translation of the node label. Customers also enrich the ontology\nnode labels with implicit descriptors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2011 12:10:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kembellec", "G\u00e9rald", "", "LIASD"], ["Saleh", "Imad", "", "LIASD"], ["Sauvaget", "Catherine", "", "LIASD"]]}, {"id": "1110.0436", "submitter": "Reza Farrahi Moghaddam", "authors": "Reza Farrahi Moghaddam and Fereydoun Farrahi Moghaddam and Mohamed\n  Cheriet", "title": "The BlueNetwork Concept", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most of energy efficiency and carbon reduction initiatives and concepts\nattempt to regulate and optimize machines behavior, and therefore, human\nbehavior itself is left neglected.

Thus, unlike previous studies that are primarily laboratory\nexperiments, we investigate the effects of using IT on the proneness to a\ndecision bias in real market transactions. We identify and analyze irrational\ndecision scenarios of auction participants. We find that participants with a\nhigher monetary investment have an increased likelihood of violating the\nassumption of rationality, due to the sunk cost effect. Interestingly, after\ncontrolling for monetary investments, participants who delegate their decision\nmaking to IT and, consequently, have comparably lower behavioral investments\n(e.g., emotional attachment, effort, time) are less prone to the sunk cost\neffect.

Based on recorded slider motion path data, we developed\nan analysis algorithm that identifies and measures different types of activity\nintervals, including error time moving irrelevant sliders and end time in\nbreaks after completing each trial item. Our results showed a significant\nincrease in speed of the mixing board interaction accompanied by reduced\nperceived cognitive load when compared with the traditional mouse-based GUI\ninteraction. The gains in speed are largely due to the improved times required\nfor the hand to reach for the first slider (acquisition time) and also when\nmoving between different ones, while the actual time spent manipulating\nrelevant sliders is very similar for either input device. These results agree\nstrongly with qualitative predictions from Fitts' Law that the larger targets\nafforded by the mixer handles contributed to its faster performance. For\nfurther investigation, we computed a measure of motion simultaneity based on\nvelocity correlation, which allowed to identify types of items for which\nincreased simultaneous adjustments occur.\n  For continuous parameter space exploration our findings suggest that mixing\nboards are a good option to provide detailed multi-value control.

Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all such\nsystems must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically\nby assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in an\nappropriate manner, e.g. majority voting.\n  In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks and\npose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task\nassignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give\na new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for\ninferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our\nalgorithm, inspired by belief propagation and low-rank matrix approximation,\nsignificantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is optimal through\ncomparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker. Further, we\ncompare our approach with a more general class of algorithms which can\ndynamically assign tasks. By adaptively deciding which questions to ask to the\nnext arriving worker, one might hope to reduce uncertainty more efficiently. We\nshow that, perhaps surprisingly, the minimum price necessary to achieve a\ntarget reliability scales in the same manner under both adaptive and\nnon-adaptive scenarios. Hence, our non-adaptive approach is order-optimal under\nboth scenarios. This strongly relies on the fact that workers are fleeting and\ncan not be exploited. Therefore, architecturally, our results suggest that\nbuilding a reliable worker-reputation system is essential to fully harnessing\nthe potential of adaptive designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 02:52:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 18:49:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2012 21:23:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 07:28:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Karger", "David R.", ""], ["Oh", "Sewoong", ""], ["Shah", "Devavrat", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5057", "submitter": "Marija Mitrovic", "authors": "Marija Mitrovi\\'c and Bosiljka Tadi\\'c", "title": "Patterns of Emotional Blogging and Emergence of Communities: Agent-Based\n  Model on Bipartite Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.HC physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: We study mechanisms underlying the collective emotional behavior\nof Bloggers by using the agent-based modeling and the parameters inferred from\nthe related empirical data.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: A bipartite network of emotional agents and\nposts evolves through the addition of agents and their actions on posts. The\nemotion state of an agent,quantified by the arousal and the valence, fluctuates\nin time due to events on the connected posts, and in the moments of agent's\naction it is transferred to a selected post. We claim that the indirect\ncommunication of the emotion in the model rules, combined with the action-delay\ntime and the circadian rhythm extracted from the empirical data, can explain\nthe genesis of emotional bursts by users on popular Blogs and similar Web\nportals. The model also identifies the parameters and how they influence the\ncourse of the dynamics.\n  Conclusions: The collective behavior is here recognized by the emergence of\ncommunities on the network and the fractal time-series of their emotional\ncomments, powered by the negative emotion (critique).
