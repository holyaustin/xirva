A real-time radio tomographic imaging system is\ndescribed which uses channel diversity and the presented models. Experiments in\nan open indoor environment, in a typical one-bedroom apartment and in a\nthrough-wall scenario are conducted to determine the accuracy of the system. We\ndemonstrate that the new system is capable of localizing and tracking a person\nwith high accuracy (<0.30 m) in all the environments, without the need to\nchange the model parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2013 15:18:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kaltiokallio", "Ossi", ""], ["Bocca", "Maurizio", ""], ["Patwari", "Neal", ""]]}]
