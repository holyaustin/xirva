Emotion can be involved in interaction at\nseveral levels. In our application case - ballet dance - emotions is\nexplicitely manipulated by the interactive system to produce emotion-wise\noutput. Our architecture model to develop emotion-wise applications is based on\nthe PAC-Amodeus model. We add a branch to this model, divided into three\ncomponents: Data capture, analysis and cue extraction, and finally\ninterpretation of those cues. We show the different data flows between this\narchitecture's components depending on the entry point of the emotion branch\nwithin the system. We then illustrate our model by describing our application\ncase: capturing a ballet dancer's movement to extract the emotions he expresses\nand use these emotions to generate graphical content that is displayed on\nstage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2007 17:23:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Clay", "Alexis", "", "LIPSI"]]}, {"id": "0710.0847", "submitter": "Alexis Clay", "authors": "Alexis Clay (LIPSI), Nadine Couture (LIPSI), Laurence Nigay (CLIPS -\n  IMAG)", "title": "Emotion capture based on body postures and movements", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Computing and\n  e-systems 2007 (TIGERA'07), Hammamet : Tunisie (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper we present a preliminary study for designing interactive\nsystems that are sensible to human emotions based on the body movements.

Research limitations/Implications - These findings can\nbe reinforced developing software to automate the structural analysis of\ndiscussions and actions to the code and documentation. Further analyses,\nsupported by these tools, will be necessary to generalise our results.\nOriginality/Value - The analysis of participation among the three interaction\nspaces of OSS design (discussion, documentation and implementation) is the main\noriginality of this work compared to other OSS research that mainly analyse one\nor two spaces.
