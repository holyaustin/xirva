The goal\nof this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers\nwith a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user\nsurveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions,\ncapturing users' motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they\nare seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting\nWikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a\nlarge-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000\nresponses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to\nWikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal\ncuriosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey\nresponses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs,\nenabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use\ncases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across\ntopics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using\nWikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on\ntopics such as science.

Based on\nanalyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131 third party apps, we\ndiscover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39% higher\nthan what users themselves cause. We take a step toward minimizing this loss by\nintroducing the concept of History-based decisions. Simply put, users are\ninformed at decision time about the vendors which have been previously granted\naccess to their data. Thus, they can reduce their privacy loss by not\ninstalling apps from new vendors whenever possible. Next, we realize this\nconcept by introducing a new privacy indicator, which can be integrated within\nthe cloud apps' authorization interface. Via a web experiment with 141\nparticipants recruited from CrowdFlower, we show that our privacy indicator can\nsignificantly increase the user's likelihood of choosing the app that minimizes\nher privacy loss. Finally, we explore the network effect of History-based\ndecisions via a simulation on top of large collaboration networks.
