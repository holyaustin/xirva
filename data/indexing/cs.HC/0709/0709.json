Contrastingly, issues relating to the design and ergonomic\nevaluation of multimodal output messages combining speech with visual\nmodalities have not yet been addressed extensively. The experimental study\npresented here addresses one of these issues. Its aim is to assess the actual\nefficiency and usability of oral system messages including brief spatial\ninformation for helping users to locate objects on crowded displays rapidly.\nTarget presentation mode, scene spatial structure and task difficulty were\nchosen as independent variables. Two conditions were defined: the visual target\npresentation mode (VP condition) and the multimodal target presentation mode\n(MP condition). Each participant carried out two blocks of visual search tasks\n(120 tasks per block, and one block per condition). Scene target presentation\nmode, scene structure and task difficulty were found to be significant factors.\nMultimodal target presentation proved to be more efficient than visual target\npresentation. In addition, participants expressed very positive judgments on\nmultimodal target presentations which were preferred to visual presentations by\na majority of participants. Besides, the contribution of spatial messages to\nvisual search speed and accuracy was influenced by scene spatial structure and\ntask difficulty: (i) messages improved search efficiency to a lesser extent for\n2D array layouts than for some other symmetrical layouts, although the use of\n2D arrays for displaying pictures is currently prevailing; (ii) message\nusefulness increased with task difficulty. Most of these results are\nstatistically significant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 13:27:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kieffer", "Suzanne", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"], ["Carbonell", "No\u00eblle", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"]]}, {"id": "0709.1056", "submitter": "Stephane Norte", "authors": "Stephane Norte", "title": "A Sudoku Game for People with Motor Impairments", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": null, "abstract": "  Computer games are motivating and beneficial in learning different\neducational skills.
