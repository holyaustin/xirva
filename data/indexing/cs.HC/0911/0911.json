The\nsystem consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and\nactuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit\nembedded in a dental retainer with electrodes put in contact with the tongue.\nThe principle consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated\nover long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce\nthese overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional\ninformation transmitted by the TDU. Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily\nparticipated in this study.

Needless to say, several lines of research aim to\nincrease the relevancy of the results users retrieve. In this paper the authors\nframe this problem within the much broader (and older) one of information\noverload. They argue that users' dissatisfaction with search engines is a\ncurrently common manifestation of such a problem, and propose a different angle\nfrom which to tackle with it. As it will be discussed, their approach shares\ngoals with a current hot research topic (namely, learning to rank for\ninformation retrieval) but, unlike the techniques commonly applied in that\nfield, their technique cannot be exactly considered machine learning and,\nadditionally, it can be used to change the search engine's response in\nreal-time, driven by the users behavior. Their proposal adapts concepts from\nSwarm Intelligence (in particular, Ant Algorithms) from an Information Foraging\npoint of view. It will be shown that the technique is not only feasible, but\nalso an elegant solution to the stated problem; what's more, it achieves\npromising results, both increasing the performance of a major search engine for\ninformational queries, and substantially reducing the time users require to\nanswer complex information needs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2009 20:57:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gayo-Avello", "Daniel", ""], ["Brenes", "David J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.4178", "submitter": "Morgan Harvey", "authors": "Morgan Harvey, Mark Baillie, Ian Ruthven, David Elsweiler", "title": "Folksonomic Tag Clouds as an Aid to Content Indexing", "comments": "SIGIR 2009 Workshop on Search in Social Media (SSM 2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social tagging systems have recently developed as a popular method of data\norganisation on the Internet.
