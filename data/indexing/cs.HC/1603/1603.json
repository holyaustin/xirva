Additionally, due to the lack of knowledge about street\nparking spaces, heuristic circling the blocks not only costs drivers' time and\nfuel, but also increases city congestion. In the wake of recent trend to build\nconvenient, green and energy-efficient smart cities, we rethink common\ntechniques adopted by high-profile smart parking systems, and present a\nuser-engaged (crowdsourcing) and sonar-based prototype to identify urban\non-street parking spaces. The prototype includes an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS\nreceiver and associated Arduino micro-controllers. It is mounted on the\npassenger side of a car to measure the distance from the vehicle to the nearest\nroadside obstacle. Multiple road tests are conducted around Wheatley, Oxford to\ngather results and emulate the crowdsourcing approach. By extracting parked\nvehicles' features from the collected trace, a supervised learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to estimate roadside parking occupancy and spot illegal parking\nvehicles. A quantity estimation model is derived to calculate the required\nnumber of sensing units to cover urban streets. The estimation is\nquantitatively compared to a fixed sensing solution. The results show that the\ncrowdsourcing way would need substantially fewer sensors compared to the fixed\nsensing system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Liao", "Ruizhi", ""], ["Roman", "Cristian", ""], ["Ball", "Peter", ""], ["Ou", "Shumao", ""], ["Chen", "Liping", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00532", "submitter": "Soroush Ghorashi", "authors": "Soroush Ghorashi, Carlos Jensen", "title": "Jimbo: A Collaborative IDE with Live Preview", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2897586.2897613", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Team collaboration plays a key role in the success of any multi-user\nactivity.

Automated methods can be\nuseful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via\ninteractive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An\ninherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to\ntruly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this\nlimitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data\nspace into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore\nthese 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface, but using\nadditional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded\nspace comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from\ncombinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and\nnavigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A\nsubspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, and also\nhelps them navigate within and across any higher-dimensional subspaces\nidentified by clustering. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a\nword cloud of attribute labels, sized according to the relevance of the\nassociated data dimensions in the currently selected subspace. Finally, a view\ngallery helps users keep their bearings and return to interesting subspaces and\nviews. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of\napplication areas, such as cluster analysis and refinement, information\ndiscovery, and supervised training of classifiers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:47:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 19:05:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 May 2017 10:22:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 25 Nov 2017 15:55:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Bing", ""], ["Mueller", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.04931", "submitter": "Nitesh Goyal", "authors": "Nitesh Goyal, Susan R.

Smooth haptic\nfeedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual\nobjects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop\ndown during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational\ncost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic\nsimulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may\ncause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement\nsmooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque\ncalculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed\nmethod, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is\nproposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.\nIn addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth\nforces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical\nsimulation. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of the proposed method\nand compare its performance with other methods and algorithms. The result shows\nthat the proposed method can provide smooth and accurate haptic force feedback\nat a high update rate for complex scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 04:29:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Xiyuan", ""], ["Sourina", "Olga", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.06996", "submitter": "Benjamin Cowley PhD", "authors": "Benjamin Ultan Cowley and Darryl Charles", "title": "Short Literature Review for a General Player Model Based on Behavlets", "comments": "Not a conference submission, not a journal. 7 pages, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the first in a series of three academic essays which deal with the\nquestion of how to build a generalized player model.

Based on this proposition, we pose three linked research\nquestions, which make incomplete progress toward a generalised player model:\nRQ1 what is a necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?;\nRQ2 can such a foundation improve performance of a computational\nintelligence-based player model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve\nefficacy of adaptive artificial intelligence in games?

For this purpose we analyze participants'\nperformance in 3D manipulation using a docking task. We measured completion\ntimes, docking precision, as well as subjective criteria such as fatigue,\nworkload, and preference. Our results show that the three input modalities\nprovide similar levels of precision but require different interaction times. We\nalso discuss our qualitative observations as well as people's preferences and\nput our findings into context of the practical application domain of 3D data\nanalysis environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 12:05:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 08:09:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Besan\u00e7on", "Lonni", ""], ["Issartel", "Paul", ""], ["Ammi", "Mehdi", ""], ["Isenberg", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08973", "submitter": "Benjamin Cowley PhD", "authors": "Benjamin Ultan Cowley, Darryl Charles", "title": "Utility of a Behavlets approach to a Decision theoretic predictive\n  player model", "comments": "Not a conference submission.

We begin with a\nproposition: a general model of players requires parameters for the subjective\nexperience of play, including at least three areas: a) player psychology, b)\ngame structure, and c) actions of play. Based on this proposition, we pose\nthree linked research questions, which make incomplete progress toward a\ngeneralized player model: RQ1 what is a necessary and sufficient foundation to\na general player model?; RQ2 can such a foundation improve performance of a\ncomputational intelligence-based player model?; and RQ3 can such a player model\nimprove efficacy of adaptive artificial intelligence in games? We set out the\narguments for each research question in each of the three essays, presented as\nthree preprints. The second essay, in this preprint, illustrates how our\n'Behavlets' method can improve the performance and accuracy of a predictive\nplayer model in the well-known Pac-Man game, by providing a simple foundation\nfor areas a) to c) above. We then propose a plan for future work to address RQ2\nby conclusively testing the Behavlets approach. This plan builds on the work\nproposed in the first preprint essay to address RQ1, and in turn provides\nsupport for work on RQ3.
