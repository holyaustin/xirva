In this paper, we propose the novel problem of\npredicting mobile application (known as \"apps\") installation using social\nnetworks and explain its challenge. Modern smart phones, like the ones used in\nour study, are able to collect different social networks using built-in\nsensors. (e.g. Bluetooth proximity network, call log network, etc) While this\ninformation is accessible to app market makers such as the iPhone AppStore, it\nhas not yet been studied how app market makers can use these information for\nmarketing research and strategy development. We develop a simple computational\nmodel to better predict app installation by using a composite network computed\nfrom the different networks sensed by phones. Our model also captures\nindividual variance and exogenous factors in app adoption. We show the\nimportance of considering all these factors in predicting app installations,\nand we observe the surprising result that app installation is indeed\npredictable. We also show that our model achieves the best results compared\nwith generic approaches: our results are four times better than random guess,\nand predict almost 45% of all apps users install with almost 45% precision (F1\nscore= 0.43).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2011 02:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Wei", ""], ["Aharony", "Nadav", ""], ["Pentland", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0868", "submitter": "Amani Tahat", "authors": "Amani Tahat, Mofleh Tahat", "title": "Python GUI Scripting Interface for Running Atomic Physics Applications", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "The Python Papers Source Codes 3: 2, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition\nto (UNIX/Linux).

It can be argued that muscular function, limb movements, and touch\nperception serve supervisory functions for movement control in motion and\ntouch-based (e.g. manipulable) devices/interfaces and human-machine interfaces\nin general. To get at this hypothesis requires the use of novel techniques and\nanalyses which demonstrate the multifaceted and regulatory role of adaptive\nphysiological processes in these interactions. Neuromechanics is an approach\nthat unifies the role of physiological function, motor performance, and\nenvironmental effects in determining human performance. A neuromechanical\nperspective will be used to explain the effect of environmental fluctuations on\nsupervisory mechanisms, which leads to adaptive physiological responses. Three\nexperiments are presented using two different types of virtual environment that\nallowed for selective switching between two sets of environmental forces. This\nswitching was done in various ways to maximize the variety of results.\nElectromyography (EMG) and kinematic information contributed to the development\nof human performance-related measures. Both descriptive and specialized\nanalyses were conducted: peak amplitude analysis, loop trace analysis, and the\nanalysis of unmatched muscle power. Results presented here provide a window\ninto performance under a range of conditions. These analyses also demonstrated\nmyriad consequences for force-related fluctuations on dynamic physiological\nregulation. The findings presented here could be applied to the dynamic control\nof touch-based and movement-sensitive human-machine systems.
