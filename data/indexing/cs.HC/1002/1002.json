As social networks evolve, they encourage users to share\nmore information, requiring the users, in turn, to place more trust into social\nnetworks. Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide an environment that can return\nownership of information, trust, and control to the users, away from\ncentralized third-party social networks.\n  In this paper, we present a novel concept, social profile overlays, which\nenable users to share their profile only with trusted peers in a scalable,\nreliable, and private manner. Each user's profile consists of a unique private,\nsecure overlay, where members of that overlay have a friendship with the\noverlay owner. Profile data is made available without regard to the online\nstate of the profile owner through the use of the profile overlay's distributed\ndata store. Privacy and security are enforced through the use of a public key\ninfrastructure (PKI), where the role of certificate authority (CA) is handled\nby the overlay owner and each member of the overlay has a CA-signed\ncertificate. All members of the social network join a common public or\ndirectory overlay facilitating friend discovery and bootstrap connections into\nprofile overlays. We define interfaces and present tools that can be used to\nimplement this system, as well as explore some of the challenges related to it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 23:06:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wolinsky", "David Isaac", ""], ["Juste", "Pierre St.", ""], ["Boykin", "P.
