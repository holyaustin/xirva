Such health-care pervasive\napplications in smart home should focus on the inhabitant's goal or task in\ndiverse situations, rather than the various complex devices and services. The\ncore challenge for homecare design is to perceive the environment and assess\noccurring situations, thus allowing systems to behave intelligently according\nto the user's intent. Due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of pervasive\ncomputing environment, it is difficult for an average user to obtain right\ninformation and service and in right place at right time. This paper proposes a\ncontext-driven task-oriented middleware (CDTOM) to meet the challenge. The most\nimportant component is its task model that provides an adequate high-level\ndescription of user-oriented tasks and their related contexts. Leveraging the\nmodel multiple entities can easily exchange, share and reuse their knowledge.\nBased on the hierarchy of task ontology, a novel task recognition approach\nusing CBR (case-based reasoning) is presented and the performance of task\nrecognition is evaluated by task number, context size and time costing.\nMoreover, a dynamic mechanism for mapping the recognized task and services is\nalso discussed. Finally, we present the design and implementation of our task\nsupporting system (TSS) to aid an inhabitant's tasks in light of his lifestyle\nand environment conditions in pervasive homecare environment, and the results\nof the prototype system show that our middleware approach achieves good\nefficiency of context management and good accuracy of user's activity\ninference, and can improve efficiently quality of user's life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Feb 2011 14:00:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ni", "Hongbo", ""], ["Abdulrazak", "Bessam", ""], ["Zhang", "Daqing", ""], ["Wu", "Shu", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3325", "submitter": "Pejman Mirza-Babaei", "authors": "Pejman Mirza-Babaei", "title": "Using physiological measures in conjunction with other UX approaches for\n  better understanding of the player's gameplay experiences", "comments": "15 Pages.

Successful\nvideo games deliver experience that impact players on a level of arousal.\nTherefore undertaking a user experience (UX) study is crucial to ensure that a\ngame achieves both critical and financial success. However, traditional\nusability methods (observation, subjective reporting, questionnaire, and\ninterview) have a number of limitations on game user research. In this study we\ncapture player's physiological measures during a gameplay session, to indicate\nmicro-events that have caused changes in their body signals. At the\npost-gameplay interviews we ask participants to comment and describe their\nfeelings on the selected events. The aim of this study is not to over-interpret\nphysiological measures, but on using blips in measures to help identify key\npoints in a game, which we then use to investigate further with the\nparticipant. This approach provides a method that can identify not only the\nnegative user experience and usability issues but also the events which have a\npositive impact on player's experience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 12:42:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mirza-Babaei", "Pejman", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3865", "submitter": "Thomas Mandl", "authors": "Thomas Mandl, Christa Womser-Hacker", "title": "Probability Based Clustering for Document and User Properties", "comments": "In: Ojala, Timo (ed.): Infotech Oulo International Workshop on\n  Information Retrieval (IR 2001).
