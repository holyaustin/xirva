The approach to achieving this\ngoal largely depends on the use of artificial intelligence techniques and\nrarely the use of a method of automatic learning in order to develop a\nfeasibility model of a software tool based on case based reasoning (CBR) to\nexploit stored knowledge in order to create know-how that can help stimulate\ndomain experts in the task of analysis, evaluation and certification of a new\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Mar 2012 14:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Maalel", "Ahmed", ""], ["Hadj-Mabrouk", "Habib", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1468", "submitter": "Matthew Lease", "authors": "Di Liu, Matthew Lease, Rebecca Kuipers, and Randolph Bias", "title": "Crowdsourcing for Usability Testing", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While usability evaluation is critical to designing usable websites,\ntraditional usability testing can be both expensive and time consuming.

To investigate the potential of such crowdsourced usability testing,\nwe conducted two similar (though not completely parallel) usability studies\nwhich evaluated a graduate school's website: one via a traditional usability\nlab setting, and the other using crowdsourcing. While we find crowdsourcing\nexhibits some notable limitations in comparison to the traditional lab\nenvironment, its applicability and value for usability testing is clearly\nevidenced.
