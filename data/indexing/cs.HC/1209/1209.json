A wide range of research has\nexploited context dependency, i.e., the relations between context(s) and the\noutcome, to achieve significant, quantified, performance gains for a variety of\napplications. These works often have to deal with the challenges of multiple\nsources of context that can lead to a sparse training data set, and the\nchallenge of energy hungry context sensors. Often, they address these\nchallenges in an application specific and ad-hoc manner. We liberate mobile\napplication designers and researchers from these burdens by providing a\nmethodical approach to these challenges. In particular, we 1) define and\nmeasure the context-dependency of three fundamental types of mobile usage in an\napplication agnostic yet practical manner, which can provide clear insight into\nthe performance of potential ap-plication. 2) Address the challenge of data\nsparseness when dealing with multiple and different sources of context in a\nsystematic manner. 3) Present SmartContext to address the energy challenge by\nautomatically selecting among context sources while ensuring the minimum\naccuracy for each estimation event is met.\n  Our analysis and findings are based on usage and context traces collected in\nreal-life settings from 24 iPhone users over a period of one year. We present\nfindings regarding the context dependency of the three principal types of\nmobile usage; visited websites, phone calls, and app usage. Yet, our\nmethodology and the lessons we learn can be readily extended to other\ncontext-dependent mobile usage and system resources as well. Our findings guide\nthe development of context aware systems, and highlight the challenges and\nexpectations regarding the context dependency of mobile usage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 21:35:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Sep 2012 01:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Rahmati", "Ahmad", ""], ["Shepard", "Clayton", ""], ["Tossell", "Chad", ""], ["Zhong", "Lin", ""], ["Kortum", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0578", "submitter": "Antonio Tapiador", "authors": "Alicia D\\'iez, Antonio Tapiador", "title": "Social Cheesecake: An UX-driven designed interface for managing contacts", "comments": "Preprint of IADIS WWW/Internet 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.SI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Social network management interfaces should consider separation of contexts\nand tie strength.

As\nbenefited from the better interpretability, neighborhood-based collaborative\nfiltering techniques, such as item-based collaborative filtering adopted by\nAmazon, have gained a great success in many practical recommender systems.\nHowever, the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering method suffers from the\nrating bound problem, i.e., the rating on a target item that this method\nestimates is bounded by the observed ratings of its all neighboring items.\nTherefore, it cannot accurately estimate the unobserved rating on a target\nitem, if its ground truth rating is actually higher (lower) than the highest\n(lowest) rating over all items in its neighborhood. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by formalizing rating estimation as a task of recovering a scalar\nrating function. With a linearity assumption, we infer all the ratings by\noptimizing the low-order norm, e.g., the $l_1/2$-norm, of the second derivative\nof the target scalar function, while remaining its observed ratings unchanged.\nExperimental results on three real datasets, namely Douban, Goodreads and\nMovieLens, demonstrate that the proposed approach can well overcome the rating\nbound problem. Particularly, it can significantly improve the accuracy of\nrating estimation by 37% than the conventional neighborhood-based methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2012 09:55:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Junming", ""], ["Cheng", "Xue-Qi", ""], ["Shen", "Hua-Wei", ""], ["Sun", "Xiaoming", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""], ["Jin", "Xiaolong", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0967", "submitter": "Travis Suel", "authors": "Travis Z.

Since there are no restorative treatments for SCI, novel\napproaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought. Our recent\nstudies show that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to control\nambulation within a virtual reality environment (VRE), suggesting that a\nBCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation may be feasible.\nHowever, the operability of our BCI has not been tested in a SCI population.\n  Methods: Five subjects with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to SCI underwent a\n10-min training session in which they alternated between kinesthetic motor\nimagery (KMI) of idling and walking while their electroencephalogram (EEG) were\nrecorded. Subjects then performed a goal-oriented online task, where they\nutilized KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10\nsequential stops at designated points within the VRE. Multiple online trials\nwere performed over 5 experimental days.\n  Results: Classification accuracy of idling and walking was estimated offline\nand ranged from 60.5% (p=0.0176) to 92.3% (p=1.36*10^-20) across subjects and\ndays. In the online task, all subjects achieved purposeful control with an\naverage performance of 7.4 +/- 2.3 successful stops in 273 +/- 51 sec (p<0.01).\nAll subjects maintained purposeful control throughout the study, and their\nonline performances improved over time.\n  Conclusions: The results demonstrate that SCI subjects can purposefully\noperate a self-paced BCI walking simulator to complete a goal-oriented\nambulation task. The operation of this BCI system requires short training, is\nintuitive, and robust against subject-to-subject and day-to-day\nneurophysiological variations. These findings indicate that BCI-controlled\nlower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration after SCI may\nbe feasible in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2012 00:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Christine E.", ""], ["Wang", "Po T.", ""], ["Chui", "Luis A.", ""], ["Do", "An H.", ""], ["Nenadic", "Zoran", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.2166", "submitter": "David Pritchard", "authors": "David Pritchard and Troy Vasiga", "title": "CS Circles: An In-Browser Python Course for Beginners", "comments": "To appear in SIGCSE 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Computer Science Circles is a free programming website for beginners that is\ndesigned to be fun, easy to use, and accessible to the broadest possible\naudience.
