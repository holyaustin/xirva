Though PDM is heavily benefiting industry but PDM community is facing\na very serious unresolved issue in PDM system development with flexible and\nuser friendly graphical user interface for efficient human machine\ncommunication. PDM systems offer different services and functionalities at a\ntime but the graphical user interfaces of most of the PDM systems are not\ndesigned in a way that a user (especially a new user) can easily learn and use\nthem. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in field of Human\nComputer Interaction; resultant data provides the information about graphical\nuser interface development using rich internet applications. The accomplished\ngoal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a proposition of a\nconceptual model for the implementation of a flexible web based graphical user\ninterface. The proposed conceptual model was successfully designed into\nimplementation model and a resultant prototype putting values to the field is\nnow available. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept,\nimplementation designs and developed prototype is also discussed in this paper.\nMoreover in the end, prototype is compared with respective functions of\nexisting PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness\nagainst targeted challenge\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Mar 2011 16:16:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "Zeeshan", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.2063", "submitter": "David Prochazka", "authors": "Jiri Stastny and David Prochazka and Tomas Koubek and Jaromir Landa", "title": "Augmented reality usage for prototyping speed up", "comments": "Keywords: augmented reality, prototyping, pose estimation,\n  transformation matrix", "journal-ref": "Acta Universitatis Agriculturae et Silviculturae Mendeleianae\n  Brunensis, 2011, LIX, No. 2, pp. 353-360", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The first part of the article describes our approach for solution of this\nproblem by means of Augmented Reality. The merging of the real world model and\ndigital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the\nwhole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality\nis the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable\ndigital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using\nidentification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not\nnecessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real\nworld model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of\noutlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the\ncamera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of\nthe article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and\norientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is\ngeneralized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in\nspace. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the\ndescription of representation of their position and orientation be means of\ntransformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical\nobjects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Mar 2011 16:00:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Stastny", "Jiri", ""], ["Prochazka", "David", ""], ["Koubek", "Tomas", ""], ["Landa", "Jaromir", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5002", "submitter": "David Vallet David Vallet", "authors": "Blaz Fortuna, Dunja Mladenic, Marko Grobelnik", "title": "User Modeling Combining Access Logs, Page Content and Semantics", "comments": "1st International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data\n  (USEWOD2011) in the 20th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2011),\n  Hyderabad, India, March 28th, 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "WWW2011USEWOD/2011/formlagro", "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper proposes an approach to modeling users of large Web sites based on\ncombining different data sources: access logs and content of the accessed pages\nare combined with semantic information about the Web pages, the users and the\naccesses of the users to the Web site.

Sometimes, it needs to combine with other\nsensors and positioning methods in order to determine the location with more\nintelligent, reliable and ubiquity. By using ubiquitous positioning in mobile\nnavigation system, it is a promising ubiquitous location technique in a mobile\nphone since as it is a familiar personal electronic device for many people.\nHowever, as research on ubiquitous positioning systems goes beyond basic\nmethods there is an increasing need for better comparison of proposed\nubiquitous positioning systems. System developers are also lacking of good\nframeworks for understanding different options during building ubiquitous\npositioning systems. This paper proposes taxonomy to address both of these\nproblems. The proposed taxonomy has been constructed from a literature study of\npapers and articles on positioning estimation that can be used to determine\nlocation everywhere on mobile navigation system. For researchers the taxonomy\ncan also be used as an aid for scoping out future research in the area of\nubiquitous positioning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Mar 2011 17:03:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bejuri", "Wan Mohd.
