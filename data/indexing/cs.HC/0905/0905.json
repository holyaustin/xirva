However, turning such awareness into\npractical community action and political change requires more than just\ncollecting and presenting data. To inform research on mobile environmental\nsensing, we conducted design fieldwork with government, private, and public\ninterest stakeholders. In parallel, we built an environmental air quality\nsensing system and deployed it on street sweeping vehicles in a major U.S.\ncity; this served as a \"research vehicle\" by grounding our interviews and\naffording us status as environmental action researchers. In this paper, we\npresent a qualitative analysis of the landscape of environmental action,\nfocusing on insights that will help researchers frame meaningful technological\ninterventions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 May 2009 11:42:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aoki", "Paul M.", ""], ["Honicky", "R.

The wide distribution of the computers forced the\nupdate of this standard. On one hand this is because of the need to support\nsymbols such as the Bulgarian quotation marks, the Cyrillic letter I with grave\naccent, the long dash, etc. On the other hand the so called \"phonetic layout\"\nbecame popular and this layout is not standartized by BDS. In this work we are\nanalyzing the possibilities to improve the keyboard layout according to BDS\n5237-78, as well as the traditional phonetic layout. At the same time we are\nmaking a comparison with the new proposed Bulgarian keyboard layout standard\nBDS 5237:2006. We are proposing an algorithm for placement of additional\nsymbols on the keys of the keyboard in a way that makes easy for the users to\nfind the symbols even when they are not inscripted on the keys. We are giving\nformal definitions and illustrations of four keyboard layouts - three extended\nkeyboard layouts for typing in \"Cyrillic\" mode (BDS, traditional phonetic and\nphonetic according to the new proposed BDS 5237:2006) and one extended layout\nfor typing in \"Latin\" mode.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2009 20:32:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zinoviev", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3070", "submitter": "Katarina  Borg Gyllenback Ms", "authors": "Katarina Borg Gyllenback", "title": "Narrative Bridging - a specification of a modelling method for game\n  design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Very little has been explored about the narrative as a process when\nconstructing entertainment for interactive media. Simultaneously, the interest\nin narrative vehicles increases while certain occupations, seeing the narrative\nas a structure, obscure the examination of the process of selecting, arranging\nand rendering story material. To correct this deficiency, a method for a\nnarrative bridging that encourages research and design while exploring\nnarration as a process, is proposed with the aim to not diminish the properties\nof the interactive media. This method focuses on the initial phase where\nestablishing and handling the information takes place and creates a foundation\nthat precedes its systematization and computation. The aim is to give designers\na comfortable design tool that firmly aids the design without interfering with\ncreativity, and at the same time aids the construction of interplay between\nnarration, spatiality and interactivity. The method aided the practise of a\ndiscipline that was established through a qualitative study conducted as part\nof a university course in rapid prototyping. The results demonstrated that the\nmethod aided time-constrained design processes, simultaneously detecting\ninconsistencies that would prevent the team from making improvements. The\nmethod gave the team a shared vocabulary and outlook, allowing them to progress\nwithout interfering with the creative flow. This enabled the team to reason\nabout the process and easily advice design stakeholders. The study also\nprovides directions for future developments within research of narrative\nprocesses in game design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2009 11:46:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gyllenback", "Katarina Borg", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4864", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Tiberiu Marius Karnyanszky, Ovidiu Crista, Catalin Tuican", "title": "Computer Based Interpretation of the Students' Evaluation of the\n  Teaching Staff", "comments": "8 pages, exposed on 5th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2009, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
