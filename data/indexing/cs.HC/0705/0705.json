Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not\nsatisfactorily answer the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global\nstructure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities.\nTo address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for\nnetworks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations:\nnode-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while\narbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better\nsupport the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction\ntechniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging\nselections from either a node-link or a matrix, flexibly manipulate the\nNodeTrix representation to explore the dataset, and create meaningful summary\nvisualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying\nNodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate\nthe capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means\nof communicating results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2007 11:50:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2007 08:53:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2007 13:32:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Henry", "Nathalie", ""], ["Fekete", "Jean-Daniel", ""], ["Mcguffin", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1395", "submitter": "Damien Chablat", "authors": "Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Petiot (IRCCyN), Damien Chablat (IRCCyN)", "title": "Subjective Evaluation of Forms in an Immersive Environment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Virtual Concept (2003) 1-6", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.RO", "license": null, "abstract": "  User's perception of product, by essence subjective, is a major topic in\nmarketing and industrial design.

The\npivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition\nprobability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,\ndiscusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's\nknowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper\ndiscusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion\nbased on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion\ntheory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with\nsubjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion\nfunction and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a\nrate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting\ncondition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information\nfor lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding.\nBy analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and\ndigitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective\ninformation is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there\nis an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the\nmatching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing\nprobability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of\nimages or too much objective information is wasteful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2007 19:33:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Chenguang", ""]]}]
