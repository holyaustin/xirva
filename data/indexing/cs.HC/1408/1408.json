Learning to get by without an arm\nor hand can be very challenging, and existing prostheses do not yet fulfil the\nneeds of individuals with amputations. One promising solution is to provide\ngreater communication between a prosthesis and its user. Towards this end, we\npresent a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a\nrobotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing\nin the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict\nimpact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning\nsystem's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in\ntheir interactions with a workspace. We tested this system with five\nable-bodied subjects. Each subject manipulated the robot arm while receiving\ndifferent forms of vibrotactile feedback regarding the arm's contact with its\nworkspace. Our trials showed that communicable predictions could be learned\nquickly during human control of the robot arm. Using these predictions as a\nbasis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task\nperformance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our\nstudy therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and\nmachine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an\nartificial limb.
