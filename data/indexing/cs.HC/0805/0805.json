However, due to\nthe very nature of spreadsheets, their evolution is particularly tricky and\ntherefore error-prone. In our strive to develop tools and methodologies to\nimprove spreadsheet quality, we analysed consolidation spreadsheets of an\ninternationally operating company for the errors they contain. The paper\npresents the results of the field audit, involving 78 spreadsheets with 60,446\nnon-empty cells. As a by-product, the study performed was also to validate our\nanalysis tools in an industrial context. The evaluated auditing tool offers the\nauditor a new view on the formula structure of the spreadsheet by grouping\nsimilar formulas into equivalence classes. Our auditing approach defines three\nsimilarity criteria between formulae, namely copy, logical and structural\nequivalence. To improve the visualization of large spreadsheets, equivalences\nand data dependencies are displayed in separated windows that are interlinked\nwith the spreadsheet. The auditing approach helps to find irregularities in the\ngeometrical pattern of similar formulas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 May 2008 20:40:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Clermont", "Markus", ""], ["Hanin", "Christian", ""], ["Mittermeir", "Roland T.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2189", "submitter": "Grenville Croll", "authors": "Ying Chen, Hock Chuan Chan", "title": "Visual Checking of Spreadsheets", "comments": "11 Pages, 5 Figures", "journal-ref": "Proc.
