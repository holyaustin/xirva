To fit into the academic workflow non-linear reading, bookmarking,\ncommenting, extracting text or the integration of non-textual elements must be\nsupported. A group of social science students were questioned about their\nexperiences with electronic publications for study purposes. This same group\nexecuted several text-related tasks with the digitized material presented to\nthem in two different file formats on four different e-readers. Their\nperformances were subsequently evaluated by means of frequency analyses in\ndetail. Findings - e-Publications have made advances in the academic world;\nhowever e-readers do not yet fit seamlessly into the established chain of\nscholarly text-processing focusing on how readers use material during and after\nreading. Our tests revealed major deficiencies in these techniques. With a\nsmall number of participants (n=26) qualitative insights can be obtained, not\nrepresentative results. Further testing with participants from various\ndisciplines and of varying academic status is required to arrive at more\nbroadly applicable results. Practical implications - Our test results help to\noptimize file conversion routines for scholarly texts. We evaluated our data on\nthe basis of descriptive statistics and abstained from any statistical\nsignificance test. The usability test of e-readers in a scientific context\naligns with both studies on the prevalence of e-books in the sciences and\ntechnical test reports of portable reading devices. Still, it takes a\ndistinctive angle in focusing on the characteristics and procedures of textual\nwork in the social sciences and measures the usability of e-readers and\nfile-features against these standards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 May 2012 15:40:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Schomisch", "Siegfried", ""], ["Zens", "Maria", ""], ["Mayr", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.2476", "submitter": "Benoit Otjacques", "authors": "Beno\\^it Otjacques, Micka\\\"el Stefas, Ma\\\"el Cornil, Fernand Feltz", "title": "Open Data Visualization: Keeping Traces of the Exploration Process", "comments": "Presented at the First International Workshop On Open Data, WOD-2012\n  (http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3726)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "WOD/2012/NANTES/1", "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a system to support the visual exploration of Open Data.\nDuring his/her interactive experience with the graphics, the user can easily\nstore the current complete state of the visualization application (called a\nviewpoint).
