The objective of\nthis research is to improve dialog specification and implementation. To do so\nwe enriched a notation based on concepts from programming languages, especially\npartial evaluation, for specifying a variety of unsolicited reporting,\nmixed-initiative dialogs in a concise representation that serves as a design\nfor dialog implementation. We also built a dialog mining system that extracts a\nspecification in this notation from requirements. To demonstrate that such a\nspecification provides a design for dialog implementation, we built a system\nthat automatically generates an implementation of the dialog, called a stager,\nfrom it. These two components constitute a dialog modeling toolkit that\nautomates dialog specification and implementation. These results provide a\nproof of concept and demonstrate the study of dialog specification and\nimplementation from a programming languages perspective. The ubiquity of\ndialogs in domains such as travel, education, and health care combined with the\ndemand for smart phone apps provide a landscape for further investigation of\nthese results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2011 03:00:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 20:58:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2014 20:05:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 00:29:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 15:10:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Perugini", "Saverio", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5147", "submitter": "Bernardo Huberman", "authors": "Haiyi Zhu, Bernardo A.

The influence is stronger when people are required to\nmake their second decision sometime later (22.4%) than immediately (14.1%).\nMoreover, people are most likely to reverse their choices when facing a\nmoderate number of opposing opinions.
