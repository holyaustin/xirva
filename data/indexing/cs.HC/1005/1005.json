However, prior work shows that this\napproach to pairing can be prone to human errors of different forms that may\ndirectly or indirectly translate into man-in-the-middle attacks. To address\nthis problem, we propose a general direction of the use of computer games for\npairing. Since games are a popular means of entertainment, our hypothesis is\nthat they may serve as an incentive to users and make the pairing process\nenjoyable for them, thus improving the usability, as well as the security, of\nthe pairing process. We consider an emerging use case of pairing whereby two\ndifferent users are involved, each in possession of his or her own device\n(e.g., Alice and Bob pairing their smartphones for social interactions). We\ndevelop \"Alice Says,\" a pairing game based on a popular memory game called\nSimon (Says), and discuss the underlying design challenges. We also present a\npreliminary evaluation of Alice Says via a usability study and demonstrate its\nfeasibility in terms of usability and security. Our results indicate that\noverall Alice Says was deemed as a fun and an enjoyable way to pair devices,\nconfirming our hypothesis. However, contrary to our intuition, the relatively\nslower speed of Alice Says pairing was found to be a cause of concern and\nprompts the need for the design of faster pairing games. We put forth several\nways in which this issue can be ameliorated. In addition, we also discuss\nseveral other security problems which are lacking optimal solutions and suggest\nideas on how entertainment can be used to improve the current state of the art\nsolutions that have been developed to address them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 01:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 May 2010 16:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gallego", "Alexander", ""], ["Saxena", "Nitesh", ""], ["Voris", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0749", "submitter": "Jonathan Heras", "authors": "Jonathan Heras and Vico Pascual and Ana Romero and Julio Rubio", "title": "Integrating multiple sources to answer questions in Algebraic Topology", "comments": "To appear in The 9th International Conference on Mathematical\n  Knowledge Management: MKM 2010", "journal-ref": "Lectures Notes in Artificial Intelligence, 6167: 331-335, 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SC cs.AI cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present in this paper an evolution of a tool from a user interface for a\nconcrete Computer Algebra system for Algebraic Topology (the Kenzo system), to\na front-end allowing the interoperability among different sources for\ncomputation and deduction.

Our camera films a movie by \"listening\" to the ProofWeb communication.\nThe first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal\nproof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to\ndiscuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a\nwhole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a\nseparate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert\nthat a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client\n(user) and a server (PA).
