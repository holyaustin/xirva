Understanding the dynamics of infection transmission in a\nhospital setting is essential for tailoring interventions and predicting the\nspread among individuals. Mathematical models need to be informed with accurate\ndata on contacts among individuals. We used wearable active Radio-Frequency\nIdentification Devices to detect face-to-face contacts among individuals with a\nspatial resolution of about 1.5 meters, and a time resolution of 20 seconds.\nThe study was conducted in a general pediatrics hospital ward, during a\none-week period, and included 119 participants. Nearly 16,000 contacts were\nrecorded during the study, with a median of approximately 20 contacts per\nparticipants per day. Overall, 25% of the contacts involved a ward assistant,\n23% a nurse, 22% a patient, 22% a caregiver, and 8% a physician. The majority\nof contacts were of brief duration, but long and frequent contacts especially\nbetween patients and caregivers were also found. In the setting under study,\ncaregivers do not represent a significant potential for infection spread to a\nlarge number of individuals, as their interactions mainly involve the\ncorresponding patient. Nurses would deserve priority in prevention strategies\ndue to their central role in the potential propagation paths of infections. Our\nstudy shows the feasibility of accurate and reproducible measures of the\npattern of contacts in a hospital setting. The results are particularly useful\nfor the study of the spread of respiratory infections, for monitoring critical\npatterns, and for setting up tailored prevention strategies. Proximity-sensing\ntechnology should be considered as a valuable tool for measuring such patterns\nand evaluating nosocomial prevention strategies in specific settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 14:42:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Isella", "L.", ""], ["Romano", "M.", ""], ["Barrat", "A.", ""], ["Cattuto", "C.", ""], ["Colizza", "V.", ""], ["Broeck", "W.

For example, a typical virtual environment must\neffectively handle user input, sensor data, and virtual world physics all in\nreal- time. Merging all of these data into a single interactive system requires\nthat we adapt approaches from topological methods such as n-dimensional\nrelativistic representation. A number of hypothetical examples will be provided\nthroughout the paper to clarify technical challenges that need to be overcome\nto realize this vision.\n  The long-term goal of this work is that truly invariant representations will\nultimately result from establishing formal, inclusive relationships between\nthese different domains. Using this framework, incomplete information in one or\nmore domains can be compensated for by parallelism and mappings within the\nvirtual world representation. To introduce this approach, I will review recent\ndevelopments in embodiment, virtual world technology, and neuroscience relevant\nto the control of virtual worlds. The next step will be to borrow ideas from\nfields such as brain science, applied mathematics, and cosmology to give proper\nperspective to this approach. A simple demonstration will then be given using\nan intuitive example of physical relativism. Finally, future directions for the\napplication of this method will be considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Apr 2011 20:07:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Alicea", "Bradly", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5377", "submitter": "Philipp Schaer", "authors": "Daniel Hienert, Benjamin Zapilko, Philipp Schaer, Brigitte Mathiak", "title": "VIZGR: Combining Data on a Visual Level", "comments": "To be published in Proceedings of 7th International Conference on Web\n  Information Systems and Technologies (WEBIST), 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5220/0003299902020211", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a novel method to connect data on the visualization\nlevel.
