Among the\nsoftware code there exist technical dependencies that arise from software\ncomponents using services from other components. The different ways of\nassigning the design, development, and testing of these software modules to\npeople can cause various coordination problems among them. We claim that the\ncollaboration of the developers, designers and testers must be related to and\ngoverned by the technical task structure. These collaboration practices are\nhandled in what we call Socio-Technical Patterns. The TESNA project (Technical\nSocial Network Analysis) we report on in this paper addresses this issue. We\npropose a method and a tool that a project manager can use in order to detect\nthe socio-technical coordination problems. We test the method and tool in a\ncase study of a small and innovative software product company.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 12:27:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Amrit", "Chintan", ""], ["van Hillegersberg", "Jos", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1260", "submitter": "Alain Barrat", "authors": "Lorenzo Isella, Juliette Stehl\\'e, Alain Barrat, Ciro Cattuto,\n  Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Pinton, Wouter Van den Broeck", "title": "What's in a crowd?

We compare two settings with very different properties, a scientific\nconference and a long-running museum exhibition. We track the behavioral\nnetworks of face-to-face proximity, and characterize them from both a static\nand a dynamic point of view, exposing important differences as well as striking\nsimilarities. We use our data to investigate the dynamics of a\nsusceptible-infected model for epidemic spreading that unfolds on the dynamical\nnetworks of human proximity. The spreading patterns are markedly different for\nthe conference and the museum case, and they are strongly impacted by the\ncausal structure of the network data. A deeper study of the spreading paths\nshows that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks would lead to\nerroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the dynamical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 14:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2010 07:58:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 11:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Isella", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Stehl\u00e9", "Juliette", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Pinton", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1803", "submitter": "Eva Isaksson", "authors": "Eva Isaksson", "title": "E-accessible Astronomy Resources", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Library and Information Services in\n  Astronomy VI, ASP Conference Proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Making online resources more accessible to physically challenged library\nusers is a topic deserving informed attention from astronomy librarians.\nRecommendations like WCAG 2.0 standards and section 508, in the United States,\nhave proven valuable, and some vendors are already making their products\ncompliant with them.

That means it measures the user's intent, and does not require the\nuser to move any muscles. In particular it should not require eye fixation of\nthe desired character. However, it has been shown that posterior electrodes\nprovide significant discriminative information, which is likely related to\nvisual processing. These findings imply the need for studies controlling the\neffect of eye movements. In experiments with a 3x3 character matrix, attention\nand eye fixation was directed to different characters. In the event-related\npotentials, a P300 occurred for the attended character, and N200 was seen for\nthe trials showing the focussed character. It occurred at posterior sites,\nreaching its peak at 200ms after stimulus onset. The results suggest that gaze\ndirection plays an important role in P300 speller paradigm. By controlling gaze\ndirection it is possible to separate voluntary and involuntary EEG responses to\nthe highlighting of characters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Jun 2010 18:06:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Frenzel", "Stefan", ""], ["Neubert", "Elke", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4539", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Siti Azura Ramlan and Nor Azman Ismail", "title": "A Study of User's Performance and Satisfaction on the Web Based Photo\n  Annotation with Speech Interaction", "comments": "IEEE Publication Format,\n  https://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computing, Vol. 2, No. 6, June 2010, NY, USA, ISSN\n  2151-9617", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper reports on empirical evaluation study of users' performance and\nsatisfaction with prototype of Web Based speech photo annotation with speech\ninteraction.
