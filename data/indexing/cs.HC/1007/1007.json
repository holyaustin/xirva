Large-scale datasets, however, are mostly available for\ncollective and statistical behaviors, at coarse granularities, while\nhigh-resolution data on person-to-person interactions are generally limited to\nrelatively small groups of individuals. Here we present a scalable experimental\nframework for gathering real-time data resolving face-to-face social\ninteractions with tunable spatial and temporal granularities. We use active\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual proximity in a\ndistributed fashion by exchanging low-power radio packets. We analyze the\ndynamics of person-to-person interaction networks obtained in three\nhigh-resolution experiments carried out at different orders of magnitude in\ncommunity size. The data sets exhibit common statistical properties and lack of\na characteristic time scale from 20 seconds to several hours. The association\nbetween the number of connections and their duration shows an interesting\nsuper-linear behavior, which indicates the possibility of defining\nsuper-connectors both in the number and intensity of connections. Taking\nadvantage of scalability and resolution, this experimental framework allows the\nmonitoring of social interactions, uncovering similarities in the way\nindividuals interact in different contexts, and identifying patterns of\nsuper-connector behavior in the community. These results could impact our\nunderstanding of all phenomena driven by face-to-face interactions, such as the\nspreading of transmissible infectious diseases and information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 15:35:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Colizza", "Vittoria", ""], ["Pinton", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Vespignani", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4303", "submitter": "Adrian Kuhn", "authors": "Adrian Kuhn and David Erni and Oscar Nierstrasz", "title": "Embedding Spatial Software Visualization in the IDE: an Exploratory\n  Study", "comments": "To appear in proceedings of SOFTVIS 2010 conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Software visualization can be of great use for understanding and exploring a\nsoftware system in an intuitive manner.
