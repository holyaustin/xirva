Thus, effective capture\nof information, and also its extraction, recording, exchange, sharing, and\nreuse become increasingly critical. These lead companies to adopt new improved\nmethodologies in managing the exchange and sharing of information. The aim of\nthis paper is to describe a collaborative framework system to exchange and\nshare information, which is based on: (i) The Product Process Collaboration\nOrganization model (PPCO) which defines product and process information, and\nthe various collaboration methods for the organizations involved in the supply\nchain. (ii) Viewpoint model describes relationships between each actor and the\ncomprehensive Product/Process model, defining each actor's \"domain of interest\"\nwithin the evolving product definition. (iii) A layer which defines the\ncomprehensive organization and collaboration relationships between the actors\nwithin the supply chain. (iv) Based on the above relationships, the last layer\nproposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on\nXML, is developed that supports optimal exchange/sharing of information. To\nillustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to\ncollaborative design of a new piston for an automotive engine. The focus is on\nuser-viewpoint integration to ensure that the adequate information is retrieved\nfrom the PPCO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2007 19:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Geryville", "Hichem", "", "LIESP"], ["Ouzrout", "Yacine", "", "LIESP"], ["Bouras", "Abdelaziz", "", "LIESP"], ["Sapidis", "Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1087", "submitter": "Matthias Brust R.", "authors": "Matthias R.

As evaluation is differently perceived and\nmodeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in\ndilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing\nand developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task.\nAdvancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is\neven harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense\nchallenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and\ncontroversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our\nfield if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning\nmodel and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task\nis to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy,\npsychology, social sciences, and engineering.

Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks\nis arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could\neliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is\nto overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with\ninstant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.\nHowever, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the\norganizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that\ndescribe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this\npaper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks\nto form hybrid wireless networks.
