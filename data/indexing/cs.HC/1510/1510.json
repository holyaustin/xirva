These dynamics are characterized by changes in temporal phases\n(onset-apex-offset) and intensity of emotion expressions and AUs, the\nappearance of which may vary considerably among target subjects, making the\nrecognition/detection task very challenging. The state-of-the-art Latent\nConditional Random Fields (L-CRF) framework allows one to efficiently encode\nthese dynamics through the latent states accounting for the temporal\nconsistency in emotion expression and ordinal relationships between its\nintensity levels, these latent states are typically assumed to be either\nunordered (nominal) or fully ordered (ordinal). Yet, such an approach is often\ntoo restrictive. For instance, in the case of AU detection, the goal is to\ndiscriminate between the segments of an image sequence in which this AU is\nactive or inactive. While the sequence segments containing activation of the\ntarget AU may better be described using ordinal latent states, the inactive\nsegments better be described using unordered (nominal) latent states, as no\nassumption can be made about their underlying structure (since they can contain\neither neutral faces or activations of non-target AUs). To address this, we\npropose the variable-state L-CRF (VSL-CRF) model that automatically selects the\noptimal latent states for the target image sequence. To reduce the model\noverfitting either the nominal or ordinal latent states, we propose a novel\ngraph-Laplacian regularization of the latent states.
