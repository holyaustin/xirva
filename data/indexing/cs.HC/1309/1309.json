We build a \"touch-based biometrics\" model of the owner by extracting\nsome principle features, and then verify whether the current user is the owner\nor guest/attacker. When using the smartphone, the unique operating dynamics of\nthe user is detected and learnt by collecting the sensor data and touch events\nsilently. When users are mobile, the micro-movement of mobile devices caused by\ntouch is suppressed by that due to the large scale user-movement which will\nrender the touch-based biometrics ineffective. To address this, we integrate a\nmovement-based biometrics for each user with previous touch-based biometrics.\nWe conduct extensive evaluations of our approaches on the Android smartphone,\nwe show that the user identification accuracy is over 99%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Aug 2013 08:16:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bo", "Cheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Lan", ""], ["Li", "Xiang-Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0185", "submitter": "Dr. R.V.
