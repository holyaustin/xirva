The data was obtained by periodic mining of a KML-file\naccessible through the Bicing website. Although in principle very noisy, after\nsome preprocessing and filtering steps the data allows to detect temporal\npatterns in mobility as well as identify residential, university, business and\nleisure areas of the city. The results lead to a proposal for an improvement of\nthe bicing website, including a prediction of the number of available bikes in\na certain station within the next minutes/hours. Furthermore a model for\nidentifying the most probable routes between stations is briefly sketched.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2008 00:15:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kaltenbrunner", "Andreas", ""], ["Meza", "Rodrigo", ""], ["Grivolla", "Jens", ""], ["Codina", "Joan", ""], ["Banchs", "Rafael", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4431", "submitter": "Weidong Huang", "authors": "Weidong Huang", "title": "An Eye Tracking Study into the Effects of Graph Layout", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a\nfair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve\nreadability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when\nthey are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to\nunderstand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance.\n  As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was\nconducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of\ncrossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance.\nSixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six\ndrawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra\neye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have\nlittle impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a\npath between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the\npath go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view\nto further confirmation in future work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 11:50:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Weidong", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4884", "submitter": "Bradly  Alicea", "authors": "Bradly Alicea", "title": "The adaptability of physiological systems optimizes performance: new\n  directions in augmentation", "comments": "12 pages, 7 figures, 1 table (review, theoretical overview paper)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper contributes to the human-machine interface community in two ways:\nas a critique of the closed-loop AC (augmented cognition) approach, and as a\nway to introduce concepts from complex systems and systems physiology into the\nfield.
