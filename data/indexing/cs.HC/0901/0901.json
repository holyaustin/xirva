The\nreturn probability as a function of time as well as the distribution of time\nintervals between consecutive visits are measured and found to be independent\nof the level of activity of single users. The results indicate a rich variety\nof individual behaviors and seem to preclude the possibility of defining a\ncharacteristic frequency for each user in his/her visits to a single site.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2009 15:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Goncalves", "Bruno", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jose J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3839", "submitter": "Bruno Goncalves", "authors": "Bruno Goncalves, Mark R.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize\nthe properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in\nwhich destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show\nthat the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more\nbroadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is\nmore broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive\nvisits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.\nTo account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation\nmodel in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as\nteleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic\nproperty caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model\nreproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also\ngenerating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return\ntime distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the\nextreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the\nmore narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Jan 2009 15:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Goncalves", "Bruno", ""], ["Meiss", "Mark R.", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jose J.", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4016", "submitter": "Daniel Shawcross Wilkerson", "authors": "Daniel Shawcross Wilkerson", "title": "A Proposal for Proquints: Identifiers that are Readable, Spellable, and\n  Pronounceable", "comments": "Added a suggestion that \"0q-\" be used as the optional magic number\n  prefix for proquint strings.
