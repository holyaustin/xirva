Data\ncollection was based on observations (by the cognitive ergonomics researcher)\nand simultaneous verbalisations (by the designers) in empirical studies\nconducted in the context of industrial design projects. The contribution of\nthis research is typical of cognitive ergonomics, in that it provides data on\nactual activities implemented by designers in their actual work situation\n(rather than on prescribed and/or idealised processes and methods). Data\npresented concern global strategies (the way in which designers actually\norganise their activity) and local strategies (reuse in design). Results from\ncognitive ergonomics and other research that challenges the way in which people\nare supposed to work with existing systems are generally not received warmly.\nAbundant corroboration of such results is required before industry may consider\ntaking them into account. The opportunistic organisation of design activity is\ntaken here as an example of this reluctance. The results concerning this aspect\nof design have been verified repeatedly, but only prototypes and experimental\nsystems implementing some of the requirements formulated on their basis, are\nunder development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2007 09:29:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Visser", "Willemien", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "0711.1227", "submitter": "Willemien Visser", "authors": "Willemien Visser (INRIA Rocquencourt)", "title": "Designing as Construction of Representations: A Dynamic Viewpoint in\n  Cognitive Design Research", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Human-Computer Interaction 21, 1 (2006) 103-152", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  This article presents a cognitively oriented viewpoint on design. It focuses\non cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, i.e., the actual cognitive\nactivity implemented by designers during their work on professional design\nprojects. Rather than conceiving de-signing as problem solving - Simon's\nsymbolic information processing (SIP) approach - or as a reflective practice or\nsome other form of situated activity - the situativity (SIT) approach - we\nconsider that, from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is most appropriately\ncharacterised as a construction of representations. After a critical discussion\nof the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our view-point. This\npresentation concerns the evolving nature of representations regarding levels\nof abstraction and degrees of precision, the function of external\nrepresentations, and specific qualities of representation in collective design.\nDesigning is described at three levels: the organisation of the activity, its\nstrategies, and its design-representation construction activities (different\nways to generate, trans-form, and evaluate representations). Even if we adopt a\n\"generic design\" stance, we claim that design can take different forms\ndepending on the nature of the artefact, and we propose some candidates for\ndimensions that allow a distinction to be made between these forms of design.\nWe discuss the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of cognitive\ndesign research occupied with the quality of design. We close our discussion of\nrepresentational structures and activities by an outline of some directions\nregarding their functional linkages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2007 09:33:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Visser", "Willemien", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "0711.2239", "submitter": "Guillaume Thomann", "authors": "Guillaume Thomann (LGS), Jean Caelen (LIG), Morgan Verdier (LGS),\n  Brigitte Meillon (LIG)", "title": "Mise en place de sc\\'enarios pour la conception d'outils en Chirurgie\n  Minimalement Invasive", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Les Syst\\`emes de Production, Lavoisier (Ed.)

In this paper, we describe a\nco-operative design case study where we analyse some annotation practices,\nmainly focused on design minutes recorded during project reviews. We point out\nspecific requirements concerning annotation needs. Based on these requirements,\nwe propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to\nsupport communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of\nannotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary\nannotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a\nset of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing\nexpress/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory\ndebates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,\nand we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design\ncontext, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.\nAfter the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse\nannotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section\nis dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and\ndefine the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic\nannotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based\non our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2007 19:22:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hisarciklilar", "Onur", "", "LGS"], ["Boujut", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", "", "LGS"]]}, {"id": "0711.2760", "submitter": "Vita Hinze-Hoare", "authors": "Vita Hinze-Hoare", "title": "Computer Supported Collaborative Research", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  It is suggested that a new area of CSCR (Computer Supported Collaborative\nResearch) is distinguished from CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work)\nand CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) and that the demarcation\nbetween the three areas could do with greater clarification and prescription.\n  Although the areas of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), CSCW, and CSCL are\nnow relatively well established, the related field of Computer Supported\nCollaborative Research (CSCR) is new and little understood.
