Moreover, as common\nsense knowledge varies from group to group of people, it can be used for\ndeveloping applications capable of giving different feedback for different\ntarget groups, as the applications presented along this chapter illustrate,\nallowing, in this way, interface personalization taking into account cultural\nissues. For the purpose of using common sense knowledge in the development and\ndesign of computer systems, it is necessary to provide an architecture that\nallows it. This chapter presents LIAs approaches for common sense knowledge\nacquisition, representation and use, as well as for natural language\nprocessing, contributing with those ones who intent to get into this\nchallenging world to get started.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jan 2010 23:25:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Anacleto", "Junia Coutinho", ""], ["de Carvalho", "Aparecido Fabiano Pinatti", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0420", "submitter": "Vedran Kordic", "authors": "Kikuo Asai", "title": "The Role of Head-Up Display in Computer- Assisted Instruction", "comments": "www.sciyo.com", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We investigated the role of HUDs in CAI.

We also introduce a novel method for\nestimating a worker's reservation wage--the smallest wage a worker is willing\nto accept for a task and the key parameter in our labor supply model. It shows\nthat the reservation wages of a sample of workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk\n(AMT) are approximately log normally distributed, with a median wage of\n$1.38/hour. At the median wage, the point elasticity of extensive labor supply\nis 0.43. We discuss how to use our calibrated model to make predictions in\napplied work. Two experimental tests of the model show that many workers\nrespond rationally to offered incentives. However, a non-trivial fraction of\nsubjects appear to set earnings targets. These \"target earners\" consider not\njust the offered wage--which is what the rational model predicts--but also\ntheir proximity to earnings goals. Interestingly, a number of workers clearly\nprefer earning total amounts evenly divisible by 5, presumably because these\namounts make good targets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2010 20:55:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Horton", "John", ""], ["Chilton", "Lydia", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0642", "submitter": "Bertrand David", "authors": "Bertrand David (LIESP), Chuantao Yin (LIESP), Ren\\'e Chalon (LIESP)", "title": "Contextual Mobile Learning Strongly Related to Industrial Activities:\n  Principles and Case Study", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "iJAC Journal, International Jouranl of Advanced Corporate Learning\n  2, 3 (2009) 12-20", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  M-learning (mobile learning) can take various forms.
