In several programs you can find some moveable objects, but it is an\nextremely rare thing. However, the design of applications on the basis of\nmoveable and resizable objects opens an absolutely new way of programming; such\napplications are much more effective in users' work, because each user can\nadjust an application to his purposes. Programs, using adaptive interface, only\nimplement the designer's ideas of what would be the best reaction to any of the\nusers' doings or commands. Applications on moveable elements do not have such\npredetermined system of rules; they are fully controlled by the users. This\narticle describes and demonstrates the new way of applications' design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2009 15:08:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Andreyev", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1629", "submitter": "Petar Kormushev", "authors": "Yoichi Yamazaki, Fangyan Dong, Yuta Masuda, Yukiko Uehara, Petar\n  Kormushev, Hai An Vu, Phuc Quang Le, Kaoru Hirota", "title": "Fuzzy inference based mentality estimation for eye robot agent", "comments": "2 pages, in Japanese", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of 23rd Fuzzy System Symposium (FSS 2007), pp.\n  387-388, 2007", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Household robots need to communicate with human beings in a friendly fashion.\nTo achieve better understanding of displayed information, an importance and a\ncertainty of the information should be communicated together with the main\ninformation.
