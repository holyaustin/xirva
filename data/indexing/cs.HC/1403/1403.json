In this paper, we present a novel application of Markov chains to\nmodel sequential usage patterns that can be found in the change-logs of\ncollaborative ontology-engineering projects. We provide a detailed presentation\nof the analysis process, describing all the required steps that are necessary\nto apply and determine the best fitting Markov chain model. Amongst others, the\nmodel and results allow us to identify structural properties and regularities\nas well as predict future actions based on usage sequences. We are specifically\ninterested in determining the appropriate Markov chain orders which postulate\non how many previous actions future ones depend on. To demonstrate the\npractical usefulness of the extracted Markov chains we conduct sequential\npattern analyses on a large-scale collaborative ontology-engineering dataset,\nthe International Classification of Diseases in its 11th revision. To further\nexpand on the usefulness of the presented analysis, we show that the collected\nsequential patterns provide potentially actionable information for\nuser-interface designers, ontology-engineering tool developers and\nproject-managers to monitor, coordinate and dynamically adapt to the natural\ndevelopment processes that occur when collaboratively engineering an ontology.\nWe hope that presented work will spur a new line of ontology-development tools,\nevaluation-techniques and new insights, further taking the interactive nature\nof the collaborative ontology-engineering process into consideration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 10:39:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 14:11:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 12:36:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Walk", "Simon", ""], ["Singer", "Philipp", ""], ["Strohmaier", "Markus", ""], ["Helic", "Denis", ""], ["Noy", "Natalya F.", ""], ["Musen", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.1465", "submitter": "Sacha Gomez", "authors": "P.

Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile\ntext entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to\ntraditional physical keyboards.

This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63\nparticipants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual\naccounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to\nrecall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and\nprobabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed\ncracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect\nof text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental\ngroups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password\nthan the control group ($t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004$). The choices for character\ntypes in each group were also significantly different ($p=0.048, FET$).

As an example, the semiconductor technologies\nare used to highlight the complexities especially with respect to energy and\nwater consumption. The need for specific representations and metric to\nseparately assess products and technologies is discussed. It is highlighted\nthat applying product-oriented approaches would result in abandoning or\ndisfavoring of new technologies that could otherwise help toward a better\nworld. Second, several believed-untouchable hot spots are highlighted to\nemphasize on their importance and footprint. The list includes, but not limited\nto, i) User Computer-Interfaces (UCIs), especially screens and displays, ii)\nNetwork-Computer Interlaces (NCIs), such as electronic and optical ports, and\niii) electricity power interfaces. In addition, considering cross-regional\nsocial and economic impacts, and also taking into account the marketing nature\nof the need for many ICT's product and services in both forms of hardware and\nsoftware, the complexity of End of Life (EoL) stage of ICT products,\ntechnologies, and services is explored. Finally, the impact of smart management\nand intelligence, and in general software, in ICT solutions and products is\nhighlighted. In particular, it is observed that, even using the same\ntechnology, the significance of software could be highly variable depending on\nthe level of intelligence and awareness deployed. With examples from an\ninterconnected network of data centers managed using Dynamic Voltage and\nFrequency Scaling (DVFS) technology and smart cooling systems, it is shown that\nthe unadjusted assessments could be highly uncertain, and even inconsistent, in\ncalculating the management component's significance on the ICT impacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2014 03:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 20:23:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 03:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Moghaddam", "Reza Farrahi", ""], ["Moghaddam", "Fereydoun Farrahi", ""], ["Dandres", "Thomas", ""], ["Lemieux", "Yves", ""], ["Samson", "R\u00e9jean", ""], ["Cheriet", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3131", "submitter": "Harika As{\\i}l{\\i} HA", "authors": "Harika Asili and Omer Ozgur Tanriover", "title": "Comparison Of Document Management Systems By Meta Modelling And\n  Workforce Centric Tuning Measures", "comments": "11 pages , 2 figures and 2 tables , journal paper", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and\n  Information Technology (IJCSEIT), Vol. 4,No. 1, February 2014", "doi": "10.5121/ijcseit.2014.4106", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Document management software are used widely for office paper management and\nrelated workflows.
