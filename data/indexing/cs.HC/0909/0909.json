It reports on an expert evaluation of the voting mechanisms\nof each website and a quantitative data analysis of users' aggregate voting\nbehavior. The results suggest that voting follows different patterns across the\nwebsites, with higher barrier to vote introducing a more of one-off voters and\nattracting mostly experts. The results also show that that one-off voters tend\nto vote on popular items, while experts mostly vote for obscure, low-rated\nitems. The study concludes with design suggestions to address the \"wisdom of\nthe crowd\" bias.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 18:31:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2009 13:46:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2009 13:40:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 08:43:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2009 01:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kostakos", "Vassilis", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1138", "submitter": "Richard Diamond", "authors": "Richard V.

Evidence of\nimpact of the unconscious functioning is presented. The unconscious is\ncharacterised as being a responsive, contextual, and autonomous participant of\nhuman-computer interaction. The unconscious participation occurs independently\nof one's cognitive and educational levels and, if ignored, leads to learning\ninefficiencies and compulsive behaviours, illustrations of which are provided.\nThree practical approaches to a study of subjective user experience are\noutlined as follows: (a) tracing operant conditioning effects of software, (b)\nregistering signs of brain activity psychological or information processing\nmeaning of which is well-explored and (c) exploring submodality interfaces.\nImplications for improvement of current usability study methods, such as\neye-tracking, are generally considered.

They have mainly focused on parsing and interpreting\nnatural language queries to generate them in a formal database language. We\nenvision the reverse functionality, where the system would be able to take the\ninternal result of that translation, say in SQL form, translate it back into\nnatural language, and show it to the initiator of the query for verification.\nLikewise, information extraction has received considerable attention in the\npast ten years or so, identifying structured information in free text so that\nit may then be stored appropriately and queried. Validation of the records\nstored with a backward translation into text would again be very powerful.\nVerification and validation of query and data input of a database system\ncorrespond to just one example of the many important applications that would\nbenefit greatly from having mature techniques for translating such database\nconstructs into free-flowing text. The problem appears to be deceivingly\nsimple, as there are no ambiguities or other complications in interpreting\ninternal database elements, so initially a straightforward translation appears\nadequate. Reality teaches us quite the opposite, however, as the resulting text\nshould be expressive, i.e., accurate in capturing the underlying queries or\ndata, and effective, i.e., allowing fast and unique interpretation of them.\nAchieving both of these qualities is very difficult and raises several\ntechnical challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we first expose\nthe reader to several situations and applications that need translation into\nnatural language, thereby, motivating the problem. We then outline, by example,\nthe research problems that need to be solved, separately for data translations\nand query translations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:10:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Simitsis", "Alkis", "", "HP Labs"], ["Ioannidis", "Yannis", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2058", "submitter": "Sihem Amer-Yahia", "authors": "Sihem Amer-Yahia (Yahoo!

Travel and sharing\narticles with their friends on New York Times. This has led to the emergence of\n{\\em social content sites}, which is being facilitated by initiatives like\nOpenID (http://www.openid.net/) and OpenSocial (http://www.opensocial.org/).\nThese community standards enable the open access to users' social profiles and\nconnections by individual content sites and are bringing content-oriented sites\nand social networking sites ever closer. The integration of content and social\ninformation raises new challenges for {\\em information management and\ndiscovery} over such sites. We propose a logical architecture, named\n\\kw{SocialScope}, consisting of three layers, for tackling the challenges. The\n{\\em content management} layer is responsible for integrating, maintaining and\nphysically accessing the content and social data. The {\\em information\ndiscovery} layer takes care of analyzing content to derive interesting new\ninformation, and interpreting and processing the user's information need to\nidentify relevant information. Finally, the {\\em information presentation}\nlayer explores the discovered information and helps users better understand it\nin a principled way. We describe the challenges in each layer and propose\nsolutions for some of those challenges. In particular, we propose a uniform\nalgebraic framework, which can be leveraged to uniformly and flexibly specify\nmany of the information discovery and analysis tasks and provide the foundation\nfor the optimization of those tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 22:08:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Amer-Yahia", "Sihem", "", "Yahoo!

Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable\noptions to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast,\ntraditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such\nas drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however,\nhas the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically\nto an individual's clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to\nmake a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time\nto make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by\nallowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection\nprobabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct\n(posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application\nand a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon's performance, we compared the\nwriting application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing\n(row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface\nthan with the scanning interface. An experienced user (author TB, with > 10\nhours practice) wrote at speeds of 9.3 words per minute with Nomon, using 1.2\nclicks per character and making no errors in the final text.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Sep 2009 21:39:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2010 16:59:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Broderick", "Tamara", ""], ["MacKay", "David John Cameron", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2452", "submitter": "Grenville Croll", "authors": "Susan Allan", "title": "Excel Modelling - Transparency, Auditing and Business Use", "comments": "7 Pages, 6 Colour Figures", "journal-ref": "Proc.
