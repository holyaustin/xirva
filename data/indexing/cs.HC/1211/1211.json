The findings\nrevealed that an average of 15 consultations per doctor to a specialist doctor\nper week was done through face to face or through telephone conversation\ninstead of using a computer-mediated tool. Participants cited reasons for not\nusing computer-mediated tool for communication due to slow transmission speed\nof the Internet and regular down turn of the Internet connectivity, constant\nelectricity power outages and lack of e-health application software to support\nreal time computer-mediated communication. The results led to the\nrecommendation of a hybrid cloud computing architecture for improving\ncommunication between doctors in hospitals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Nov 2012 06:46:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Coleman", "Alfred", ""], ["Herselman", "Marlien E", ""], ["Coleman", "Mary", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.6411", "submitter": "Mohammed El-Dosuky", "authors": "Mohammed El-Dosuky, Ahmed EL-Bassiouny, Taher Hamza and Magdy Rashad", "title": "New Heuristics for Interfacing Human Motor System using Brain Waves", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are many new forms of interfacing human users to machines.
