It is evaluated using a hotel evacuation scenario. Four different\nkinds of supporting information are compared, standard exit signs, floor plans\nwith indicated exit routes, guiding lines on the floor and simulated agents\nleading the way. The results indicate that guiding lines are the most efficient\nway to support an evacuation but the natural behavior of following others comes\nvery close. On another level the results are consistent with previously\nperformed real and virtual experiments and validate the use of a telepresence\nsystem in evacuation studies. It is shown that using a microscopic traffic\nsimulator extends the possibilities for evaluation, e.g. by adding simulated\nhumans to the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2011 11:52:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kretz", "Tobias", ""], ["Hengst", "Stefan", ""], ["Arias", "Antonia P\u00e9rez", ""], ["Friedberger", "Simon", ""], ["Hanebeck", "Uwe D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1842", "submitter": "Laurent George", "authors": "Laurent George (INRIA - IRISA), Laurent Bonnet (INRIA - IRISA),\n  Anatole L\\'ecuyer (INRIA - IRISA)", "title": "Freeze the BCI until the user is ready: a pilot study of a BCI inhibitor", "comments": "5th International Brain-Computer Interface Workshop (2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)\ninhibitor, which is meant to standby the BCI until the user is ready, in order\nto improve the overall performance and usability of the system. BCI inhibitor\ncan be defined as a system that monitors user's state and inhibits BCI\ninteraction until specific requirements (e.g. brain activity pattern, user\nattention level) are met. In this pilot study, a hybrid BCI is designed and\ncomposed of a classic synchronous BCI system based on motor imagery and a BCI\ninhibitor. The BCI inhibitor initiates the control period of the BCI when\nrequirements in terms of brain activity are reached (i.e. stability in the beta\nband). Preliminary results with four participants suggest that BCI inhibitor\nsystem can improve BCI performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 09:47:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["George", "Laurent", "", "INRIA - IRISA"], ["Bonnet", "Laurent", "", "INRIA - IRISA"], ["L\u00e9cuyer", "Anatole", "", "INRIA - IRISA"]]}, {"id": "1111.1896", "submitter": "Bruno Gon\\c{c}alves", "authors": "Janette Lehmann, Bruno Gon\\c{c}alves, Jos\\'e J.

Here we focus on spikes of\ncollective attention in Twitter, and specifically on peaks in the popularity of\nhashtags. Users employ hashtags as a form of social annotation, to define a\nshared context for a specific event, topic, or meme. We analyze a large-scale\nrecord of Twitter activity and find that the evolution of hastag popularity\nover time defines discrete classes of hashtags. We link these dynamical classes\nto the events the hashtags represent and use text mining techniques to provide\na semantic characterization of the hastag classes. Moreover, we track the\npropagation of hashtags in the Twitter social network and find that epidemic\nspreading plays a minor role in hastag popularity, which is mostly driven by\nexogenous factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 13:06:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 17:45:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lehmann", "Janette", ""], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Bruno", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jos\u00e9 J.", ""], ["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5500", "submitter": "Armanda Rodrigues", "authors": "Andr\\'e Sabino and Armanda Rodrigues", "title": "Understanding the Role of Cooperation in Emergency Plan Construction", "comments": "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, The 8th International Conference on\n  Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management -- ISCRAM 2011, held\n  in Lisbon, Portugal, May 8-11, 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we describe a proposal for information organization for\ncomputer supported cooperative work, while working with spatial information.
