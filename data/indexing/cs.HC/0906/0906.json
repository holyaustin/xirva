Twenty-five\nrespondents (32%) reported seeking extra information on web pages and forums,\nin addition to asking their peers for advice (related to the nature of the item\nto be bought). Moreover, from the remaining 52 subjects, only 6 (8%) were\nconfident enough to make prompt comparisons between items and an immediate\npurchasing choice, while 17 respondents (22%) expressed the need for being away\nfrom persuasive elements. The remaining 29 respondents (38%) reported having a\nsuboptimal strategy for making their shopping decisions (i.e. buying all items,\nnot buying, or choosing randomly). Therefore, the majority of our participants\n(70% = 32% + 38%) had social and information needs when making purchasing\ndecisions. This result motivates the development of applications that would\nallow consumers to ask shopping questions to their social network while\non-the-go.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 13:47:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Cherubini", "Mauro", ""], ["de Oliveira", "Rodrigo", ""], ["Oliver", "Nuria", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3074", "submitter": "Miao Song", "authors": "Miao Song", "title": "Feynman Algorithm Implementation for Comparison with Euler in a Uniform\n  Elastic Two-Layer 2D and 3D Object Dynamic Deformation Framework in OpenGL\n  with GUI", "comments": "28 pages, 15 figures; from June 2008; portions of this work have been\n  subsequently published in conferences", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DS cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We implement for comparative purposes the Feynman algorithm within a\nC++-based framework for two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time\nsoftbody simulation based on physics modeling methods. To facilitate the\ncomparison, we implement initial timing measurements on the same hardware\nagainst that of Euler integrator in the softbody framework by varying different\nalgorithm parameters. Due to a relatively large number of such variations we\nimplement a GLUI-based user-interface to allow for much more finer control over\nthe simulation process at real-time, which was lacking completely in the\nprevious versions of the framework. We show our currents results based on the\nenhanced framework. The two-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer\nelastic mass-spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of\nthe inner layer can be set differently from the density of the outer layer; the\nmotion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer.\nThese special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object,\nresult in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquid\nnon-uniform deformation. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well\nillustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling,\nand floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty\nmethod and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential\nEquation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them,\nand observe the response to their action in real-time and we provide an\nextensible framework and its implementation for comparative studies of\ndifferent physical-based modeling and integration algorithm implementations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2009 05:39:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Miao", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3224", "submitter": "Sergey Andreyev", "authors": "Sergey Andreyev", "title": "Personal applications, based on moveable / resizable elements", "comments": "14 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  All the modern day applications have the interface, absolutely defined by the\ndevelopers.
