We were specifically\ninterested in analysing paper use for people in the research side of academia,\nand seeing how our results compare to existing work. We recruited and\ninterviewed participants from academia to understand what kind of tasks they\nuse paper for, what kind of tasks they use computing devices for and what\nmotivates them to use these two media.\n  We found that, despite having access to at least one personal computing\ndevice, the participants preferred to work with paper in many situations. This\nappears to be attributed to certain intrinsic qualities that paper has, such as\nopen format, easy navigation, readability, and the aff?ordances these qualities\nprovide. In order to eventually replace paper with devices, designers of new\ntechnology will have to successfully emulate these qualities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2012 20:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Joey", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.1494", "submitter": "Georg Singer", "authors": "Georg Singer, Ulrich Norbisrath, Dirk Lewandowski", "title": "Impact of Gender and Age on performing Search Tasks Online", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1524/9783486718782.23", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  More and more people use the Internet to work on duties of their daily work\nroutine.

However, most elicitation\nmethods ask for users' predicted utilities based on hypothetical scenarios\nrather than more realistic experienced utilities. This is especially true in\ninterface customization, where users are asked to assess novel interface\ndesigns. We propose experiential utility elicitation methods for customization\nand compare these to predictivemethods.

A key property of the combined CIP image is the\nencoding of the arrival time information from greyscale images into the hue of\nthe color in the CIP image. A few minor improvements to the calculation of the\nCIP image are introduced that substantially improve the quality of the\nvisualisation. One improvement is interpolating of the greyscale images in time\nbefore calculation of the CIP image. A second is the use of hue cycling - where\nthe hue of the color is cycled through more than once in an image. The hue\ncycling allows the variation of the hue to be concentrated in structures of\ninterest. If there is a zero time point hue cycling can be applied after zero\ntime and before zero time can be indicated by greyscale. If there is an end\ntime point hue cycling can be applied before the end time and pixels can be set\nto black after the end time. An angiogram of a brain is used to demonstrate the\nsubstantial improvements hue cycling brings to CIP images. A third improvement\nis the use of maximum intensity projection for 2D rendering of a 3D CIP image\nvolume. A fourth improvement allowing interpreters to interactively adjust the\nphase of the hue via standard contrast - brightness controls using lookup\ntables. Other potential applications of CIP are also mentioned.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2012 11:05:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 20:16:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 11:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2015 16:00:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 04:27:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cover", "Keith S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6222", "submitter": "Saeid Abolfazli", "authors": "Saeid Abolfazli, Zohre Sanaei, Muhammad Shiraz, Hassan Keshavarz,\n  Abdullah Gani", "title": "An Evolutionary Study of Rich Mobile Applications", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some copyright\n  issues", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Delivering Rich User eXperience (RUX) with the current explosion of\nsmartphone as real ubiquitous computing device requires adaptive application\narchitecture.
