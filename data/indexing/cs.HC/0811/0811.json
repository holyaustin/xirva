However, at this\nstage, it is important to provide tools facilitating the use and deployment of\nthese technologies by end-users. In this paper, we describe EdHibou, an\nautomatically generated, ontology-based graphical user interface that\nintegrates in a semantic portal. The particularity of EdHibou is that it makes\nuse of OWL reasoning capabilities to provide intelligent features, such as\ndecision support, upon the underlying ontology. We present an application of\nEdHibou to medical decision support based on a formalization of clinical\nguidelines in OWL and show how it can be customized thanks to an ontology of\ngraphical components.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2008 14:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Badra", "Fadi", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"], ["D'Aquin", "Mathieu", "", "KMI"], ["Lieber", "Jean", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"], ["Meilender", "Thomas", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"]]}, {"id": "0811.0335", "submitter": "Sylvie Saget", "authors": "Sylvie Saget, Francois Legras, Gilles Coppin", "title": "Cooperative interface of a swarm of UAVs", "comments": "First Conference on Humans Operating Unmanned Systems (HUMOUS-08),\n  Brest : France (2008)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  After presenting the broad context of authority sharing, we outline how\nintroducing more natural interaction in the design of the ground operator\ninterface of UV systems should help in allowing a single operator to manage the\ncomplexity of his/her task.

When individuals wear the beacons as a badge, a persistent radio\ncontact between the RFID devices can be used as a proxy for a social\ninteraction between individuals.
