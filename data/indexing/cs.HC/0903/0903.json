However, this raises a speed\nproblem. That is, if NLP module can not process sentences in durable time\ndelay, users will never use the system. As a result, systems which are strict\nwith processing time, such as dialogue systems, web search systems, automatic\ncustomer service systems, especially real-time systems, have to abandon NLP\nmodule in order to get a faster system response. This paper aims to solve the\nspeed problem. In this paper, at first, the construction of a syntactic parser\nwhich is based on corpus machine learning and statistics model is introduced,\nand then a speed problem analysis is performed on the parser and its\nalgorithms. Based on the analysis, two accelerating methods, Compressed POS Set\nand Syntactic Patterns Pruning, are proposed, which can effectively improve the\ntime efficiency of parsing in NLP module. To evaluate different parameters in\nthe accelerating algorithms, two new factors, PT and RT, are introduced and\nexplained in detail. Experiments are also completed to prove and test these\nmethods, which will surely contribute to the application of NLP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:39:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 11:37:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Zhe", ""], ["Wen", "Dunwei", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0735", "submitter": "Joost Broekens", "authors": "Joost Broekens", "title": "Modeling the Experience of Emotion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Affective computing has proven to be a viable field of research comprised of\na large number of multidisciplinary researchers resulting in work that is\nwidely published. The majority of this work consists of computational models of\nemotion recognition, computational modeling of causal factors of emotion and\nemotion expression through rendered and robotic faces. A smaller part is\nconcerned with modeling the effects of emotion, formal modeling of cognitive\nappraisal theory and models of emergent emotions. Part of the motivation for\naffective computing as a field is to better understand emotional processes\nthrough computational modeling. One of the four major topics in affective\ncomputing is computers that have emotions (the others are recognizing,\nexpressing and understanding emotions). A critical and neglected aspect of\nhaving emotions is the experience of emotion (Barrett, Mesquita, Ochsner, and\nGross, 2007): what does the content of an emotional episode look like, how does\nthis content change over time and when do we call the episode emotional. Few\nmodeling efforts have these topics as primary focus. The launch of a journal on\nsynthetic emotions should motivate research initiatives in this direction, and\nthis research should have a measurable impact on emotion research in\npsychology. I show that a good way to do so is to investigate the psychological\ncore of what an emotion is: an experience. I present ideas on how the\nexperience of emotion could be modeled and provide evidence that several\ncomputational models of emotion are already addressing the issue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 11:26:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Broekens", "Joost", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1680", "submitter": "Chao He", "authors": "H.

Emering Resource Space (ERS) is a class of resources characterized by\na concept set. ERSes compose a lattice (ERSL) via concept association. A series\nof exploration operations is proposed to guide users to explore through ERSL\nwith more demanding and richer semantics than current faceted navigation.

In\nthis paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of\npower law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although\nprevious research has already shown that power laws emerge in tagging systems,\nthe cause of why power law distributions emerge is not understood empirically.\nThe majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the\nliterature assume that the emergence of power laws in tagging systems is mainly\ndriven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions\nprovided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior\nleads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular\nwhich is also known as the `rich get richer' or a preferential attachment\nmodel. We present experimental results that show that the power law\ndistribution forms regardless of whether or not tag suggestions are presented\nto the users. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is\nrather subtle; the resulting power law distribution is `compressed' if tag\nsuggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a\n`compressed' top of the power law distribution. The consequences of this\nexperiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the\nformation of power law distributions in tagging systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 14:48:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bollen", "Dirk", ""], ["Halpin", "Harry", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2207", "submitter": "Damiano Zanardini", "authors": "Yoshihiro Adachi", "title": "Prolog Visualization System Using Logichart Diagrams", "comments": "Paper presented at the 18th Workshop on Logic-based Methods in\n  Programming Environments (WLPE2008, arXiv:0903.1598).

We use non-parametric statistical tests in order to estimate the\nsignificance level of reliability of global distributions to describe activity\npatterns of single users. Global inter-event time probability distributions are\nnot representative for the behavior of single users: the shape of single\nusers'inter-event distributions is strongly influenced by the total number of\noperations performed by the users and distributions of the total number of\noperations performed by users are heterogeneous. A universal behavior can be\nanyway found by suppressing the intrinsic dependence of the global probability\ndistribution on the activity of the users. This suppression can be performed by\nsimply dividing the inter-event times with their average values. Differently,\nwaiting time probability distributions seem to be independent of the activity\nof users and global probability distributions are able to significantly\nrepresent the replying activity patterns of single users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Mar 2009 16:24:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 15:21:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Radicchi", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4261", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Florentina Anica Pintea", "title": "On-Line Tests", "comments": "8 pages, exposed on 4th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2007, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
