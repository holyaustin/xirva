Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or\nsearching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a\nspecific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an\ninsect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not\nrelevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim\nthat users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in\nthe form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this\nmetadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search\nperformance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision\nby filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network\nthat includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic\nmodel that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics\ncontained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be\ndescribed by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics\nfound by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding\nimages on topics that are of interest to the user.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:31:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Plangprasopchok", "Anon", ""], ["Wong", "Chio", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.2542", "submitter": "Joan Llobera", "authors": "Joan Llobera", "title": "Narratives within immersive technologies", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  The main goal of this project is to research technical advances in order to\nenhance the possibility to develop narratives within immersive mediated\nenvironments.

Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in\nconsumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad\nhoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies;\nand strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the\nreliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked\nstorage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2007 02:35:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Marshall", "Catherine C.", ""], ["Bly", "Sara", ""], ["Brun-Cottan", "Francoise", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3662", "submitter": "Tian-Jian Jiang", "authors": "Mike Tian-Jian Jiang, James Zhan, Jaimie Lin, Jerry Lin, Wen-Lien Hsu", "title": "An Automated Evaluation Metric for Chinese Text Entry", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": "Jiang, Mike Tian-Jian, et al. \"Robustness analysis of adaptive\n  chinese input methods.\" Advances in Text Input Methods (WTIM 2011) (2011): 53", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CL", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry.
