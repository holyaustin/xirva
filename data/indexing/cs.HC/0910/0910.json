KwSS can play a significant role in enhancing the IS support for\nknowledge management processes, including those customarily identified as less\namenable to IS support. In our approach we try to enhance basic functionalities\nprovided by the computer-based information systems, namely, that of improving\nthe efficiency of the knowledge workers in accessing, processing and creating\nuseful information. The improvement, along with proper focus on cultural,\nsocial and other aspects of the knowledge management processes, can enhance the\nworkers' efficiency significantly in performing high quality knowledge works.\nIn order to build the proposed approach, we develop several new concepts. The\napproach analyzes the information availability and usage from the knowledge\nworkers and their works' perspectives and consequently brings forth more\ntransparency in various aspects of information life-cycle with respect to\nknowledge management. KsSSes are technology platforms, which can be implemented\nindependently as well as in conjunction with other knowledge management and\ndata management technology platforms, to provide significant boost in the\nknowledge capabilities of organizations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2009 14:31:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Laha", "Arijit", ""]]}]
