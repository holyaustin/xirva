Apart\nfrom the quantity, they also require that the information received is of high\nquality in terms of authenticity and details. This, in turn, requires that the\ninformation delivered should also include argumentative support, exhibiting the\nreasoning process behind their development and provenance to indicate their\nlineage. In conventional document-centric practices for information management,\nsuch details are difficult to capture, represent/archive and retrieve/deliver.\nTo achieve such capability we need to re-think some core issues of information\nmanagement from the above requirements perspective. In this paper we develop a\nframework for comprehensive representation of information in archive, capturing\ninformational contents along with their context. We shall call it the\n\"Information Warehouse (IW)\" framework of information archival. The IW is a\nsignificant yet technologically realizable conceptual advancement which can\nsupport efficiently some interesting classes of applications which can be very\nuseful to the knowledge workers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2009 15:16:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Laha", "Arijit", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.1019", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "B.
