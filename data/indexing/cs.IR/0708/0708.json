This has prompted the use of text\nmining tools to extract key biological information. Previous studies have\nreported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process\nbiological text. However, this requirement for modification had not been\nexamined. In this study, we have constructed Muscorian, using MontyLingua, a\ngeneric text processor. It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization\nparadigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable\nintermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are\napplied at the specialization layer. Evaluation using a corpus and experts\nindicated 86-90% precision and approximately 30% recall in extracting\nprotein-protein interactions, which was comparable to previous studies using\neither specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools.\nOur study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered\ngeneralization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer\nfor two specialized information extraction tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2007 01:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Maurice HT", ""], ["Lefevre", "Christophe", ""], ["Nicholas", "Kevin R.", ""], ["Lin", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0741", "submitter": "Shi Zhou Dr.", "authors": "Shi Zhou, Ingemar Cox and Vaclav Petricek", "title": "Characterising Web Site Link Structure", "comments": "To appear at IEEE/WSE07", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/WSE.2007.4380247", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The topological structures of the Internet and the Web have received\nconsiderable attention.

To do so, we exhaustively crawled 18 web sites as diverse as\ngovernmental departments, commercial companies and university departments in\ndifferent countries. These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand\npages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed\nthat the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different\nwhen measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e.\nproperties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes.\nHowever, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the\nconnectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong\ncorrespondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant. Comparison with\nthe Web, the AS Internet, and a citation network, showed that this third-order\nproperty is not shared across other types of networks.

The\ndifficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather\nthe access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval\nsystem, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their\ninformation needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which\ntakes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could\ncontribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We\nbelieve also that responses of multimedia information system would be more\nrelevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system\nwere identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the\nintegration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage\ncontexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and\nfeedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need. The first section of this\nstudy is dedicated to traditional multimedia information systems and\nspecifically the approaches of representing multimedia information. Taking into\naccount the dynamism of users, these approaches do not permit the explicit\nintegration of the users' information needs. In this paper, we will present our\nproposals based on economic intelligence approach.
