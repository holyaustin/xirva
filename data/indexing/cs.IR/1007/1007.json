The modification in\nthe dual ternary algorithm was essential to handle variable length query phrase\nand to accommodate features specific to Carnatic music. The dual ternary\nindexing algorithm is adapted for Carnatic music by segmenting using the\nsegmentation technique for Carnatic music. The dual ternary algorithm is\ncompared with the multi-key hashing algorithm designed by us for indexing and\nretrieval in which features like MFCC, spectral flux, melody string and\nspectral centroid are used as features for indexing data into a hash table. The\nway in which collision resolution was handled by this hash table is different\nthan the normal hash table approaches.
