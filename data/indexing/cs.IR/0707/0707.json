Delayed correlation matrix D is composed\nof the correlations between one variable in the multivariable time series and\nanother at a time delay \\tau . Inverse participation ratio (IPR) of\neigenvectors of D deviates substantially from the IPR of eigenvectors of the\nequal time correlation matrix C. We relate this finding to the localization and\ndiscuss its importance for network congestion control. The time-lagged\ncorrelation pattern between network time series is preserved over a long time,\nup to 100\\tau, where \\tau=300 sec. The largest eigenvalue \\lambda_{max} of D\nand the corresponding IPR oscillate with two characteristic periods of 3\\tau\nand 6\\tau . The existence of delayed correlations between network time series\nfits well into the long range dependence (LRD) property of the network traffic.\n  The ability to monitor and control the long memory processes is crucial since\nthey impact the network performance. Injecting the random traffic counts\nbetween non-randomly correlated time series, we were able to break the picture\nof periodicity of \\lambda_{max}. In addition, we investigated influence of the\nperiodic injections on both largest eigenvalue and the IPR, and addressed\nrelevance of these indicators for the LRD and self-similarity of the network\ntraffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Jul 2007 19:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Rojkova", "Viktoria", ""], ["Kantardzic", "Mehmed", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3559", "submitter": "Wilson Wong", "authors": "Wilson Wong", "title": "Practical Approach to Knowledge-based Question Answering with Natural\n  Language Understanding and Advanced Reasoning", "comments": "Master of Science thesis, National Technical University College of\n  Malaysia, 2005", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.HC cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This research hypothesized that a practical approach in the form of a\nsolution framework known as Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning for\nIntelligence (NaLURI), which combines full-discourse natural language\nunderstanding, powerful representation formalism capable of exploiting\nontological information and reasoning approach with advanced features, will\nsolve the following problems without compromising practicality factors: 1)\nrestriction on the nature of question and response, and 2) limitation to scale\nacross domains and to real-life natural language text.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 14:30:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Wilson", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3575", "submitter": "Philipp Mayr", "authors": "Philipp Mayr, Anne-Kathrin Walter", "title": "An exploratory study of Google Scholar", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1108/14684520710841784", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The paper discusses and analyzes the scientific search service Google Scholar\n(GS).
