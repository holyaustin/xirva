Rigorous tests are needed to establish to what\nextent sophisticated methods can improve the quality of the predictions. Here\nwe analyse a refined correlation-based collaborative filtering algorithm and\ncompare it with a novel spectral method for recommending. We test them on two\ndatabases that bear different statistical properties (MovieLens and Jester)\nwithout filtering out the less active users and ordering the opinions in time,\nwhenever possible. We find that, when the distribution of user-user\ncorrelations is narrow, simple averages work nearly as well as advanced\nmethods. Recommender systems can, on the other hand, exploit a great deal of\nadditional information in systems where external influence is negligible and\npeoples' tastes emerge entirely. These findings are validated by simulations\nwith artificially generated data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2007 09:27:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Blattner", "Marcel", ""], ["Hunziker", "Alexander", ""], ["Laureti", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.4669", "submitter": "Muhammad Marwan Muhammad Fuad", "authors": "Muhammad Marwan Muhammad Fuad (VALORIA), Pierre-Fran\\c{c}ois Marteau\n  (VALORIA)", "title": "The Extended Edit Distance Metric", "comments": "Technical report", "journal-ref": "Content-Based Multimedia Indexing, CBMI 2008, london : United\n  Kingdom (2008)", "doi": "10.1109/CBMI.2008.4564953", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  Similarity search is an important problem in information retrieval.
