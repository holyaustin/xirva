The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple interpretation\nof product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'\ninterests, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing\nsupport for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, we\npresent our multiple viewpoints approach, and we illustrate it by an industrial\nexample on cyclone vessel product.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jun 2007 13:09:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Geryville", "Hichem", "", "LIESP"], ["Bouras", "Abdelaziz", "", "LIESP"], ["Ouzrout", "Yacine", "", "LIESP"], ["Sapidis", "Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.2797", "submitter": "Anne-Marie Vercoustre", "authors": "Thierry Despeyroux (INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis),\n  Eduardo Fraschini (INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis), Anne-Marie\n  Vercoustre (INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis)", "title": "Extraction d'entit\\'es dans des collections \\'evolutives", "comments": "The bibteX file has been replaced with the correct one", "journal-ref": "Dans 7i\\`emes Journ\\'ees francophones Extraction et Gestion des\n  Connaissances EGC 2007 76300 (23/01/2007) pp. 533-538", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The goal of our work is to use a set of reports and extract named entities,\nin our case the names of Industrial or Academic partners. Starting with an\ninitial list of entities, we use a first set of documents to identify syntactic\npatterns that are then validated in a supervised learning phase on a set of\nannotated documents. The complete collection is then explored. This approach is\nsimilar to the ones used in data extraction from semi-structured documents\n(wrappers) and do not need any linguistic resources neither a large set for\ntraining. As our collection of documents would evolve over years, we hope that\nthe performance of the extraction would improve with the increased size of the\ntraining set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2007 14:16:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2007 14:20:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Jul 2007 15:32:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Despeyroux", "Thierry", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis"], ["Fraschini", "Eduardo", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis"], ["Vercoustre", "Anne-Marie", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt / INRIA Sophia Antipolis"]]}]
