Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital\nphotographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text\nlabels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging\nand introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging\nactivity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform\nexperiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a\nweighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show\nthat this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among\nresources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely\nemergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number\nof users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in\nsocial tagging systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 11:40:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Baldassarri", "Andrea", ""], ["Servedio", "Vito D.

Our\napproach to the full text tasks resulted in one of the highest recall rates as\nwell as mean reciprocal rank of correct passages. Our approach to abstract\nclassification shows that a simple linear model, using relatively few features,\nis capable of generalizing and uncovering the conceptual nature of\nprotein-protein interaction from the bibliome. Since the novel approach is\nbased on a very lightweight linear model, it can be easily ported and applied\nto similar problems.

Although community detection methods abound, there is a\nlack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We\nshow here that the quality of a partition can be measured in terms of its\nstability, defined in terms of the clustered autocovariance of a Markov process\ntaking place on the graph. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on\ntime scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each\ntime and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.\nHence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter\nthat establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our\nframework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning\nmeasures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step\ntime measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We\napply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions\nover time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and\nsocial networks. We also obtain reduced descriptions for atomic level protein\nstructures over different time scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Dec 2008 22:32:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2008 17:42:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:49:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2009 15:26:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Delvenne", "J. -C.", ""], ["Yaliraki", "S.

In this study, we test the results of two recently\navailable algorithms for the decomposition of large matrices against two\ncontent-based classifications of journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the\nfield/subfield classification of Glaenzel & Schubert (2003). The content-based\nschemes allow for the attribution of more than a single category to a journal,\nwhereas the algorithms maximize the ratio of within-category citations over\nbetween-category citations in the aggregated category-category citation matrix.\nBy adding categories, indexers generate between-category citations, which may\nenrich the database, for example, in the case of inter-disciplinary\ndevelopments. The consequent indexer effects are significant in sparse areas of\nthe matrix more than in denser ones. Algorithmic decompositions, on the other\nhand, are more heavily skewed towards a relatively small number of categories,\nwhile this is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of content-based\nclassifications. Because of the indexer effects, science policy studies and the\nsociology of science should be careful when using content-based\nclassifications, which are made for bibliographic disclosure, and not for the\npurpose of analyzing latent structures in scientific communications. Despite\nthe large differences among them, the four classification schemes enable us to\ngenerate surprisingly similar maps of science at the global level.
