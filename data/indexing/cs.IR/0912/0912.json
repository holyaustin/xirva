The result suggests a regularized definition\nof spectral ranking that yields for a general matrix a unique vector depending\non a boundary condition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 19:35:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 14:01:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sat, 7 Sep 2013 17:18:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Sat, 12 Oct 2013 10:45:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2013 11:37:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v14", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 21:26:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v15", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2019 11:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2009 08:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2009 23:30:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2009 16:53:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2009 16:37:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2009 01:14:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2010 11:24:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Fri, 12 Nov 2010 16:19:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 14:57:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Vigna", "Sebastiano", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0433", "submitter": "Arijit  Laha Ph.D.", "authors": "Arijit Laha", "title": "On the issues of building Information Warehouses", "comments": "ACM Comptute 2010, January 22-23, 2010, Bangalore, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.IR cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While performing knowledge-intensive tasks of professional nature, the\nknowledge workers need to access and process large volume of information.
