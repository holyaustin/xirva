However, existing\nmethods largely assume that a KG is complete and simply transfer the\n\"knowledge\" in KG at the shallow level of entity raw data or embeddings. This\nmay lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be\ncomplete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and\nentities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature\nof KG when incorporating it into recommender system.\n  In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge\ngraph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we\ntransfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a\nuser likes an item. As an example, if a user has watched several movies\ndirected by (relation) the same person (entity), we can infer that the director\nrelation plays a critical role when the user makes the decision, thus help to\nunderstand the user's preference at a finer granularity.\n  Technically, we contribute a new translation-based recommendation model,\nwhich specially accounts for various preferences in translating a user to an\nitem, and then jointly train it with a KG completion model by combining several\ntransfer schemes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art KG-based recommendation methods.

The key to this problem is to estimate the outfit\ncompatibility. Previous works which focus on the compatibility of two items or\nrepresent an outfit as a sequence fail to make full use of the complex\nrelations among items in an outfit. To remedy this, we propose to represent an\noutfit as a graph.

Accordingly, each outfit can be represented as a subgraph by\nputting items into their corresponding category nodes. To infer the outfit\ncompatibility from such a graph, we propose Node-wise Graph Neural Networks\n(NGNN) which can better model node interactions and learn better node\nrepresentations. In NGNN, the node interaction on each edge is different, which\nis determined by parameters correlated to the two connected nodes. An attention\nmechanism is utilized to calculate the outfit compatibility score with learned\nnode representations. NGNN can not only be used to model outfit compatibility\nfrom visual or textual modality but also from multiple modalities.
