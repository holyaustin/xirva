These rankings try to maximize the expected utilities based on the user\nclick models. Recent empirical analysis on search engine logs suggests a\nunified click models for both ranked ads and search results. The segregated\nview of document and ad rankings does not consider this commonality. Further,\nthe used models consider parameters of (i) probability of the user abandoning\nbrowsing results (ii) perceived relevance of result snippets. But how to\nconsider them for improved ranking is unknown currently. In this paper, we\npropose a generalized ranking function---namely \"Click Efficiency (CE)\"---for\ndocuments and ads based on empirically proven user click models. The ranking\nconsiders parameters (i) and (ii) above, optimal and has the same time\ncomplexity as sorting. To exploit its generality, we examine the reduced forms\nof CE ranking under different assumptions enumerating a hierarchy of ranking\nfunctions. Some of the rankings in the hierarchy are currently used ad and\ndocument ranking functions; while others suggest new rankings. While optimality\nof ranking is sufficient for document ranking, applying CE ranking to ad\nauctions requires an appropriate pricing mechanism. We incorporate a second\nprice based pricing mechanism with the proposed ranking. Our analysis proves\nseveral desirable properties including revenue dominance over VCG for the same\nbid vector and existence of a Nash Equilibrium in pure strategies. The\nequilibrium is socially optimal, and revenue equivalent to the truthful VCG\nequilibrium. Further, we relax the independence assumption in CE ranking and\nanalyze the diversity ranking problem. We show that optimal diversity ranking\nis NP-Hard in general, and that a constant time approximation is unlikely.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 15:39:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Balakrishnan", "Raju", ""], ["Kambhampati", "Subbarao", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1956", "submitter": "Gopalakrishnan Tr Nair", "authors": "Dr T.R.

Accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the\ndevelopment of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. Roughly,\nindex compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents,\nwhich strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of\nthe inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. Large\ncommercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing\nWeb. The sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents\namong thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such\nthat each server indexes only several millions pages. Due to engineering and\nruntime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers\nis common. However, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely\nimpacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of\ndocument ordering schemes. We study the impact of random index-partitioning on\ndocument ordering schemes. We show that index-partitioning decreases the\naggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of\nservers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. On the other\nhand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the\nnumber of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as\nlexical URL sorting and clustering with TSP, are applied. Finally, we justify\nthe common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we\nqualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it\ndecreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of\nmagnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 09:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "M.", ""], ["Lempel", "R.", ""], ["Somekh", "O.", ""], ["Vornovitsky", "K.", ""]]}]
