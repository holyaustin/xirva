Attempts to address this problem face a fundamental dilemma.\nDatabase querying is based on the logic of predicate evaluation, with a\nprecisely defined answer set for a given query. On the other hand, in an\ninformation retrieval approach, ranked query results have long been accepted as\nfar superior to results based on boolean query evaluation. As a consequence,\nwhen keyword queries are attempted against databases, relatively ad-hoc ranking\nmechanisms are invented (if ranking is used at all), and there is little\nleverage from the large body of IR literature regarding how to rank query\nresults.\n  Our proposal is to create a clear separation between ranking and database\nquerying. This divides the problem into two parts, and allows us to address\nthese separately. The first task is to represent the database, conceptually, as\na collection of independent ``queried units'', or ``qunits'', each of which\nrepresents the desired result for some query against the database. The second\ntask is to evaluate keyword queries against a collection of qunits, which can\nbe treated as independent documents for query purposes, thereby permitting the\nuse of standard IR techniques. We provide insights that encourage the use of\nthis query paradigm, and discuss preliminary investigations into the efficacy\nof a qunits-based framework based on a prototype implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:09:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Nandi", "Arnab", "", "University of Michigan"], ["Jagadish", "H V", "", "University of\n  Michigan"]]}, {"id": "0909.1783", "submitter": "AnHai Doan", "authors": "AnHai Doan (Univ of Wisconsin), Jeff Naughton (Wisconsin), Akanksha\n  Baid (Wisconsin), Xiaoyong Chai (Wisconsin), Fei Chen (Wisconsin), Ting Chen\n  (Wisconsin), Eric Chu (Wisconsin), Pedro DeRose (Wisconsin), Byron Gao\n  (Wisconsin), Chaitanya Gokhale (Wisconsin), Jiansheng Huang (Wisconsin),\n  Warren Shen (Wisconsin), Ba-Quy Vuong (Wisconsin)", "title": "The Case for a Structured Approach to Managing Unstructured Data", "comments": "CIDR 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.IR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The challenge of managing unstructured data represents perhaps the largest\ndata management opportunity for our community since managing relational data.\nAnd yet we are risking letting this opportunity go by, ceding the playing field\nto other players, ranging from communities such as AI, KDD, IR, Web, and\nSemantic Web, to industrial players such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft.
