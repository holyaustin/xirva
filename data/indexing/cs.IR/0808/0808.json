While topic models can potentially discover a broad range of themes\nin a data set, the interpretability of the learned topics is not always ideal.\nHuman-defined concepts, on the other hand, tend to be semantically richer due\nto careful selection of words to define concepts but they tend not to cover the\nthemes in a data set exhaustively. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic\nframework to combine a hierarchy of human-defined semantic concepts with\nstatistical topic models to seek the best of both worlds. Experimental results\nusing two different sources of concept hierarchies and two collections of text\ndocuments indicate that this combination leads to systematic improvements in\nthe quality of the associated language models as well as enabling new\ntechniques for inferring and visualizing the semantics of a document.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2008 07:59:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chemudugunta", "Chaitanya", ""], ["Smyth", "Padhraic", ""], ["Steyvers", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1753", "submitter": "Andrew Krizhanovsky A", "authors": "A.

The inverted file index database was designed using\nvisual tool DBDesigner. The rules for parsing Wikipedia texts are illustrated\nby examples. Two index databases of Russian Wikipedia (RW) and Simple English\nWikipedia (SEW) are built and compared. The size of RW is by order of magnitude\nhigher than SEW (number of words, lexemes), though the growth rate of number of\npages in SEW was found to be 14% higher than in Russian, and the rate of\nacquisition of new words in SEW lexicon was 7% higher during a period of five\nmonths (from September 2007 to February 2008). The Zipf's law was tested with\nboth Russian and Simple Wikipedias.
