In particular, existing\ncollaborative filtering (CF) approaches take into account only the binary\nevents of user actions but totally disregard the contexts in which users'\ndecisions are made. In this paper, we propose Collaborative Competitive\nFiltering (CCF), a framework for learning user preferences by modeling the\nchoice process in recommender systems. CCF employs a multiplicative latent\nfactor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF\nmodels the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In\nthis way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped\ntogether with missing data in existing CF models. We present two formulations\nand an efficient large scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on three\nreal-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that CCF significantly\noutperforms standard CF approaches in both offline and online evaluations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Oct 2010 15:29:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 21:37:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Shuang Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1496", "submitter": "Vishwakarma Singh", "authors": "Vishwakarma Singh, Ambuj K.

Sub-image search using profiles is a single-phase process\nrequiring no geometric validation, yields high precision on natural images, and\nworks well on small visual codebook.
