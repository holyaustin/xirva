Blog authoring tools enable users to publish content, while sites\nsuch as Digg and Del.icio.us are used to distribute content to a wider\naudience. With content fast becoming a commodity, interest in using social\nnetworks to promote and find content has grown, both on the side of content\nproducers (viral marketing) and consumers (recommendation). Here we study the\nrole of social networks in promoting content on Digg, a social news aggregator\nthat allows users to submit links to and vote on news stories. Digg's goal is\nto feature the most interesting stories on its front page, and it aggregates\nopinions of its many users to identify them. Like other social networking\nsites, Digg allows users to designate other users as ``friends'' and see what\nstories they found interesting. We studied the spread of interest in news\nstories submitted to Digg in June 2006. Our results suggest that pattern of the\nspread of interest in a story on the network is indicative of how popular the\nstory will become. Stories that spread mainly outside of the submitter's\nneighborhood go on to be very popular, while stories that spread mainly through\nsubmitter's social neighborhood prove not to be very popular. This effect is\nvisible already in the early stages of voting, and one can make a prediction\nabout the potential audience of a story simply by analyzing where the initial\nvotes come from.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jun 2008 17:53:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Galstyan", "Aram", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.3765", "submitter": "Philipp Mayr", "authors": "Philipp Mayr, Vivien Petras", "title": "Cross-concordances: terminology mapping and its effectiveness for\n  information retrieval", "comments": "19 pages, 4 figures, 11 tables, IFLA conference 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The German Federal Ministry for Education and Research funded a major\nterminology mapping initiative, which found its conclusion in 2007.
