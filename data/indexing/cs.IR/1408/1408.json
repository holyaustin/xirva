To alleviate\nthese issues, in recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in\nexploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with\nthe rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main\nmotivation for exploiting trust information in recommendation process stems\nfrom the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make\nare significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user\ncommunities, in addition to trust relations, the distrust relations also exist\nbetween users.

This might happen if they cannot quite come up with\nthe right search terms. What do searchers do when this happens? Intuitively one\nimagines that they will try a number of associated search terms to zero in on\ntheir intended search target. Certainly the provision of spelling suggestions\nand related search terms assume that frustrated searchers will use these to\nimplement this strategy. Is this assumption correct? What do people really do?\n  We ran an experiment where we asked people to find some relevant links, but\nwe prevented them from using the most obvious search terms, which we termed\ntaboo words. To make the experiment more interesting we also provided the\ntraditional forms of assistance: spelling suggestions and related search\nsuggestions. We assigned participants using a magic square to get no\nassistance, one kind of assistance, or both. Forty eight people participated in\nthe experiment.\n  What emerged from the analysis was that when people are frustrated in their\nsearching attempts, a minority soldier on, attempting to find other terms, but\nthe majority will stick with their original query term and simply progress from\npage to page in a vain attempt to find something relevant. This confirms\nfindings by other researchers about the difficulties of query re-formulation.\nOur finding will serve to inform the developers of user interfaces to search\nengines, since it would be helpful if we could find a better way of supporting\nfrustrated searchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 04:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Renaud", "Gareth", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4966", "submitter": "Jimmy Dubuisson", "authors": "Jimmy Dubuisson, Jean-Pierre Eckmann and Andrea Agazzi", "title": "Diffusion Fingerprints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.IR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce, test and discuss a method for classifying and clustering data\nmodeled as directed graphs.
