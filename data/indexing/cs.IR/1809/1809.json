Our method has the\nflexibility to handle different types of weak supervision and can be easily\nintegrated into existing deep neural models for text classification. We have\nperformed extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different\ndomains. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves inspiring\nperformance without requiring excessive training data and outperforms baseline\nmethods significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2018 02:56:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2018 04:34:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Yu", ""], ["Shen", "Jiaming", ""], ["Zhang", "Chao", ""], ["Han", "Jiawei", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.01479", "submitter": "Andreas Hanselowski Dr.", "authors": "Andreas Hanselowski, Hao Zhang, Zile Li, Daniil Sorokin, Benjamin\n  Schiller, Claudia Schulz, Iryna Gurevych", "title": "UKP-Athene: Multi-Sentence Textual Entailment for Claim Verification", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) shared task was launched to\nsupport the development of systems able to verify claims by extracting\nsupporting or refuting facts from raw text.

Recent advances in translation-based graph embedding\nmethods for populating instance-level knowledge graphs lead to promising new\napproaching for the ontology population problem.

On2Vec integrates two model components that effectively\ncharacterize comprehensive relation facts in ontology graphs.

For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to capture the latent user\ninterest behind the user behavior data. Besides, considering the changing of\nthe external environment and the internal cognition, user interest evolves over\ntime dynamically. There are several CTR prediction methods for interest\nmodeling, while most of them regard the representation of behavior as the\ninterest directly, and lack specially modeling for latent interest behind the\nconcrete behavior. Moreover, few work consider the changing trend of interest.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel model, named Deep Interest Evolution\nNetwork~(DIEN), for CTR prediction.

At this\nlayer, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise interest extracting at each\nstep. As user interests are diverse, especially in the e-commerce system, we\npropose interest evolving layer to capture interest evolving process that is\nrelative to the target item. At interest evolving layer, attention mechanism is\nembedded into the sequential structure novelly, and the effects of relative\ninterests are strengthened during interest evolution.

However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic\nto recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not\ngraph-based.

We also propose an extension of the above method, which jointly\nmodels the community and content information of the news article through a\ncoupled matrix-tensor factorization framework. We empirically demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method for the task of Fake News Detection over two real-world\ndatasets. Further, we validate the generalization of the resulting embeddings\nover two other auxiliary tasks, namely: \\textbf{1)} News Cohort Analysis and\n\\textbf{2)} Collaborative News Recommendation. Our proposed method outperforms\nappropriate baselines for both the tasks, establishing its generalization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2018 04:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Shashank", ""], ["Thirukovalluru", "Raghuveer", ""], ["Sinha", "Manjira", ""], ["Mannarswamy", "Sandya", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.05618", "submitter": "Jiaming Shen", "authors": "Jiaming Shen, Maryam Karimzadehgan, Michael Bendersky, Zhen Qin,\n  Donald Metzler", "title": "Multi-Task Learning for Email Search Ranking with Auxiliary Query\n  Clustering", "comments": "CIKM 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3269206.3272019", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  User information needs vary significantly across different tasks, and\ntherefore their queries will also differ considerably in their expressiveness\nand semantics.

Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation\nlearning, recent advance on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on\nexploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To\ndate, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of\nmultimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia\nrecommendation.\n  In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender\nsystem. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image\nfeatures, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a\nsmall (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease\nthe recommendation accuracy.

To this end, we propose a\nnovel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can\nlead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial\nlearning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds\nperturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's\naccuracy.

In this paper, we address both biases by proposing a hybrid\nfairness-aware recommender system. Our model provides efficient and accurate\nrecommendations by incorporating multiple user-user and item-item similarity\nmeasures, content, and demographic information, while addressing recommendation\nbiases. We implement our model using a powerful and expressive probabilistic\nprogramming language called probabilistic soft logic. We experimentally\nevaluate our approach on a popular movie recommendation dataset, showing that\nour proposed model can provide more accurate and fairer recommendations,\ncompared to a state-of-the art fair recommender system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Sep 2018 00:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Farnadi", "Golnoosh", ""], ["Kouki", "Pigi", ""], ["Thompson", "Spencer K.", ""], ["Srinivasan", "Sriram", ""], ["Getoor", "Lise", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.09096", "submitter": "Davide Bacciu", "authors": "Davide Bacciu and Antonio Bruno", "title": "Text Summarization as Tree Transduction by Top-Down TreeLSTM", "comments": "To appear in IEEE SCCI Deep Learning 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Extractive compression is a challenging natural language processing problem.\nThis work contributes by formulating neural extractive compression as a parse\ntree transduction problem, rather than a sequence transduction task.
