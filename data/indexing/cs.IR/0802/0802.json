In his recent book, van Rijsbergen argues that many of the\nlogical tools developed for quantum systems are also suitable for applications\nin information retrieval. I explore the mathematical support for this idea on\nan abstract vector space model, covering several forms of data analysis\n(information retrieval, data mining, collaborative filtering, formal concept\nanalysis...), and roughly based on an idea from categorical quantum mechanics.\nIt turns out that quantum (i.e., noncommutative) probability distributions\narise already in this rudimentary mathematical framework. We show that a\nBell-type inequality must be satisfied by the standard similarity measures, if\nthey are used for preference predictions. The fact that already a very general,\nabstract version of the vector space model yields simple counterexamples for\nsuch inequalities seems to be an indicator of a genuine need for quantum\nstatistics in data analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Feb 2008 01:42:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2008 12:08:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 May 2008 18:46:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1306", "submitter": "Dusko Pavlovic", "authors": "Dusko Pavlovic", "title": "Network as a computer: ranking paths to find flows", "comments": "12 pages, CSR 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI math.CT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We explore a simple mathematical model of network computation, based on\nMarkov chains. Similar models apply to a broad range of computational\nphenomena, arising in networks of computers, as well as in genetic, and neural\nnets, in social networks, and so on. The main problem of interaction with such\nspontaneously evolving computational systems is that the data are not uniformly\nstructured. An interesting approach is to try to extract the semantical content\nof the data from their distribution among the nodes. A concept is then\nidentified by finding the community of nodes that share it. The task of data\nstructuring is thus reduced to the task of finding the network communities, as\ngroups of nodes that together perform some non-local data processing. Towards\nthis goal, we extend the ranking methods from nodes to paths. This allows us to\nextract some information about the likely flow biases from the available static\ninformation about the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Feb 2008 05:33:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1738", "submitter": "\\'Alvaro Francisco Huertas-Rosero", "authors": "\\'Alvaro Francisco Huertas-Rosero, Leif Azzopardi and C.
