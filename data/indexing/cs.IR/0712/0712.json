We base\nrewrites on a historical click graph that records the ads that have been\nclicked on in response to past user queries. Given a query q, we first consider\nSimrank as a way to identify queries similar to q, i.e., queries whose ads a\nuser may be interested in. We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify\nquery similarities in our application, and we present two enhanced version of\nSimrank: one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that\nexploits ``evidence.'' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against\nSimrank, using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo!, and using a variety\nof metrics. Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and\nbetter query rewrites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 12:43:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Antonellis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Garcia-Molina", "Hector", ""], ["Chang", "Chi-Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2063", "submitter": "Vladimir Pestov", "authors": "Vladimir Pestov", "title": "An axiomatic approach to intrinsic dimension of a dataset", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures, latex 2e with Elsevier macros, final submission\n  to Neural Networks with referees' comments taken into account", "journal-ref": "Neural Networks 21, 2-3 (2008), 204-213.", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  We perform a deeper analysis of an axiomatic approach to the concept of\nintrinsic dimension of a dataset proposed by us in the IJCNN'07 paper\n(arXiv:cs/0703125). The main features of our approach are that a high intrinsic\ndimension of a dataset reflects the presence of the curse of dimensionality (in\na certain mathematically precise sense), and that dimension of a discrete\ni.i.d. sample of a low-dimensional manifold is, with high probability, close to\nthat of the manifold. At the same time, the intrinsic dimension of a sample is\neasily corrupted by moderate high-dimensional noise (of the same amplitude as\nthe size of the manifold) and suffers from prohibitevely high computational\ncomplexity (computing it is an $NP$-complete problem). We outline a possible\nway to overcome these difficulties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 23:39:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pestov", "Vladimir", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3298", "submitter": "Bryan Gibson", "authors": "Dragomir Radev, Mark Hodges, Anthony Fader, Mark Joseph, Joshua\n  Gerrish, Mark Schaller, Jonathan dePeri, Bryan Gibson", "title": "CLAIRLIB Documentation v1.03", "comments": "for download and additional information, please see\n  http://www.clairlib.org", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "CSE-TR-536-07", "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL", "license": null, "abstract": "  The Clair library is intended to simplify a number of generic tasks in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Network\nAnalysis.
