It is personalised and dynamic and allows\nto compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based\non the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some\npersonalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of\nfeedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust\nmetrics.In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns\ncharacterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply\nthe metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over\ntime. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations\nthat the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical\nvalidation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the\nperformance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative\nfiltering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 16:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2009 17:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Walter", "Frank E.", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1911", "submitter": "Junsheng  Zhang", "authors": "Hai Zhuge and Junsheng Zhang", "title": "Topological Centrality and Its Applications", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "KGRC-2009-02", "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent development of network structure analysis shows that it plays an\nimportant role in characterizing complex system of many branches of sciences.\nDifferent from previous network centrality measures, this paper proposes the\nnotion of topological centrality (TC) reflecting the topological positions of\nnodes and edges in general networks, and proposes an approach to calculating\nthe topological centrality.
