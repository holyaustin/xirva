We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem\nas a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models\nunder which to estimate student grades and grader reliability.

This naturally leads to a\nmeasure of similarity on graph objects. We define similarity between two given\ngraphs as a Bhattacharya similarity measure between their corresponding\ncovariance matrix representations. As shown in our experimental study on the\ntask of social network classification, such a similarity measure outperforms\nother widely used state-of-the-art methodologies. Our proposed method is also\ncomputationally efficient. The computation of both the matrix representation\nand the similarity value can be performed in operations linear in the number of\nedges. This makes our method scalable in practice.\n  We believe our theoretical and empirical results provide evidence for\nstudying truncated power iterations, of the adjacency matrix, to characterize\nsocial networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:39:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Shrivastava", "Anshumali", ""], ["Li", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4909", "submitter": "Jouni Sir\\'en", "authors": "Gonzalo Navarro, Simon J.

Further\nanalysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems\ncontributes to such observation.
