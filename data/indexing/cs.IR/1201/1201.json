In most collaborative\ntagging systems the tagging by the users is completely \"flat\", while in some\ncases they are allowed to define a shallow hierarchy for their own tags.\nHowever, usually no overall hierarchical organisation of the tags is given, and\none of the interesting challenges of this area is to provide an algorithm\ngenerating the ontology of the tags from the available data. In contrast, there\nare also other type of tagged networks available for research, where the tags\nare already organised into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), encapsulating the\n\"is a sub-category of\" type of hierarchy between each other. In this paper we\nstudy how this DAG affects the statistical distribution of tags on the nodes\nmarked by the tags in various real networks. We analyse the relation between\nthe tag-frequency and the position of the tag in the DAG in two large\nsub-networks of the English Wikipedia and a protein-protein interaction\nnetwork. We also study the tag co-occurrence statistics by introducing a 2d\ntag-distance distribution preserving both the difference in the levels and the\nabsolute distance in the DAG for the co-occurring pairs of tags. Our most\ninteresting finding is that the local relevance of tags in the DAG, (i.e.,\ntheir rank or significance as characterised by, e.g., the length of the\nbranches starting from them) is much more important than their global distance\nfrom the root.

Information and\ncommunication technology puts its leg into the education sector to capture and\ncompile low cost information. Now a day a new research community, educational\ndata mining (EDM), is growing which is intersection of data mining and\npedagogy. In this paper we present roadmap of research done in EDM in various\nsegment of education sector.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jan 2012 04:50:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Pandey", "Umesh Kumar", ""], ["Bhardwaj", "Brijesh Kumar", ""], ["pal", "Saurabh", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6095", "submitter": "Lingfei Wu", "authors": "Lingfei Wu and Robert Ackland", "title": "How Web 1.0 Fails: The Mismatch Between Hyperlinks and Clickstreams", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The core of the Web is a hyperlink navigation system collaboratively set up\nby webmasters to help users find desired websites. But does this system really\nwork as expected? We show that the answer seems to be negative: there is a\nsubstantial mismatch between hyperlinks and the pathways that users actually\ntake. A closer look at empirical surfing activities reveals the reason of the\nmismatch: webmasters try to build a global virtual world without geographical\nor cultural boundaries, but users in fact prefer to navigate within more\nfragmented, language-based groups of websites. We call this type of behavior\n\"preferential navigation\" and find that it is driven by \"local\" search engines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 01:15:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 02:15:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Lingfei", ""], ["Ackland", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6134", "submitter": "Nino Antulov-Fantulin", "authors": "Nino Antulov-Fantulin, Matko Bosnjak, Vinko Zlatic, Miha Grcar,\n  Tomislav Smuc", "title": "Synthetic sequence generator for recommender systems - memory biased\n  random walk on sequence multilayer network", "comments": "The new updated version of the paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-11812-3_3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Personalized recommender systems rely on each user's personal usage data in\nthe system, in order to assist in decision making.

A key challenge of CF system is that the\nreliably accurate results are obtained with the help of peers' recommendation,\nbut the most useful individual recommendations are hard to be found among\ndiverse niche objects. In this paper we investigate the direction effect of the\nrandom walk on user similarity measurements and find that the user similarity,\ncalculated by directed random walks, is reverse to the initial node's degree.\nSince the ratio of small-degree users to large-degree users is very large in\nreal data sets, the large-degree users' selections are recommended extensively\nby traditional CF algorithms. By tuning the user similarity direction from\nneighbors to the target user, we introduce a new algorithm specifically to\naddress the challenge of diversity of CF and show how it can be used to solve\nthe accuracy-diversity dilemma. Without relying on any context-specific\ninformation, we are able to obtain accurate and diverse recommendations, which\noutperforms the state-of-the-art CF methods. This work suggests that the random\nwalk direction is an important factor to improve the personalized\nrecommendation performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 16:52:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Jian-Guo", ""], ["Shi", "Kerui", ""], ["Guo", "Qiang", ""]]}]
