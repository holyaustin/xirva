So, only\noption is to capture the intuition of the user and provide them with the\nrecommendation list. Most specifically, an online navigation behavior grows\nwith each passing day, thus extracting information intelligently from it is a\ndifficult issue. Web master should use web usage mining method to capture\nintuition. A WUM is designed to operate on web server logs which contain user's\nnavigation. Hence, recommendation system using WUM can be used to forecast the\nnavigation pattern of user and recommend those to user in a form of\nrecommendation list. In this paper, we propose a two tier architecture for\ncapturing users intuition in the form of recommendation list containing pages\nvisited by user and pages visited by other user's having similar usage profile.\nThe practical implementation of proposed architecture and algorithm shows that\naccuracy of user intuition capturing is improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Sep 2010 14:15:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dixit", "Dipa", ""], ["Gadge", "Jayant", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1690", "submitter": "Truyen Tran", "authors": "Tran The Truyen, Dinh Q.

The word lookup table will be a part of the\noperating system and the reduction will be done by the operating system.\nAccording to this method each word will be replaced by an address value. This\nmethod can quite effectively reduce the size of persistent memory required for\ntext data. At the end of the first level compression with the use of word\nlookup table, a binary file containing the addresses will be generated.
