NMF attempts to approximate a matrix with\nnonnegative entries by a product of two low-rank matrices, also with\nnonnegative entries. We propose an algorithm called rank-one downdate (R1D) for\ncomputing a NMF that is partly motivated by singular value decomposition. This\nalgorithm computes the dominant singular values and vectors of adaptively\ndetermined submatrices of a matrix. On each iteration, R1D extracts a rank-one\nsubmatrix from the dataset according to an objective function. We establish a\ntheoretical result that maximizing this objective function corresponds to\ncorrectly classifying articles in a nearly separable corpus. We also provide\ncomputational experiments showing the success of this method in identifying\nfeatures in realistic datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2008 17:59:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Biggs", "Michael", ""], ["Ghodsi", "Ali", ""], ["Vavasis", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2045", "submitter": "Ciro Cattuto", "authors": "Ciro Cattuto, Dominik Benz, Andreas Hotho, Gerd Stumme", "title": "Semantic Analysis of Tag Similarity Measures in Collaborative Tagging\n  Systems", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social bookmarking systems allow users to organise collections of resources\non the Web in a collaborative fashion. The increasing popularity of these\nsystems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them\nrelevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The\nproblem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags\nand characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three\nmeasures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of\nco-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank\nalgorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale\ndataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a\nsemantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon\nfor the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of\nWordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our\nresults clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of\nrelatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge\nextraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2008 14:10:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Benz", "Dominik", ""], ["Hotho", "Andreas", ""], ["Stumme", "Gerd", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2855", "submitter": "Ed Summers", "authors": "Ed Summers, Antoine Isaac, Clay Redding, Dan Krech", "title": "LCSH, SKOS and Linked Data", "comments": "Submission for the Dublin Core 2008 conference in Berlin", "journal-ref": "Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web,\n  Volume 20, May 2013, Pages 35-49, ISSN 1570-8268", "doi": "10.1016/j.websem.2013.05.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  A technique for converting Library of Congress Subject Headings MARCXML to\nSimple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) RDF is described.

The given annotation in training images is loose due to: (1)\nambiguous correspondences between visual features and annotated keywords; (2)\nincomplete lists of annotated keywords. The second reason motivates us to\nenrich the incomplete annotation in a simple way before learning topic models.\nIn particular, some imagined keywords are poured into the incomplete annotation\nthrough measuring similarity between keywords. Then, both given and imagined\nannotations are used to learning probabilistic topic models for automatically\nannotating new images. We conduct experiments on a typical Corel dataset of\nimages and loose annotations, and compare the proposed method with\nstate-of-the-art discrete annotation methods (using a set of discrete blobs to\nrepresent an image). The proposed method improves word-driven probability\nLatent Semantic Analysis (PLSA-words) up to a comparable performance with the\nbest discrete annotation method, while a merit of PLSA-words is still kept,\ni.e., a wider semantic range.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2008 10:35:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Hong", ""], ["Boujemma", "Nozha", ""], ["Chen", "Yunhao", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4722", "submitter": "Bernard Jacquemin", "authors": "Bernard Jacquemin (LIMSI), Aur\\'elien Lauf (LIMSI), C\\'eline Poudat\n  (LTCI), Martine Hurault-Plantet (LIMSI), Nicolas Auray (LTCI)", "title": "La fiabilit\\'e des informations sur le web", "comments": "8 pp", "journal-ref": "Dans Actes de la Conf\\'erence en Recherche d'Information et\n  Applications CORIA 2008 - Conf\\'erence en Recherche d'Information et\n  Applications 2008, Tr\\'egastel : France (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online IR tools have to take into account new phenomena linked to the\nappearance of blogs, wiki and other collaborative publications.
