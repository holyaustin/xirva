We find that the web is conservative in judging talent and\nthe overall fitness distribution is exponential, showing low variability. The\nsmall variance in talent, however, is enough to lead to experience\ndistributions with high variance: The preferential attachment mechanism\namplifies these small biases and leads to heavy-tailed power-law (PL) inbound\ndegree distributions over all pages, as well as over pages that are of the same\nage. The balancing act between experience and talent on the web allows newly\nintroduced pages with novel and interesting content to grow quickly and surpass\nolder pages. In this regard, it is much like what we observe in high-mobility\nand meritocratic societies: People with entitlement continue to have access to\nthe best resources, but there is just enough screening for fitness that allows\nfor talented winners to emerge and join the ranks of the leaders. Finally, we\nshow that the fitness estimates have potential practical applications in\nranking query results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2009 23:11:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kong", "Joseph S.", ""], ["Sarshar", "Nima", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Vwani P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0358", "submitter": "Pierre-Francois Marteau", "authors": "Pierre-Fran\\c{c}ois Marteau (VALORIA), Gilbas M\\'enier (VALORIA),\n  Eugen Popovici (VALORIA)", "title": "Weighted Naive Bayes Model for Semi-Structured Document Categorization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "1st International Conference on Multidisciplinary Information\n  Sciences and Technologies InSciT2006, Merida : Espagne (2006)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is the supervised classification of semi-structured\ndata.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize\nthe properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in\nwhich destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show\nthat the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more\nbroadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is\nmore broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive\nvisits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.\nTo account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation\nmodel in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as\nteleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic\nproperty caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model\nreproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also\ngenerating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return\ntime distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the\nextreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the\nmore narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Jan 2009 15:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Goncalves", "Bruno", ""], ["Meiss", "Mark R.", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jose J.", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3939", "submitter": "Qingzhao Tan", "authors": "Qingzhao Tan, Prasenjit Mitra, C.

Users want to search for historical maps to determine recorded\nhistory of the political geography of regions at different eras, to find out\nwhere exactly archaeological artifacts were discovered, etc. Currently, they\nhave to use a generic search engine and add the term map along with other\nkeywords to search for maps. This crude method will generate a significant\nnumber of false positives that the user will need to cull through to get the\ndesired results. To reduce their manual effort, we propose an automatic map\nidentification, indexing, and retrieval system that enables users to search and\nretrieve maps appearing in a large corpus of digital documents using simple\nkeyword queries. We identify features that can help in distinguishing maps from\nother figures in digital documents and show how a Support-Vector-Machine-based\nclassifier can be used to identify maps. We propose map-level-metadata e.g.,\ncaptions, references to the maps in text, etc. and document-level metadata,\ne.g., title, abstract, citations, how recent the publication is, etc. and show\nhow they can be automatically extracted and indexed. Our novel ranking\nalgorithm weights different metadata fields differently and also uses the\ndocument-level metadata to help rank retrieved maps. Empirical evaluations show\nwhich features should be selected and which metadata fields should be weighted\nmore. We also demonstrate improved retrieval results in comparison to\nadaptations of existing methods for map retrieval. Our map search engine has\nbeen deployed in an online map-search system that is part of the Blind-Review\ndigital library system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 02:14:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Qingzhao", ""], ["Mitra", "Prasenjit", ""], ["Giles", "C.

Therefore, the lexico-semantic resource produced describes all the\nwords and all their meanings observed in the corpus. The sense trends are\nexpressed by syntactic contexts, typical for a given meaning. The link between\neach sense trend and the utterances used to build the sense trend are also\nstored in an index. Thus all the instances of a word in a particular sense are\nlinked and can be browsed easily. And by using several corpora of different\nlanguages, several resources are built that correspond with each other through\nlanguages.
