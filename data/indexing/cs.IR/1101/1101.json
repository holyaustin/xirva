Abstractly\nspeaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical\nstructure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces.\nIn this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear\nmeaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of\nsentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby\nmeaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure,\nlive in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor\nproduct of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each\naugmented with a grammatical role.

BoF methods are based on orderless collections of quantized local\nimage descriptors; they discard spatial information and are therefore\nconceptually and computationally simpler than many alternative methods. Despite\nthis, or perhaps because of this, BoF-based systems have set new performance\nstandards on popular image classification benchmarks and have achieved\nscalability breakthroughs in image retrieval.

Among the more fundamental challenges are how and whether BoF\nmethods can contribute to localizing objects in complex images, or to\nassociating high-level semantics with natural images.
