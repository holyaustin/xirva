The word \"Semantic\" refers to \"meaning\" - a semantic web is a web of\nmeaning. In this fast changing and result oriented practical world, gone are\nthe days where an individual had to struggle for finding information on the\nInternet where knowledge management was the major issue. The semantic web has a\nvision of linking, integrating and analysing data from various data sources and\nforming a new information stream, hence a web of databases connected with each\nother and machines interacting with other machines to yield results which are\nuser oriented and accurate. With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the\nna\\\"ive approach of searching information on the syntactic web is clich\\'e.\nThis paper proposes an optimised semantic searching of keywords exemplified by\nsimulation an ontology of Indian universities with a proposed algorithm which\nramifies the effective semantic retrieval of information which is easy to\naccess and time saving.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 12:43:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Siddharth", ""], ["Thakur", "Narina", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.0404", "submitter": "Basma Hassan", "authors": "Samir AbdelRahman, Basma Hassan, Reem Bahgat", "title": "A New Email Retrieval Ranking Approach", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": "International journal of computer science & information Technology\n  (IJCSIT), Vol.2, No.5, (October 2010) 44-63", "doi": "10.5121/ijcsit.2010.2504", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Email Retrieval task has recently taken much attention to help the user\nretrieve the email(s) related to the submitted query.

But a\nsimple explanation does not always suggest a simple solution. It turns out that\nit is impossible to alter the fragile distribution of trust without sacrificing\nsome of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust\nmust thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This\nobservation was the starting point of the present paper. It explores a\ndifferent method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining\nfor its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure\ntrust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided\nin terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity\npreserving maps. This view may be of independent interest, as it uncovers a\ncommon conceptual and structural foundation of mathematical classification\ntheory on one hand, and of the spectral methods of graph clustering and data\nmining on the other hand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Nov 2010 02:42:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Dec 2010 01:36:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""]]}]
