Over the last several years, a significant number of\nperformance analysis and monitoring tools have been built/proposed.

In this paper we present ScALPEL, a Scalable Adaptive\nLightweight Performance Evaluation Library for application performance\nmonitoring at the functional level. Our approach provides several distinct\nadvantages. First, ScALPEL is portable across a wide variety of architectures,\nand its ability to selectively monitor functions presents low run-time\noverhead, enabling its use for large-scale production applications. Second, it\nis run-time configurable, enabling both dynamic selection of functions to\nprofile as well as events of interest on a per function basis. Third, our\napproach is transparent in that it requires no source code modifications.\nFinally, ScALPEL is implemented as a pluggable unit by reusing existing\nperformance monitoring frameworks such as Perfmon and PAPI and extending them\nto support both sequential and MPI applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Feb 2009 04:11:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Pyla", "Hari K.", ""], ["Ramesh", "Bharath", ""], ["Ribbens", "Calvin J.", ""], ["Varadarajan", "Srinidhi", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0694", "submitter": "Gerard Briscoe Mr", "authors": "Gerard Briscoe and Alexandros Marinos", "title": "Digital Ecosystems in the Clouds: Towards Community Cloud Computing", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures, IEEE Digital EcosystemS and Technologies DEST\n  (2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cloud Computing is rising fast, with its data centres growing at an\nunprecedented rate.

Our previous studies have demonstrated the\nbenefits of combining dedicated reliable resources with opportunistic resources\nin case of high-throughput computing applications, where timely allocation of\nthe processing units is the primary concern. Since distributed stream\nprocessing applications demand large volume of data transmission between the\nprocessing sites at a consistent rate, adequate control over the network\nresources is important here to assure a steady flow of processing. In this\npaper, we propose a system model for the hybrid hosting platform where stream\nprocessing servers installed at distributed sites are interconnected with a\ncombination of dedicated links and public Internet. Decentralized algorithms\nhave been developed for allocation of the two classes of network resources\namong the competing tasks with an objective towards higher task throughput and\nbetter utilization of expensive dedicated resources. Results from extensive\nsimulation study show that with proper management, systems exploiting the\nsynergy of dedicated and opportunistic resources yield considerably higher task\nthroughput and thus, higher return on investment over the systems solely using\nexpensive dedicated resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 16:01:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Asaduzzaman", "Shah", ""], ["Maheswaran", "Muthucumaru", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4392", "submitter": "Shah Asaduzzaman", "authors": "Shah Asaduzzaman, Muthucumaru Maheswaran", "title": "Towards a decentralized algorithm for mapping network and computational\n  resources for distributed data-flow computations", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": "Proc. 21st IEEE Intl.

These applications include continual\nprocessing on data streams originating from a network of sensors, composing a\nmultimedia stream through embedding several component streams originating from\ndifferent locations, etc. These data-flow computing applications require\nmultiple processing nodes interconnected according to the data-flow topology of\nthe application, for on-stream processing of the data. Since the applications\nusually sustain for a long period, it is important to optimally map the\ncomponent computations and communications on the nodes and links in the\nnetwork, fulfilling the capacity constraints and optimizing some quality metric\nsuch as end-to-end latency. The mapping problem is unfortunately NP-complete\nand heuristics have been previously proposed to compute the approximate\nsolution in a centralized way. However, because of the dynamicity of the\nnetwork, it is practically impossible to aggregate the correct state of the\nwhole network in a single node. In this paper, we present a distributed\nalgorithm for optimal mapping of the components of the data flow applications.\nWe propose several heuristics to minimize the message complexity of the\nalgorithm while maintaining the quality of the solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 16:32:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Asaduzzaman", "Shah", ""], ["Maheswaran", "Muthucumaru", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4961", "submitter": "Tianshi Chen", "authors": "Yunji Chen, Tianshi Chen, and Weiwu Hu", "title": "Global Clock, Physical Time Order and Pending Period Analysis in\n  Multiprocessor Systems", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In multiprocessor systems, various problems are treated with Lamport's\nlogical clock and the resultant logical time orders between operations.\nHowever, one often needs to face the high complexities caused by the lack of\nlogical time order information in practice. In this paper, we utilize the\n\\emph{global clock} to infuse the so-called \\emph{pending period} to each\noperation in a multiprocessor system, where the pending period is a time\ninterval that contains the performed time of the operation. Further, we define\nthe \\emph{physical time order} for any two operations with disjoint pending\nperiods. The physical time order is obeyed by any real execution in\nmultiprocessor systems due to that it is part of the truly happened operation\norders restricted by global clock, and it is then proven to be independent and\nconsistent with traditional logical time orders. The above novel yet\nfundamental concepts enables new effective approaches for analyzing\nmultiprocessor systems, which are named \\emph{pending period analysis} as a\nwhole. As a consequence of pending period analysis, many important problems of\nmultiprocessor systems can be tackled effectively. As a significant application\nexample, complete memory consistency verification, which was known as an\nNP-hard problem, can be solved with the complexity of $O(n^2)$ (where $n$ is\nthe number of operations). Moreover, the two event ordering problems, which\nwere proven to be Co-NP-Hard and NP-hard respectively, can both be solved with\nthe time complexity of O(n) if restricted by pending period information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2009 10:34:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 12 Jul 2009 09:10:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yunji", ""], ["Chen", "Tianshi", ""], ["Hu", "Weiwu", ""]]}]
