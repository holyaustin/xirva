These\nlimitations are independent of the topology and message transmission latency.\nIn this paper we consider a peer-to-peer network, based on the Engset model,\nwhere peers arrive and depart independently at random. We show how the arrival\nand departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be\nbroadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately\ndescribe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k\nbuffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time,\nand we give results for both single and multi-source message streams. We define\ncoverage rate as peer-messages per unit time, i.e. the rate at which a number\nof peers receive messages, and show that the coverage rate is limited by the\nchurn rate and buffer size. Our theory introduces an Instantaneous Message\nExchange (IME) model and provides a template for further analysis of more\ncomplicated systems. Using the IME model, and assuming random processes, we\nhave obtained very accurate equations of the system dynamics in a variety of\ninteresting cases, that allow us to tune a peer-to-peer system. It remains to\nbe seen if we can maintain this accuracy for general processes and when\napplying a non-instantaneous model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2007 01:42:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Harwood", "Aaron", ""], ["Ohrimenko", "Olga", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.2313", "submitter": "Olivier Powell", "authors": "Olivier Powell, Luminita Moraru, Jean-Marc Seigneur", "title": "TrustMIX: Trustworthy MIX for Energy Saving in Sensor Networks", "comments": "19 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CR cs.NI", "license": null, "abstract": "  MIX has recently been proposed as a new sensor scheme with better energy\nmanagement for data-gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks.

The\nmain result of this paper is to find that MIX is very vulnerable to sinkhole\nattacks but that the adjunct trust management efficiently reduces the impact of\nsuch attacks while preserving the main feature of MIX: increased lifetime of\nthe network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2007 09:22:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Powell", "Olivier", ""], ["Moraru", "Luminita", ""], ["Seigneur", "Jean-Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3015", "submitter": "Erik Schnetter", "authors": "Dylan Stark, Gabrielle Allen, Tom Goodale, Thomas Radke, Erik\n  Schnetter", "title": "An Extensible Timing Infrastructure for Adaptive Large-scale\n  Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "In Roman Wyrzykowski et al., editors, Parallel Processing and\n  Applied Mathematics (PPAM), 2007, Gdansk, Poland, volume 4967 of Lecture\n  Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), pages 1170-1179.

Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before\nthey are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.\nSince the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious\nattackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.\nA witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this\napproach, the base station receives the fusion data and \"votes\" on the data\nfrom a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2007 02:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pai", "H. -T.", ""], ["Han", "Y.
