First, we present a new model for\nstudying mobile entities in networks subject to transient faults. Our model\ndiffers from the classical robot model because robots have constraints about\nthe paths they are allowed to follow, and from the classical agent model\nbecause the number of agents remains fixed throughout the execution of the\nprotocol. Second, in this model, we study the possibility of designing\nself-stabilizing algorithms when those algorithms are run by mobile robots (or\nagents) evolving on a graph.
