This is known\nto be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm\nhas optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two\nnodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced\nto $O(d \\log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal.
