PEMS executes Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) algorithms in an\nExternal Memory (EM) context, enabling computation with very large data sets\nwhich exceed the size of main memory. Many parallel algorithms have been\ndesigned and implemented for Bulk-Synchronous Parallel models of computation.\nSuch algorithms generally assume that the entire data set is stored in main\nmemory at once. PEMS overcomes this limitation without requiring any\nmodification to the algorithm by using disk space as memory for additional\n\"virtual processors\". Previous work has shown this to be a promising approach\nwhich scales well as computational resources (i.e. processors and disks) are\nadded. However, the technique incurs significant overhead when compared with\npurpose-built EM algorithms. PEMS2 introduces refinements to the simulation\nprocess intended to reduce this overhead as well as the amount of disk space\nrequired to run the simulation. New functionality is also introduced, including\nasynchronous I/O and support for multi-core processors. Experimental results\nshow that these changes significantly improve the runtime of the simulation.\nPEMS2 narrows the performance gap between simulated BSP algorithms and their\nhand-crafted EM counterparts, providing a practical system for using BSP\nalgorithms with data sets which exceed the size of RAM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2010 17:24:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Robillard", "David E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3718", "submitter": "T.R.
