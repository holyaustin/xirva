Membrane computing\naims at defining parallel and non-deterministic computing models, called\nmembrane systems or P Systems, which abstract from the functioning and\nstructure of the cell. A membrane system consists of a spatial structure, a\nhierarchy of membranes which do not intersect, with a distinguishable membrane\ncalled skin surrounding all of them. A membrane without any other membranes\ninside is elementary, while a non-elementary membrane is a composite membrane.\nThe membranes define demarcations between regions; for each membrane there is a\nunique associated region.

The space outside the\nskin membrane is called the environment.\n  In this thesis we define and investigate variants of systems of mobile\nmembranes as models for molecular computing and as modelling paradigms for\nbiological systems. On one hand, we follow the standard approach of research in\nmembrane computing: defining a notion of computation for systems of mobile\nmembranes, and investigating the computational power of such computing devices.\nSpecifically, we address issues concerning the power of operations for\nmodifying the membrane structure of a system of mobile membranes by mobility:\nendocytosis (moving a membrane inside a neighbouring membrane) and endocytosis\n(moving a membrane outside the membrane where it is placed).

Existing\nwork assumes the delay to be symmetric, which does not generalize to\napplications that are sensitive to one-way delays, such as the multimedia video\ndelivery from the servers to the hosts. We propose a relaxed inframetric model\nfor the network delay space that does not assume the triangle inequality and\ndelay symmetry to hold. We prove that the DNNS requests can be completed\nefficiently if the delay space exhibits modest inframetric dimensions, which we\ncan observe empirically. Finally, we propose a DNNS method named HybridNN\n(\\textit{Hybrid} \\textit{N}earest \\textit{N}eighbor search) based on the\ninframetric model for fast and accurate DNNS. For DNNS requests, HybridNN\nchooses closest neighbors accurately via the inframetric modelling, and\nscalably by combining delay predictions with direct probes to a pruned set of\nneighbors. Simulation results show that HybridNN locates nearly optimally the\nnearest neighbor. Experiments on PlanetLab show that HybridNN can provide\naccurate nearest neighbors that are close to optimal with modest query overhead\nand maintenance traffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2011 13:57:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Yongquan", ""], ["Wang", "Yijie", ""], ["Biersack", "Ernst", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.2580", "submitter": "Danny Bickson", "authors": "Yao Wu, Qiang Yan, Danny Bickson, Yucheng Low, Qing Yang", "title": "Efficient Multicore Collaborative Filtering", "comments": "In ACM KDD CUP Workshop 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes the solution method taken by LeBuSiShu team for track1\nin ACM KDD CUP 2011 contest (resulting in the 5th place).

Several self-healing algorithms\nhave been suggested recently [IPDPS'08, PODC'08, PODC'09, PODC'11] in a line of\nwork that has yielded gradual improvements in the properties ensured on the\ngraph. This work motivates a strong general phenomenon of edge-preserving\nhealing that aims at obtaining self-healing algorithms with the constraint that\nall original edges in the graph (not deleted by the adversary), be retained in\nevery intermediate graph.\n  The previous algorithms, in their nascent form, are not explicitly edge\npreserving. In this paper, we show they can be suitably modified (We introduce\nXheal+, an edge-preserving version of Xheal[PODC'11]). Towards this end, we\npresent a general self-healing model that unifies the previous models. The main\ncontribution of this paper is not in the technical complexity, rather in the\nsimplicity with which the edge-preserving property can be ensured and the\nmessage that this is a crucial property with several benefits. In particular,\nwe highlight this by showing that, almost as an immediate corollary, subgraph\ndensities are preserved or increased. Maintaining density is a notion motivated\nby the fact that in certain distributed networks, certain nodes may require and\ninitially have a larger number of inter-connections. It is vital that a healing\nalgorithm, even amidst failures, respect these requirements. Our suggested\nmodifications yield such subgraph density preservation as a by product. In\naddition, edge preservation helps maintain any subgraph induced property that\nis monotonic.

(b) A deterministic protocol for\nacknowledged gossiping, which takes $O(n^2 \\lg n)$ rounds when collision\ndetection mechanism is available. The structure of the transmissions of nodes\nin the network, to enable them to infer collisions, and discover existence of\nunknown in-neighborhood as a result, is abstracted as a family of integral sets\ncalled Selecting-Colliding family. We prove the existence of\nSelecting-Colliding families using the probabilistic method and employ them to\ndesign protocol for acknowledged gossiping when no collision detection\nmechanism is available.\n  Finally, we present a deterministic protocol for acknowledged broadcasting\nfor bidirectional networks, with a round complexity of $O(n \\lg n)$ rounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 10:16:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Vaya", "Shailesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6132", "submitter": "Shiqiang Wang Mr.", "authors": "Shiqiang Wang, Qingyang Song, Xingwei Wang, and Abbas Jamalipour", "title": "Distributed MAC Protocol Supporting Physical-Layer Network Coding", "comments": "Final version", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, vol. 12, no. 5, pp.\n  1023-1036, May 2013", "doi": "10.1109/TMC.2012.69", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is a promising approach for wireless\nnetworks. It allows nodes to transmit simultaneously. Due to the difficulties\nof scheduling simultaneous transmissions, existing works on PNC are based on\nsimplified medium access control (MAC) protocols, which are not applicable to\ngeneral multi-hop wireless networks, to the best of our knowledge. In this\npaper, we propose a distributed MAC protocol that supports PNC in multi-hop\nwireless networks. The proposed MAC protocol is based on the carrier sense\nmultiple access (CSMA) strategy and can be regarded as an extension to the IEEE\n802.11 MAC protocol. In the proposed protocol, each node collects information\non the queue status of its neighboring nodes. When a node finds that there is\nan opportunity for some of its neighbors to perform PNC, it notifies its\ncorresponding neighboring nodes and initiates the process of packet exchange\nusing PNC, with the node itself as a relay. During the packet exchange process,\nthe relay also works as a coordinator which coordinates the transmission of\nsource nodes. Meanwhile, the proposed protocol is compatible with conventional\nnetwork coding and conventional transmission schemes. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed protocol is advantageous in various scenarios of wireless\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 06:32:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2011 18:04:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 May 2013 19:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shiqiang", ""], ["Song", "Qingyang", ""], ["Wang", "Xingwei", ""], ["Jamalipour", "Abbas", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6160", "submitter": "Alfredo Braunstein", "authors": "Fabrizio Altarelli and Alfredo Braunstein and Abolfazl Ramezanpour and\n  Riccardo Zecchina", "title": "Stochastic optimization by message passing", "comments": "31 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "J.
