Having multiple chains in Parallel\nTempering allows parallelization in a manner that is similar to the serial\nalgorithm.

We call it the PALOMA model, standing for PAssively mobile\nLOgarithmic space MAchines. The main modification w.r.t. the Population\nProtocol model is that agents now, instead of being automata, are Turing\nMachines whose memory is logarithmic in the population size n. Note that the\nnew model is still easily implementable with current technology. We focus on\ncomplete communication graphs. We define the complexity class PLM, consisting\nof all symmetric predicates on input assignments that are stably computable by\nthe PALOMA model. We assume that the agents are initially identical.\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the PALOMA model can assign unique consecutive\nids to the agents and inform them of the population size! This allows us to\ngive a direct simulation of a Deterministic Turing Machine of O(nlogn) space,\nthus, establishing that any symmetric predicate in SPACE(nlogn) also belongs to\nPLM. We next prove that the PALOMA model can simulate the Community Protocol\nmodel, thus, improving the previous lower bound to all symmetric predicates in\nNSPACE(nlogn). Going one step further, we generalize the simulation of the\ndeterministic TM to prove that the PALOMA model can simulate a Nondeterministic\nTM of O(nlogn) space. Although providing the same lower bound, the important\nremark here is that the bound is now obtained in a direct manner, in the sense\nthat it does not depend on the simulation of a TM by a Pointer Machine.\nFinally, by showing that a Nondeterministic TM of O(nlogn) space decides any\nlanguage stably computable by the PALOMA model, we end up with an exact\ncharacterization for PLM: it is precisely the class of all symmetric predicates\nin NSPACE(nlogn).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Apr 2010 10:03:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chatzigiannakis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Michail", "Othon", ""], ["Nikolaou", "Stavros", ""], ["Pavlogiannis", "Andreas", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3408", "submitter": "Ayon Chakraborty", "authors": "Ayon Chakraborty, Kaushik Chakraborty, Swarup Kumar Mitra and M.K.\n  Naskar", "title": "An Energy Efficient Scheme for Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor\n  Networks Using Particle Swarm Optimization", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign\n  error in equation 1", "journal-ref": "Journal of Applied Computer Science, no. 6 (3) /2009, Suceava", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in\nequation 1\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Apr 2010 11:09:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Jun 2011 05:54:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Ayon", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Kaushik", ""], ["Mitra", "Swarup Kumar", ""], ["Naskar", "M.

The details of the implementations depend on the specific context\nof use of the protocol. The knowledge-based approach enables the\nimplementations to be optimized relative to these conditions of use. The\napproach is illustrated using extensions of the Dining Cryptographers protocol,\na security protocol for anonymous broadcast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 00:16:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Bataineh", "Omar I.", ""], ["van der Meyden", "Ron", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5256", "submitter": "Swan Dubois", "authors": "Swan Dubois (LIP6, INRIA Rocquencourt), Toshimitsu Masuzawa,\n  S\\'ebastien Tixeuil (LIP6)", "title": "Construction auto-stabilisante d'arbre couvrant en d\\'epit d'actions\n  malicieuses", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "12\\`emes Rencontres Francophones sur les Aspects Algorithmiques de\n  T\\'el\\'ecommunications (AlgoTel), Belle Dune : France (2010)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A self-stabilizing protocol provides by definition a tolerance to transient\nfailures.
