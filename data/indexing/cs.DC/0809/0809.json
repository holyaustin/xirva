Modeling defines the optimality. We first derive a global\nprobabilistic model for a network configuration which characterizes jointly the\nstatistical spatial dependence of a physical- and a logical-configuration. We\nthen show that a local model which approximates the global model is a two-layer\nMarkov Random Field or a random bond model. The complexity of the local model\nis the communication range among nodes. The local model is near-optimal when\nthe approximation error to the global model is within a given error bound.
