It is often preferred for the sake of its\nstability. We present TPILU(k), the first efficiently parallelized ILU(k)\npreconditioner that maintains this important stability property. Even better,\nTPILU(k) preconditioning produces an answer that is bit-compatible with the\nsequential ILU(k) preconditioning. In terms of performance, the TPILU(k)\npreconditioning is shown to run faster whenever more cores are made available\nto it --- while continuing to be as stable as sequential ILU(k). This is in\ncontrast to some competing methods that may become unstable if the degree of\nthread parallelism is raised too far. Where Block Jacobi ILU(k) fails in an\napplication, it can be replaced by TPILU(k) in order to maintain good\nperformance, while also achieving full stability. As a further optimization,\nTPILU(k) offers an optional level-based incomplete inverse method as a fast\napproximation for the original ILU(k) preconditioned matrix. Although this\nenhancement is not bit-compatible with classical ILU(k), it is bit-compatible\nwith the output from the single-threaded version of the same algorithm. In\nexperiments on a 16-core computer, the enhanced TPILU(k)-based iterative linear\nsolver performed up to 9 times faster. As we approach an era of many-core\ncomputing, the ability to efficiently take advantage of many cores will become\never more important. TPILU(k) also demonstrates good performance on cluster or\nGrid. For example, the new algorithm achieves 50 times speedup with 80 nodes\nfor general sparse matrices of dimension 160,000 that are diagonally dominant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2008 07:21:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Oct 2010 05:30:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2011 19:48:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 06:02:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Xin", ""], ["Cooperman", "Gene", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0053", "submitter": "M Sabu THAMPI", "authors": "Sabu M.
