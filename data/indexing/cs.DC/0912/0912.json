Cognitive Radio enhanced ad-hoc\narchitecture has been put forward as a candidate to enable such networks.\nSpectrum sensing, the cornerstone of the Cognitive Radio paradigm, has been the\nfocus of intensive research, from which the main conclusion was that its\nperformance can be greatly enhanced through the use of cooperative sensing\nschemes. To apply the Cognitive Radio paradigm to Ad-hoc disaster relief\nnetworks, the design of effective cooperative spectrum sensing schemes is\nessential. In this paper we propose a cluster based orchestration cooperative\nsensing scheme, which adapts to the cluster nodes surrounding radio environment\nstate as well as to the degree of correlation observed between those nodes. The\nproposed scheme is given both in a centralized as well as in a decentralized\napproach. In the centralized approach, the cluster head controls and adapts the\ndistribution of the cluster sensing nodes according to the monitored spectrum\nstate. While in the decentralized approach, each of the cluster nodes decides\nwhich spectrum it should monitor, according to the past local sensing decisions\nof the cluster nodes. The centralized and decentralized schemes can be combined\nto achieve a more robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. The proposed\nscheme performance is evaluated through a framework, which allows measuring the\naccuracy of the spectrum sensing cooperative scheme by measuring the error in\nthe estimation of the monitored spectrum state. Through this evaluation it is\nshown that the proposed scheme outperforms the case where the choice of which\nspectrum to sense is done without using the knowledge obtained in previous\nsensing iterations, i.e. a implementation of a blind Round Robin scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 13:37:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pratas", "Nuno", ""], ["Marchetti", "Nicola", ""], ["Prasad", "Neeli Rashmi", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Antonio", ""], ["Prasad", "Ramjee", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0338", "submitter": "David Goldberg", "authors": "David Gamarnik, David Goldberg, Theophane Weber", "title": "Correlation Decay in Random Decision Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.DC math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a decision network on an undirected graph in which each node\ncorresponds to a decision variable, and each node and edge of the graph is\nassociated with a reward function whose value depends only on the variables of\nthe corresponding nodes.

Our shared memory variants have a significantly\nbetter performance than conventional single threaded approaches, which is a\nresult that many users can benefit from as multi-core and multi-processor\ntechnology is widely available. Furthermore we demonstrate that our framework\ncan be deployed in a typical cluster of workstations, where several multi-core\nmachines are connected by a network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Dec 2009 23:33:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wieringa", "Siert", "", "Helsinki University of Technology TKK"], ["Niemenmaa", "Matti", "", "Helsinki University of Technology TKK"], ["Heljanko", "Keijo", "", "Helsinki\n  University of Technology TKK"]]}, {"id": "0912.2553", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Hao Wang (Centre for Logic and Information, St. Francis Xavier\n  University, Canada), Wendy MacCaull (Centre for Logic and Information, St.\n  Francis Xavier University, Canada)", "title": "An Efficient Explicit-time Description Method for Timed Model Checking", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 14, 2009, pp. 77-91", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.14.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.DC cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Timed model checking, the method to formally verify real-time systems, is\nattracting increasing attention from both the model checking community and the\nreal-time community. Explicit-time description methods verify real-time systems\nusing general model constructs found in standard un-timed model checkers.\nLamport proposed an explicit-time description method using a clock-ticking\nprocess (Tick) to simulate the passage of time together with a group of global\nvariables to model time requirements. Two methods, the Sync-based Explicit-time\nDescription Method using rendezvous synchronization steps and the\nSemaphore-based Explicit-time Description Method using only one global variable\nwere proposed; they both achieve better modularity than Lamport's method in\nmodeling the real-time systems. In contrast to timed automata based model\ncheckers like UPPAAL, explicit-time description methods can access and store\nthe current time instant for future calculations necessary for many real-time\nsystems, especially those with pre-emptive scheduling. However, the Tick\nprocess in the above three methods increments the time by one unit in each\ntick; the state spaces therefore grow relatively fast as the time parameters\nincrease, a problem when the system's time period is relatively long. In this\npaper, we propose a more efficient method which enables the Tick process to\nleap multiple time units in one tick.

Because such operations are the building blocks of most scientific\napplications, conventional supercomputers are still strongly predominant in\nhigh-performance computing and the use of grids for speeding up large-scale\nscientific problems is limited to applications exhibiting parallelism at a\nhigher level. We have identified two performance bottlenecks in the distributed\nmemory algorithms implemented in ScaLAPACK, a state-of-the-art dense linear\nalgebra library. First, because ScaLAPACK assumes a homogeneous communication\nnetwork, the implementations of ScaLAPACK algorithms lack locality in their\ncommunication pattern. Second, the number of messages sent in the ScaLAPACK\nalgorithms is significantly greater than other algorithms that trade flops for\ncommunication. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing a QR\nfactorization -- one of the main dense linear algebra kernels -- of tall and\nskinny matrices in a grid computing environment that overcomes these two\nbottlenecks. Our contribution is to articulate a recently proposed algorithm\n(Communication Avoiding QR) with a topology-aware middleware (QCG-OMPI) in\norder to confine intensive communications (ScaLAPACK calls) within the\ndifferent geographical sites. An experimental study conducted on the Grid'5000\nplatform shows that the resulting performance increases linearly with the\nnumber of geographical sites on large-scale problems (and is in particular\nconsistently higher than ScaLAPACK's).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 04:01:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Agullo", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Coti", "Camille", ""], ["Dongarra", "Jack", ""], ["Herault", "Thomas", ""], ["Langou", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.2785", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Gianfranco Ciardo (University of California, Riverside), Yang Zhao\n  (University of California, Riverside), Xiaoqing Jin (University of\n  California, Riverside)", "title": "Parallel symbolic state-space exploration is difficult, but what is the\n  alternative?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 14, 2009, pp. 1-17", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.14.1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  State-space exploration is an essential step in many modeling and analysis\nproblems. Its goal is to find the states reachable from the initial state of a\ndiscrete-state model described. The state space can used to answer important\nquestions, e.g., \"Is there a dead state?\" and \"Can N become negative?\", or as a\nstarting point for sophisticated investigations expressed in temporal logic.\n  Unfortunately, the state space is often so large that ordinary explicit data\nstructures and sequential algorithms cannot cope, prompting the exploration of\n(1) parallel approaches using multiple processors, from simple workstation\nnetworks to shared-memory supercomputers, to satisfy large memory and runtime\nrequirements and (2) symbolic approaches using decision diagrams to encode the\nlarge structured sets and relations manipulated during state-space generation.\n  Both approaches have merits and limitations. Parallel explicit state-space\ngeneration is challenging, but almost linear speedup can be achieved; however,\nthe analysis is ultimately limited by the memory and processors available.\nSymbolic methods are a heuristic that can efficiently encode many, but not all,\nfunctions over a structured and exponentially large domain; here the pitfalls\nare subtler: their performance varies widely depending on the class of decision\ndiagram chosen, the state variable order, and obscure algorithmic parameters.\n  As symbolic approaches are often much more efficient than explicit ones for\nmany practical models, we argue for the need to parallelize symbolic\nstate-space generation algorithms, so that we can realize the advantage of both\napproaches.
