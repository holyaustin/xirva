To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel\ntransaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is\nimplemented on the basis of the promising Shock Resistant Time Warp\nsynchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The\nvalidation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp\nalgorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves\nbut it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp\nalgorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion\nof this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp\nalgorithm to avoid such problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2007 15:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Krafft", "Gerald", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.2344", "submitter": "Publications Ampere", "authors": "Christian Vollaire (CEGELY), Laurent Nicolas (CEGELY), Alain Nicolas\n  (CEGELY)", "title": "Parallel computing for the finite element method", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL Applied Physics 1, 3 (03/1998) 305-314", "doi": "10.1051/epjap:1998151", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": null, "abstract": "  A finite element method is presented to compute time harmonic microwave\nfields in three dimensional configurations.
