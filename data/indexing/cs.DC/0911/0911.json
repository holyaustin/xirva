However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local\ninteractions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective\nbehaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a\ndivide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through\nlocal coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team\nof three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 04:23:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 13:14:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 02:58:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Karimadini", "Mohammad", ""], ["Lin", "Hai", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0480", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Boseung Kim, Huibin Lim, Yongtae Shin", "title": "Routing Technique Based on Clustering for Data Duplication Prevention in\n  Wireless Sensor Network", "comments": "5 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 061-065, October 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless Sensor Networks is important to nodes energy consumption for long\nactivity of sensor nodes because nodes that compose sensor network are small\nsize, and battery capacity is limited.

In this setting, we give session types\na semantics based on fair testing. The outcome is a unified theory of\nbehavioral types that shares common aspects with conversation types and that\nencompass features of both dyadic and multi-party session types. The point of\nview we provide sheds light on the nature of session types and gives us a\nchance to reason about them in a framework where every notion, from\nwell-typedness to the subtyping relation between session types, is semantically\n-rather than syntactically- grounded.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 00:35:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Padovani", "Luca", "", "University of Urbino"]]}, {"id": "0911.5593", "submitter": "Yves Robert", "authors": "Franck Cappello (LRI), Henri Casanova (ICS), Yves Robert (INRIA\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parall\\'elisme, LIP)", "title": "Checkpointing vs. Migration for Post-Petascale Machines", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We craft a few scenarios for the execution of sequential and parallel jobs on\nfuture generation machines.

We explain how Grid resources\nwere exploited efficiently and with ease, using user-level overlay based on\nGanga and DIANE tools above standard Grid software stack. Application-specific\nscheduling and resource selection based on simple but powerful heuristics\nallowed to improve efficiency of the processing to obtain desired scientific\nresults by a specified deadline. This is also a demonstration of combined use\nof supercomputers, to calculate the initial state of the QCD system, and Grids,\nto perform the subsequent massively distributed simulations. The QCD simulation\nwas performed on a $16^3\\times 4$ lattice. Keeping the strange quark mass at\nits physical value, we reduced the masses of the up and down quarks until,\nunder an increase of temperature, the system underwent a second-order phase\ntransition to a quark-gluon plasma. Then we measured the response of this\nsystem to an increase in the quark density. We find that the transition is\nsmoothened rather than sharpened. If confirmed on a finer lattice, this finding\nmakes it unlikely for ongoing experimental searches to find a QCD critical\npoint at small chemical potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 16:14:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Mo\u015bcicki", "Jakub T.", ""], ["Wo\u015b", "Maciej", ""], ["Lamanna", "Massimo", ""], ["de Forcrand", "Philippe", ""], ["Philipsen", "Owe", ""]]}]
