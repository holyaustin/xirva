Biological membranes\nplay a fundamental role in the complex reactions which take place in cells of\nliving organisms. The importance of this role has been considered in two\ndifferent types of formalisms introduced recently. Membrane systems were\nintroduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the\nobservation that any biological system is a complex hierarchical structure,\nwith a flow of biochemical substances and information that underlies their\nfunctioning. The modeling and analysis of biological systems has also attracted\nconsiderable interest of the process algebra research community. Thus the\nnotions of membranes and compartments have been explicitly represented in a\nfamily of calculi, such as ambients and brane calculi. A cross fertilization of\nthese two research areas has recently started. A deeper investigation of the\nrelationships between these related formalisms is interesting, as it is\nimportant to understand the crucial similarities and the differences. The main\naim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on membrane\ncomputing, in biologically inspired process calculi, and in other related\nfields, in order to present recent results and to discuss new ideas concerning\nsuch formalisms, their properties and relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Oct 2010 07:48:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ciobanu", "Gabriel", "", "Iasi, Romania"], ["Koutny", "Maciej", "", "Newcastle, UK"]]}, {"id": "1011.0235", "submitter": "Sisir Koppaka", "authors": "Sisir Koppaka, Dheevatsa Mudigere, Srihari Narasimhan, Babu Narayanan", "title": "Fast Histograms using Adaptive CUDA Streams", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, to appear in Student Research\n  Symposium, High Performance Computing 2010, Goa, India (www.hipc.org)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Histograms are widely used in medical imaging, network intrusion detection,\npacket analysis and other stream-based high throughput applications.

The\nnetwork is recursively partitioned into subnetworks. Initially, nodes at the\nfinest scale gossip to compute local averages. Then, using geographic routing\nto enable gossip between nodes that are not directly connected, these local\naverages are progressively fused up the hierarchy until the global average is\ncomputed. We show that the proposed hierarchical scheme with $k$ levels of\nhierarchy is competitive with state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms, in\nterms of message complexity, achieving $\\epsilon$-accuracy with high\nprobability after $O\\big(n \\log \\log n \\log \\frac{kn}{\\epsilon} \\big)$\nmessages. Key to our analysis is the way in which the network is recursively\npartitioned. We find that the optimal scaling law is achieved when subnetworks\nat scale $j$ contain $O(n^{(2/3)^j})$ nodes; then the message complexity at any\nindividual scale is $O(n \\log \\frac{kn}{\\epsilon})$, and the total number of\nscales in the hierarchy grows slowly, as $\\Theta(\\log \\log n)$. Another\nimportant consequence of hierarchical construction is that the longest distance\nover which messages are exchanged is $O(n^{1/3})$ hops (at the highest scale),\nand most messages (at lower scales) travel shorter distances. In networks that\nuse link-level acknowledgements, this results in less congestion and resource\nusage by reducing message retransmissions.

The resource model is based on\nstatistical analysis of host computational power, memory, and storage as well\nas how these resources change over time and the correlations between them. We\nfind that resources with few discrete values (core count, memory) are well\nmodeled by exponential laws governing the change of relative resource\nquantities over time. Resources with a continuous range of values are well\nmodeled with either correlated normal distributions (processor speed for\ninteger operations and floating point operations) or log-normal distributions\n(available disk space). We validate and show the utility of the models by\napplying them to a resource allocation problem for Internet-distributed\napplications, and demonstrate their value over other models.

Such\nbehaviour can be found in many practical systems, including collaborative\nworkflow in healthcare systems for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).\nProcesses using the symmetric sums can be embedded into the original branching\ntypes using conductor processes.

However, the majority of the existing\naggregation algorithms exhibit relevant dependability issues, when prospecting\ntheir use in real application environments. In this paper, we reveal some\ndependability issues of aggregation algorithms based on iterative averaging\ntechniques, giving some directions to solve them. This class of algorithms is\nconsidered robust (when compared to common tree-based approaches), being\nindependent from the used routing topology and providing an aggregation result\nat all nodes. However, their robustness is strongly challenged and their\ncorrectness often compromised, when changing the assumptions of their working\nenvironment to more realistic ones. The correctness of this class of algorithms\nrelies on the maintenance of a fundamental invariant, commonly designated as\n\"mass conservation\". We will argue that this main invariant is often broken in\npractical settings, and that additional mechanisms and modifications are\nrequired to maintain it, incurring in some degradation of the algorithms\nperformance. In particular, we discuss the behavior of three representative\nalgorithms Push-Sum Protocol, Push-Pull Gossip protocol and Distributed Random\nGrouping under asynchronous and faulty (with message loss and node crashes)\nenvironments.
