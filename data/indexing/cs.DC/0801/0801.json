DASH is fully distributed; adds new edges\nonly among neighbors of deleted nodes; and has average latency and bandwidth\ncosts that are at most logarithmic in n. DASH has these properties irrespective\nof the topology of the initial network, and is thus orthogonal and\ncomplementary to traditional topology-based approaches to defending against\nattack.\n  We also prove lower-bounds showing that DASH is asymptotically optimal in\nterms of minimizing maximum degree increase over multiple attacks.

Our argument can be extended to prove a lower bound\nof Omega(\\sqrt{nD}) rounds for broadcasting in radio networks of radius D. This\nresolves one of the open problems posed in [29], where in the authors proved a\nlower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/4}) rounds for broadcasting in constant diameter\nnetworks.\n  We prove the new lower $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ bound for a special family of\nradius 2 networks.
