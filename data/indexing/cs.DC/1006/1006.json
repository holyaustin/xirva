Therefore, we need\nGreen Cloud computing solutions that can not only save energy for the\nenvironment but also reduce operational costs.

In this paper, we construct two\nedge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles in $TQ_n$ for any odd integer $n\\geqslant 5$.\nThe presence of two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles provides an advantage when\nimplementing two algorithms that require a ring structure by allowing message\ntraffic to be spread evenly across the twisted cube. Furthermore, we construct\ntwo equal node-disjoint cycles in $TQ_n$ for any odd integer $n\\geqslant 3$, in\nwhich these two cycles contain the same number of nodes and every node appears\nin one cycle exactly once. In other words, we decompose a twisted cube into two\ncomponents with the same size such that each component contains a Hamiltonian\ncycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jun 2010 05:37:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2010 09:20:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hung", "Ruo-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.3919", "submitter": "Ying Cui", "authors": "Ying Cui, Vincent K.N.Lau", "title": "Convergence-Optimal Quantizer Design of Distributed Contraction-based\n  Iterative Algorithms with Quantized Message Passing", "comments": "17 pages, 9 figures, Transaction on Signal Processing, accepted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2010.2055861", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the convergence behavior of distributed iterative\nalgorithms with quantized message passing.

Each such\nedge from $u$ is linked to a random node at distance $r$ ahead in the ring with\nprobability proportional to $1/r$, a \"harmonic\" distance distribution of\ncontacts. Aspnes et al. (2002) have shown an $O(\\log^2 n / \\ell)$ bound on the\nexpected length of greedy routes in the case when each node is assigned exactly\n$\\ell$ contacts and, as a consequence of recent work by Dietzfelbinger and\nWoelfel (2009), this bound is known to be tight. In this paper, we generalize\nAspnes' upper bound to show that any degree distribution with mean $\\ell$ and\nmaximum value $O(\\log n)$ has greedy routes of expected length $O(\\log^2n /\n\\ell)$, implying that any harmonic ring in this family is asymptotically\noptimal. Furthermore, for a more general family of rings, we show that a fixed\ndegree distribution is optimal. More precisely, if each random contact is\nchosen at distance $r$ with a probability that decreases with $r$, then among\ndegree distributions with mean $\\ell$, greedy routing time is smallest when\nevery node is assigned $\\floor{\\ell}$ or $\\ceiling{\\ell}$ contacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jun 2010 02:14:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 22:09:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Terashima", "R.

While traditional embedded systems provide only\nclosed base applications (natively-installed software) to users, open embedded\nsystems allow the users to freely execute open applications\n(additionally-installed software) in order to meet various user requirements,\nsuch as user personalization and device coordination. Key to the success of\nplatforms required for open embedded systems is the achievement of both the\nscalable extension of base applications and the secure execution of open\napplications. Most existing platforms, however, have focused on either scalable\nor secure execution, limiting their applicability. This dissertation presents a\nnew secure platform using multi-core processors, which achieves both\nscalability and security. Four techniques feature the new platform: (1)\nseamless communication, by which legacy applications designed for a single\nprocessor make it possible to be executed on multiple processors without any\nsoftware modifications; (2) secure processor partitioning with hardware\nsupport, by which Operating Systems (OSs) required for base and open\napplications are securely executed on separate processors; (3) asymmetric\nvirtualization, by which many OSs over the number of processors are securely\nexecuted under secure processor partitioning; and (4) secure dynamic\npartitioning, by which the number of processors allocated to individual OSs\nmakes it possible to be dynamically changed under secure processor\npartitioning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2010 11:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Inoue", "Hiroaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5643", "submitter": "Graham Kirby", "authors": "\\'Alvaro Reb\\'on Portillo, Scott Walker, Graham Kirby, Alan Dearle", "title": "A Reflective Approach to Providing Flexibility in Application\n  Distribution", "comments": "2nd International Workshop on Reflective and Adaptive Middleware,\n  ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Middleware Conference (Middleware 2003), Rio de\n  Janeiro, Brazil, pp.95-99", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Current middleware systems suffer from drawbacks.
