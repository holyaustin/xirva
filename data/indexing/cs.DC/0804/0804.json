Many consensus\nalgorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the\ngraph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is\nundirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has\nbeen extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this\nwork, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal\ndecision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly\nsimple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective,\nchannel. The main contribution of the paper is to derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the\nchannel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the\nconsensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay\ncondition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 09:22:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Scutari", "Gesualdo", ""], ["Barbarossa", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0862", "submitter": "Mark Braverman", "authors": "Mark Braverman", "title": "On ad hoc routing with guaranteed delivery", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We point out a simple poly-time log-space routing algorithm in ad hoc\nnetworks with guaranteed delivery using universal exploration sequences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Apr 2008 16:16:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Braverman", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1115", "submitter": "Oskar Sandberg", "authors": "Olof Mogren, Oskar Sandberg, Vilhelm Verendel and Devdatt Dubhashi", "title": "Adaptive Dynamics of Realistic Small-World Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Continuing in the steps of Jon Kleinberg's and others celebrated work on\ndecentralized search in small-world networks, we conduct an experimental\nanalysis of a dynamic algorithm that produces small-world networks.

Many empirical evidences suggest that multiple heads\naugment the expressive power of the language, however no formal result in this\ndirection has been proved, so far.\n  In the first part of this paper we analyze the Turing completeness of CHR\nwith respect to the underneath constraint theory. We prove that if the\nconstraint theory is powerful enough then restricting to single head rules does\nnot affect the Turing completeness of the language. On the other hand,\ndifferently from the case of the multi-headed language, the single head CHR\nlanguage is not Turing powerful when the underlying signature (for the\nconstraint theory) does not contain function symbols.\n  In the second part we prove that, no matter which constraint theory is\nconsidered, under some reasonable assumptions it is not possible to encode the\nCHR language (with multi-headed rules) into a single headed language while\npreserving the semantics of the programs. We also show that, under some\nstronger assumptions, considering an increasing number of atoms in the head of\na rule augments the expressive power of the language.\n  These results provide a formal proof for the claim that multiple heads\naugment the expressive power of the CHR language.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 16:21:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 19:49:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2009 16:29:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2010 18:22:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 5 Nov 2010 21:19:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 18 Jan 2011 11:03:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Di Giusto", "Cinzia", ""], ["Gabbrielli", "Maurizio", ""], ["Meo", "Maria Chiara", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3417", "submitter": "Nicholas M.
