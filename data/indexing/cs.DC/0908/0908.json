The implicit initial assumptions enable correct nodes to infer\nabout the progression of the algorithm at other nodes from their local state.\nThis paper considers a more severe fault model than permanent Byzantine\nfailures, one in which the system can in addition be subject to severe\ntransient failures that can temporarily throw the system out of its assumption\nboundaries. When the system eventually returns to behave according to the\npresumed assumptions it may be in an arbitrary state in which any\nsynchronization among the nodes might be lost, and each node may be at an\narbitrary state. We present a self-stabilizing Byzantine agreement algorithm\nthat reaches agreement among the correct nodes in an optimal ration of faulty\nto correct, by using only the assumption of eventually bounded message\ntransmission delay. In the process of solving the problem, two additional\nimportant and challenging building blocks were developed: a unique\nself-stabilizing protocol for assigning consistent relative times to protocol\ninitialization and a Reliable Broadcast primitive that progresses at the speed\nof actual message delivery time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2009 21:09:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Daliot", "Ariel", ""], ["Dolev", "Danny", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0390", "submitter": "Zohir Bouzid", "authors": "Zohir Bouzid (LIP6), Maria Potop-Butucaru (LIP6, INRIA Rocquencourt),\n  S\\'ebastien Tixeuil (LIP6)", "title": "Byzantine Convergence in Robots Networks: The Price of Asynchrony", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the convergence problem in fully asynchronous, uni-dimensional robot\nnetworks that are prone to Byzantine (i.e. malicious) failures.

During the off-working hours, the computational capacities of these\nnetworked computers are underused or unused. In order to utilize this\ncomputational capacity an application has to be recoded to exploit concurrency\ninherent in a computation which is clearly not possible for legacy applications\nwithout any source code. This thesis presents the design an implementation of a\ndistributed middleware which can automatically execute a legacy application on\nmultiple networked computers by parallelizing it. This middleware runs multiple\ncopies of the binary executable code in parallel on different hosts in the\nnetwork. It wraps up the binary executable code of the legacy application in\norder to capture the kernel level data access system calls and perform them\ndistributively over multiple computers in a safe and conflict free manner. The\nmiddleware also incorporates a dynamic scheduling technique to execute the\ntarget application in minimum time by scavenging the available CPU cycles of\nthe hosts in the network. This dynamic scheduling also supports the CPU\navailability of the hosts to change over time and properly reschedule the\nreplicas performing the computation to minimize the execution time. A prototype\nimplementation of this middleware has been developed as a proof of concept of\nthe design. This implementation has been evaluated with a few typical case\nstudies and the test results confirm that the middleware works as expected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2009 16:26:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Que Thu Dung", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3455", "submitter": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica", "authors": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica, Ion Pargaru, Florin Ionescu, Cristina Teodora\n  Andreica", "title": "Algorithmic Aspects of Several Data Transfer Service Optimization\n  Problems", "comments": "Proceedings of the International Symposium on Sustainable Development\n  in Conditions of Economic Instability, Satu Mare, 26-27 June, 2009", "journal-ref": "\"Quality - Access to Success\" Journal, vol. 10, special issue no.\n  101, pp. 30-32, 2009.
