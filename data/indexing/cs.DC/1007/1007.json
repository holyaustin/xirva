Effects on performance and resource consumption\nwere measured in experiments, which were carried out in a local area test-bed.\nThe experiments were conducted with components of one specific distributed\nstorage system, but seek to be applicable to a wide range of such systems, in\nparticular those exposed to varying conditions. The perceived characteristics\nof distributed storage systems depend on their configuration parameters and on\nvarious dynamic conditions. For a given set of conditions, one specific\nconfiguration may be better than another with respect to measures such as\nresource consumption and performance. Here, configuration parameter values were\nset dynamically and the results compared with a static configuration. It was\nhypothesised that under non-changing conditions this would allow the system to\nconverge on a configuration that was more suitable than any that could be set a\npriori. Furthermore, the system could react to a change in conditions by\nadopting a more appropriate configuration. Autonomic management was applied to\nthe peer-to-peer (P2P) and data retrieval components of ASA, a distributed\nstorage system. The effects were measured experimentally for various workload\nand churn patterns. The management policies and mechanisms were implemented\nusing a generic autonomic management framework developed during this work. The\nexperimental evaluations of autonomic management show promising results, and\nsuggest several future research topics. The findings of this thesis could be\nexploited in building other distributed storage systems that focus on\nharnessing storage on user workstations, since these are particularly likely to\nbe exposed to varying, unpredictable conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2010 10:08:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tauber", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0641", "submitter": "Fei Wei", "authors": "Fei Wei, Huazhong Yang", "title": "Transmission Line Inspires A New Distributed Algorithm to Solve the\n  Nonlinear Dynamical System of Physical Circuit", "comments": "v1: 12 pages, 7 figures; v2: 19 pages, 13 figures, submitted to 2nd\n  International Conference on Circuit Simulation, being reviewed (ICCS,\n  Shanghai, 2010); v3: a copy of v2, this is an internal error of arxiv.org;\n  v4: Rejected by ICCS, re-submitted to ICCIT'10", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC math.CA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As known, physical circuits, e.g. integrated circuits or power system, work\nin a distributed manner, but these circuits could not be easily simulated in a\ndistributed way.

To achieve this goal, we propose a request\ntracing approach that online classifies the major causal path patterns of a\nmulti-tier service and monitors their performance data as a guide for accurate\nDVFS control. The request tracing approach significantly decreases the time\ncost of performance profiling experiments that aim to establish the empirical\nperformance model. Moreover, it decreases the controller complexity so that we\ncan introduce a much simpler feedback controller, which only relies on the\nsingle-node DVFS modulation at a time as opposed to varying multiple CPU\nfrequencies simultaneously. Based on the request tracing approach, we present a\nhybrid DVFS control system that combines an empirical performance model for\nfast modulation at different load levels and a simpler feedback controller for\nadaption. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, called PowerTracer,\nand conduct extensive experiments on a 3-tier platform. Our experimental\nresults show that PowerTracer outperforms its peer in terms of power saving and\nsystem performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2010 08:13:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 31 Jul 2010 02:52:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Lin", ""], ["Zhan", "Jianfeng", ""], ["Sang", "Bo", ""], ["Wang", "Lei", ""], ["Wang", "Haining", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4993", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "MohammadReza Mousavi (Eindhoven University of Technology), Gwen\n  Sala\\\"un (INRIA Grenoble - Rhone-Alpes)", "title": "Proceedings Ninth International Workshop on the Foundations of\n  Coordination Languages and Software Architectures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 30, 2010", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.30", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.DC cs.LO cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of FOCLASA 2010, the 9th International\nWorkshop on the Foundations of Coordination Languages and Software\nArchitectures.

We advocate that this\napproach has actually only made matters worse, as the developer needs to be\naware of many intricate internal details in order to adequately handle partial\nfailures. The result is an increase of application complexity. We present an\nalternative in which distribution transparency is lessened in favor of clearer\nsemantics. In particular, we argue that a developer should always be offered\nthe unambiguous semantics of local objects, and that distribution comes from\ncopying those objects to where they are needed. We claim that it is often\nsufficient to provide only small, immutable objects, along with facilities to\ngroup objects into clusters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 00:12:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wams", "Jan-Mark S.", "", "VU Amsterdam"], ["van Steen", "Maarten", "", "VU Amsterdam"]]}, {"id": "1007.5090", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Imene Ben-Hafaiedh (Universite Joseph Fourier/VERIMAG), Susanne Graf\n  (Universite Joseph Fourier/VERIMAG), Hammadi Khairallah (Tunisia Polytechnic\n  School)", "title": "Implementing Distributed Controllers for Systems with Priorities", "comments": "In Proceedings FOCLASA 2010, arXiv:1007.4993", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 30, 2010, pp. 31-46", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.30.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PL cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Implementing a component-based system in a distributed way so that it ensures\nsome global constraints is a challenging problem.

This leads to identifying coordination classes,\ne.g., for delegating the most security sensitive coordination to the direct\nactor-actor coordination links, the least real-time constrained coordination to\nindirect links, and the safety critical coordination to both direct actor links\nand indirect sensor paths between actors.
