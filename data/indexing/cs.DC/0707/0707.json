Method: The\nMammoGrid project has deployed a prototype system for clinicians using the Grid\nas its information infrastructure. To assist in the specification of the system\nrequirements (and for the first time in healthgrid applications), use-case\nmodelling has been carried out in close collaboration with clinicians and\nradiologists who had no prior experience of this modelling technique.

This kind of scheduling, in which there is no consideration of\nnetwork characteristics, can lead to performance degradation in a Grid\nenvironment and may result in large processing queues and job execution delays\ndue to site overloads. In this paper we describe a Data Intensive and Network\nAware (DIANA) meta-scheduling approach, which takes into account data,\nprocessing power and network characteristics when making scheduling decisions\nacross multiple sites. Through a practical implementation on a Grid testbed, we\ndemonstrate that queue and execution times of data-intensive jobs can be\nsignificantly improved when we introduce our proposed DIANA scheduler. The\nbasic scheduling decisions are dictated by a weighting factor for each\npotential target location which is a calculated function of network\ncharacteristics, processing cycles and data location and size. The job\nscheduler provides a global ranking of the computing resources and then selects\nan optimal one on the basis of this overall access and execution cost. The\nDIANA approach considers the Grid as a combination of active network elements\nand takes network characteristics as a first class criterion in the scheduling\ndecision matrix along with computation and data. The scheduler can then make\ninformed decisions by taking into account the changing state of the network,\nlocality and size of the data and the pool of available processing cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2007 19:46:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["McClatchey", "Richard", ""], ["Anjum", "Ashiq", ""], ["Stockinger", "Heinz", ""], ["Ali", "Arshad", ""], ["Willers", "Ian", ""], ["Thomas", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.1607", "submitter": "Erik Schnetter", "authors": "Erik Schnetter, Christian D.
