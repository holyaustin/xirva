This motivates\nthe support of multiple independent clock domains and related clock domain\ncrossing circuits that enable reliable communication across domains. Existing\nJ-SIM simulation models indicate that setup violations can cause clock-to-Q\nincreases of up to 100%.

This new cell structure,\nreferred to as flash threshold logic (FTL), uses floating gate (flash)\ntransistors to realize the weights associated with a threshold function. The\nthreshold voltages of the flash transistors serve as a proxy for the weights.\nAn FTL cell can be equivalently viewed as a multi-input, edge-triggered\nflipflop which computes a threshold function on a clock edge. Consequently, it\ncan be used in the automatic synthesis of ASICs. The use of flash transistors\nin the FTL cell allows programming of the weights after fabrication, thereby\npreventing discovery of its function by a foundry or by reverse engineering.\nThis paper focuses on the design and characteristics of the FTL cell. We\npresent a novel method for programming the weights of an FTL cell for a\nspecified threshold function using a modified perceptron learning algorithm.\nThe algorithm is further extended to select weights to maximize the robustness\nof the design in the presence of process variations. The FTL circuit was\ndesigned in 40nm technology and simulations with layout-extracted parasitics\nincluded, demonstrate significant improvements in the area (79.7%), power\n(61.1%), and performance (42.5%) when compared to the equivalent\nimplementations of the same function in conventional static CMOS design.
