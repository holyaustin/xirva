Global\nwireless data traffic is undergoinga rapid growth. However, wireless systems,\ndue to their broad-casting nature, are vulnerable to malicious security\nbreaches. Inaddition, advances in quantum computing poses a risk to\nexistingcrypto-based information security. It is of the utmost importanceto\nmake the THz systems resilient to potential active and passiveattacks which may\nlead to devastating consequences, especiallywhen handling sensitive patient\ndata in healthcare systems. Newstrategies are needed to analyse these malicious\nattacks and topropose viable countermeasures. In this manuscript, we presenta\nnew authentication mechanism for nanoscale communicationsystems operating in\nTHz band at the physical layer. We assessedan impersonation attack on a THz\nsystem. We propose usingpath loss as a fingerprint to conduct authentication\nvia two-stephypothesis testing for a transmission device. We used hiddenMarkov\nModel (HMM) viterbi algorithm to enhance the outputof hypothesis testing. We\nalso conducted transmitter identificationusing maximum likelihood and Gaussian\nmixture model (GMM)expectation maximization algorithms. Our simulations\nshowedthat the error probabilities are a decreasing functions of SNR. At 10 dB\nwith 0.2 false alarm, the detection probability was almostone. We further\nobserved that HMM out-performs hypothesistesting at low SNR regime (10%\nincrease in accuracy is recordedat SNR =5 dB) whereas the GMM is useful when\ngroundtruths are noisy. Our work addresses major security gaps facedby\ncommunication system either through malicious breachesor quantum computing,\nenabling new applications of nanoscalesystems for Industry 4.0.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 05:01:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Aman", "Waqas", ""], ["Rahman", "M.

In this paper, a\ngeneralized circuit design platform is introduced where biological models can\nbe conveniently implemented using CMOS circuitry operating in strong-inversion.\nThe application of the method is demonstrated by synthesizing a relatively\ncomplex two-dimensional (2-D) nonlinear neuron model. The validity of our\napproach is verified by nominal simulated results with realistic process\nparameters from the commercially available AMS 0.35 um technology. The circuit\nsimulation results exhibit regular spiking responses in good agreement with\ntheir mathematical counterpart.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2020 01:47:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Soleimani", "Hamid", ""], ["Drakakis", "Emmanuel.

To achieve maximum energy efficiency in such systems, logic and\nmemory should be integrated as tightly as possible. In this work, we focus on\nthe case of ternary neural networks, where synaptic weights assume ternary\nvalues. We propose a two-transistor/two-resistor memory architecture employing\na precharge sense amplifier, where the weight value can be extracted in a\nsingle sense operation. Based on experimental measurements on a hybrid 130 nm\nCMOS/RRAM chip featuring this sense amplifier, we show that this technique is\nparticularly appropriate at low supply voltage, and that it is resilient to\nprocess, voltage, and temperature variations. We characterize the bit error\nrate in our scheme. We show based on neural network simulation on the CIFAR-10\nimage recognition task that the use of ternary neural networks significantly\nincreases neural network performance, with regards to binary ones, which are\noften preferred for inference hardware. We finally evidence that the neural\nnetwork is immune to the type of bit errors observed in our scheme, which can\ntherefore be used without error correction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2020 09:37:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 08:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Laborieux", "Axel", ""], ["Bocquet", "Marc", ""], ["Hirtzlin", "Tifenn", ""], ["Klein", "Jacques-Olivier", ""], ["Nowak", "Etienne", ""], ["Vianello", "Elisa", ""], ["Portal", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Querlioz", "Damien", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.14568", "submitter": "Sajjad Abdollahramezani", "authors": "Sajjad Abdollahramezani, Omid Hemmatyar, and Ali Adibi", "title": "Meta-optics for spatial optical analog computing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Nanophotonics (2020)", "doi": "10.1515/nanoph-2020-0285", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rapidly growing demands for high-performance computing, powerful data\nprocessing systems, and big data necessitate the advent of novel optical\ndevices to perform demanding computing processes effectively.
