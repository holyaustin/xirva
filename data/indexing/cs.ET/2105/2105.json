However, to date, the essential rationale for\nand analysis of classical reversible computing (RC) has not yet been expressed\nin terms that leverage the modern formal methods of non-equilibrium quantum\nthermodynamics (NEQT). In this paper, we begin developing an NEQT-based\nfoundation for the physics of reversible computing. We use the framework of\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics (a.k.a. Lindbladians) with\nmultiple asymptotic states, incorporating recent results from resource theory,\nfull counting statistics, and stochastic thermodynamics. Important conclusions\ninclude that, as expected: (1) Landauer's Principle indeed sets a strict lower\nbound on entropy generation in traditional non-reversible architectures for\ndeterministic computing machines when we account for the loss of correlations;\nand (2) implementations of the alternative reversible computation paradigm can\npotentially avoid such losses, and thereby circumvent the Landauer limit,\npotentially allowing the efficiency of future digital computing technologies to\ncontinue improving indefinitely.
