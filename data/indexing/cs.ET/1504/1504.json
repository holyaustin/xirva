Reservoir computing is an\napproach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time\ncomputing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a\ntime-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a\ndesired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the\ncomputational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated\nreadouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of\ninterconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal\namplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which\nimproves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number\nof output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small\nnetworks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform\ngeneration tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor\nof 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single\nmemristive networks are unable to produce the correct result.
