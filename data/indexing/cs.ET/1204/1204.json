Thelow power\nrequirements of intra-body communication (IBC) as compared to near field\nelectromagnetic waves showed that it can be a suitable solution for Medical\nBody Area Networks (MBANs) in a mobile health care system.In this paper, we\ninvestigate the transmission characteristics of the human body as a conductor\nof signals by considering different data transmission rates of multi-point to\npoint network in order to reduce overall power consumption of the\nBAN.Furthermore, we utilize IBC and propose a new scheme to combines Slotted\nALOHA, TDMA, and Reservation ALOHA together to increase the throughput and\ndecrease the delay. By using our new hybrid scheme with the movable boundary\ndesigned for health status monitoring, we are able to increase the efficiency\nof data transmission by prioritizing the more critical data from the sensors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 07:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Alshehab", "Abdullah", ""], ["Wu", "Chiu Tung", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Nao", ""], ["Sok", "Sikieng", ""], ["Shimamoto", "Shigeru", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.1749", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Yukio-Pegio Gunji, Yuta Nishiyama, Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "Robust Soldier Crab Ball Gate", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Complex Systems 20 (2011) 2", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET nlin.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Soldier crabs Mictyris guinotae exhibit pronounced swarming behaviour.

By applying these items, the hardware requirements for a QCA\ndesign can be reduced and circuits can be simpler in level and gate counts. As\nan example, a 1-bit QCA adder is constructed by applying our new scheme and is\ncompared to the other existing implementation.
