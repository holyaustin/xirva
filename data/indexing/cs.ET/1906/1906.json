To simplify or enable a\nrealization of these oracles in quantum logic in the first place, the Boolean\nreversible functions to be realized usually need to be broken down into several\nnon-reversible sub-functions.

Among these, wireless intra-chip communications have\nbeen under intense scrutiny due to their low latency broadcast and\narchitectural flexibility. Thus far, the practicality of the idea has been\nstudied from the RF front-end and the network interface perspectives, whereas\nlittle to no attention has been placed on another essential component: the data\nconverters. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive\nanalysis of the requirements of the scenario, as well as of the current\nperformance and cost trends of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Based on\nMurmann's data, we demonstrate that ADCs will not be a roadblock for the\nrealization of wireless intra-chip communications although current designs do\nnot meet their demands fully.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:46:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Abadal", "Sergi", ""], ["Alarc\u00f3n", "Eduard", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.05361", "submitter": "Sergi Abadal", "authors": "S.

This is achieved\nby introducing an additional loss function during the training of the ESNs,\nwhich penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional\ntraining data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system, where\nthe physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two\nLyapunov times as compared to conventional ESNs. The proposed framework shows\nthe potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge\nto improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2019 10:01:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Doan", "Nguyen Anh Khoa", ""], ["Polifke", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Magri", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11137", "submitter": "Ritajit Majumdar", "authors": "Ritajit Majumdar, Susmita Sur-Kolay", "title": "Optimal Error Correcting Code For Ternary Quantum Systems", "comments": "This is more of a rigorous exercise than a novel research", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multi-valued quantum systems can store more information than binary ones for\na given number of quantum states. For reliable operation of multi-valued\nquantum systems, error correction is mandated. In this paper, we propose a\n5-qutrit quantum error-correcting code and provide its stabilizer formulation.\nSince 5 qutrits are necessary to correct a single error, our proposed code is\noptimal in the number of qutrits. We prove that the error model considered in\nthis paper spans the entire $(3 \\times 3)$ operator space. Therefore, our\nproposed code can correct any single error on the codeword.

To ensure efficient use of\nsuch crossbars in neuromorphic computing circuits, variations of\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of crosspoint devices must be substantially\nlower than those of memory cells with select transistors. Apparently, this\nrequirement explains why there were so few demonstrations of neuromorphic\nsystem prototypes using passive crossbars. Here we report a 64x64 passive\nmetal-oxide memristor crossbar circuit with ~99% device yield, based on a\nfoundry-compatible fabrication process featuring etch-down patterning and\nlow-temperature budget, conducive to vertical integration. The achieved ~26%\nvariations of switching voltages of our devices were sufficient for programming\n4K-pixel gray-scale patterns with an average tuning error smaller than 4%. The\nanalog properties were further verified by experimentally demonstrating MNIST\npattern classification with a fidelity close to the software-modeled limit for\na network of this size, with an ~1% average error of import of\nex-situ-calculated synaptic weights. We believe that our work is a significant\nimprovement over the state-of-the-art passive crossbar memories in both\ncomplexity and analog properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2019 00:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Hyungjin", ""], ["Nili", "Hussein", ""], ["Mahmoodi", "Mahmood", ""], ["Strukov", "Dmitri", ""]]}]
