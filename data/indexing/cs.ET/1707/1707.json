However, since physical realizations of\nquantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in\nthis domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional\nmachines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art\nsimulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based\nrepresentation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist\nsolutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to\ntackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states\nand operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit\nredundancies that are actually present. In this work, we revisit the basics of\nquantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum\noperations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated\nin a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation\napproach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as\ngraph-based). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution is\ncapable of simulating quantum computations for more qubits than before, and in\nsignificantly less run-time (several magnitudes faster compared to previously\nproposed simulators). An implementation of the proposed simulator is publicly\navailable online at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 09:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Nov 2017 14:14:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Jun 2018 08:14:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Zulehner", "Alwin", ""], ["Wille", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.04687", "submitter": "Abhronil Sengupta", "authors": "Yong Shim, Shuhan Chen, Abhronil Sengupta, Kaushik Roy", "title": "Stochastic Spin-Orbit Torque Devices as Elements for Bayesian Inference", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Probabilistic inference from real-time input data is becoming increasingly\npopular and may be one of the potential pathways at enabling cognitive\nintelligence.
