To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is\nintroduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible\nfunction. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be\nused as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The\nselected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential\nrepresentation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library\ncontaining seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle\nof length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a\ndecomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent\nfactorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions\ncontain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are\nused in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed\nbased on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.\nThen, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the\nlibrary. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method\nare considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the\nlibrary for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is\nintroduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Apr 2010 08:18:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Saeedi", "Mehdi", ""], ["Sedighi", "Mehdi", ""], ["Zamani", "Morteza Saheb", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1755", "submitter": "Mona Arabzadeh", "authors": "Mona Arabzadeh, Mehdi Saeedi, Morteza Saheb Zamani", "title": "Rule-Based Optimization of Reversible Circuits", "comments": "12 pages, 15 figures, Asia and South Pacific Design Automation\n  Conference, 2010", "journal-ref": "Mona Arabzadeh, Mehdi Saeedi, Morteza Saheb Zamani, \"Rule-Based\n  Optimization of Reversible Circuits,\" The 15th Asia and South Pacific Design\n  Automation Conference (ASPDAC), pp. 849 - 854, 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including\nlow-power design and quantum computation.
