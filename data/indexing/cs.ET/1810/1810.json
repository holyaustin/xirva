The proposed calculation model is\napplied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with\npositive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and\nsummation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction\noperation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to\nimplement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current\nmode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in\ncharging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be\ndesigned without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low\npower consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on\nthe order of G$\\rm \\Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip\nto verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by\npost-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology.

The algorithm\nworks in a distributed manner using only local interactions and computations\nwithout any central control and aids the robots to form the shape in a\ntriangular lattice structure. In case of damage or splitting of the shape, it\nhelps each set of the remaining robots to regenerate and position themselves to\nbuild scaled down versions of the original shape. The paper presents the shapes\nformed and regenerated by the algorithm using the Kilombo simulator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 03:25:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mishra", "Rahul Shivnarayan", ""], ["Semwal", "Tushar", ""], ["Nair", "Shivashankar B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.11948", "submitter": "Caroline Figgatt", "authors": "C.

The ability to execute parallel entangling quantum gates\noffers clear efficiency gains in numerous quantum circuits as well as for\nentire algorithms such as Shor's factoring algorithm and quantum simulations.\nIn cases such as full adders and multiple-control Toffoli gates, parallelism\ncan provide an exponential improvement in overall execution time. More\nimportantly, quantum gate parallelism is essential for the practical\nfault-tolerant error correction of qubits that suffer from idle errors. The\nimplementation of parallel quantum gates is complicated by potential crosstalk,\nespecially between qubits fully connected by a common-mode bus, such as in\nCoulomb-coupled trapped atomic ions or cavity-coupled superconducting\ntransmons. Here, we present the first experimental results for parallel 2-qubit\nentangling gates in an array of fully-connected trapped ion qubits. We\ndemonstrate an application of this capability by performing a 1-bit full\naddition operation on a quantum computer using a depth-4 quantum circuit. These\nresults exploit the power of highly connected qubit systems through classical\ncontrol techniques, and provide an advance toward speeding up quantum circuits\nand achieving fault tolerance with trapped ion quantum computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 04:15:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Figgatt", "C.", ""], ["Ostrander", "A.", ""], ["Linke", "N.

For example, an effective catalytic pathway must\nhave a large barrier when the catalyst is absent. While programming such energy\nbarriers seems to require knowledge of the specific molecular substrate, we\ndevelop a novel substrate-independent approach. We extend the\nrecently-developed model known as thermodynamic binding networks, demonstrating\nprogrammable kinetic barriers that arise solely from the thermodynamic driving\nforces of bond formation and the configurational entropy of forming separate\ncomplexes. Our kinetic model makes relatively weak assumptions, which implies\nthat energy barriers predicted by our model would exist in a wide variety of\nsystems and conditions. We demonstrate that our model is robust by showing that\nseveral variations in its definition result in equivalent energy barriers. We\napply this model to design catalytic systems with an arbitrarily large energy\nbarrier to uncatalyzed reactions. Our results could yield robust amplifiers\nusing DNA strand displacement, a popular technology for engineering synthetic\nreaction pathways, and suggest design strategies for preventing undesired\nkinetic behavior in a variety of molecular systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2018 17:37:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:42:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:49:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Breik", "Keenan", ""], ["Chalk", "Cameron", ""], ["Doty", "David", ""], ["Haley", "David", ""], ["Soloveichik", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.13140", "submitter": "Hikaru Nomura", "authors": "Hikaru Nomura, Taishi Furuta, Kazuki Tsujimoto, Yuki Kuwabiraki,\n  Ferdinand Peper, Eiiti Tamura, Shinji Miwa, Minori Goto, Ryoichi Nakatani and\n  Yoshishige Suzuki", "title": "Reservoir computing with dipole-coupled nanomagnets", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.7567/1347-4065/ab2406", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cond-mat.mes-hall", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The feasibility of reservoir computing based on dipole-coupled nanomagnets is\ndemonstrated using micro-magnetic simulations.
