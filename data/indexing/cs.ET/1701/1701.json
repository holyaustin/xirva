It has turned out that resistive\nswitching devices with a continuous resistance range are potential candidates\nfor such applications. These devices are memristive systems - nonlinear\nresistors with memory. They are fabricated in nanotechnology and hence\nparameter spread during fabrication may aggravate reproducible analyses. This\nissue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.\n  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device\ncan be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena.\nHowever, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for\ninvestigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation\npurposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast\nsimulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced\nelectrical model of a valence change mechanism (VCM) based double barrier\nmemristive device (DBMD) with a continuous resistance range. This device\nconsists of an ultra-thin memristive layer sandwiched between a tunnel barrier\nand a Schottky-contact. The introduced model leads to very fast simulations by\nusing usual circuit simulation tools while maintaining physically meaningful\nparameters.\n  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model and experimental\ndata have been utilized as references to verify the concentrated model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 09:29:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Solan", "Enver", ""], ["Dirkmann", "Sven", ""], ["Hansen", "Mirko", ""], ["Schroeder", "Dietmar", ""], ["Kohlstedt", "Hermann", ""], ["Ziegler", "Martin", ""], ["Mussenbrock", "Thomas", ""], ["Ochs", "Karlheinz", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08208", "submitter": "Akhilesh Jaiswal", "authors": "Akhilesh Jaiswal, Indranil Chakraborty, Kaushik Roy", "title": "Energy-Efficient Memories using Magneto-Electric Switching of\n  Ferromagnets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Voltage driven magneto-electric (ME) switching of ferro-magnets has shown\npotential for future low-energy spintronic memories.
