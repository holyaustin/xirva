The motivation is\nto apply molecular-based communications to challenging electromagnetic\nenvironments. We first derive a novel capture probability expression of a\nfinite sized receiver. The paper then introduces the concept of time-aggregated\nmolecular noise at the receiver as a function of the rate at which the sensor\ncan self-cleanse. The resulting inter-symbol-interference is expressed as a\nfunction of the sensor cleanse time, and the performance metrics of bit error\nrate, throughput and round-trip-time are derived. The results show that the\nperformance is very sensitive to the sensor cleanse time and the drift\nvelocity. The paper concludes with recommendations on the design of a real\ncommunication link based on these findings and applies the concepts to a\ntest-bed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 05:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Siyi", ""], ["Guo", "Weisi", ""], ["Qiu", "Song", ""], ["McDonnell", "Mark D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0296", "submitter": "Mostafizur Rahman", "authors": "Mostafizur Rahman, Pritish Narayanan and Csaba Andras Moritz", "title": "Metal-Gated Junctionless Nanowire Transistors", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Junctionless Nanowire Field-Effect Transistors (JNFETs), where the channel\nregion is uniformly doped without the need for source-channel and drain-channel\njunctions or lateral doping abruptness, are considered an attractive\nalternative to conventional CMOS FETs.
