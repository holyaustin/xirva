We generalize these results to non-binary logic: For any finite\nset $A$, a finite gate set can generate all even permutations of $A^n$ for all\n$n$, without any auxiliary symbols. This directly implies the previously\npublished result that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$\nwhen the cardinality of $A$ is odd, and that one auxiliary symbol is necessary\nand sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of $A$ is even.\nWe also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$\nthat preserve the weight of the input word.

In contrast to previous space-optimized\nimplementations, ours features a purely Toffoli based modular multiplication\ncircuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in O(n^3) and O(n^3\nlog(n)), respectively. We thus achieve the same space and time costs as\nTakahashi et al., while using a purely classical modular multiplication\ncircuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads\noriginating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of\nfaults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware\nimplementation.

An input voltage is applied to a ferroelectric (FE)\nmaterial, in contact with a composite structure - a ferromagnet (FM) with\nin-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) placed on top of an intra-gate FM\ninterconnect with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through the\nmagnetoelectric (ME) effect, the input voltage nucleates a domain wall (DW) at\nthe input end of the PMA-FM interconnect. An applied current then rapidly\npropagates the DW towards the output FE structure, where the inverse-ME effect\ngenerates an output voltage. This voltage is propagated to the input of the\nnext CoMET device using a novel circuit structure that enables efficient device\ncascading. The material parameters for CoMET are optimized by systematically\nexploring the impact of parameter choices on device performance.
