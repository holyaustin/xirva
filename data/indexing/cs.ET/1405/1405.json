Inherent stochasticity in the fabrication\nprocess and nanometer scale of these substrates inevitably lead to design\nvariations, defects, faults, and noise in the resulting devices. A key\nchallenge is how to harness such devices to perform robust computation. We\npropose reservoir computing as a solution. In reservoir computing, computation\ntakes place by translating the dynamics of an excited medium, called a\nreservoir, into a desired output. This approach eliminates the need for\nexternal control and redundancy, and the programming is done using a\nclosed-form regression problem on the output, which also allows concurrent\nprogramming using a single device. Using a theoretical model, we show that both\nregular and irregular reservoirs are intrinsically robust to structural noise\nas they perform computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2014 20:11:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Goudarzi", "Alireza", ""], ["Lakin", "Matthew R.", ""], ["Stefanovic", "Darko", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.0527", "submitter": "Damien Woods", "authors": "Moya Chen, Doris Xin, Damien Woods", "title": "Parallel computation using active self-assembly", "comments": "Journal version to appear in Natural Computing.
