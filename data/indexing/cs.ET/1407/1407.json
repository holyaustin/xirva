Two bidirectional linear reversible circuit\nsynthesis methods are introduced, the Alternating Elimination with Cost\nMinimization method (AECM) and the Multiple CNOT Gate method (MCG). Algorithms,\nexample syntheses, and extensions to these methods are presented. An MCG\nvariant which incorporates line reordering is introduced. Tests comparing the\nnew cost minimization methods with the best known method for large circuits are\npresented. Results show that of the three methods MCG had the lowest average\nCNOT gate counts for linear reversible circuits up to 24 lines, and that AECM\nhad the lowest counts between 28 and 60 lines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 22:12:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Schaeffer", "Ben", ""], ["Perkowski", "Marek", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0632", "submitter": "Piyush Gautam", "authors": "Piyush Gautam", "title": "Development of Tool for Mapping Conventional Circuit to Reversible Logic", "comments": "71 Pages, Dissertation Report. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1403.2686 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the last decades, great achievements have been made in the development of\ncomputing machines.

To understand device physics in depth and to assess\nthe performance limits of SNWTs, simulation is becoming increasingly important.\nThe objectives of this work are: 1) to theoretically explore the essential\nphysics of SNWTs (e.g., electrostatics, transport and band structure) by\nperforming computer-based simulations, and 2) to assess the performance limits\nand scaling potentials of SNWTs and to address the SNWT design issues. The\ncomputer based simulations carried out are essentially based on DFT using NEGF\nformalism. A silicon nanowire has been modeled as PN diode (Zener Diode), PIN\ndiode, PIP & NIN diode configurations by selectively doping the nanowire and\nsimulated by biasing one end of the nanowire to ground and sweeping the other\nend of the nanowire from -1 V to 1 V to obtain the electrical characteristics\nof the respective diodes. In order to determine the effectiveness of the\nmodeled diodes in silicon nanowire, the same diodes have been modeled using a\ngermanium nanowire by selective doping and simulated in the same manner to\nobtain the electrical characteristics of the germanium nanowire based diodes\nwhich has been used as a reference to analyze the characteristics obtained\nusing silicon nanowire. The modeled diodes are extremely small in dimension\nwhen compared to the conventional bulk silicon and germanium based diodes.
