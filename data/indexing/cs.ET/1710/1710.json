A CMOS/spin based weighted array structure is designed to\nimplement a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Device-level simulations based\non precise physics relations are used to validate the sigmoidal relation\nbetween the output probability of a p-bit and its input currents.\nCharacteristics of the resistive networks and p-bits are modeled in SPICE to\nperform a circuit-level simulation investigating the performance, area, and\npower consumption tradeoffs of the weighted array. In the application-level\nsimulation, a DBN is implemented in MATLAB for digit recognition using the\nextracted device and circuit behavioral models. The MNIST data set is used to\nassess the accuracy of the DBN using 5,000 training images for five distinct\nnetwork topologies. The results indicate that a baseline error rate of 36.8%\nfor a 784x10 DBN trained by 100 samples can be reduced to only 3.7% using a\n784x800x800x10 DBN trained by 5,000 input samples. Finally, Power dissipation\nand accuracy tradeoffs for probabilistic computing mechanisms using resistive\ndevices are identified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Sep 2017 19:23:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2018 22:08:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zand", "Ramtin", ""], ["Camsari", "Kerem Yunus", ""], ["Pyle", "Steven D.", ""], ["Ahmed", "Ibrahim", ""], ["Kim", "Chris H.", ""], ["DeMara", "Ronald F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01056", "submitter": "Tianshi Wang", "authors": "Tianshi Wang", "title": "Achieving Phase-based Logic Bit Storage in Mechanical Metronomes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, oscillator-based Boolean computation has been proposed for its\npotentials in noise immunity and energy efficiency.
