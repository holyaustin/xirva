We give a very brief\nintroduction for the methods used in search engine first. Then how to build a\nDNA search system like Google is illustrated in detail. Since there is no local\nalignment process, this system is able to provide the ms level search services\nfor billions of DNA sequences in a typical server.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 16:41:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 07:25:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2010 02:49:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 02:20:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Liang", "Wang", ""], ["Bo", "Fang", ""]]}]
