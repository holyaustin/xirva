While first commercial prototypes have become\navailable, the performance of such machines in practical application is still\nsubject to exploration. Quantum computers will not entirely replace classical\nmachines, but serve as accelerators for specific problems. This necessitates\nintegrating quantum computational primitives into existing applications.\n  In this paper, we perform a case study on how to augment existing software\nwith quantum computational primitives for the Boolean satisfiability problem\n(SAT) implemented using a quantum annealer (QA). We discuss relevant quality\nmeasures for quantum components, and show that mathematically equivalent, but\nstructurally different ways of transforming SAT to a QA can lead to substantial\ndifferences regarding these qualities. We argue that engineers need to be aware\nthat (and which) details, although they may be less relevant in traditional\nsoftware engineering, require considerable attention in quantum computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 May 2020 22:20:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kr\u00fcger", "Tom", ""], ["Mauerer", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.05832", "submitter": "Eduardo R.
