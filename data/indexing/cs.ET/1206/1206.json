As an illustration of our method\nwe implemented this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used\nquantum logical operations into elementary gates in the Clifford+T set. In\nparticular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of\nClifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby\nproviding a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the\nToffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the algorithm is only\npractical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the number of\ngates in an optimal implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 20:35:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Aug 2012 20:28:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 17:39:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Amy", "Matthew", ""], ["Maslov", "Dmitri", ""], ["Mosca", "Michele", ""], ["Roetteler", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.2534", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "R.
