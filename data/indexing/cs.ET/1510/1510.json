Here, we overcome this difficulty by\nproposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections\nliterally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.\nThis is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering\nof coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of\nclassification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,\nthe experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the\ncorresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for\napplications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.\nWe discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,\nspeed, memory consumption and different problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2015 15:54:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 11:19:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Saade", "Alaa", ""], ["Caltagirone", "Francesco", ""], ["Carron", "Igor", ""], ["Daudet", "Laurent", ""], ["Dr\u00e9meau", "Ang\u00e9lique", ""], ["Gigan", "Sylvain", ""], ["Krzakala", "Florent", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.07252", "submitter": "Murat Kuscu", "authors": "M.

MC\nhas been extensively studied from various aspects in the literature; however,\nthe physical design of MC transceiving units is largely neglected with the\nassumption that network nodes are entirely biological devices, e.g., engineered\nbacteria, which are intrinsically capable of receiving and transmitting\nmolecular messages. However, the low information processing capacity of\nbiological devices and the challenge to interface them with macroscale networks\nhinder the true application potential of nanonetworks. To overcome this\nproblem, recently, we proposed a nanobioelectronic MC receiver architecture\nexploiting the nanoscale field effect transistor-based biosensor (bioFET)\ntechnology, which provides noninvasive and sensitive molecular detection while\nproducing electrical signals as the output. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomprehensive model for silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receivers by\nintegrating the underlying processes in MC and bioFET to provide a unified\nanalysis framework. We derive closed-form expressions for noise statistics,\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver output, and symbol error\nprobability (SEP). Performance evaluation in terms of SNR and SEP reveals the\neffects of individual system parameters on the detection performance of the\nproposed MC receiver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 14:32:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 18:53:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 13:59:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kuscu", "M.", ""], ["Akan", "O.

In particular, the\ntransmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for\nmodulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in\nnatural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are\npore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be\ncontrolled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on\nion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are\nreleased from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.\nExploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying\nmodulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,\ni.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is\nderived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a\nclosed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is\nobtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released\nmolecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal\nis compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical\nresults show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion\nchannels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 09:13:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 12:49:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 04:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Arjmandi", "Hamidreza", ""], ["Ahmadzadeh", "Arman", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Kenari", "Masoumeh Nasiri", ""]]}]
