In this paper, we describe methods for\nestimating harvested energy from acceleration traces. To characterize the\nenergy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing,\nwalking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based\non acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study\nenergy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also\nbriefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy\nallocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design\nconsiderations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements.\nOur observations provide insights into the design of motion energy harvesters,\nIoT nodes, and energy harvesting adaptive algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 22:40:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 20:49:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2014 22:34:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Gorlatova", "Maria", ""], ["Sarik", "John", ""], ["Grebla", "Guy", ""], ["Cong", "Mina", ""], ["Kymissis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Zussman", "Gil", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.1251", "submitter": "Sukanta Bhattacharjee", "authors": "Sukanta Bhattacharjee, Ansuman Banerjee, Tsung-Yi Ho, Krishnendu\n  Chakrabarty, and Bhargab B.
