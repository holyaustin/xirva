By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of\nthe current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of\nthe output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation\ncurrent is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted\ntransistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit\nlow-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the\narea of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented\nin AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of\nabout 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the\nanodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor\ncan be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed\nsystem suitable for a large number of channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 09:10:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ngamkham", "W.", ""], ["van Dongen", "M.
