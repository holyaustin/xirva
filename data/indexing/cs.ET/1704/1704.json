Co-design of the antenna and the electronics\nis explored to boost the power conversion efficiency of the RF-DC converter. As\na proof of principle, a charge pump rectifier is designed, and its measurement\nresults are presented. To boost the rectifier output voltage, a DC-DC converter\nthat employs maximum power point tracking has been designed. A prototype\ncircuit is also presented that can accommodate an input power level range of 1\n{\\mu}W to 1 mW and offers peak efficiencies of 76.3% and 82% at 1 {\\mu}W and 1\nmW, respectively. The co-design principle is also used at the receiver side\nwhere the antenna-electronics interface is optimized. It is shown how this\ntechnique allows improving the noise figure of the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)\nwithout sacrificing power consumption. As a low power alternative to\nnarrow-band wireless transmission, sub-GHz ultra-wideband is proposed. As a\nproof of principle, the design of a novel low-power sub-GHz\nUltra-Wide-Bandwidth (UWB) transmitter which consumes only 0.28 mW is\npresented. Its working principle is verified by means of circuit simulations\nand measurements. The low power nature of the transmitter and receiver\nprinciples, combined with the power efficient RF-DC converter paves the way\ntowards the continuous operation of a WSN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:02:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Feb 2018 13:47:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Martins", "G.
