Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for\nvarious metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space\nrequired to implement a given function reversibly. However, little effort has\nbeen spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular\nimportance in quantum computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to\nhardware, but also the estimation of resources required to implement a given\nquantum algorithm, a process that is crucial for identifying which algorithms\nwill outperform their classical counterparts. We present a reversible circuit\ncompiler called ReVerC, which has been formally verified in F* and compiles\ncircuits that operate correctly with respect to the input program. Our compiler\ncompiles the Revs language to combinational reversible circuits with as few\nancillary bits as possible, and provably cleans temporary values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 21:17:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 18:47:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Amy", "Matthew", ""], ["Roetteler", "Martin", ""], ["Svore", "Krysta", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.01819", "submitter": "Reza Mosayebi", "authors": "Reza Mosayebi, Amin Gohari, Mahtab Mirmohseni, and Masoumeh Nasiri\n  Kenari", "title": "Type Based Sign Modulation and its Application for ISI mitigation in\n  Molecular Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.ET math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An important challenge in design of modulation schemes for molecular\ncommunication is positivity of the transmission signal (only a positive\nconcentration of molecules can be released in the environment).

This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic\ngate (TLG). A TLG with $n$ inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of\n$n$ variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is\none if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs\nequals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of\na TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex\nlogic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented\nusing conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that\nsubset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the\ninput transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some\ninputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high $V_t$.\nThe threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low $V_t$ to\nincrease their transconductance. The function of a TLG is not determined by the\ncell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes\nit possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing\nsome variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of\nhigh and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell\nlibrary of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize\ncomplex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse\nengineering.
