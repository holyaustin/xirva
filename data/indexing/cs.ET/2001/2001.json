Key\nmemristor properties include a suitable non-volatile resistance range,\ncontinuous linear resistance modulation and symmetric switching. In this work,\nwe demonstrate voltage-controlled, symmetric and analog potentiation and\ndepression of a ferroelectric Hf$_{57}$Zr$_{43}$O$_{2}$ (HZO) field effect\ntransistor (FeFET) with good linearity. Our FeFET operates with a low writing\nenergy (fJ) and fast programming time (40 ns). Retention measurements have been\ndone over 4-bits depth with low noise (1%) in the tungsten oxide (WO$_{x}$)\nread out channel. By adjusting the channel thickness from 15nm to 8nm, the\non/off ratio of the FeFET can be engineered from 1% to 200% with an\non-resistance ideally >100 kOhm, depending on the channel geometry. The device\nconcept is using earth-abundant materials, and is compatible with a back end of\nline (BEOL) integration into complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)\nprocesses. It has therefore a great potential for the fabrication of high\ndensity, large-scale integrated arrays of artificial analog synapses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2020 18:54:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Halter", "Mattia", ""], ["B\u00e9gon-Lours", "Laura", ""], ["Bragaglia", "Valeria", ""], ["Sousa", "Marilyne", ""], ["Offrein", "Bert Jan", ""], ["Abel", "Stefan", ""], ["Luisier", "Mathieu", ""], ["Fompeyriney", "Jean", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.06887", "submitter": "Yu Zhang", "authors": "Yu Zhang and Haowei Deng and Quanxi Li", "title": "Context-Sensitive and Duration-Aware Qubit Mapping for Various NISQ\n  Devices", "comments": "9 pages,5 figures, 2 tables.

Quantum programs written by\nprogrammers could hardly run on real hardware directly since two-qubit gates\nare usually allowed on few pairs of qubits.

Our work evaluates the feasibility of\nusing the D-Wave as a sampler for machine learning. We describe a hybrid system\nthat combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum\nannealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our\nhybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST\nFashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream\nclassification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated\nsamples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit\nD-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate\ntypical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and\nsamples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these\nlimitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression\nfactor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a\nlossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how\ngenerating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28\nimages that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed\nto recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification\nproblem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a\nquantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an\nMNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as\nan MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder\napproach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current\nRBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even\nmore promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 16:44:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sleeman", "Jennifer", ""], ["Dorband", "John", ""], ["Halem", "Milton", ""]]}]
