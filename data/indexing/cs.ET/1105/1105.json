So yes, in a\ncomputational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely\nremoves this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),\nthen the computational \"power\" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing\nuniversal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \\times N$ squares)\nbecomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only\nTuring universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \\times N$\nsquares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,\nSchweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical \"power\" of a\nseemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which\n(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single\nnegative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact. We call these\nthe \\emph{restricted glue} TASs (rgTAS). We first show the tile complexity of\nproducing an $N \\times N$ square with an rgTAS is $O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log\nn})$. We also prove that rgTASs are Turing universal with a construction that\nsimulates an arbitrary Turing machine. Next, we provide results for a variation\nof the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except\nthat the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\\ge\n1$. These results consist of a construction with $O(\\log n)$ tile complexity\nfor building $N \\times N$ squares, and one which simulates a Turing machine but\nwith a greater scaling factor than for the rgTAS construction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2011 02:45:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 19:28:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Patitz", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert T.", ""], ["Summers", "Scott M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1424", "submitter": "Maurice Margenstern", "authors": "Maurice Margenstern and Pascal Mayer and Sergey Verlan", "title": "DNA Circuits Based on Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA\n  Amplification", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension\nDNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining\nthe advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement\namplification (SDA).

In this context,\na human user equipped with his/her own mobile devices, can be though of as a\ndigital organism (DO), a subsystem characterized by a set of peculiar features\nand resources it can offer to the rest of the ecosystem for use from its peer\nDOs. The internal organization of the DO must address issues of management of\nits own resources, including power consumption. Inside the DO and among DOs,\npeer-to-peer interaction mechanisms can be conveniently deployed to favor\nresource sharing and data dissemination. Throughout this paper, we show that\nmost of the solutions and technologies needed to construct a digital ecosystem\nare already available. What is still missing is a framework (i.e., mechanisms,\nprotocols, services) that can support effectively the integration and\ncooperation of these technologies. In addition, in the following we show that\nthat framework can be implemented as a middleware subsystem that enables novel\nand ubiquitous forms of computation and communication. Finally, in order to\nillustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce some experimental\nresults we have obtained from preliminary implementations of (parts of) that\nsubsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 13:02:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 09:07:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:24:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angelo", "Gabriele", ""], ["Ferretti", "Stefano", ""], ["Ghini", "Vittorio", ""], ["Panzieri", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.4927", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "Jan Halamek, Vera Bocharova, Mary A.
