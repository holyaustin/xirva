The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they\ncreated. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that\ncontributors can trust is also necessary. DataBright thus merges both a data\nmarket and a trusted computation market.\n  We illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI\nmarket, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its\ncreator. DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their\ncontribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is\ngiven by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the\nDataBright computation market.

First, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art\ndelay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible to evasion through delay\nmanipulations, which involve both increasing and decreasing the Internet delays\nthat are observed between a client and a remote measuring party. We then\npropose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify\nan assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic\nregion. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted\nlocation are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between\nthemselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays\nand thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between\neach verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance\ninference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise\na novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and\nthe three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client\ncould manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We\nevaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients\n(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired\nand wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab\ntestbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such\nas the client's geographical nearness to the verifiers. For wireless\nevaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired\nclients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile\nwireless link.

A typical example is prime factorization\nthat may be solved in polynomial time by exploiting quantum entanglement on a\nquantum computer.

In this perspective we discuss how to employ one such property,\nmemory (time non-locality), in a novel physics-based approach to computation:\nMemcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)\nthat are scalable. DMMs can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with\nmemory. The latter property allows the realization of a new type of Boolean\nlogic, one that is self-organizing. Self-organizing logic gates are\n\"terminal-agnostic\", namely they do not distinguish between input and output\nterminals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given\ncombinatorial/optimization problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit\nconverges to the equilibrium points that express the solutions of the problem\nat hand. In doing so, DMMs take advantage of the long-range order that develops\nduring the transient dynamics. This collective dynamical behavior, reminiscent\nof a phase transition, or even the \"edge of chaos\", is mediated by families of\nclassical trajectories (instantons) that connect critical points of increasing\nstability in the system's phase space. The topological character of the\nsolution search renders DMMs robust against noise and structural disorder.\nSince DMMs are non-quantum systems described by ordinary differential\nequations, not only can they be built in hardware with available technology,\nthey can also be simulated efficiently on modern classical computers.

By applying\nappropriate analog voltages to the read-ports of the 8T SRAM array, and sensing\nthe output current, an approximate analog-digital dot-product engine can be\nimplemented. We present two different configurations for enabling multi-bit dot\nproduct computations in the 8T SRAM cell array, without modifying the standard\nbit-cell structure. Since our proposal preserves the standard 8T-SRAM array\nstructure, it can be used as a storage element with standard read-write\ninstructions, and also as an on-demand analog-like dot product accelerator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:35:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:17:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jaiswal", "Akhilesh", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Indranil", ""], ["Agrawal", "Amogh", ""], ["Roy", "Kaushik", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.09705", "submitter": "Fan Yang", "authors": "Fan Yang, Shining Li, Zhe Yang, Tao Gu and Cheng Qian", "title": "Enabling Multiple Access for Non-Line-of-Sight Light-to-Camera\n  Communications", "comments": "12 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMC.2018.2880442", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.NI eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Light-to-Camera Communications (LCC) have emerged as a new wireless\ncommunication technology with great potential to benefit a broad range of\napplications. However, the existing LCC systems either require cameras directly\nfacing to the lights or can only communicate over a single link, resulting in\nlow throughputs and being fragile to ambient illuminant interference. We\npresent HYCACO, a novel LCC system, which enables multiple light emitting\ndiodes (LEDs) with an unaltered camera to communicate via the non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) links. Different from other NLoS LCC systems, the proposed scheme is\nresilient to the complex indoor luminous environment. HYCACO can decode the\nmessages by exploring the mixed reflected optical signals transmitted from\nmultiple LEDs. By further exploiting the rolling shutter mechanism, we present\nthe optimal optical frequencies and camera exposure duration selection strategy\nto achieve the best performance. We built a hardware prototype to demonstrate\nthe efficiency of the proposed scheme under different application scenarios.\nThe experimental results show that the system throughput reaches 4.5 kbps on\niPhone 6s with three transmitters. With the robustness, improved system\nthroughput and ease of use, HYCACO has great potentials to be used in a wide\nrange of applications such as advertising, tagging objects, and device\ncertifications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 03:31:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2018 16:38:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Fan", ""], ["Li", "Shining", ""], ["Yang", "Zhe", ""], ["Gu", "Tao", ""], ["Qian", "Cheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10023", "submitter": "Simone Gaiarin", "authors": "Simone Gaiarin, Auro Michele Perego, Edson Porto da Silva, Francesco\n  Da Ros, Darko Zibar", "title": "Dual polarization nonlinear Fourier transform-based optical\n  communication system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1364/OPTICA.5.000263", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  New services and applications are causing an exponential increase in internet\ntraffic.

Capacitively driven wire has\nrecently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of global\ninterconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect\nby using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional\nvoltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary\nto use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at\nthe receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization\nreversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low\nvoltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we\npropose an ME effect based receiver that uses the low voltage at the receiving\nend of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet is also used as\nthe free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is\ntuned through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full\nswing binary signals by using simple digital components. This process allows\ncapacitive low swing interconnection without differential signaling or\namplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency. Our simulation\nresults indicate that for 5-10 mm long global wires in IBM 45 nm technology,\ncapacitive ME design consumes 3x lower energy compared to full-swing CMOS\ndesign and 2x lower energy compared to differential amplifier based low-swing\ncapacitive CMOS design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:24:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Azim", "Zubair Al", ""], ["Jaiswal", "Akhilesh", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Indranil", ""], ["Roy", "Kaushik", ""]]}]
