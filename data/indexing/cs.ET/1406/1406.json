The\norganism forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected food stuffs,\nthis foraging behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and\nchemotaxis. The electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a\nperistaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen;\nthe frequency of this oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth.\nExternal stimuli such as light and food cause changes in the oscillation\nfrequency. We demonstrate that using these stimuli as logical inputs we can\napproximate logic gates using these tubes and derive combinational logic\ncircuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis providing the output of\neach gate and determining the input of the following gate. Basic gates OR, AND\nand NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time respectively. Derived\nlogic circuits XOR, Half Adder and Full Adder were 70.8%, 65% and 58.8%\naccurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as the\nnumber of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous\nlogic approximations using spatial growth of Physarum polycephalum and up to 30\ntimes as fast at computing the logical output. The results shown here\ndemonstrate a significant advancement in organism-based computing, providing a\nsolid basis for hybrid computers of the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 19:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Whiting", "James G.

We study\nboth numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be\nreplaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by\na sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy\nto generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives\nperformance worse than state of the art.

In our proposal, the receiver, acting\nas a control node, sends a connection setup signal to the transmitter, which\nstokes molecules, to start molecule transmission. The molecules transmitted by\nthe transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver\nthrough its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of\nmolecules, it releases a tear-down signal to notify the transmitter to stop the\ntransmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by\nusing a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the\nproposed protocol is connection-oriented, and uses the TCP-like probing to find\na suitable transmission rate between transmitter and receiver so as to avoid\nreceiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not\nused, since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large\ndelay, a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed\nprotocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the\nreceiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit\nnegative feedbacks. We also present the results of an extensive simulation\ncampaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the\nmain protocol parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:15:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Felicetti", "Luca", ""], ["Femminella", "Mauro", ""], ["Reali", "Gianluca", ""], ["Nakano", "Tadashi", ""], ["Vasilakos", "Athanasios V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.5179", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "Laszlo B.
