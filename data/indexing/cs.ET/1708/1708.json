There are three constraints that have to be satisfied: the order or\ndependency of the quantum gates in the specific algorithm, the fact that any\nqubit may be involved in at most one gate at a time, and the restriction that\ntwo-qubit gates are implementable only between connected qubits. The last\naspect implies that the compilation depends not only on the algorithm, but also\non hardware properties like connectivity. Here we suggest a two-step approach\nin which logical gates are initially scheduled neglecting connectivity\nconsiderations, while routing operations are added at a later step in a way\nthat minimizes their overhead. We rephrase the subtasks of gate scheduling in\nterms of graph problems like edge-coloring and maximum subgraph isomorphism.\nWhile this approach is general, we specialize to a one dimensional array of\nqubits to propose a routing scheme that is minimal in the number of exchange\noperations. As a practical application, we schedule the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm in a linear geometry and quantify the reduction in the\nnumber of gates and circuit depth that results from increasing the efficacy of\nthe scheduling strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:08:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2018 18:39:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Guerreschi", "Gian Giacomo", ""], ["Park", "Jongsoo", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.00306", "submitter": "Rasha Montaser", "authors": "Rasha Montaser, Ahmed Younes, Mahmoud Abdel-Aty", "title": "New Design of Reversible Full Adder/Subtractor using $R$ gate", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10773-018-3921-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computers require quantum processors.

By\nemploying one such realization, we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit\nelementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons are classical\ntrajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and\nconnect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear\nanalysis at those points, we show that these instantons connect the initial\ncritical point of the dynamics, with at least one unstable direction, directly\nto the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these gates\nonly affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution.\nFinally, we demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential\nequations, that since instantons connect critical points, noise and\nperturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space, but not\nthe initial and final critical points.
