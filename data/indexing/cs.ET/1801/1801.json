The demand for data will continue to grow as smart gadgets\nmultiply and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives.\nNext-generation industries in artificial intelligence services and\nhigh-performance computing are so far supported by microelectronic platforms.\nThese data-intensive enterprises rely on continual improvements in hardware.\nTheir prospects are running up against a stark reality: conventional\none-size-fits-all solutions offered by digital electronics can no longer\nsatisfy this need, as Moore's law (exponential hardware scaling),\ninterconnection density, and the von Neumann architecture reach their limits.\n  With its superior speed and reconfigurability, analog photonics can provide\nsome relief to these problems; however, complex applications of analog\nphotonics have remained largely unexplored due to the absence of a robust\nphotonic integration industry. Recently, the landscape for\ncommercially-manufacturable photonic chips has been changing rapidly and now\npromises to achieve economies of scale previously enjoyed solely by\nmicroelectronics.\n  The scientific community has set out to build bridges between the domains of\nphotonic device physics and neural networks, giving rise to the field of\n\\emph{neuromorphic photonics}. This article reviews the recent progress in\nintegrated neuromorphic photonics. We provide an overview of neuromorphic\ncomputing, discuss the associated technology (microelectronic and photonic)\nplatforms and compare their metric performance.

The paper will give an overview of\nthe neuromorphic computing platform at the KIP and the associated hardware\nrequirements which drove the described technological developments. In the first\nphase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level\npackaging were adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on\n200mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring reticles were interconnected across the scribe\nlines with an 8{\\mu}m pitch routing based on semi-additive copper\nmetallization. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene was used to\nenable a second intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads with flash gold were\ngenerated on top of each reticle. With that concept neuromorphic systems based\non full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated high density\ninter-reticle routing revealed a very high yield of larger than 99.9%. In order\nto allow an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with\nfeasible effort a full wafer embedding concept for printed circuit boards was\ndeveloped and proven in the second phase of the project. The wafers were\nthinned to 250{\\mu}m and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper\nfoils into a core material. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs\nof the embedded wafer were accessed by micro via drilling, copper\nelectroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of the PCB wiring\nstructure. The created wiring with 50um line width enabled an access of the\nreticle IOs on the embedded wafer as well as a board level routing. The panels\nwith the embedded wafers were subsequently stressed with up to 1000 thermal\ncycles between 0C and 100C and have shown no severe failure formation over the\ncycle time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 10:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zoschke", "Kai", ""], ["G\u00fcttler", "Maurice", ""], ["B\u00f6ttcher", "Lars", ""], ["Gr\u00fcbl", "Andreas", ""], ["Husmann", "Dan", ""], ["Schemmel", "Johannes", ""], ["Meier", "Karlheinz", ""], ["Ehrmann", "Oswin", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04774", "submitter": "Alberto Giaretta", "authors": "Federico Tavella, Alberto Giaretta, Triona Marie Dooley-Cullinane,\n  Mauro Conti, Lee Coffey, Sasitharan Balasubramaniam", "title": "DNA Molecular Storage System: Transferring Digitally Encoded Information\n  through Bacterial Nanonetworks", "comments": "22 pages, 13 figures; removed wrong venue references, reordered\n  bibliography accordingly to ACM guidelines", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 2019", "doi": "10.1109/TETC.2019.2932685", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Since the birth of computer and networks, fuelled by pervasive computing and\nubiquitous connectivity, the amount of data stored and transmitted has\nexponentially grown through the years.
