Non-classical\ncomputation has tended to consider only single computational models: neural,\nanalog, quantum, chemical, biological, neglecting to account for the\ncontribution from the experimental controls. In this position paper, we propose\na framework suitable for analysing combined computational models, from abstract\ntheory to practical programming tools. Focusing on the simplest example of one\nsystem controlled by another through a sequence of operations in which only one\nsystem is active at a time, the output from one system becomes the input to the\nother for the next step, and vice versa. We outline the categorical machinery\nrequired for handling diverse computational systems in such combinations, with\ntheir interactions explicitly accounted for. Drawing on prior work in\nrefinement and retrenchment, we suggest an appropriate framework for developing\nprogramming tools from the categorical framework. We place this work in the\ncontext of two contrasting concepts of \"efficiency\": theoretical comparisons to\ndetermine the relative computational power do not always reflect the practical\ncomparison of real resources for a finite-sized computational task, especially\nwhen the inputs include (approximations of) real numbers.
