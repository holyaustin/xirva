The gesture - taking a selfie - has become part of the\nlifestyle of mobile phone users worldwide, including non-technology-savvy ones.\nThe metaphor likens computing two visual shares of the selfie to ripping a\nbanknote in two, a technique used for decades for delayed payment in cash-only\nmarkets. PGS is designed to work with devices with limited computational power\nand when connectivity is patchy or not always available. Thanks to visual\ncryptography techniques PGS uses for computing the shares, the original selfie\ncan be recomposed simply by stacking the shares, preserving the analogy with\nre-joining the two parts of the banknote.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:26:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Damiani", "Ernesto", ""], ["Houngbo", "Perpetus Jacques", ""], ["Asal", "Rasool", ""], ["Cimato", "Stelvio", ""], ["Frati", "Fulvio", ""], ["Honsou", "Joel T.", ""], ["Shehada", "Dina", ""], ["Yeun", "Chan Yeob", ""]]}]
