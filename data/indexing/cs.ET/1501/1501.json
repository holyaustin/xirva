The operation\nscheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum\nphysical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the\nscheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution\ndue to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation\nscheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions\ninfluence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between\npredecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.\nThe proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies\nby applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum\ndata flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the\nquantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified\nforce-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and\nquantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven\ninstruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while\nmaking iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct\nscheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step\nthat finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to\nthe quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single\nbest ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of\ndifferent FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using\ninformation about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of\nthe target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 02:25:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Goudarzi", "Hadi", ""], ["Dousti", "Mohammad Javad", ""], ["Shafaei", "Alireza", ""], ["Pedram", "Massoud", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.03024", "submitter": "Quentin Vinckier", "authors": "Quentin Vinckier, Fran\\c{c}ois Duport, Anteo Smerieri, Kristof\n  Vandoorne, Peter Bienstman, Marc Haelterman and Serge Massar", "title": "High performance photonic reservoir computer based on a coherently\n  driven passive cavity", "comments": "none", "journal-ref": "Optica 2, Issue 5, pp. 438-446 (2015)", "doi": "10.1364/OPTICA.2.000438", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reservoir computing is a recent bio-inspired approach for processing\ntime-dependent signals.
