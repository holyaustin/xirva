In this discourse, we use the tools of\nmolecular biology to demonstrate the theoretical encoding of Strassen's fast\nmatrix multiplication algorithm with DNA based on an $n$-moduli set in the\nresidue number system, thereby demonstrating the viability of computational\nmathematics with DNA. As a result, a general scalable implementation of this\nmodel in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the\napplication of \\emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA\ncomputer. We also discuss the practical capabilities and issues of this\nscalable implementation. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are\nimportant because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other\nalgorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) with DNA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2009 23:04:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Sep 2010 16:43:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 15:44:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 28 May 2011 16:25:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 04:17:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Nayebi", "Aran", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3912", "submitter": "Hector J.

Recent proposals suggest using Ising spin-glasses for\nnon-traditional computing as a way to harness the nature's ability to find\nmin-energy configurations, and to take advantage of quantum tunneling to boost\ncombinatorial optimization. Laboratory demonstrations have been unconvincing so\nfar and lack a non-quantum baseline for definitive comparisons. In this work we\n(i) design and evaluate new computational techniques to simulate natural energy\nminimization in spin glasses and (ii) explore their application to study design\nalternatives in quantum adiabatic computers. Unlike previous work, our\nalgorithms are not limited to planar Ising topologies. In one CPU-day, our\nbranch-and-bound algorithm finds ground states on 100 spins, while our local\nsearch approximates ground states on 1, 000, 000 spins. We use this\ncomputational tool as a simulator to study the significance of hyper-couplings\nin the context of recently implemented adiabatic quantum computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Dec 2009 17:46:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 17:18:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Jun 2013 19:38:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia", "Hector J.", ""], ["Markov", "Igor L.", ""]]}]
