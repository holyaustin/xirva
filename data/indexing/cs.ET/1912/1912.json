Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to\ntransmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller.\nThe fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main\nlimiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large\narray of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate\nadditional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively\ncontrol the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and\nthus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase\ncontrol, combined with the conventional transmission control, can potentially\nbring performance gain compared to wireless networks without IRS. In this\nsurvey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of\nits reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless\ncommunications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical\napproaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless\nnetworks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of\nthe IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different\nnetwork design problems, e.g.,~rate maximization and power minimization\nproblems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless\nnetworks to some emerging use cases. Finally, we highlight important practical\nchallenges and future research directions for realizing IRS-assisted wireless\nnetworks in beyond 5G communications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 02:54:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2020 04:09:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Shimin", ""], ["Lu", "Xiao", ""], ["Hoang", "Dinh Thai", ""], ["Niyato", "Dusit", ""], ["Shu", "Lei", ""], ["Kim", "Dong In", ""], ["Liang", "Ying-Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.07821", "submitter": "Sandeep Krishna Thirumala", "authors": "Sandeep Thirumala, Yi-Tse Hung, Shubham Jain, Arnab Raha, Niharika\n  Thakuria, Vijay Raghunathan, Anand Raghunathan, Zhihong Chen and Sumeet Gupta", "title": "Valley-Coupled-Spintronic Non-Volatile Memories with Compute-In-Memory\n  Support", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TNANO.2020.3012550", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET physics.app-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we propose valley-coupled spin-hall memories (VSH-MRAMs) based\non monolayer WSe2.

Each neuron is required to exhibit a\ndirectionally dependent response to propagating optical signals, with the\nbackwards response conditioned on the forward signal, which is highly\nnon-trivial to implement optically. We propose a practical and surprisingly\nsimple solution that uses saturable absorption to provide the network\nnonlinearity. We find that the backward propagating gradients required to train\nthe network can be approximated in a pump-probe scheme that requires only\npassive optical elements. Simulations show that, with readily obtainable\noptical depths, our approach can achieve equivalent performance to\nstate-of-the-art computational networks on image classification benchmarks,\neven in deep networks with multiple sequential gradient approximations. This\nscheme is compatible with leading optical neural network proposals and\ntherefore provides a feasible path towards end-to-end optical training.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Dec 2019 10:14:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:38:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2020 15:47:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Xianxin", ""], ["Barrett", "Thomas D.", ""], ["Wang", "Zhiming M.", ""], ["Lvovsky", "A.
