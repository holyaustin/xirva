It was found through a combination of imaging techniques and\nelectrophysiological measurements that P. polycephalum is able to internalise a\nrange of electrically active nanoparticles, assemble them in vivo and\ndistribute them around the plasmodium. Hybridised plasmodium is able to form\nbiomorphic mineralised networks, both inside the living plasmodium and the\nempty trails left in its wake by taxis, both of which facilitate the\ntransmission of electricity. Hybridisation also alters the bioelectrical\nactivity of the plasmodium and likely influences its information processing\ncapabilities. It was concluded that hybridised slime mould is a suitable\nsubstrate for producing functional unconventional computing devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Nov 2013 15:18:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mayne", "Richard", ""], ["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.5843", "submitter": "Bartlomiej Placzek", "authors": "Bart{\\l}omiej P{\\l}aczek", "title": "A traffic model based on fuzzy cellular automata", "comments": "23 pages, 11 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1112.4631", "journal-ref": "P{\\l}aczek B.: A traffic model based on fuzzy cellular automata.\n  Journal of Cellular Automata, vol. 8, no. 3-4, pp. 261-282 (2013)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cellular automata (CA) play an important role in the development of\ncomputationally efficient microscopic traffic models and recently have gained\nconsiderable importance as a mean of optimising traffic control strategies.\nHowever, real-time application of the available CA models in traffic control\nsystems is a difficult task due to their discrete and stochastic nature. This\npaper introduces a novel method for simulation of signalised traffic streams,\nwhich combines CA and fuzzy numbers. The introduced traffic simulation\nalgorithm eliminates main drawbacks of the CA approach, i.e. necessity of\nmultiple Monte Carlo simulations and calibration issues. Computational cost of\ntraffic simulation for the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the\ncost of simulation based on stochastic CA. Thus, the simulation results can be\nobtained in a much shorter time. Experiments confirmed that the simulation\nresults for the introduced algorithm are consistent with that observed for\nstochastic CA.
