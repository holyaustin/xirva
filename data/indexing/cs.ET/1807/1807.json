Its building blocks can be fabricated in hardware with standard\nelectronic circuits, thus offering a path to its practical realization. In\naddition, since memcomputing is based on non-quantum elements, the equations of\nmotion describing these machines can be simulated efficiently on standard\ncomputers. In fact, it was recently realized that memcomputing, and in\nparticular its digital (hence scalable) version, when simulated on a classical\nmachine provides a significant speed-up over state-of-the-art algorithms on a\nvariety of non-convex problems. Here, we stress-test the capabilities of this\napproach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization\nproblems. These fall into a class which is known to require exponentially\ngrowing resources in the worst cases, even to generate approximations. We\nrecently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate\nthis exponential growth, simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed\nusing the Falcon$^\\copyright$ simulator of MemComputing, Inc. only require time\nand memory resources that scale linearly. These results are extended in a\nstress-test up to $64\\times10^6$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion\nliterals), namely the largest case that we could fit on a single node with 128\nGB of DRAM.

Indeed, a major landmark that enables\nefficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from\nthe machine learning community that have demonstrated aggressively scaled deep\nbinary networks with state-of-the-art accuracies. In this paper, we demonstrate\nhow deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von-Neumann machines by\nenabling binary convolutions within the SRAM array. In general, binary\nconvolutions consist of bit-wise XNOR followed by a population-count\n(popcount). We present a charge sharing XNOR and popcount operation in 10\ntransistor SRAM cells. We have employed multiple circuit techniques including\ndual-read-worldines (Dual-RWL) along with a dual-stage ADC that overcomes the\ninaccuracies of a low precision ADC, to achieve a fairly accurate popcount. In\naddition, a key highlight of the present work is the fact that we propose\nsectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby\nachieving improved parallelism. This is beneficial for deep networks, where the\nkernel size grows and requires to be stored in multiple sub-banks. As such, one\nneeds to evaluate the partial popcount from multiple sub-banks and sum them up\nfor achieving the final popcount. For n-sections per sub-array, we can perform\nn convolutions within one particular sub-bank, thereby improving overall system\nthroughput as well as the energy efficiency. Our results at the array level\nshow that the energy consumption and delay per-operation was 1.914pJ and 45ns,\nrespectively.

Remarkably, the computation of higher moments of\nthe voltage manifest purely quantum features related to the circuit zero-point\nenergy. Finally, we study the implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley quantum\nmemristor as an asymmetric rf SQUID in superconducting circuits. This study may\nallow the construction of quantum neuron networks inspired in the brain\nfunction, as well as the design of neuromorphic quantum architectures for\nquantum machine learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2018 15:48:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:14:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:08:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2019 14:19:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gonzalez-Raya", "Tasio", ""], ["Cheng", "Xiao-Hang", ""], ["Egusquiza", "I\u00f1igo L.", ""], ["Chen", "Xi", ""], ["Sanz", "Mikel", ""], ["Solano", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.10749", "submitter": "Sergio Boixo", "authors": "Igor L.

The leading\ncandidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output distribution\ndefined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation\ntool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or\nproprietary hardware. We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for\ncomputational speedups, so as to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer\n--- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive speedups for the\nsampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as\nwell as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available\nGoogle Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable comparisons by\ntotal cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling from the\noutput of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million\nbitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5%, at an estimated cost of $35184. The\nsimulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we\nestimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million\ndollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for\nsampling 1M bitstrings helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We\ndescribe refinements in benchmarks that slow down leading simulators, halving\nthe circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2018 17:58:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 08:02:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2018 22:11:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Markov", "Igor L.", ""], ["Fatima", "Aneeqa", ""], ["Isakov", "Sergei V.", ""], ["Boixo", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11607", "submitter": "Wolfgang Fink", "authors": "Tzyy-Juin Kao and Wolfgang Fink", "title": "Pareto-Optimization Framework for Automated Network-on-Chip Design", "comments": "25 pages (1.5 line spacing), 8 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.DC cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advent of multi-core processors, network-on-chip design has been key\nin addressing network performances, such as bandwidth, power consumption, and\ncommunication delays when dealing with on-chip communication between the\nincreasing number of processor cores.

Therefore, there is a critical need in soliciting\ncomputer aid in determining network configurations that afford optimal\nperformance given resources and design constraints. We propose a\nPareto-optimization framework that explores the space of possible network\nconfigurations to determine optimal network latencies, power consumption, and\nthe corresponding link allocations.
