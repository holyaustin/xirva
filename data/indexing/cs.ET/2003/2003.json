These\narchitectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand\nneurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly\ninefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire\nNeural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for\nsimulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of\nneurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to\nefficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights.\nHere, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural\nnetwork, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark\nsimulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks.

In\nthis paper, we propose to break this scalability barrier using a new\nsilicon-on-sapphire (SOS) based photonic device platform. Our physical-layer\ncharacterization results show that SOS-based photonic devices have negligible\noptical non-linearity effects in the mid-infrared region near 4{\\mu}m, which\ndrastically alleviates their power constraints. Our link-level analysis shows\nthat SOS-based photonic devices can be used to realize photonic links with\naggregated data rate of more than 1 Tb/s, which recently has been deemed\nunattainable for the SOI-based photonic on-chip links. We also show that such\nhigh-throughput SOS-based photonic links can significantly improve the\nenergy-efficiency of on-chip photonic communication architectures. Our\nsystem-level analysis results position SOS-based photonic interconnects to pave\nthe way for realizing ultra-low-energy (< 1 pJ/bit) on-chip data transfers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 20:48:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Karempudi", "Venkata Sai Praneeth", ""], ["Vatsavai", "Sairam Sri", ""], ["Thakkar", "Ishan", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.12094", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Alessandro Chiolerio and Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "Tactile sensing and computing on a random network of conducting fluid\n  channels", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Liquid electronic sensors are typically based on regular arrays of channels\nfilled with a conductive liquid.

This emerging paradigm aims at\nembedding some aspects of computations inside the memory array, thereby\navoiding frequent and expensive movement of data between the compute unit and\nthe storage memory. In-memory computing with respect to Silicon memories has\nbeen widely explored on various memory bit-cells. Embedding computation inside\nthe 6 transistor (6T) SRAM array is of special interest since it is the most\nwidely used on-chip memory. In this paper, we present a novel in-memory\nmultiplication followed by accumulation operation capable of performing\nparallel dot products within 6T SRAM without any changes to the standard\nbitcell. We, further, study the effect of circuit non-idealities and process\nvariations on the accuracy of the LeNet-5 and VGG neural network architectures\nagainst the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. The proposed in-memory\ndot-product mechanism achieves 88.8% and 99% accuracy for the CIFAR-10 and\nMNIST, respectively. Compared to the standard von Neumann system, the proposed\nsystem is 6.24x better in energy consumption and 9.42x better in delay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2020 17:43:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ali", "Mustafa", ""], ["Jaiswal", "Akhilesh", ""], ["Kodge", "Sangamesh", ""], ["Agrawal", "Amogh", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Indranil", ""], ["Roy", "Kaushik", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13097", "submitter": "Tim Wylie", "authors": "David Caballero, Angel A.

Movement is based on a sequence of uniform commands which\ncause all particles to move 1 step in a specific direction. The 2D grid board\nadditionally contains \"blocked\" spaces which prevent particles from entry.\nWithin this model, we investigate the complexity of deciding 1) whether a\ntarget location on the board can be occupied (by any) particle (\\emph{occupancy\nproblem}), 2) whether a specific particle can be relocated to another specific\nposition in the board (\\emph{relocation problem}), and 3) whether a board\nconfiguration can be transformed into another configuration\n(\\emph{reconfiguration problem}). We prove that while occupancy is solvable in\npolynomial time, the relocation and reconfiguration problems are both\nNP-Complete even when restricted to only 2 or 3 movement directions.
