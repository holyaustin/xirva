Hence, in order to make use of all the potential benefits of\nthe vertical stacking a thermal aware design is very essential. The first step\nfor designing a thermal aware architecture is to analyze the hotspot\ntemperature generated by the devices. In this paper we are presenting the\nresults of our thermal analysis experiments of a 3D heterogeneous structure\nwith three layers. The bottom layer had eight identical processors at 2.4 GHz\nand the top layer was with four memory units. The intermediate layer was a\nthermal interface material (TIM). The 2D thermal analysis of the top and bottom\nlayers was also done separately. In the next step simulations were carried out\nby varying TIM thickness and conductivity to study its affect on hotspot\ntemperature so as to optimize the temperature distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 13:55:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["C.", "Ramya Menon", ""], ["Pangracious", "Vinod", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1971", "submitter": "Naagesh Bhat S", "authors": "Naagesh S.
