The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize\nthe concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads\nto favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and\navoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules\ninto the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector\nfor a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption\nthat the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this\ngenie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any\npractical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different\ncomplexity are proposed. The proposed ML detector as well as one of the\nsuboptimal detectors require the channel response (CR) of the considered MC\nsystem. Moreover, the CR is needed for the performance evaluation of all\nproposed detectors. However, analyzing MC with reactive signaling is\nchallenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe\nthe reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, an\nalgorithm is developed in this paper for efficient computation of the CR to any\narbitrary transmit symbol sequence. The accuracy of this algorithm is validated\nvia particle-based simulation. Simulation results using the developed CR\nalgorithm show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal detectors can\napproach that of the genie- aided ML detector. Moreover, these results show\nthat MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to\nthose with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the\nchemical reactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 22:31:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jamali", "Vahid", ""], ["Farsad", "Nariman", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Goldsmith", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.01041", "submitter": "Dmitry Korolev", "authors": "A.N.

While most recent\nresearch in this area have explored the role of the Riemann zeta-function in\ndifferent formulations of statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and\nquantum chaotic systems, the resulting devices (quantum or classical) have only\nexisted in theory or the fabrication of the device has been found to be not\nscalable to large prime numbers. Here we report for the first time that any\nhypothetical prime number generator, to our knowledge, has to be a special case\nof a dynamical system that is governed by the physics of Fowler-Nordheim (FN)\nquantum-tunneling. In this paper we report how such a dynamical system can be\nimplemented using a counting process that naturally arises from sequential FN\ntunneling and integration of electrons on a floating-gate (FG) device. The\nself-compensating physics of the FG device makes the operation reliable and\nrepeatable even when tunneling-currents approach levels below 1 attoamperes. We\nreport measured results from different variants of fabricated prototypes, each\nof which shows an excellent match with the asymptotic prime number statistics.\nWe also report similarities between the spectral signatures produced by the FN\ndevice and the spectral statistics of a hypothetical prime number sequence\ngenerator. We believe that the proposed floating-gate device could have future\nimplications in understanding the process that generates prime numbers with\napplications in security and authentication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Nov 2017 21:49:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Liang", ""], ["Kondapalli", "SriHarsha", ""], ["Chakrabartty", "Shantanu", ""]]}]
