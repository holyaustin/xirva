It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in\nforaging for nutrients and developing an optimal transport network of\nprotoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients. The slime mould sufficiently\napproximates man-made transport networks on a flat substrate. Does slime mould\nimitate man-made transport networks on three-dimensional terrain as well as it\ndoes on a flat substrate? We simplified the problem to approximation of a\nsingle transport route. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA\nand Germany we imitated development of route 20, the longest road in USA, and\nautobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould\nbuilds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat agar plates\nyet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We discuss how\nnutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould, how\nthe mould navigates around elevations, and offer an automaton model of slime\nmould which might explain variability of the protoplasmic routes constructed.\nWe also display results of scoping experiments with slime mould on 3D terrains\nof Russia and United Kingdom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2012 18:44:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.0886", "submitter": "Brent Jason Lance", "authors": "Brent J.

Fortunately, these technological\nadvancements have also driven an explosion of neuroscience research over the\npast several decades, presenting engineers with a remarkable opportunity to\ndesign and develop flexible and adaptive brain-based neurotechnologies that\nintegrate with and capitalize on human capabilities and limitations to improve\nhuman-system interactions. Major forerunners of this conception are\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which to this point have been largely focused\non improving the quality of life for particular clinical populations and\ninclude, for example, applications for advanced communications with paralyzed\nor locked in patients as well as the direct control of prostheses and\nwheelchairs. Near-term applications are envisioned that are primarily task\noriented and are targeted to avoid the most difficult obstacles to development.\nIn the farther term, a holistic approach to BCIs will enable a broad range of\ntask-oriented and opportunistic applications by leveraging pervasive\ntechnologies and advanced analytical approaches to sense and merge critical\nbrain, behavioral, task, and environmental information. Communications and\nother applications that are envisioned to be broadly impacted by BCIs are\nhighlighted; however, these represent just a small sample of the potential of\nthese technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 15:13:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lance", "Brent J.", ""], ["Kerick", "Scott E.", ""], ["Ries", "Anthony J.", ""], ["Oie", "Kelvin S.", ""], ["McDowell", "Kaleb", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.2737", "submitter": "Venkateshwara Prasad Tangirala", "authors": "T.

Not only does this result in space\nlimitations; it also translates into unwanted delays in retrieving and\nprocessing of relevant information. There is, however, a class of two-terminal\npassive circuit elements with memory, memristive, memcapacitive and\nmeminductive systems -- collectively called memelements -- that perform both\ninformation processing and storing of the initial, intermediate and final\ncomputational data on the same physical platform. Importantly, the states of\nthese memelements adjust to input signals and provide analog capabilities\nunavailable in standard circuit elements, resulting in adaptive circuitry, and\nproviding analog massively-parallel computation. All these features are\ntantalizingly similar to those encountered in the biological realm, thus\noffering new opportunities for biologically-inspired computation. Of particular\nimportance is the fact that these memelements emerge naturally in nanoscale\nsystems, and are therefore a consequence and a natural by-product of the\ncontinued miniaturization of electronic devices. We will discuss the various\npossibilities offered by memcomputing, discuss the criteria that need to be\nsatisfied to realize this paradigm, and provide an example showing the solution\nof the shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the\nsolution path.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:35:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 02:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Di Ventra", "M.", ""], ["Pershin", "Y.
