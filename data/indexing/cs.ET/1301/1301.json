Normal anatomical\nimaging can provide structural information on certain abnormalities in the\nbrain. However there are many neurological disorders for which only structure\nstudies are not sufficient. In such cases it is required to investigate the\nfunctional organization of the brain. Further it is necessary to study the\nbrain functions under normal as well as diseased conditions. Brain mapping\ntechniques can help in deriving useful and important information on these\nissues. Brain functions and brain area responsible for the particular\nactivities like motor, sensory speech and memory process could be investigated.\nThe authors provide an overview of various Brain Mapping techniques and fMRI\nsignal processing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 11:00:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Daimiwal", "Nivedita", ""], ["Sundhararajan", "M.", ""], ["Shriram", "Revati", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.2807", "submitter": "Sophia Sklan", "authors": "Sophia Sklan and Jeffrey C.

The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,\nrange, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a\nchallenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting\nexploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied\ncross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac\nstandard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge\nbetween PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in\ncollision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly\ninvolved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC\nmechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such\nfunctionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac\nspecifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for\nthe IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,\nneeds both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented\ncross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it\nwith the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate\nthe 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO\nsolutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel\nsounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a\nshort PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE\n802.11ah communications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jan 2013 21:10:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Redieteab", "Getachew", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5027", "submitter": "Oliver Knill", "authors": "Oliver Knill and Elizabeth Slavkovsky", "title": "Thinking like Archimedes with a 3D printer", "comments": "16 pages, 13 figures, (fixed some typos)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.HO cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We illustrate Archimedes' method using models produced with 3D printers.
