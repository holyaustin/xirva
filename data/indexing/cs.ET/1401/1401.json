However,\nresilience research struggles to come up with useful abstract programming\nmodels for reasoning about SDC. Existing work randomly flips bits in running\napplications, but this only shows average-case behavior for a low-level,\nartificial hardware model. Algorithm developers need to understand worst-case\nbehavior with the higher-level data types they actually use, in order to make\ntheir algorithms more resilient. Also, we know so little about how SDC may\nmanifest in future hardware, that it seems premature to draw conclusions about\nthe average case. We argue instead that numerical algorithms can benefit from a\nnumerical unreliability fault model, where faults manifest as unbounded\nperturbations to floating-point data. Algorithms can use inexpensive \"sanity\"\nchecks that bound or exclude error in the results of computations. Given a\nselective reliability programming model that requires reliability only when and\nwhere needed, such checks can make algorithms reliable despite unbounded\nfaults. Sanity checks, and in general a healthy skepticism about the\ncorrectness of subroutines, are wise even if hardware is perfectly reliable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 21:18:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Elliott", "James", ""], ["Hoemmen", "Mark", ""], ["Mueller", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3410", "submitter": "Huseyin Birkan Yilmaz", "authors": "H.

In this work, we focus on a\ndiffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an\nabsorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is\nremoved from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first\npassage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.\nIn 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time\ndistribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end\nsimulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive\nsymbols.\n  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol\nduration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main\nchallenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in\nthe following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.\nEnd-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol\ninterference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI\ncancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the\neffect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are\nconsidered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints\non transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a\ncarrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this\npurpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the\nsymbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved\nmore than frequency-based modulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 02:26:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "H.

This is done with detailed system\ncalculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics\ncomponents to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including\nself-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic\nrange for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the\nanalog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide\ncomprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The\nanalytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations. We\nobserve that the nonlinear distortion produced by the transmitter PA is a\nsignificant issue in a full-duplex transceiver and, when using cheaper and less\nlinear components, also the receiver chain nonlinearities become considerable.\nIt is also shown that, with digitally-intensive self-interference cancellation,\nthe quantization noise of the ADCs is another significant problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 10:43:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 06:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2014 12:19:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Korpi", "Dani", ""], ["Riihonen", "Taneli", ""], ["Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4", "Ville", ""], ["Anttila", "Lauri", ""], ["Valkama", "Mikko", ""], ["Wichman", "Risto", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.4396", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "Towards plant wires", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In experimental laboratory studies we evaluate a possibility of making\nelectrical wires from living plants.
