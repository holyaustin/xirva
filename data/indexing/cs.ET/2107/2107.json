Both external and\ninternal factors can drive changes in the composition and in the interactions\nof the human gut bacteriome, impacting negatively on the host cells. In this\npaper, we focus on the human gut bacteriome metabolism and we propose a\ntwo-layer network system to investigate its dynamics. Furthermore, we develop\nan in-silico simulation model (virtual GB), allowing us to study the impact of\nthe metabolite exchange through molecular communications in the human gut\nbacteriome network system. Our results show that the regulation of molecular\ninputs can strongly affect bacterial population growth and create an unbalanced\nnetwork, as shown by the shift in the node weights based on the molecular\nsignals that are produced. Additionally, we show that the metabolite molecular\ncommunication production is greatly affected when directly manipulating the\ncomposition of the human gut bacteriome network in the virtual GB. These\nresults indicate that our human GB interaction model can help to identify\nhidden behaviors of the human gut bacteriome depending on the molecular signal\ninteractions. Moreover, the virtual GB can support the research and development\nof novel medical treatments based on the accurate control of bacterial growth\nand exchange of metabolites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 12:56:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Somathilaka", "Samitha", ""], ["Martins", "Daniel P.", ""], ["Barton", "Wiley", ""], ["O'Sullivan", "Orla", ""], ["Cotter", "Paul D.", ""], ["Balasubramaniam", "Sasitharan", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.08047", "submitter": "Yuri I.
