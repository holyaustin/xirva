Tensors\n(i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for\nsuch massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big\ndata analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets\nwithin tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for\nmultidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks (TNs) and\ntensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets of factor\n(component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis\nallows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to\nperform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect\nrelationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical\nand graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale\nTDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection,\nfeature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and\nintegration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series\nanalysis and multiway component analysis.\n  Keywords: Large-scale HOSVD, Tensor decompositions, CPD, Tucker models,\nHierarchical Tucker (HT) decomposition, low-rank tensor approximations (LRA),\nTensorization/Quantization, tensor train (TT/QTT) - Matrix Product States\n(MPS), Matrix Product Operator (MPO), DMRG, Strong Kronecker Product (SKP).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Mar 2014 10:45:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 May 2014 13:41:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Jun 2014 08:53:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 24 Aug 2014 11:04:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cichocki", "Andrzej", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.2975", "submitter": "Peter Selinger", "authors": "Neil J.

Often referred to as\n``temperature-2'' systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite\npowerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous\nvariety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not\nenforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. ``temperature-1'' systems, are conjectured\nto be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations\nor algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety\nof models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in\nwhich temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation\nthrough a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several\nof those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate\nthe stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.\n  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1\nsystems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)\nin which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is\nalso unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2\naTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the\nDupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a\nmodel which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at\ntemperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any\naTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be\nsimulated by any system in the aTAM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Mar 2014 18:41:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hendricks", "Jacob", ""], ["Patitz", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Rogers", "Trent A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3973", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Richard Mayne and Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "Towards slime mould electrical logic gates with optical coupling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physarum polycephalum is a macroscopic single celled plasmodial slime mould.\nWe employ plasmodial phototactic responses to construct laboratory prototypes\nof NOT and NAND logical gates with electrical inputs/outputs and optical\ncoupling; the slime mould plays dual roles of computing device and electrical\nconductor.
