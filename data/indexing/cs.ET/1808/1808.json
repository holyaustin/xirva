To link the macroworld to the microworld, we propose and\ndemonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a\nmicroscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an\noptical signal, which is controlled using an LED, into a chemical signal by\nchanging the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using E. coli\nbacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump\ngloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light\nstimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting\nprotons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed\noptical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH\nsensor, which serves as receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for\nthe induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using\nthis model, we derive a training-based channel estimator which estimates the\nparameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data. We further derive\nthe optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity\ndetector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal.
