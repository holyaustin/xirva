Our verification\nmethodology is based on the new notion of a reversible miter that allows one to\nleverage existing techniques for circuit simplification of quantum circuits.\nFor reversible circuits which arise as runtime bottlenecks of key quantum\nalgorithms, we develop several verification techniques and empirically compare\nthem.\n  We also combine existing quantum verification tools with the use of\nSAT-solvers. Experiments with circuits for Shor's number-factoring algorithm,\ncontaining thousands of gates, show improvements in efficiency by 3-4 orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2009 02:09:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2009 04:35:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 06:37:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yamashita", "Shigeru", ""], ["Markov", "Igor L.", ""]]}]
