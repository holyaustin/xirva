Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are a form of\nIMC that performs parallel searches for matched entries over a memory array for\na given input query. CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that\ninvolve pattern matching and search functionality. To accommodate the ever\nexpanding data, it is attractive to resort to analog CAM for memory density\nimprovement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard CMOS or\nemerging nonvolatile memories (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already\nchallenging due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely\nexpensive to achieve analog CAM with those technologies due to added cell\ncomponents. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal compact FeFET\nbased CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in\ndigital and analog domain simultaneously. By exploiting the multi-level-cell\n(MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM can store and search inputs in either digital or\nanalog domain. We perform a device-circuit co-design of the proposed FeCAM and\nvalidate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated\nFeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either\nstore continuous matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell.\nWhen compared with the existing digital CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is\nfound to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving by 8.6/3.2X for\nanalog/digital modes, respectively.

This study\npaves the way for autonomous behavior in photonic artificial intelligence and\ncould lead to new applications in load forecasting and multi-objective control,\nwhere frequent environment changes are expected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2020 03:54:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kanno", "Kazutaka", ""], ["Naruse", "Makoto", ""], ["Uchida", "Atsushi", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.13259", "submitter": "Xinyu Huang", "authors": "Xinyu Huang, Yuting Fang, Adam Noel, Nan Yang", "title": "Parameter Estimation in a Noisy 1D Environment via Two Absorbing\n  Receivers", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures, accepted by Globecom 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322407", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the estimation of different parameters, e.g.,\npropagation distance and flow velocity, by utilizing two fully-absorbing\nreceivers (RXs) in a one-dimensional (1D) environment. The time-varying number\nof absorbed molecules at each RX and the number of absorbed molecules in a time\ninterval as time approaches infinity are derived. Noisy molecules in this\nenvironment, that are released by sources in addition to the transmitter, are\nalso considered. A novel estimation method, namely difference estimation (DE),\nis proposed to eliminate the effect of noise by using the difference of\nreceived signals at the two RXs. For DE, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on\nthe variance of estimation is derived. Independent maximum likelihood\nestimation is also considered at each RX as a benchmark to show the performance\nadvantage of DE. Aided by particle-based simulation, the derived analytical\nresults are verified. Furthermore, numerical results show that DE attains the\nCRLB and is less sensitive to the change of noise than independent estimation\nat each RX.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 03:27:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Apr 2020 15:35:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:33:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Xinyu", ""], ["Fang", "Yuting", ""], ["Noel", "Adam", ""], ["Yang", "Nan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.13334", "submitter": "Byungik Ahn", "authors": "Byungik Ahn", "title": "Implementation of a 12-Million Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Network on a Single\n  Chip", "comments": "8 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ICONS conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the human brain is the biggest challenge for scientists in the\ntwenty-first century. The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is one of the most\nsuccessful mathematical models for bio-realistic simulations of the brain.\nHowever, the simulation of HH neurons involves complex computation, which makes\nthe implementation of large-scale brain networks difficult. In this paper, we\npropose a hardware architecture that efficiently computes a large-scale network\nof HH neurons. This architecture is based on the neuron machine hardware\narchitecture, which has the limitation of speed as it has only one computation\nnode. The proposed architecture is essentially a non-Von Neumann synchronous\nsystem with multiple computation nodes, called hardware neurons, to achieve\nlinear speedup. In this paper, the design of a digital circuit that computes\nlarge-scale networks of HH neurons is presented as an example to provide a\ndetailed description of the proposed architecture. This design supports axonal\nconduction delay of spikes and short- and long-term plasticity synapses, along\nwith floating-point precision HH neurons. The design is implemented on a\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and computes a network of one million\nHH neurons in near real time. The implemented system can compute a network with\nup to 12 million HH neurons and 600 million synapses.

Deep\nlearning is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent,\nbio-inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units\noperating in parallel. Deep learning has been successfully applied in areas\nsuch as object/pattern recognition, speech and natural language processing,\nself-driving vehicles, intelligent self-diagnostics tools, autonomous robots,\nknowledgeable personal assistants, and monitoring. These successes have been\nmostly supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data,\ncontinuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The\napproaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest\nimprovements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raise the\nquestion of whether the described progress will be slowed or halted due to\nhardware limitations. This paper reviews the case for a novel beyond CMOS\nhardware technology, memristors, as a potential solution for the implementation\nof power-efficient in-memory computing, deep learning accelerators, and spiking\nneural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non-von-Neumann computing\narchitectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference\nalgorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing\ndirections for further progress in artificial intelligence, we briefly discuss\nan example based reservoir computing. We conclude the review by speculating on\nthe big picture view of future neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 16:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mehonic", "Adnan", ""], ["Sebastian", "Abu", ""], ["Rajendran", "Bipin", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""], ["Vasilaki", "Eleni", ""], ["Kenyon", "Anthony J.", ""]]}]
