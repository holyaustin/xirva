The plasmodium is capable for distributed sensing, parallel information\nprocessing, and decentralized optimization. It is an ideal substrate for future\nand emerging bio-computing devices. We study space-time dynamics of plasmodium\nreactiom to localised illumination, and provide analogies between propagating\nplasmodium and travelling wave-fragments in excitable media. We show how\nplasmodium-based computing devices can be precisely controlled and shaped by\nplanar domains of illumination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 12:23:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}]
