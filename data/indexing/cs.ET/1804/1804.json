As in\ndiffusion-based MC, most of the molecules arrive at the receptor closer to the\nstart of the symbol duration, the wrong estimation of the start of the symbol\ninterval leads to a high symbol detection error. By utilizing two types of\nmolecules with different diffusion coefficients we propose a synchronization\ntechnique for MCvD. Moreover, we evaluate the symbol-error-rate performance\nunder the proposed symbol synchronization scheme for equal and non-equal symbol\nduration in MCvD systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2018 09:46:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2018 11:11:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Mar 2019 03:08:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mukherjee", "Mithun", ""], ["Yilmaz", "H.

Exploring\nroads toward cognitive SNNs requires the design of compact, low-power and\nversatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning\nin order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However,\nembedding online learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred\ncomplexity and area overheads. In this work, we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm$^2$\n64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor\nin 28nm FDSOI CMOS achieving a minimum energy per synaptic operation (SOP) of\n12.7pJ. It leverages an efficient implementation of the spike-driven synaptic\nplasticity (SDSP) learning rule for high-density embedded online learning with\nonly 0.68$\\mu$m$^2$ per 4-bit synapse. Neurons can be independently configured\nas a standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model or as a custom\nphenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in\nbiological spiking neurons. Using a single presentation of 6k 16$\\times$16\nMNIST training images to a single-layer fully-connected 10-neuron network with\non-chip SDSP-based learning, ODIN achieves a classification accuracy of 84.5%\nwhile consuming only 15nJ/inference at 0.55V using rank order coding. ODIN thus\nenables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for\nlow-power, adaptive and low-cost processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 23:18:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2018 21:49:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 10 Nov 2018 23:27:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Frenkel", "Charlotte", ""], ["Lefebvre", "Martin", ""], ["Legat", "Jean-Didier", ""], ["Bol", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09062", "submitter": "Manoj Gopalkrishnan", "authors": "Muppirala Viswa Virinchi, Abhishek Behera, Manoj Gopalkrishnan", "title": "A reaction network scheme which implements the EM algorithm", "comments": "15 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.IT cs.SY math.IT q-bio.MN stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A detailed algorithmic explanation is required for how a network of chemical\nreactions can generate the sophisticated behavior displayed by living cells.\nThough several previous works have shown that reaction networks are\ncomputationally universal and can in principle implement any algorithm, there\nis scope for constructions that map well onto biological reality, make\nefficient use of the computational potential of the native dynamics of reaction\nnetworks, and make contact with statistical mechanics.

Compared to Service-oriented Architecture\n(SOA), MSA puts a stronger focus on self-containment of services. Each\nmicroservice is responsible for realizing exactly one business or technological\ncapability that is distinct from other services' capabilities. Additionally, on\nthe implementation and operation level, microservices are self-contained in\nthat they are developed, tested, deployed and operated independently from each\nother. Next to these characteristics that distinguish MSA from SOA, both\narchitectural styles rely on services as building blocks of distributed\nsoftware architecture and hence face similar challenges regarding, e.g.,\nservice identification, composition and provisioning. However, in contrast to\nMSA, SOA may rely on an extensive body of knowledge to tackle these challenges.\nThus, due to both architectural styles being service-based, the question arises\nto what degree MSA might draw on existing findings of SOA research and\npractice. In this paper we address this question in the field of Model-driven\nDevelopment (MDD) for design and operation of service-based architectures.\nTherefore, we present an analysis of existing MDD approaches to SOA, which\ncomprises the identification and semantic clustering of modeling concepts for\nSOA design and operation. For each concept cluster, the analysis assesses its\napplicability to MDD of MSA (MSA-MDD) and assigns it to a specific modeling\nviewpoint. The goal of the presented analysis is to provide a conceptual\nfoundation for an MSA-MDD metamodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:57:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Rademacher", "Florian", ""], ["Sachweh", "Sabine", ""], ["Z\u00fcndorf", "Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10071", "submitter": "Fatih Dinc", "authors": "Fatih Dinc, Bayram Cevdet Akdeniz, Ali Emre Pusane and Tuna Tugcu", "title": "A General Analytical Approximation to Impulse Response of 3-D\n  Microfluidic Channels in Molecular Communication", "comments": "The manuscript is submitted to IEEE: Transactions on Nanobioscience", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 396-403,\n  July 2019", "doi": "10.1109/TNB.2019.2905417", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, the impulse response for a 3-D microfluidic channel in the\npresence of Poiseuille flow is obtained by solving the diffusion equation in\nradial coordinates.
