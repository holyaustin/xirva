The\ndifferent point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs\ncorresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG\nindistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard\n2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs\nindistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever\nangles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the\nOR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL\ngate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the\nself-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according\nto the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate\nit is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective\nAND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles.

In this work, we focus on one important aspect of\ncommunication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by\nborrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that\nperform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We\nevaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a\nchemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and\ndifficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform\nsignificantly better than a simple detector that was used in previous works,\nwhich also did not assume any knowledge of the channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 May 2017 23:47:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 02:43:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Farsad", "Nariman", ""], ["Goldsmith", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.08927", "submitter": "Davide Venturelli", "authors": "Davide Venturelli, Minh Do, Eleanor Rieffel, Jeremy Frank", "title": "Compiling quantum circuits to realistic hardware architectures using\n  temporal planners", "comments": "updated manuscript, more planners and results", "journal-ref": "2017 Quantum Sci.

For\nnear-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is\ncritical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the\napplication of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits\nto newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on\ncompiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor\nconstraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating\nOperator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow\ngreat flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom\nmakes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is\na greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible\ncircuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal\nplanning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA\ncircuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report\ncompilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this\ntest set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning\nis a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 May 2017 18:52:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:41:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Venturelli", "Davide", ""], ["Do", "Minh", ""], ["Rieffel", "Eleanor", ""], ["Frank", "Jeremy", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09176", "submitter": "Dmitri Maslov", "authors": "Dmitri Maslov and Martin Roetteler", "title": "Shorter stabilizer circuits via Bruhat decomposition and quantum circuit\n  transformations", "comments": "Supersedes arXiv:1703.00874", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 64(7):4729-4738 (2018)", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2018.2825602", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer\ncircuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in Phys. Rev. A 70(052328), 2004:\nto obtain a general stabilizer circuit, we reduce their $11$-stage computation\n-H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- over the gate set consisting of Hadamard,\nControlled-NOT, and Phase gates, into a $7$-stage computation of the form\n-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the\n-C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered\nexpression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement\ncompared to the -C- stages. Based on this decomposition, we develop a two-qubit\ngate depth-$(14n{-}4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate\nlibrary $\\{$H, P, CNOT$\\}$, executable in the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN)\narchitecture, improving best previously known depth-$25n$ circuit, also\nexecutable in the LNN architecture. Our constructions rely on Bruhat\ndecomposition of the symplectic group and on folding arbitrarily long sequences\nof the form $($-P-C-$)^m$ into a 3-stage computation -P-CZ-C-. Our results\ninclude the reduction of the $11$-stage decomposition -H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C-\ninto a $9$-stage decomposition of the form -C-P-C-P-H-C-P-C-P-. This reduction\nis based on the Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group. This result also\nimplies a new normal form for stabilizer circuits. We show that a circuit in\nthis normal form is optimal in the number of Hadamard gates used. We also show\nthat the normal form has an asymptotically optimal number of parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 13:46:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 Jun 2018 18:26:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Maslov", "Dmitri", ""], ["Roetteler", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09402", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "On dynamics of excitation in F-actin: automaton model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We represent a filamentous actin molecule as a graph of finite-state machines\n(F-actin automaton).
