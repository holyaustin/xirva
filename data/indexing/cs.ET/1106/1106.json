QIS-XML is a proposed\nframework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize,\nexchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a\npotential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers\nthrough the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the\ndescription of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools\nto visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also\npresented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and\nrunning the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial\neffort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the\narchitecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a\nwidely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and\nquantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and\nfacilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would\nsupport the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum\nInformation Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could\nbe referred to as the \"Information Science Grand Unification Challenge\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 12:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Heus", "Pascal", ""], ["Gomez", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2927", "submitter": "Omid Kavehei", "authors": "Omid Kavehei, Said Al-Sarawi, Kyoung-Rok Cho, Kamran Eshraghian, and\n  Derek Abbott", "title": "An Analytical Approach for Memristive Nanoarchitectures", "comments": "12 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TNANO.2011.2174802", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As conventional memory technologies are challenged by their technological\nphysical limits, emerging technologies driven by novel materials are becoming\nan attractive option for future memory architectures.

One particular problem that\nlimits the maximum array size is interference from neighboring cells due to\nsneak-path currents. A possible device level solution to address this issue is\nto implement a memory array using complementary resistive switches (CRS).\nAlthough the storage mechanism for a CRS is fundamentally different from what\nhas been reported for memristors (low and high resistances), a CRS is simply\nformed by two series bipolar memristors with opposing polarities. In this paper\nour intention is to introduce modeling principles that have been previously\nverified through measurements and extend the simulation principles based on\nmemristors to CRS devices and hence provide an analytical approach to the\ndesign of a CRS array.
