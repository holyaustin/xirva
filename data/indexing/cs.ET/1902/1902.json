We first show that there is the similarity between\nthe dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is, some kind of flux-controlled\nmemristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly, namely,\nthey can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory\nperiod after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further\nsinusoidal inputs until the flux is decreased. We next show that the\nmemristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this system,\nthe memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells\nare connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then\npropose the modified CNN model, which can hold a binary output image, even if\nall cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied to the cell after a\ncertain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the\noutput image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN\nmodel. It can also hold a binary output state (image), even if all cells are\ndisconnected, and no signal is supplied to the cell, by memristor's switching\nbehavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system during the\ncomputation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the\nmemristor CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term\n(non-volatile) memory. The above suspend and resume feature are useful when we\nwant to save the current state, and continue work later from the previous\nstate.

Drawing inspiration from the usage of butterfly diagrams for FPRM\nand KRM forms, we devise a method to exhaustively construct all FPQF and KQF\nforms. Thus, the new forms can be used to optimize quantum circuits with\narbitrary target unitary matrices, rather than only multi-controlled NOT gates\nsuch as CNOT, CCNOT, and their extensions. Experimental results on FPQF and KQF\nforms, as well as FPRM and KRM classical forms, applied to various target gates\nsuch as NOT, V, V+, Hadamard, and Pauli rotations, demonstrate that FPQF and\nKQF forms greatly reduce the gate cost of quantum multiplexers in both randomly\ngenerated data and FPRM benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2019 09:10:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Kevin", ""], ["Saffat", "Tahsin", ""], ["Perkowski", "Marek", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06886", "submitter": "Jianlei Yang", "authors": "Xiaotao Jia, Jianlei Yang, Pengcheng Dai, Runze Liu, Yiran Chen,\n  Weisheng Zhao", "title": "SPINBIS: Spintronics based Bayesian Inference System with Stochastic\n  Computing", "comments": "14 pages, 26 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided\n  Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2019.2897631", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.AR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Bayesian inference is an effective approach for solving statistical learning\nproblems, especially with uncertainty and incompleteness.

Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers,\nthey can be operated with extremely low power consumption.

We designed a\nCMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model\nwith binary weights, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip,\nmemory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic\nconnection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the\nsubthreshold operation region of MOS transistors unlike the ordinary\ncomputing-in-memory circuits. The chip was designed and fabricated using a\n250-nm fabrication technology.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can\nrealize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which\nleads to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction\nand avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling\nmolecules into the channel. This work first presents a general formulation for\nbinary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and\nproposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of\nreceivers are considered: a receiver that is able to observe both types of\nsignaling molecules (2TM), and a simpler receiver that can observe only one\ntype of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the\nassumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence.\nIn addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed,\nnamely an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing\nsequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed\ndetectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver,\nrequire knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system.\nMoreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed\ndetectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling\nmolecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations\nthat describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear.\nTherefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and\nvalidate its accuracy via particle-based simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 10:14:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Jul 2019 09:42:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jamali", "Vahid", ""], ["Farsad", "Nariman", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Goldsmith", "Andrea", ""]]}]
