Some of their peculiar features are their smaller\nsize, higher speed, higher switching frequency, lower power consumption, and\nhigher scale integration. In these technologies, the majority (or minority) and\ninverter gates are employed for the production of the functions as this set of\ngates makes a universal set of Boolean primitives in these technologies. An\nimportant step in the generation of Boolean functions using the majority gate\nis reducing the number of involved gates. In this paper, a multi-objective\nsynthesis methodology (with the objective priority of gate counts, gate levels\nand the number of inverter gates) is presented for finding the minimal number\nof possible majority gates in the synthesis of Boolean functions using the\nproposed Majority Specification Matrix (MSM) concept. Moreover, based on MSM, a\nsynthesis flow is proposed for the synthesis of multi-output Boolean functions.\nTo reveal the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with a\nmeta-heuristic method, multi-objective Genetic Programing (GP). Besides, it is\napplied to synthesize MCNC benchmark circuits. The results are indicative of\nthe outperformance of the proposed method in comparison to multi-objective GP\nmethod. Also, for the MCNC benchmark circuits, there is an average reduction of\n10.5% in the number of levels as well as 16.8% and 33.5% in the number of\nmajority and inverter gates, as compared to the best available method\nrespectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 10:06:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 18:49:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:02:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Sarvaghad-Moghaddam", "Moein", ""], ["Orouji", "Ali A.", ""], ["Houshmand", "Monireh", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.00467", "submitter": "Asmit De", "authors": "Asmit De, Mohammad Nasim Imtiaz Khan, Swaroop Ghosh", "title": "Attack resilient architecture to replace embedded Flash with STTRAM in\n  homogeneous IoTs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is an emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)\ntechnology that provides better endurance, write energy and performance than\ntraditional NVM technologies such as Flash.

The question is how do you\nask a relevant question and how do you use the answer it returns. This paper\naddresses these issues in a way that is pertinent to machine learning. A\nBoltzmann machine is implemented with the D-Wave since the D-Wave is merely a\nhardware instantiation of a partially connected Boltzmann machine. This paper\npresents a prototype implementation of a 3-layered neural network where the\nD-Wave is used as the middle (hidden) layer of the neural network. This paper\nalso explains how the D-Wave can be utilized in a multi-layer neural network\n(more than 3 layers) and one in which each layer may be multiple times the size\nof the D-Wave being used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 14:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dorband", "John E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.06513", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Alastair A.

However, such problems are intractable on digital\ncomputers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for\nalternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,\ncontinuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\\bf 7}(12),\n966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean\nSatisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on\neven the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \\geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost\nthrough exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel\nanalog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating\nnovel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a\nco-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.\nIt is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are\nchallenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its\nmodular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,\nwhile the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of\nvariables and number of clauses. The circuit is designed and simulated based on\na 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE simulation results show speedup factors of\n$\\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-SAT problems, when compared with a\nstate-of-the-art SAT solver on digital computers.

Applications span from automatic classification\nfor big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for\nbio-medical prosthesis.

Nanometer-scale devices\nexploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this\ncontext.

We consider the diffusive molecular communication\nchannel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a\nfluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter\nnano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order\ndegradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can\nparticipate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor\nproteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,\nwe assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor\nmolecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected\nreceived signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated\nreceptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we\nconsider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the\nuniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only\npartially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be\naccurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario\nafter appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy\nof the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based\nsimulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the\neffect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 15:03:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Oct 2016 19:55:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadzadeh", "Arman", ""], ["Arjmandi", "Hamidreza", ""], ["Burkovski", "Andreas", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.08299", "submitter": "Gaye Genc", "authors": "Gaye Genc, Yunus Emre Kara, H.
