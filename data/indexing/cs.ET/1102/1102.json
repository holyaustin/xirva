Artificial Immune\nSystem is an evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the\nimmune system of mammals. The immune system can inspire to form new algorithms\nlearning from its course of action. The human immune system has motivated\nscientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms\nthat has solved complex engineering problems. This work is the result of an\nattempt to explore a different perspective of the immune system namely the\nImmune Privileged Site (IPS) which has the ability to make an exception to\ndifferent parts of the body by not triggering immune response to some of the\nforeign agent in these parts of the body. While the complete system is secured\nby an Immune System at certain times it may be required that the system allows\ncertain activities which may be harmful to other system which is useful to it\nand learns over a period of time through the immune privilege model as done in\ncase of Immune Privilege Sites in Natural Immune System.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Feb 2011 06:01:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chingtham", "Tejbanta Singh", ""], ["Sahoo", "G.", ""], ["Ghose", "M.
