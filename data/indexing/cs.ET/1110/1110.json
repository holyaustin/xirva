A large number of such experiments performed have been\nimplementations of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It is known, however, that in\nsome cases the Deutsch-Jozsa problem can be solved classically using as many\nqueries to the black-box as in the quantum solution. In this paper we describe\nexperiments in which we take the contrasting approach of using NMR as a\nclassical computing medium, treating the nuclear spin vectors classically and\nutilising an alternative embedding of bits into the physical medium. This\nallows us to determine the actual Boolean function computed by the black-box\nfor the n=1,2 cases, as opposed to only the nature (balanced or constant) as\nconventional quantum algorithms do. Discussion of these experiments leads to\nsome clarification of the complications surrounding the comparison of different\nquantum algorithms, particularly black-box type algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2011 12:19:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Abbott", "Alastair A.", ""], ["Bechmann", "Matthias", ""], ["Calude", "Cristian S.", ""], ["Sebald", "Angelika", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2074", "submitter": "Ondrej \\v{S}uch", "authors": "Martin Klimo, Ondrej Such", "title": "Memristors can implement fuzzy logic", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.NE cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In our work we propose implementing fuzzy logic using memristors.

In addition, we\ncalculated the number of spins required by SOPAC in order to purify qubits for\nquantum computation. As few as 12 and 7 spins are required (in an ideal\nscenario) to yield a mildly pure spin (60% polarized) from initial\npolarizations of 1% and 10%, respectively.
