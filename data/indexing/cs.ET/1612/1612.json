An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices\nconnected in series. Such a cell has constant output and oscillatory states.\nAll cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through\nthe cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias\nvoltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing\nto the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two\n1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase where one of the devices is in the\ninsulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The\nnearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are\nresistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the On state while they\nare capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation\nof the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30x30 node\nnetwork.

AcCoRD is a sandbox reaction-diffusion solver\ndesigned for the study of molecular communication systems. It uses a hybrid of\nmicroscopic and mesoscopic simulation models that enables scalability via user\ncontrol of local accuracy. AcCoRD is developed in C as an open source command\nline tool and includes utilities to process simulation output in MATLAB. The\nlatest code and links to user documentation can be found at\nhttps://github.com/adamjgnoel/AcCoRD/. This paper provides an overview of\nAcCoRD's design, including the motivation for developing a specialized\nreaction-diffusion solver. The corresponding algorithms are presented in\ndetail, including the computational complexity of the microscopic and\nmesoscopic models. Other novel derivations include the transition rates between\nadjacent mesoscopic subvolumes of different sizes. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the use of AcCoRD as both an accurate reaction-diffusion solver and\none that is catered to the analysis of molecular communication systems. A link\nis included to videos that demonstrate many of the simulated scenarios.\nAdditional insights from the simulation results include the selection of\nsuitable hybrid model parameters, the impact of reactive surfaces that are in\nthe proximity of a hybrid interface, and the size of a bounded environment that\nis necessary to assume that it is unbounded. The development of AcCoRD is\nongoing, so its future direction is also discussed in order to highlight\nimprovements that will expand its potential areas of application.

However, real life quantum systems are open\nand are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost\nimportance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality. Ideally, an\nerror correction block should be placed after every gate operation in a quantum\ncircuit. This increases the overhead and reduced the speedup of the quantum\ncircuit. Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as\nthe gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have\nproposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and\ndecoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when\nthe error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a\ndrastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks.\nFurthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout\nlattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport\nmechanism. Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most\ncases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required\nbecome static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing\nconcatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 17:20:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Majumdar", "Ritajit", ""], ["Basu", "Saikat", ""], ["Mukhopadhyay", "Priyanka", ""], ["Sur-Kolay", "Susmita", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08091", "submitter": "Damian S.

A excitable\nthin-layer BZ medium responds to a localised perturbation with omnidirectional\ntarget or spiral excitation waves. A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to an\nasymmetric perturbation by producing travelling localised excitation\nwave-fragments similar to dissipative solitons. We employ interactions between\nexcitation wave-fragments to perform computation. We interpret the\nwave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. A presence of a wave-fragment at\na given site of a circuit represents logical truth, absence of the\nwave-fragment --- logical false.
