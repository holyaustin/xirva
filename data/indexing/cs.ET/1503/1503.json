Cellular\nautomaton is used as the reservoir of dynamical systems. Input is randomly\nprojected onto the initial conditions of automaton cells and nonlinear\ncomputation is performed on the input via application of a rule in the\nautomaton for a period of time. The evolution of the automaton creates a\nspace-time volume of the automaton state space, and it is used as the\nreservoir. The proposed framework is capable of long short-term memory and it\nrequires orders of magnitude less computation compared to Echo State Networks.\nWe prove that cellular automaton reservoir holds a distributed representation\nof attribute statistics, which provides a more effective computation than local\nrepresentation. It is possible to estimate the kernel for linear cellular\nautomata via metric learning, that enables a much more efficient distance\ncomputation in support vector machine framework. Also, binary reservoir feature\nvectors can be combined using Boolean operations as in hyperdimensional\ncomputing, paving a direct way for concept building and symbolic processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 08:14:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 20:31:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 06:33:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "Ozgur", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.01244", "submitter": "Matthew Patitz", "authors": "Jacob Hendricks and Matthew J.
