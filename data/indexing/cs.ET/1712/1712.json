These reduced problem sets can then be processed independently and\nin parallel, thus improving computational efficiency and speed. Here we show an\noptical RNS hardware representation based on integrated nanophotonics. The\ndigit-wise shifting in RNS arithmetic is expressed as spatial routing of an\noptical signal in 2x2 hybrid photonic-plasmonic switches. Here the residue is\nrepresented by spatially shifting the input waveguides relative to the routers\noutputs, where the moduli are represented by the number of waveguides. By\ncascading the photonic 2x2 switches, we design a photonic RNS adder and a\nmultiplier forming an all-to-all sparse directional network. The advantage of\nthis photonic arithmetic processor is the short (10's ps) computational\nexecution time given by the optical propagation delay through the integrated\nnanophotonic router. Furthermore, we show how photonic processing\nin-the-network leverages the natural parallelism of optics such as\nwavelength-division-multiplexing or optical angular momentum in this RNS\nprocessor. A key application for photonic RNS is the functional analysis\nconvolution with widespread usage in numerical linear algebra, computer vision,\nlanguage- image- and signal processing, and neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 19:46:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Jiaxin", ""], ["Sun", "Shuai", ""], ["Narayana", "Vikram K.", ""], ["Sorger", "Volker J.", ""], ["El-Ghazawi", "Tarek", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.00414", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Jordi Vallverdu, Oscar Castro, Richard Mayne, Max Talanov, Michael\n  Levin, Frantisek Baluska, Yukio Gunji, Audrey Dussutour, Hector Zenil, Andrew\n  Adamatzky", "title": "Slime mould: the fundamental mechanisms of cognition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The slime mould Physarum polycephalum has been used in developing\nunconventional computing devices for in which the slime mould played a role of\na sensing, actuating, and computing device.

The drawback to this solution is\nthat the histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the\nmolecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of\nthis heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most\nprior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a\ncounting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the\ntransmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that\nthe molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be\ncoming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this\nidea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and\ntime is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is\napproximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing\nspherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the\ncharacteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved\nperformance is presented.
