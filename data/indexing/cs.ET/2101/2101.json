In this paper,\nwe focus on the detection problem for biological MC receivers employing ligand\nreceptors to infer the transmitted messages encoded into the concentration of\nmolecules, i.e., ligands. In practice, receptors are not ideally selective\nagainst target ligands, and in physiological environments, they can interact\nwith multiple types of ligands at different reaction rates depending on their\nbinding affinity. This molecular cross-talk can cause a substantial\ninterference on MC. Here we consider a particular scenario, where there is\nnon-negligible concentration of interferer molecules in the channel, which have\nsimilar receptor-binding characteristics with the information molecules, and\nthe receiver employs single type of receptors. We investigate the performance\nof four different detection methods, which make use of different statistics of\nthe ligand-receptor binding reactions: instantaneous number of bound receptors,\nunbound time durations of receptors, bound time durations of receptors, and\ncombination of unbound and bound time durations of receptors within a sampling\ntime interval. The performance of the introduced detection methods are\nevaluated in terms of bit error probability for varying strength of molecular\ninterference, similarity between information and interferer molecules, number\nof receptors, and received concentration difference between bit-0 and bit-1\ntransmissions.

One such approach to build an Ising spin, or\na binary stochastic neuron (BSN), is a compact mixed-signal unit based on a\nlow-barrier nanomagnet based design that uses a single magnetic tunnel junction\n(MTJ) and three transistors (3T-1MTJ) where the MTJ functions as a stochastic\nresistor (1SR). Such a compact unit can drastically reduce the area footprint\nof BSNs while promising massive scalability by leveraging the existing Magnetic\nRAM (MRAM) technology that has integrated 1T-1MTJ cells in ~Gbit densities. The\n3T-1SR design however can be realized using different materials or devices that\nprovide naturally fluctuating resistances.

Effective logical expressions are likely to be extensive, involving\ndozens of variables. Large expressions require considerable computational power\nto be processed. This is problematic for BCI applications because they require\nfast reaction times to execute sequences of commands. Quantum computers hold\nmuch promise in terms of processing speed for some problems, including those\ninvolving logical expressions.

SNNs have\ninspired the design and can take advantage of the emerging class of\nneuromorphic processors like Intel Loihi. These novel hardware architectures\nexpose a variety of constraints that affect firmware, compiler and algorithm\ndevelopment alike. To enable rapid and flexible development of SNN algorithms\non Loihi, we developed NxTF: a programming interface derived from Keras and\ncompiler optimized for mapping deep convolutional SNNs to the multi-core Intel\nLoihi architecture. We evaluate NxTF on DNNs trained directly on spikes as well\nas models converted from traditional DNNs, processing both sparse event-based\nand dense frame-based data sets. Further, we assess the effectiveness of the\ncompiler to distribute models across a large number of cores and to compress\nmodels by exploiting Loihi's weight sharing features. Finally, we evaluate\nmodel accuracy, energy and time to solution compared to other architectures.\nThe compiler achieves near optimal resource utilization of 80% across 16 Loihi\nchips for a 28-layer, 4M parameter MobileNet model with input size 128x128. In\naddition, we report the lowest error rate of 8.52% for the CIFAR-10 dataset on\nneuromorphic hardware, using an off-the-shelf MobileNet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2021 02:03:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Rueckauer", "Bodo", ""], ["Bybee", "Connor", ""], ["Goettsche", "Ralf", ""], ["Singh", "Yashwardhan", ""], ["Mishra", "Joyesh", ""], ["Wild", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.04764", "submitter": "Alexandru Paler", "authors": "Alexandru Paler, Oumarou Oumarou, Robert Basmadjian", "title": "On the realistic worst case analysis of quantum arithmetic circuits", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We provide evidence that commonly held intuitions when designing quantum\ncircuits can be misleading.

For example, a data structure for graph\nnodes can have pointers (critical) to neighboring nodes and its score\n(non-critical, depending on the use-case).
