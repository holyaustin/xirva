We model actin filament as a double chain of finite\nstate machines, nodes, which take states `0' and `1'. The states are\nabstractions of absence and presence of a sub-threshold charge on an actin\nunits corresponding to the nodes. All nodes update their state in parallel in\ndiscrete time. A node updates its current state depending on states of two\nclosest neighbours in the node chain and two closest neighbours in the\ncomplementary chain. Previous models of actin automata considered momentary\nstate transitions of nodes. We enrich the actin automata model by assuming that\nstates of nodes depends not only on the current states of neighbouring node but\nalso on their past states. Thus, we assess the effect of memory of past states\non the dynamics of acting automata. We demonstrate in computational experiments\nthat memory slows down propagation of perturbations, decrease entropy of\nspace-time patterns generated, transforms travelling localisations to\nstationary oscillators, and stationary oscillations to still patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 11:24:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Alonso-Sanz", "Ramon", ""], ["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00681", "submitter": "Yansha Deng", "authors": "Yansha Deng, Adam Noel, Maged Elkashlan, Arumugam Nallanathan, and\n  Karen C.

Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density\ntechnology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform\ncomputation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior\n(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that\ncan embed computation with storage.\n  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances\nof the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of\nmemristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based\ncontent addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over\nlarge datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes\na concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data\nstructures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS\nprocessor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable\nmemristor technologies for lower levels.\n  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and\nuse analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data\nstructures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our\nconfigurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive\napplications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.\nFurthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data\nstructures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and\nlifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or\nother technologies with improved endurance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 14:08:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Dwyer", "Chris", ""], ["Lebeck", "Alvin R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.05356", "submitter": "Massimo Monti", "authors": "Massimo Monti and Manolis Sifalakis and Christian F.
