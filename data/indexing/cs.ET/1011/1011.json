To this\nend, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested\nwhich contains $l$ qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic\nsynthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied\nto reach unitary gates over $l$ qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some\noptimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact\nvalue of $l$ affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed\nmethod. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of $l$ is\nexamined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total\nnumber of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the\nnearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT\ngates is increased by at most a factor of $\\frac{5}{3}$ if the nearest neighbor\ninteraction is applied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Nov 2010 17:42:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Saeedi", "Mehdi", "", "The\n  first two authors contributed equally to this work"], ["Arabzadeh", "Mona", "", "The\n  first two authors contributed equally to this work"], ["Zamani", "Morteza Saheb", "", "The\n  first two authors contributed equally to this work"], ["Sedighi", "Mehdi", "", "The\n  first two authors contributed equally to this work"]]}, {"id": "1011.3151", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "Marcos Pita, Vladimir Privman, Mary A.
