However, timing jitter can\nalso result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery\ncircuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock\nretiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects.\nWe first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the\nsettling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a\nMarkov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov\nchain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined.\nThe model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the\nresults of which match well with the model predictions. We consider circuits\nwith (i) data dependent jitter, (ii) random jitter, and (iii) combination of\nboth of them. We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down\ncorrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10%\nmismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact\ntoward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques\nbased on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps. We also present\na coarse+fine clock retiming circuit, which can operate in coarse first mode,\nto reduce the settling time substantially. These fast settling retiming\ncircuits are verified with circuit simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 13:21:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 05:00:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2019 11:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kadayinti", "Naveen", ""], ["Budkuley", "Amitalok J.", ""], ["Baghini", "Maryam S.", ""], ["Sharma", "Dinesh K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00642", "submitter": "Moein Sarvaghad-Moghaddam", "authors": "Moein Sarvaghad-Moghaddam", "title": "Multi-objective design of quantum circuits using genetic programming", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some of\n  modifications in structures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of\nquantum mechanics.

Although several basic QCA circuits\nhave been designed, fabricated and tested, proving that quantum-dots can form\nfunctional, fast and low-power nanoelectornic circuits, QCA nanoelectronics\nstill remain at its infancy. One of the reasons for this is the lack of design\nautomation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA\ncircuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel,\nprogrammable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These\ncircuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS\nFPGAs and open the road that will lead to full design automation of QCA\nnanoelectronic circuits. Using this architecture we designed and simulated QCA\ncircuits that proved to be area efficient, stable and reliable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 19:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kalogeiton", "Vicky S.", ""], ["Papadopoulos", "Dim P.", ""], ["Liolis", "Orestis", ""], ["Mardiris", "Vassilios A.", ""], ["Sirakoulis", "Georgios Ch.", ""], ["Karafyllidis", "Ioannis G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.08926", "submitter": "Mingyu Li", "authors": "Mingyu Li, Jiajun Shi, Mostafizur Rahman, Santosh Khasanvis, Sachin\n  Bhat, Csaba Andras Moritz", "title": "Skybridge-3D-CMOS: A Vertically-Composed Fine-Grained 3D CMOS Integrated\n  Circuit Technology", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Parallel and monolithic 3D integration directions offer pathways to realize\n3D integrated circuits (ICs) but still lead to layer-by-layer implementations,\neach functional layer being composed in 2D first. This mindset causes\nchallenging connectivity, routing and layer alignment between layers when\nconnected in 3D, with a routing access that can be even worse than 2D CMOS,\nwhich fundamentally limits their potential. To fully exploit the opportunities\nin the third dimension, we propose Skybridge-3D-CMOS (S3DC), a fine-grained 3D\nintegration approach that is directly composed in 3D, utilizing the vertical\ndimension vs. using a layer-by-layer assembly mindset. S3DC uses a novel wafer\nfabric creation with direct 3D design and connectivity in the vertical\ndimension. It builds on a uniform vertical nanowire template that is processed\nas a single wafer; it incorporates specifically architected structures for\nrealizing devices, circuits, and heat management directly in 3D. Novel 3D\ninterconnect concepts, including within the silicon layers, enable\nsignificantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a\nhigh-density 3D design paradigm overall. Intrinsic components for fabric-level\n3D heat management are introduced. Extensive bottom-up simulations and\nexperiments have been presented to validate the key fabric-enabling concepts.\nEvaluation results indicate up to 40x density and 10x performance-per-watt\nbenefits against conventional 16-nm CMOS for the circuits studied; benefits are\nalso at least an order of magnitude beyond what was shown to be possible with\nother 3D directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 18:08:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Mingyu", ""], ["Shi", "Jiajun", ""], ["Rahman", "Mostafizur", ""], ["Khasanvis", "Santosh", ""], ["Bhat", "Sachin", ""], ["Moritz", "Csaba Andras", ""]]}]
