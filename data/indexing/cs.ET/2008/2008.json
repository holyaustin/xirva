All\nexisting memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and\nrealism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely\ncharacterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical\nprocesses are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ\nquantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model\nfor the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More\nspecifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms\nforming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament\nstructure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the\nconductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization\nof the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate\nour computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation\nresults successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of\nmemristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data,\nprove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of\nmulti-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its\noperation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:30:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2020 11:08:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fyrigos", "Iosif-Angelos", ""], ["Ntinas", "Vasileios", ""], ["Sirakoulis", "Georgios Ch.", ""], ["Dimitrakis", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Karafyllidis", "Ioannis G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.07566", "submitter": "Sairam Sri Vatsavai", "authors": "Sairam Sri Vatsavai, Venkata Sai Praneeth Karempudi and Ishan Thakkar", "title": "PROTEUS: Rule-Based Self-Adaptation in Photonic NoCs for Loss-Aware\n  Co-Management of Laser Power and Performance", "comments": "Submitted and Accepted at NOCs 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The performance of on-chip communication in the state-of-the-art multi-core\nprocessors that use the traditional electron-ic NoCs has already become\nseverely energy-constrained.
