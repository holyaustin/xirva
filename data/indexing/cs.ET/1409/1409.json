Usually,\neither subthreshold circuits or RC-decays based on transconductance amplifiers\nare used. In the latter case, transconductances in the 10 pS range are needed.\nHowever, state-of-the-art low-transconductance amplifiers still require too\nmuch circuit area to be applicable in neuromorphic circuits where >100 of these\ntime constant circuits may be required on a single chip. We present a silicon\nverified operational transconductance amplifier that achieves a gm of 5 pS in\nonly 700 {\\mu}m2, a factor of 10-100 less area than current examples.

The\nproposed method stores petabytes of user-data in a sugar cube (1 cm3), and can\nread/write that information at hundreds of megabits/sec. Digital information is\nrecorded and stored in the form of a long macromolecule consisting of at least\ntwo bases, A and B. (This would be similar to DNA strands constructed from the\nfour nucleic acids G,C,A,T.) The macromolecules initially enter the system as\nblank slates. A macromolecule with, say, 10,000 identical bases in the form of\nAAAAA....AAA may be used to record a kilobyte block of user-data (including\nmodulation and error-correction coding), although, in this blank state, it can\nonly represent the null sequence 00000....000. Suppose this blank string of A's\nis dragged before an atomically-sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope\n(STM). When electric pulses are applied to the needle in accordance with the\nsequence of 0s and 1s of a 1 kB block of user-data, selected A molecules will\nbe transformed into B molecules (e.g., a fraction of A will be broken off and\ndiscarded). The resulting string now encodes the user-data in the form of\nAABABBA...BAB. The same STM needle can subsequently read the recorded\ninformation, as A and B would produce different electric signals when the\nstrand passes under the needle. The macromolecule now represents a data block\nto be stored in a \"parking lot\" within the sugar cube, and later brought to a\nread station on demand. Millions of parking spots and thousands of Read/Write\nstations may be integrated within the micro-fabricated sugar cube, thus\nproviding access to petabytes of user-data in a scheme that benefits from the\nmassive parallelism of thousands of Read/Write stations within the same\nthree-dimensionally micro-structured device.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 17:19:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mansuripur", "Masud", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.4355", "submitter": "Neil J.
