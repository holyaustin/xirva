It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in foraging for nutrients and\ndeveloping an optimal transport network of protoplasmic tubes spanning sources\nof nutrients. When placed in an environment with distributed sources of\nnutrients the cell 'computes' an optimal graph spanning the nutrients by\ngrowing a network of protoplasmic tubes. P. polycephalum imitates development\nof man-made transport networks of a country when configuration of nutrients\nrepresents major urban areas. We employ this feature of the slime mould to\nimitate mexican migration to USA. The Mexican migration to USA is the World's\nlargest migration system. We bio-physically imitate the migration using slime\nmould P. polycephalum. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA\nwe imitated development of migratory routes from Mexico-USA border to ten urban\nareas with high concentration of Mexican migrants. From results of laboratory\nexperiments we extracted topologies of migratory routes, and highlighted a role\nof elevations in shaping the human movement networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 21:52:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""], ["Martinez", "Genaro J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0810", "submitter": "Vadym Kliuchnikov", "authors": "Vadym Kliuchnikov and Dmitri Maslov", "title": "Optimization of Clifford Circuits", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

A simple binary receiver\ndetection scheme is proposed where the number of observed molecules is sampled\nat the time when the maximum number of molecules is expected. Insight is also\nprovided into the selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit\nerror probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously\ntransmitted bits.

This is because contexts are often noisy\nowing to unreliable sensing data streams, inaccurate data measurement, fragile\nconnectivity and resource constraints. One of the state-of-the-art efforts is\nCEDA, which concurrently detects context consistency by exploring the\n\\emph{happened-before} relation among events. However, CEDA is seriously\nlimited by several side effects --- centralized detection manner that easily\ngets down the checker process, heavy computing complexity and false negative.\n  In this paper, we propose SECA: Snapshot-based Event Detection for Checking\nAsynchronous Context Consistency in ubiquitous computing. SECA introduces\nsnapshot-based timestamp to check event relations, which can detect scenarios\nwhere CEDA fails. Moreover, it simplifies the logical clock instead of adopting\nthe vector clock, and thus significantly reduces both time and space\ncomplexity. Empirical studies show that SECA outperforms CEDA in terms of\ndetection accuracy, scalability, and computing complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2013 10:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Daqiang", ""], ["Zou", "Qin", ""], ["Sun", "Zhiren", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4787", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "Yessica Saez, Laszlo B.
