In this paper, we propose an Ising cell based on Spin Hall\nEffect (SHE) induced magnetization switching in a Magnetic Tunnel Junction\n(MTJ). The stochasticity of our proposed Ising cell based on SHE induced MTJ\nswitching, can implement the natural annealing process by preventing the system\nfrom being stuck in solutions with local minima. Further, by controlling the\ncurrent through the Heavy-Metal (HM) underlying the MTJ, we can mimic the\nmajority vote function which determines the next state of the individual spins.\nBy solving coupled \\textit{Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert} (LLG) equations, we\ndemonstrate that our Ising cell can be replicated to map certain combinatorial\nproblems. We present results for two representative problems - Maximum-cut and\nGraph coloring - to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed device-circuit\nconfiguration in solving combinatorial problems.

The non-reciprocity of\nboth device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at\nthe input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The\nproposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by\na long FM wire.

This device\nconcept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input\nmajority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin\ntransport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel\nand stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires.
