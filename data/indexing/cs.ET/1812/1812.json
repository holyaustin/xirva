However, this lower bound is\nachievable only for quasistatic, near-equilibrium computations -- that is, only\nover infinite time. In practice, information processing takes place in finite\ntime, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For\noverdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be\ncrafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational\npaths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time\ncomputations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound,\nthat is irretrievably dissipated into the environment. We show that this\ndissipated work is proportional to the computation rate as well as the square\nof the information-storing system's length scale. As a paradigmatic example, we\ndesign shortcuts to erase a bit of information metastably stored in a\ndouble-well potential. Though dissipated work generally increases with erasure\nfidelity, we show that it is possible perform perfect erasure in finite time\nwith finite work. We also show that the robustness of information storage\naffects the energetic cost of erasure---specifically, the dissipated work\nscales as the information lifetime of the bistable system.
