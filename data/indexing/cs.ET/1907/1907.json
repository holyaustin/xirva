Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge\nfor synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN)\nmodel idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the\ncomputational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation\nwith CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the\ninput and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output.\nSpecifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the\ncomputation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and\ncomposable ($f\\circ g$ can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$\nand $g$). Rate independence and composability are important engineering\ndesiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or\neven \"well-mixedness\", and allowing the systematic construction of complex\ncomputation via modular design. We show that to construct composable\nrate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output\nspecies of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We\nthen exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as\nsuperadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus\ncomposability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more\nsophisticated input/output encodings are used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2019 00:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Jan 2020 18:40:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:54:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chalk", "Cameron", ""], ["Kornerup", "Niels", ""], ["Reeves", "Wyatt", ""], ["Soloveichik", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.00285", "submitter": "Amogh Agrawal", "authors": "Amogh Agrawal, Chankyu Lee, Kaushik Roy", "title": "X-CHANGR: Changing Memristive Crossbar Mapping for Mitigating\n  Line-Resistance Induced Accuracy Degradation in Deep Neural Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is widespread interest in emerging technologies, especially resistive\ncrossbars for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Resistive crossbars\noffer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM)\noperation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars\nideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities\nlead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that\nend, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance\ninduced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned\nweights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels\nalong the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away\nfrom the drivers. We rank the DNN weights and kernels based on a sensitivity\nanalysis, and re-arrange the columns such that the most sensitive kernels are\nmapped closer to the drivers, thereby minimizing the impact of errors on the\noverall accuracy. We propose two algorithms $-$ static remapping strategy (SRS)\nand dynamic remapping strategy (DRS), to optimize the crossbar re-arrangement\nof a pre-trained DNN.

PHEVs\nallow the driver to use electric power exclusively for driving and then switch\nto gasoline as needed. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is\nrequired for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot last for a long period on stored\nelectricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging\ncompared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

In QAOA, the objective is a\nfunction of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate\nparameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). A classical\noptimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions\n(quantum state) with significant support to the optimal solution. Even at the\nlowest circuit depth, QAOA offers non-trivial provable performance guarantee\nwhich is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, the existing\nanalysis fails to consider non-idealities in the qubit quality i.e., short\nlifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this\narticle, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance\nof QAOA both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from IBM. Our\nanalyses indicate that the optimal number of stages (p-value) for any QAOA\ninstance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time,\netc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that\nhigher-depth QAOA will provide monotonically better performance for a given\nproblem compared to the low-depth implementations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Jul 2019 22:41:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "Mahabubul", ""], ["Ash-Saki", "Abdullah", ""], ["Ghosh", "Swaroop", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.09664", "submitter": "Kerem Camsari", "authors": "Brian Sutton, Rafatul Faria, Lakshmi A.

The architecture of this probabilistic\ncomputer is similar to a stochastic neural network with the p-bit playing the\nrole of a binary stochastic neuron, but with one key difference: there is no\nsequencer used to enforce an ordering of p-bit updates, as is typically\nrequired. Instead, we explore \\textit{sequencerless} designs where all p-bits\nare allowed to flip autonomously and demonstrate that such designs can allow\nultrafast operation unconstrained by available clock speeds without\ncompromising the solution's fidelity. Based on experimental results from a\nhardware benchmark of the autonomous design and benchmarked device models, we\nproject that a nanomagnetic implementation can scale to achieve petaflips per\nsecond with millions of neurons.
