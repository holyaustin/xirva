This form of communication is attractive\nfor applications where conventional wireless systems perform poorly, from\nnanotechnology to urban health monitoring. Using examples, we demonstrate the\nuse of our platform as a testbed for molecular communication, and illustrate\nthe features of these communication systems using experiments. By providing a\nsimple and inexpensive means of performing experiments, our system fills an\nimportant gap in the molecular communication literature, where much current\nwork is done in simulation with simplified system models. A key finding in this\npaper is that these systems are often nonlinear in practice, whereas current\nsimulations and analysis often assume that the system is linear. However, as we\nshow in this work, despite the nonlinearity, reliable communication is still\npossible. Furthermore, this work motivates future studies on more realistic\nmodelling, analysis, and design of theoretical models and algorithms for these\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 21:46:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Farsad", "Nariman", ""], ["Guo", "Weisi", ""], ["Eckford", "Andrew W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.2040", "submitter": "Rodney Van Meter", "authors": "Rodney Van Meter", "title": "Quantum Computing's Classical Problem, Classical Computing's Quantum\n  Problem", "comments": "Post-proceedings of Quantum Horizons, Taipei, Oct. 2012. 10 pages, no\n  figures", "journal-ref": "Foundations of Physics 44(8), 819-828, Aug. 2014", "doi": "10.1007/s10701-014-9807-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum\ncomputing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of\nclassical computing systems.
