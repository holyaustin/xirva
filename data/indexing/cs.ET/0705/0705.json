It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but\nmore challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,\nsuch as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.\nWhile differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which\nare represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading\nto several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing\nquantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for\nsimulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking\nproblems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum\ncommunication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust\nfor hundreds of qubits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 16:31:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 20:48:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Viamontes", "George F.", ""], ["Markov", "Igor L.", ""], ["Hayes", "John P.", ""]]}]
