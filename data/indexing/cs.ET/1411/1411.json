This problem relates to the verification of Petri\nnets, but existing approaches are not sufficient for providing a single\nguarantee covering an infinite set of possible initial states (molecule counts)\nand an infinite state space potentially explored by the system given any\ninitial state. We address these issues by formulating a new theory of pathway\ndecomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical\nreaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes\nthis basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise\nin molecular implementations, such as what we call \"delayed choice,\" that are\nnot easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway\ndecomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class\nthat includes most currently known enzyme-free DNA implementation techniques.\nWe anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical reaction\nnetwork implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations\nsuch as biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in\nconcurrency theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 04:53:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 18:22:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 20:01:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shin", "Seung Woo", ""], ["Thachuk", "Chris", ""], ["Winfree", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.0784", "submitter": "Genaro J.

Following a specific program, the evolving brain can be trained using\nsubstitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know\nfrom neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is\nelectrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at\nthe molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and\nsynaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates\nand is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual\nprocess of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to\nemerge in the hybrid system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 23:12:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Aur", "Dorian", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.5255", "submitter": "Alex James Dr", "authors": "Alex Pappachen James, Dinesh S.

Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the\np-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of\nreadout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain\nbetter performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it\nattractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of\ndendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having\nmultiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity. The number of synaptic\nconnections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of\nconnections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find\nthe best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.\nHence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network\nsimilar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We\nshow that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this\narchitecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of\nbinary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train\nclassification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation\ntask. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons\ncannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout.\nAn additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the\n'choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event\nrepresentation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems\nwhere the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary\nsynapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 07:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Subhrajit", ""], ["Banerjee", "Amitava", ""], ["Basu", "Arindam", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.6372", "submitter": "Huseyin Birkan Yilmaz", "authors": "Ali Akkaya and H.
