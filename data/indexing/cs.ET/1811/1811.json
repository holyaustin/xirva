However,\nmost LIM approaches reported in literature are not truly \"simultaneous\" as\nduring LIM operation the bitcell can be used only as a Memory cell or only as a\nLogic cell. The bitcell is not capable of storing both the Memory/Logic outputs\nsimultaneously. Here, we propose a novel 'Simultaneous Logic in-Memory' (SLIM)\nmethodology that allows to implement both Memory and Logic operations\nsimultaneously on the same bitcell in a non-destructive manner without losing\nthe previously stored Memory state. Through extensive experiments we\ndemonstrate the SLIM methodology using non-filamentary bilayer analog OxRAM\ndevices with NMOS transistors (2T-1R bitcell). Detailed programming scheme,\narray level implementation and controller architecture are also proposed.\nFurthermore, to study the impact of introducing SLIM array in the memory\nhierarchy, a simple image processing application (edge detection) is also\ninvestigated. It has been estimated that by performing all computations inside\nthe SLIM array, the total Energy Delay Product (EDP) reduces by ~ 40x in\ncomparison to a modern-day computer. EDP saving owing to reduction in data\ntransfer between CPU Memory is observed to be ~ 780x.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2018 13:40:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2020 04:28:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kingra", "Sandeep Kaur", ""], ["Parmar", "Vivek", ""], ["Chang", "Che-Chia", ""], ["Hudec", "Boris", ""], ["Hou", "Tuo-Hung", ""], ["Suri", "Manan", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06011", "submitter": "Alexandru Paler", "authors": "Alexandru Paler, Austin Fowler, Robert Wille", "title": "Faster manipulation of large quantum circuits using wire label reference\n  diagrams", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.DS cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Large scale quantum computing is highly anticipated, and quantum circuit\ndesign automation needs to keep up with the transition from small scale to\nlarge scale problems.

The embedded MRAM-based neuron is modeled using precise\nphysics equations. The simulation results exhibit the desired sigmoidal\nrelation between the input voltages and probability of the output state. A\nprobabilistic inference network simulator (PIN-Sim) is developed to realize a\ncircuit-level model of an RBM utilizing resistive crossbar arrays along with\ndifferential amplifiers to implement the positive and negative weight values.\nThe PIN-Sim is composed of five main blocks to train a DBN, evaluate its\naccuracy, and measure its power consumption. The MNIST dataset is leveraged to\ninvestigate the energy and accuracy tradeoffs of seven distinct network\ntopologies in SPICE using the 14nm HP-FinFET technology library with the\nnominal voltage of 0.8V, in which an MRAM-based neuron is used as the\nactivation function. The software and hardware level simulations indicate that\na $784\\times200\\times10$ topology can achieve less than 5% error rates with\n$\\sim400 pJ$ energy consumption. The error rates can be reduced to 2.5% by\nusing a $784\\times500\\times500\\times500\\times10$ DBN at the cost of\n$\\sim10\\times$ higher energy consumption and significant area overhead.\nFinally, the effects of specific hardware-level parameters on power dissipation\nand accuracy tradeoffs are identified via the developed PIN-Sim framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:23:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zand", "Ramtin", ""], ["Camsari", "Kerem Y.", ""], ["Datta", "Supriyo", ""], ["DeMara", "Ronald F.", ""]]}]
