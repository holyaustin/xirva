Although traditionally non-volatile long-term\nplasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for\nneuromorphic applications, recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that\nbiological synapses undergo meta-stable volatile strengthening followed by a\nlong-term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is\nsufficiently high. Such \"memory strengthening\" and \"memory decay\"\nfunctionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics\nof a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) to short-term plasticity and long-term\npotentiation observed in biological synapses. We illustrate that, in addition\nto the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus, frequency of the stimulus\nplays a critical role in determining long-term potentiation of the MTJ. Such\nMTJ synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact, ultra-fast and\nlow power intelligent neural systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 00:41:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 23:46:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Dec 2017 00:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sengupta", "Abhronil", ""], ["Roy", "Kaushik", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.01892", "submitter": "Sebastian Ahnert", "authors": "S.

Given such limited\nresources, can environmental stimuli play a role in generating the complexity\nof slime mould behaviour? We use a multi-agent collective model of slime mould\nto explore a two-way mechanism where the collective behaviour is influenced by\nsimulated chemical concentration gradient fields and, in turn, this behaviour\nalters the spatial pattern of the concentration gradients. This simple\nmechanism yields complex behaviour amid the dynamically changing gradient\nprofiles and suggests how the apparently intelligent response of the slime\nmould could possibly be due to outsourcing of computation to the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:08:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Jeff", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07651", "submitter": "Jeff Jones Dr", "authors": "Jeff Dale Jones", "title": "Material-based Non-neural Analogues of Lateral Inhibition: A Multi-agent\n  Approach", "comments": "2014 - Adaptive Materials, Devices and Systems Towards Unconventional\n  Computing and Robotics: Modeling and Implementation, 26th-27th September,\n  Rhodes, Greece", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lateral Inhibition (LI) phenomena occur in a wide range of sensory modalities\nand are most famously described in the human visual system.

These PWs have been shown to be self repairing, offering significant\nadvantage over traditional electronic components. This article documents work\nperformed to produce practical circuits using PWs. Method: We have demonstrated\nthrough manufacture and testing of hybrid circuits that PWs can be used to\nproduce a variety of practical electronic circuits. A purality of different\napplications of PWs have been tested to show the universality of PWs in\nanalogue and digital electronics. Results: Voltage dividers can be produced\nusing a pair of PWs in series with an output voltage accurate to within 12%.\nPWs can also transmit analogue and digital data with a frequency of up to 19\nkHz, which with the addition of a buffer, can drive high current circuits. We\nhave demonstrated that PWs can last approximately two months, a 4 fold increase\non previous literature. Protoplasmic tubes can be modified with the addition of\nconductive or magnetic nano-particles to provide changes in functionality.\nConclusion This work has documented novel macro-scale data transmission through\nbiological material; it has advanced the field of bio-electronics by providing\na cheap and easy to grow conducting bio-material which may be used in future\nhybrid electronic technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 23:19:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Whiting", "James G.

One of the main challenges with such systems\nis the limited control the transmitter has on the concentration level at the\nreceiver. For example, concentration cannot be directly decreased by the\ntransmitter, and the decrease in concentration over time occurs solely due to\ntransport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance. In this\nwork, a new and novel scheme is proposed that uses the transmission of acids,\nbases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions for carrying information.
