Detection of these biomarkers is challenging since due to the\ndiffusion and degradation, the biomarkers are only detectable in the vicinity\nof the target. In addition, the exact location of the target within the tissue\nis not known. In this paper, we propose to distribute several reactive\nnanosensors (NSs) across the tissue such that at least some of them are\nexpected to come in contact with biomarkers, which cause them to become\nactivated. Upon activation, an NS releases a certain number of molecules of a\nsecondary type into the medium to alert a fusion center (FC), where the final\ndecision regarding the presence of the target is made. In particular, we\nconsider a composite hypothesis testing framework where it is assumed that the\nlocation of the target and the biomarker secretion rate are unknown, whereas\nthe locations of the NSs are known. We derive the uniformly most powerful (UMP)\ntest for the detection at the NSs. For the final decision at the FC, we show\nthat the UMP test does not exist.

This systematic method enables the automatic\ndesign of a DCNN where all design parameters are jointly optimized.\nExperimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithm can achieve a joint\noptimization of all design parameters given the comprehensive budget of a DCNN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 May 2018 19:21:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Zhe", ""], ["Li", "Ji", ""], ["Ren", "Ao", ""], ["Ding", "Caiwen", ""], ["Draper", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Qiu", "Qinru", ""], ["Yuan", "Bo", ""], ["Wang", "Yanzhi", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.04168", "submitter": "Anh Tuan Nguyen", "authors": "Diu Khue Luu, Anh Tuan Nguyen, Zhi Yang", "title": "Achieving Super-Resolution with Redundant Sensing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (2018)", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2018.2885523", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.ET eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analog-to-digital (quantization) and digital-to-analog (de-quantization)\nconversion are fundamental operations of many information processing systems.\nIn practice, the precision of these operations is always bounded, first by the\nrandom mismatch error (ME) occurred during system implementation, and\nsubsequently by the intrinsic quantization error (QE) determined by the system\narchitecture itself.
