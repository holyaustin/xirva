Most countermeasures are tailored for CMOS integration and tend to\nincur excessive overheads, resulting from additional circuitry or device-level\nmodifications. On the other hand, power density is a critical concern for\nsub-50 nm nodes, necessitating alternate design concepts. Although initially\ntailored for error-tolerant applications, imprecise computing has gained\ntraction as a general-purpose design technique. Emerging devices are currently\nbeing explored to implement ultra-low-power circuits for inexact computing\napplications. In this paper, we quantify the security threats of imprecise\ncomputing using emerging devices. More specifically, we leverage the innate\npolymorphism and tunable stochastic behavior of spin-orbit torque (SOT)\ndevices, particularly, the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch. We enable IP\nprotection (by means of logic locking and camouflaging) simultaneously for\ndeterministic and probabilistic computing, directly at the GSHE device level.\nWe conduct a comprehensive security analysis using state-of-the-art Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT) attacks; this study demonstrates the superior resilience\nof our GSHE primitive when tailored for deterministic computing. We also\ndemonstrate how probabilistic computing can thwart most, if not all, existing\nSAT attacks. Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called\nprobabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking\nand camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how\ncareful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the\napplication of the PSAT attack. Finally, we also discuss side-channel attacks\nand invasive monitoring, which are arguably even more concerning threats than\nSAT attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Mar 2019 14:35:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Patnaik", "Satwik", ""], ["Rangarajan", "Nikhil", ""], ["Knechtel", "Johann", ""], ["Sinanoglu", "Ozgur", ""], ["Rakheja", "Shaloo", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.00836", "submitter": "Raihan Sayeed Khan", "authors": "Raihan Sayeed Khan, Nadim H.

The novel scheme programs the HyperSurface to perform compressed\nsensing of the impinging wave via simple one-antenna power measurements. The\nHyperSurface can jointly be programmed for both wave sensing and wave\nmanipulation duties at the same time. Evaluation via simulations validates the\nconcept and highlight its promising potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:42:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Liaskos", "Christos", ""], ["Tsioliaridou", "Ageliki", ""], ["Pitilakis", "Alexandros", ""], ["Pirialakos", "George", ""], ["Tsilipakos", "Odysseas", ""], ["Tasolamprou", "Anna", ""], ["Kantartzis", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Ioannidis", "Sotiris", ""], ["Kafesaki", "Maria", ""], ["Pitsillides", "Andreas", ""], ["Akyildiz", "Ian", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11236", "submitter": "Julie Grollier", "authors": "M.

In this paper, a novel kind of multilayer neural network is\nproposed, in which diffusion and drift memristor models are applied to\nconstruct a system merging image preprocessing and pattern recognition.\nSpecifically, the entire network consists of two diffusion memristive cellular\nlayers for image preprocessing and one drift memristive feedforward layer for\npattern recognition. Experimental results show that good recognition accuracy\nof noisy MNIST is obtained due to the fusion of image preprocessing and pattern\nrecognition.
