Here we\npresent the integrated circuits that implement this rule and demonstrate their\nexpected behaviour in low-level circuit simulations. Our proposed method paves\nthe way towards a system-level implementation of tightly balanced networks on\nanalog mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Thanks to their coding properties\nand sparse activity, neuromorphic electronic EBNs will be ideally suited for\nextreme-edge computing applications that require low-latency, ultra-low power\nconsumption and which cannot rely on cloud computing for data processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:05:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 09:26:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00fcchel", "Julian", ""], ["Kakon", "Jonathan", ""], ["Perez", "Michel", ""], ["Indiveri", "Giacomo", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.14828", "submitter": "Sebastian Lotter", "authors": "Sebastian Lotter and Maximilian Sch\\\"afer and Johannes Zeitler and\n  Robert Schober", "title": "Receptor Saturation Modeling for Synaptic DMC", "comments": "6 pages, 1 table, 4 figures.

In particular,\nit features highly specialized mechanisms to enable inter-symbol interference\n(ISI)-free and energy efficient communication. The understanding of synaptic MC\nis furthermore critical for disruptive innovations in the context of\nbrain-machine interfaces. However, the physical modeling of synaptic MC is\ncomplicated by the possible saturation of the molecular receiver arising from\nthe competition of postsynaptic receptors for neurotransmitters. Saturation\nrenders the system behavior nonlinear and is commonly neglected in existing\nanalytical models. In this work, we propose a novel model for receptor\nsaturation in terms of a nonlinear, state-dependent boundary condition for\nFick's diffusion equation. We solve the resulting boundary-value problem using\nan eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator and the incorporation of the\nreceiver memory as feedback system into the corresponding state-space\ndescription. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated with particle-based\nstochastic computer simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 09:01:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Lotter", "Sebastian", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Maximilian", ""], ["Zeitler", "Johannes", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15559", "submitter": "Rajkumar Buyya", "authors": "Sukhpal Singh Gill, Adarsh Kumar, Harvinder Singh, Manmeet Singh,\n  Kamalpreet Kaur, Muhammad Usman, Rajkumar Buyya", "title": "Quantum Computing: A Taxonomy, Systematic Review and Future Directions", "comments": "37 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Technical Report CLOUDS-TR-2020-1, Cloud Computing and Distributed\n  Systems Laboratory, The University of Melbourne, Australia, September 28,\n  2020", "categories": "cs.ET cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer\nsignificant computational advantage over conventional classical computing by\nexploiting quantum-mechanical principles such as entanglement and\nsuperposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of quantum\ncomputing will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable\nproblems in several areas such as drug design, data science, clean energy,\nfinance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and quantum\nchemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum hardware\ndevelopment and quantum software/algorithm have brought quantum computing much\ncloser to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a\nsignificant milestone in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era - the\nnext logical step being the quantum advantage whereby quantum computers solve a\nreal-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing. As the\nquantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years,\nquantum decoherence and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges\nto achieve quantum advantage in the NISQ era. Quantum computing is a highly\ntopical and fast-moving field of research with significant ongoing progress in\nall facets. This article presents a comprehensive review of quantum computing\nliterature, and taxonomy of quantum computing. Further, the proposed taxonomy\nis used to map various related studies to identify the research gaps.
