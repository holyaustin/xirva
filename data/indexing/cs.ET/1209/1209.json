Recently, by using a\ntime-multiplexed architecture, hardware reservoir computers have reached\nperformance comparable to digital implementations. Operating speeds allowing\nfor real time information operation have been reached using optoelectronic\nsystems. At present the main performance bottleneck is the readout layer which\nuses slow, digital postprocessing. We have designed an analog readout suitable\nfor time-multiplexed optoelectronic reservoir computers, capable of working in\nreal time. The readout has been built and tested experimentally on a standard\nbenchmark task. Its performance is better than non-reservoir methods, with\nample room for further improvement. The present work thereby overcomes one of\nthe major limitations for the future development of hardware reservoir\ncomputers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 08:56:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Smerieri", "Anteo", ""], ["Duport", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Paquot", "Yvan", ""], ["Schrauwen", "Benjamin", ""], ["Haelterman", "Marc", ""], ["Massar", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5013", "submitter": "Ligia Cremene dr", "authors": "Ligia Cremene, Dumitru Dumitrescu", "title": "Analysis of Cognitive Radio Scenes Based on Non-cooperative Game\n  Theoretical Modelling", "comments": "8 double-column pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1209.5387", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1049/iet-com.2011.0712", "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO cs.ET cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A noncooperative game theoretical approach for analysing opportunistic\nspectrum access (OSA) in cognitive radio (CR) environments is proposed. New\nconcepts from game theory are applied to spectrum access analysis in order to\nextract rules of behaviour for an emerging environment. In order to assess OSA\nscenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of\nresource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:\nsimultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and\nasymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access\n(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game\nsolutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter\ncaptures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting\ndifferent types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic\nmodelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium\ndetection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of\nchannels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium\ndescribes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable\nsolutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are\nmaximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new\nentrants are Pareto driven.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2012 18:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 05:32:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Cremene", "Ligia", ""], ["Dumitrescu", "Dumitru", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5491", "submitter": "Martin Roetteler", "authors": "Brittanney Amento, Martin Roetteler, Rainer Steinwandt", "title": "Quantum binary field inversion: improved circuit depth via choice of\n  basis representation", "comments": "17 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Quantum Information & Computation 13(1-2): 116-134 (2013)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.DS cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Finite fields of the form GF(2^m) play an important role in coding theory and\ncryptography.
