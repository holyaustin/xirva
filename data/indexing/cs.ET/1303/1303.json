A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to\nre-synthesize circuits with additional ancillae to reduce T-depth at\neffectively no cost.

Its computational intractability has\nattracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not\noptimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple\nunconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a\nvirtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the\nmaterial emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles\nmoving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a\nset of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,\nand the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it\nmorphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage\nprocess automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all\ncities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is\nelicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated\ndatasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean\nbest tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour\nlength of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an\nexact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob\nconstructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and\ndiscuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group\npoints on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially\nrepresented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between\nthis method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and\nsuggest possibilities for further improvement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:36:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 17:45:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Jeff", ""], ["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7220", "submitter": "Larry Bull", "authors": "Larry Bull", "title": "On Mobile DNA in Artificial Regulatory Networks: Evolving Functional and\n  Structural Dynamism", "comments": "24 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is a growing body of work considering the use of representations based\nupon genetic regulatory networks.
