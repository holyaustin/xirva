This protocol\nentirely avoids collisions. It is assumed that the network consists of one\naccess point and two client stations. We extend this scheme to a network with\nan arbitrary number of client stations. We propose three approaches, namely,\nthe qubit distribution, transmit first election and temporal ordering\nprotocols. The qubit distribution protocol leverages the concepts of Bell-EPR\npair or W state triad. It works for networks of up to four CSs. With up to\nthree CSs, there is no probability of collision. In a four-CS network, there is\na low probability of collision. The transmit first election protocol and\ntemporal ordering protocols work for a network with any number of CSs. The\ntransmit first election builds upon the concept of W state of size\ncorresponding to the number of client stations. It is fair and collision free.\nThe temporal ordering protocol employs the concepts of Lehmer code and quantum\noracle. It is collision free, has a normalized throughput of 100% and achieves\nquasi-fairness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 15:58:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Barbeau", "Michel", ""], ["Cloutier", "Steve R.", ""], ["Garcia-Alfaro", "Joaquin", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.01060", "submitter": "Peng He", "authors": "Peng He, Yuming Mao, Qiang Liu and Kun Yang", "title": "A Diffusion-Neuron Hybrid System for Molecular Communication", "comments": "6 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Diffusion-based and neural communication are two interesting domains in\nmolecular communication.
