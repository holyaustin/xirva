One of the most prospective candidates to provide\ncomparable complexity, while operating much faster and with manageable power\ndissipation, are so-called CrossNets based on hybrid CMOS/memristor circuits.\nIn these circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several\ncrossbar layers, with adjustable two-terminal memristors at each crosspoint.\nRecently, there was a significant progress in improvement of technology of\nfabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS\ncircuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration.\nSeparately, there have been several demonstrations of discrete memristors as\nartificial synapses for neuromorphic networks. Very recently such experiments\nwere extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The\nadjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each\ncrosspoint, and hence the prospects of their scaling are less impressive than\nthose of metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear I-V curves enable\ntransistor-free operation. Here we report the first experimental implementation\nof a transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbar with device variability\nlowered sufficiently to demonstrate a successful operation of a simple\nintegrated neural network, a single layer-perceptron. The network could be\ntaught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta-rule algorithm to\nperform the perfect classification of 3x3-pixel black/white images into 3\nclasses. We believe that this demonstration is an important step towards the\nimplementation of much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 19:42:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Prezioso", "Mirko", ""], ["Merrikh-Bayat", "Farnood", ""], ["Hoskins", "Brian", ""], ["Adam", "Gina", ""], ["Likharev", "Konstantin K.", ""], ["Strukov", "Dmitri B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.0625", "submitter": "Peter Selinger", "authors": "Jonathan M.
