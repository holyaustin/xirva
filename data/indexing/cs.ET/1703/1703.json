Therefore, multiple quantum technologies and quantum error correcting\ncodes strongly require the interacting qubits to be arranged in a nearest\nneighbor (NN) fashion. The current literature on converting a given quantum\ncircuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or\nLinear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology.
