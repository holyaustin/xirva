This paper describes a design of cross-point architecture for\nSTT-MRAM. The mean area per word corresponds to only two transistors, which are\nshared by a number of bits (e.g. 64). This leads to significant improvement of\ndata density (e.g. 1.75 F2/bit). Special techniques are also presented to\naddress the sneak currents and low speed issues of conventional cross-point\narchitecture, which are difficult to surmount and few efficient design\nsolutions have been reported in the literature. By using a STT-MRAM SPICE model\nincluding precise experimental parameters and STMicroelectronics 65 nm\ntechnology, some chip characteristic results such as cell area, data access\nspeed and power have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected\nperformances of this new memory architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 17:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Weisheng", ""], ["Chaudhuri", "Sumanta", ""], ["Accoto", "Celso", ""], ["Klein", "Jacques-Olivier", ""], ["Chappert", "Claude", ""], ["Mazoyer", "Pascale", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2075", "submitter": "Nicolas Sturmel Dr", "authors": "Nicolas Sturmel and Laurent Daudet", "title": "Informed Source Separation using Iterative Reconstruction", "comments": "submitted to the IEEE transactions on Audio, Speech and Language\n  Processing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a technique for Informed Source Separation (ISS) of a\nsingle channel mixture, based on the Multiple Input Spectrogram Inversion\nmethod.

We formulate the\nSignal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), based on the model of Padilla, Liu,\nand Seeman to be asynchronous, allowing any action of turning a glue on or off,\nattaching a new tile, or breaking apart an assembly to happen in any order.\nWithin this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile\nself-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile\nAssembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for\nsubstantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result\nutilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly\nof linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in\nstandard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles\nsimulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant\nnumber of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete\nSierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly\nself-assembled within the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that\nit is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well\nstudied tile self-assembly models. Notably, all of our constructions are at\ntemperature 1, further demonstrating that signal-passing confers the power to\nbypass many restrictions found in standard tile assembly models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 19:16:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 06:18:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Nov 2013 01:15:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Padilla", "Jennifer E.", ""], ["Patitz", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Pena", "Raul", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert T.", ""], ["Seeman", "Nadrian C.", ""], ["Sheline", "Robert", ""], ["Summers", "Scott M.", ""], ["Zhong", "Xingsi", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6614", "submitter": "Mehdi Saeedi", "authors": "Igor L.
