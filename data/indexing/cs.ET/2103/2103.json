We have leveraged the\nDataset Lifecycle Framework which takes care of all the low-level details about\ndata access in Kubernetes pods. Its pluggable architecture is designed for the\ndevelopment of caching, scheduling and governance plugins. Together, they\nmanage the entire lifecycle of the custom resource Dataset.\n  We use Dataset Lifecycle Framework to serve data from object stores to both\nML and non-ML pipelines running on Kubeflow. With DLF, we make training data\nfed into ML models directly without being downloaded to the local disks, which\nmakes the input scalable. We have enhanced the durability of training metadata\nby storing it into a dataset, which also simplifies the set up of the\nTensorboard, separated from the notebook server. For the non-ML pipeline, we\nhave simplified the 1000 Genome Project pipeline with datasets injected into\nthe pipeline dynamically.

Receiver saturation renders\nthe system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly\nneglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'\ncompetition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at\nthe molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial\nmodel for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,\nwe propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a\nstate-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion\nequation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation\nat the molecular receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received\nsignal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when\nreceptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the\nreceived signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for\nthe competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs.\nThe proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by\nthe number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics\nof the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show that\nthe impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative\nnumbers of NTs and receptors.

In contrast to conventional\nrepresentation schemes used within the binary domain, the sequence of bit\nstreams in the stochastic domain is inconsequential, and computation is usually\nnon-deterministic. In this brief, we exploit the stochasticity during switching\nof probabilistic Conductive Bridging RAM (CBRAM) devices to efficiently\ngenerate stochastic bit streams in order to perform Deep Learning (DL)\nparameter optimization, reducing the size of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC)\nunits by 5 orders of magnitude.

Finally, a passive channel estimation methodology exploiting deep\nneural networks and scene images is discussed as a potential solution to\nenabling CSI availability without utilizing resource-hungry pilots.
