Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable\nplatforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital\nmicrofluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is\nperformed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of\na sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume\ndroplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume\ndaughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is\ndue to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced\nfollowing a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different\nmix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the\ntarget-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in\nlife-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several\nerror-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for\nDMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the\ndynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed.

Increasingly, data-related issues are equally as important as the\nalgorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce\nan open source GPU-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning\nreactive potential energy surfaces (PESs), and investigate the use of real-time\ninteractive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new\nstrategy for rapidly sampling geometries along reaction pathways which can be\nused to train NNs to learn reactive PESs. Focussing on hydrogen abstraction\nreactions of CN radical with isopentane, we compare the performance of NNs\ntrained using iMD-VR data versus NNs trained using a more traditional method,\nnamely molecular dynamics (MD) constrained to sample a predefined grid of\npoints along hydrogen abstraction reaction coordinates. Both the NN trained\nusing iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce\nimportant qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early\nbarrier to abstraction. Quantitatively, learning is sensitive to the training\ndataset. Our results show that user-sampled structures obtained with the\nquantum chemical iMD-VR machinery enable better sampling in the vicinity of the\nminimum energy path (MEP). As a result, the NN trained on the iMD-VR data does\nvery well predicting energies in the vicinity of the MEP, but less well\npredicting energies for 'off-path' structures. The NN trained on the\nconstrained MD data does better in predicting energies for 'off-path'\nstructures, given that it included a number of such structures in its training\nset.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 18:09:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2019 20:08:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Amabilino", "Silvia", ""], ["Bratholm", "Lars A.", ""], ["Bennie", "Simon J.", ""], ["Vaucher", "Alain C.", ""], ["Reiher", "Markus", ""], ["Glowacki", "David R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.05519", "submitter": "Andrew Adamatzky", "authors": "Alessandro Chiolerio, Carsten Jost, Thomas C.

Despite the long history of the Principle, its\nfundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently\nmisunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is\nejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from\nour perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total\nentropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational\ninformation motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the\nrequirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less\nrestrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic\ncomputational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of\ncomputational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational\noperations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be\nfully explored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2019 18:52:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Michael P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10351", "submitter": "Aayush Ankit", "authors": "Aayush Ankit, Izzat El Hajj, Sai Rahul Chalamalasetti, Geoffrey Ndu,\n  Martin Foltin, R.

We explore the feasibility of\nsolving this problem by proposing a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) model. In recent years this QUBO formulation has gained\nincreasing attention since it represents the input for the specialized quantum\nannealer D-Wave machines. Hence, our contribution takes an important first step\ntowards the sampling optimization of Gaussian processes in the context of\nquantum computation. Results of our empirical evaluation shows that the optimum\nof the QUBO objective function we derived represents a good solution for the\nabove mentioned problem.

A transmitter NM (TN) sends the information symbols by\nemitting molecules into the transmission medium and a receiver NM (RN) receives\nthe information symbols by sensing the molecule concentration. In this paper, a\nmodel of how a RN measures and reconstructs the molecular signal is proposed.\nThe signal around the RN is assumed to be a Gaussian random process instead of\ndeterministic approach in a more realistic way. After the reconstructed signal\nis derived as a Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process (DSPP), the distortion\nbetween the signal around the RN and the reconstructed signal is derived as a\nnew performance parameter in MC systems. The derived distortion which is a\nfunction of system parameters such as RN radius, sampling period and the\ndiffusion coefficient of the channel, is shown to be valid by employing random\nwalk simulations. Then, it is shown that the original signal can be\nsatisfactorily reconstructed with a sufficiently low-level of distortion.\nFinally, optimum RN design parameters, namely RN radius, sampling period and\nsampling frequency, are derived by minimizing the signal distortion. The\nsimulation results reveal that there is a trade-off among the RN design\nparameters which can be jointly set for a desired signal distortion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 07:10:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 09:37:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Atakan", "Baris", ""], ["Gulec", "Fatih", ""]]}]
