A 1T-1R synapse, adding a transistor (1T) in series with the memristive\nsynapse (1R), has been proposed to mitigate such non-idealities. We observe\nthat the non-linear characteristics of the transistor affect the overall\nconductance of the 1T-1R cell which in turn affects the\nMatrix-Vector-Multiplication (MVM) operation in crossbars. This 1T-1R\nnon-ideality arising from the input voltage-dependent non-linearity is not only\ndifficult to model or formulate, but also causes a drastic performance\ndegradation of DNNs when mapped onto crossbars. In this paper, we analyse the\nnon-linearity of the 1T-1R crossbar and propose a novel Non-linearity Aware\nTraining (NEAT) method to address the non-idealities. Specifically, we first\nidentify the range of network weights, which can be mapped into the 1T-1R cell\nwithin the linear operating region of the transistor. Thereafter, we regularize\nthe weights of the DNNs to exist within the linear operating range by using\niterative training algorithm. Our iterative training significantly recovers the\nclassification accuracy drop caused by the non-linearity. Moreover, we find\nthat each layer has a different weight distribution and in turn requires\ndifferent gate voltage of transistor to guarantee linear operation. Based on\nthis observation, we achieve energy efficiency while preserving classification\naccuracy by applying heterogeneous gate voltage control to the 1T-1R cells\nacross different layers. Finally, we conduct various experiments on CIFAR10 and\nCIFAR100 benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nnon-linearity aware training.

The visioning and\nforecasting of how to bring computation to the edge in smart sensors have\nalready begun, with an aspiration to provide adaptive extreme edge computing.\nHere, we provide a holistic view of hardware and theoretical solutions towards\nsmart wearable devices that can provide guidance to research in this pervasive\ncomputing era. We propose various solutions for biologically plausible models\nfor continual learning in neuromorphic computing technologies for wearable\nsensors. To envision this concept, we provide a systematic outline in which\nprospective low power and low latency scenarios of wearable sensors in\nneuromorphic platforms are expected. We successively describe vital potential\nlandscapes of neuromorphic processors exploiting complementary metal-oxide\nsemiconductors (CMOS) and emerging memory technologies (e.g. memristive\ndevices). Furthermore, we evaluate the requirements for edge computing within\nwearable devices in terms of footprint, power consumption, latency, and data\nsize. We additionally investigate the challenges beyond neuromorphic computing\nhardware, algorithms and devices that could impede enhancement of adaptive edge\ncomputing in smart wearable devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2020 20:48:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Covi", "Erika", ""], ["Donati", "Elisa", ""], ["Heidari", "Hadi", ""], ["Kappel", "David", ""], ["Liang", "Xiangpeng", ""], ["Payvand", "Melika", ""], ["Wang", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15748", "submitter": "Sergi Abadal", "authors": "Seyed Ehsan Hosseininejad, Kasra Rouhi, Mohammad Neshat, Albert\n  Cabellos-Aparicio, Sergi Abadal and Eduard Alarc\\'on", "title": "Digital Metasurface Based on Graphene: An Application to Beam Steering\n  in Terahertz Plasmonic Antennas", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology, vol. 18, no. 1, pp. 734-746,\n  December 2019", "doi": "10.1109/TNANO.2019.2923727", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.app-ph cs.ET physics.optics", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Metasurfaces, the two-dimensional counterpart of metamaterials, have caught\ngreat attention thanks to their powerful capabilities on manipulation of\nelectromagnetic waves. Recent times have seen the emergence of a variety of\nmetasurfaces exhibiting not only countless functionalities, but also a\nreconfigurable response. Additionally, digital or coding metasurfaces have\nrevolutionized the field by describing the device as a matrix of discrete\nbuilding block states, thus drawing clear parallelisms with information theory\nand opening new ways to model, compose, and (re)program advanced metasurfaces.\nThis paper joins the reconfigurable and digital approaches, and presents a\nmetasurface that leverages the tunability of graphene to perform beam steering\nat terahertz frequencies. A comprehensive design methodology is presented\nencompassing technological, unit cell design, digital metamaterial synthesis,\nand programmability aspects. By setting up and dynamically adjusting a phase\ngradient along the metasurface plane, the resulting device achieves beam\nsteering at all practical directions. The proposed design is studied through\nanalytical models and validated numerically, showing beam widths and steering\nerrors well below 10 degrees and 5% in most cases. Finally, design guidelines\nare extracted through a scalability analysis involving the metasurface size and\nnumber of unit cell states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2020 21:05:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseininejad", "Seyed Ehsan", ""], ["Rouhi", "Kasra", ""], ["Neshat", "Mohammad", ""], ["Cabellos-Aparicio", "Albert", ""], ["Abadal", "Sergi", ""], ["Alarc\u00f3n", "Eduard", ""]]}]
