In this work, we investigate theoretically\nthe artificial implementation of such \"resonate-and-fire\" neurons by utilizing\nthe magnetization dynamics of a fixed magnetic skyrmion in the free layer of a\nmagnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). To realize firing of this nanomagnetic\nimplementation of an artificial neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of\nmagnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain as an input (spike or\nsinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\n(PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a\nskyrmion core that mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input\npulse having an interval close to the breathing period or a sinusoidal input\nclose to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics of the fixed\nskyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the\nMTJ layer due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to\ndrive a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which\nproduces spike outputs. By rigorous micromagnetic simulation, we investigate\nthe interspike timing dependence and response to different excitatory and\ninhibitory incoming input pulses. Finally, we show that such resonate and fire\nneurons have potential application in coupled nanomagnetic oscillator based\nassociative memory arrays.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 20:14:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Azam", "Md.
