The objective is to obtain a LNN architecture with minimum gate\ncost. As achieving optimal synthesis is a hard problem, heuristic methods have\nbeen proposed in recent literature. In this work we present a graph\npartitioning based approach for LNN synthesis with reduction in circuit cost.\nIn particular, the number of SWAP gates required to convert a given gate-level\nquantum circuit to its equivalent LNN configuration is minimized. Our algorithm\ndetermines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s) for both single\ncontrol and multiple controlled gates. Experimental results for placing the\ntarget qubits of Multiple Controlled Toffoli (MCT) library of benchmark\ncircuits show a significant reduction in gate count and quantum gate cost\ncompared to those of related research works.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2011 16:30:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 03:02:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chakrabarti", "Amlan", ""], ["Sur-Kolay", "Susmita", ""], ["Chaudhury", "Ayan", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.2156", "submitter": "Simon Gay", "authors": "Simon J.

Among\nvarious propositions, Spiking Neural Network (SNN) seems a valid candidate. (i)\nIn terms of functions, SNN using relative spike timing for information coding\nare deemed to be the most effective at taking inspiration from the brain to\nallow fast and efficient processing of information for complex tasks in\nrecognition or classification. (ii) In terms of technology, SNN may be able to\nbenefit the most from nanodevices, because SNN architectures are intrinsically\ntolerant to defective devices and performance variability. Here we demonstrate\nSpike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a basic and primordial learning\nfunction in the brain, with a new class of synapstor (synapse-transistor),\ncalled Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect Transistor (NOMFET). We show\nthat this learning function is obtained with a simple hybrid material made of\nthe self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and organic semiconductor thin films.\nBeyond mimicking biological synapses, we also demonstrate how the shape of the\napplied spikes can tailor the STDP learning function. Moreover, the experiments\nand modeling show that this synapstor is a memristive device. Finally, these\nsynapstors are successfully coupled with a CMOS platform emulating the pre- and\npost-synaptic neurons, and a behavioral macro-model is developed on usual\ndevice simulator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 08:13:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Alibart", "F.", ""], ["Pleutin", "S.", ""], ["Bichler", "O.", ""], ["Gamrat", "C.", ""], ["Serrano-Gotarredona", "T.", ""], ["Linares-Barranco", "B.", ""], ["Vuillaume", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.4055", "submitter": "Bartlomiej Placzek", "authors": "Bart{\\l}omiej P{\\l}aczek", "title": "Fuzzy cellular model for on-line traffic simulation", "comments": "The original publication is available at http://www.springerlink.com", "journal-ref": "P{\\l}aczek, B., Fuzzy Cellular Model for On-Line Traffic\n  Simulation.

This is due to the enormous flexibility these\nelements provide in solving diverse problems in analog/neuromorphic and\ndigital/quantum computation; the possibility to use them in an integrated\ncomputing-memory paradigm, massively-parallel solution of different\noptimization problems, learning, neural networks, etc. The time is therefore\nripe to introduce these elements to the next generation of physicists and\nengineers with appropriate teaching tools that can be easily implemented in\nundergraduate teaching laboratories. In this paper, we suggest the use of\neasy-to-build emulators to provide a hands-on experience for the students to\nlearn the fundamental properties and realize several applications of these\nmemelements. We provide explicit examples of problems that could be tackled\nwith these emulators that range in difficulty from the demonstration of the\nbasic properties of memristive, memcapacitive, and meminductive systems to\nlogic/computation and cross-bar memory. The emulators can be built from\noff-the-shelf components, with a total cost of a few tens of dollars, thus\nproviding a relatively inexpensive platform for the implementation of these\nexercises in the classroom. We anticipate that this experiment-based learning\ncan be easily adopted and expanded by the instructors with many more case\nstudies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 19:38:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pershin", "Y.
