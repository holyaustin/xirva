The biological nature of\nchemical signaling makes MC a promising methodology for interdisciplinary\napplications requiring communication between cells and other microscale\ndevices. However, since the life sciences and communications engineering fields\nhave distinct approaches to formulating and solving research problems, the\nmismatch between them can hinder the translation of research results and impede\nthe development and implementation of interdisciplinary solutions. To bridge\nthis gap, this survey proposes a novel communication hierarchy for MC signaling\nin cell biology and maps phenomena, contributions, and problems to the\nhierarchy. The hierarchy includes: 1) the Physical Signal Propagation level; 2)\nthe Physical and Chemical Signal Interaction level; 3) the Signal-Data\nInterface level; 4) the Local Data Abstraction level; and 5) the Application\nlevel. To further demonstrate the proposed hierarchy, it is applied to case\nstudies on quorum sensing, neuronal signaling, and communication via DNA.\nFinally, several open problems are identified for each level and the\nintegration of multiple levels. The proposed hierarchy provides language for\ncommunication engineers to study and interface with biological systems, and\nalso helps biologists to understand how communications engineering concepts can\nbe exploited to interpret, control, and manipulate signaling in cell biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 20:44:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bi", "Dadi", ""], ["Almpanis", "Apostolos", ""], ["Noel", "Adam", ""], ["Deng", "Yansha", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00112", "submitter": "Francesco Caravelli", "authors": "Forrest C.

We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with\ntransmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement\nsurface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains.\nSpecifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them in layers\ndistributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon.\n  Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a\nminimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient\noperations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical\nqubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice\nsurgery CNOTs.
