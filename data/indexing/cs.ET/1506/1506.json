In the\nconstruction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly\nused to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic\ngates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and\nFredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be\nexpensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla\nbits a practical topic.\n  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single\nbase gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of\nthe 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three\nmain results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can\ngenerate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated\nToffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations\nusing no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative\nreversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known\nresult for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known\nresult for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is\ntrivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove\ntheir optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible\ngates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We\nalso explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new\nconcept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an\nunlimited number of borrowed bits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 19:12:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Siyao", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.04923", "submitter": "Kumar Sankar Ray", "authors": "Kumar Sankar Ray and Mandrita Mondal", "title": "Logical Inference by DNA Strand Algebra", "comments": "18 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on the concept of DNA strand displacement and DNA strand algebra we\nhave developed a method for logical inference which is not based on silicon\nbased computing.
