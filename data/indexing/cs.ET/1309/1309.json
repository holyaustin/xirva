The journey begins with the result that there is a single\nuniversal tile set that, with proper initialization and scaling, simulates any\ntile assembly system. This universal tile set exhibits something stronger than\nTuring universality: it captures the geometry and dynamics of any simulated\nsystem. From there we find that there is no such tile set in the\nnoncooperative, or temperature 1, model, proving it weaker than the full tile\nassembly model. In the two-handed or hierarchal model, where large assemblies\ncan bind together on one step, we encounter an infinite set, of infinite\nhierarchies, each with strictly increasing simulation power. Towards the end of\nour trip, we find one tile to rule them all: a single rotatable flipable\npolygonal tile that can simulate any tile assembly system. It seems this could\nbe the beginning of a much longer journey, so directions for future work are\nsuggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Sep 2013 08:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Woods", "Damien", "", "California Institute of Technology"]]}, {"id": "1309.1273", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Jacob Hendricks (University of Arkansas), Matthew J.

We work with 2-dimensional systems in\nboth models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems\nto simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems. We\nuse notions of simulate which are similar to those used in the study of\nintrinsic universality since they are in some sense strict, but also\nintuitively natural notions of simulation.
