Spin-based threshold logic\ndesign is presented as an example (dynamic resisitve threshold logic and\nmagnetic threshold logic). Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultralow-\nvoltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing\ncapabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for\nnon-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing.\nIntegration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and\nresistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing\nhardware for applications like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing,\nimage-processing and data-conversion.

Equipped\nwith a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient\nenvironments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit\npackets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,\nintolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source\nalways waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable\nEnergy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged\npackets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay\nand power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal\nscheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a\ncapacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The\nproposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and\nresorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing\nprocesses, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through\ntwodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we\nderive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the\ncorresponding transmission parameters.
