To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first time that circuits based on memristors are proposed for simulations.\nWe study the performance of these analog computers by simulating\nintegro-differential models related to fluid dynamics, nonlinear Volterra\nequations for population growth, and quantum models describing non-Markovian\nmemory effects, among others. Finally, we perform stability tests by\nconsidering imperfect analog components, obtaining robust solutions with up to\n$13\\%$ relative error for relevant timescales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2018 18:53:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2019 13:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2019 23:32:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Barrios", "G.

In this paper, we identify three\nmajor decision making factors for the selection of an approximate multipliers\ncircuit: (1) the type of approximate full adder (FA) used to construct the\nmultiplier, (2) the architecture, i.e., array or tree, of the multiplier and\n(3) the placement of sub-modules of approximate and exact multipliers in the\nmain multiplier module. Based on these factors, we explored the design space\nfor circuit level implementations of approximate multipliers. We used circuit\nlevel implementations of some of the most widely used approximate full adders,\ni.e., approximate mirror adders, XOR/XNOR based approximate full adders and\nInexact adder cell. These FA cells are then used to develop circuits for the\napproximate high order compressors as building blocks for 8x8 array and tree\nmultipliers.
