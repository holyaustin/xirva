This so-called quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is\nborn out of topological correlations, and is oblivious of low-sample quality.\nIt was envisioned to lead towards dissipationless and topologically protected\nelectronics. However, no clear framework of how to design such an electronic\ndevice out of it exists. Here we construct an ultra-low power, non-volatile,\ncryogenic memory architecture leveraging the QAHE phenomenon. Our design\npromises orders of magnitude lower cell area compared with the state-of-the-art\ncryogenic memory technologies. We harness the fundamentally quantized Hall\nresistance levels in moir\\'e graphene heterostructures to store non-volatile\nbinary bits (1, 0). We perform the memory write operation through controlled\nhysteretic switching between the quantized Hall states, using nano-ampere level\ncurrents with opposite polarities. The non-destructive read operation is\nperformed by sensing the polarity of the transverse Hall voltage using a\nseparate pair of terminals. We custom design the memory architecture with a\nnovel sensing mechanism to avoid accidental data corruption, ensure highest\nmemory density and minimize array leakage power. Our design is transferrable to\nany material platform exhibiting QAHE, and provides a pathway towards realizing\ntopologically protected memory devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2020 02:33:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "Shamiul", ""], ["Hossain", "Md Shafayat", ""], ["Aziz", "Ahmedullah", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00448", "submitter": "Hyokeun Lee", "authors": "Hyokeun Lee, Seungyong Lee, Byeongki Song, Moonsoo Kim, Seokbo Shim,\n  Hyun Kim, Hyuk-Jae Lee", "title": "Mitigating Write Disturbance Errors of Phase-Change Memory as In-Module\n  Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the growing demand for technology scaling and storage capacity in server\nsystems to support high-performance computing, phase-change memory (PCM) has\ngarnered attention as the next-generation non-volatile memory to satisfy these\nrequirements. However, write disturbance error (WDE) appears as a serious\nreliability problem preventing PCM from general commercialization. WDE occurs\non the neighboring cells of a written cell due to heat dissipation. Previous\nstudies for the prevention of WDEs are based on the write cache or\nverify-n-correction while they often suffer from significant area overhead and\nperformance degradation, making it unsuitable for high-performance computing.\nTherefore, an on-demand correction is required to minimize the performance\noverhead. In this paper, an in-module disturbance barrier (IMDB) mitigating\nWDEs is proposed. IMDB includes two sets of SRAMs into two levels and evicts\nentries with a policy that leverages the characteristics of WDE. In this work,\nthe comparator dedicated to the replacement policy requires significant\nhardware resources and latency.

Beyond a\nfield of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require\nefficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision\nproblem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,\nbelieved to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for\nthe worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of\nBoolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the\nworst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a\nmemory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its\nnon-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows\nevidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving \"hard\"\nplanted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve\nin the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the\nSAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an\nexponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to\nthe collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that\npersist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even\nin the presence of numerical errors.

Furthermore, since decades the idea of exploiting\nnonlinear physical phenomena \"directly\" for non-digital computing has been\nexplored under names like \"unconventional computing\", \"natural computing\",\n\"physical computing\", or \"in-materio computing\". This has been taking place in\nniches which are small compared to other sectors of computer science. In this\npaper I stake out the grounds of how a general concept of \"computing\" can be\ndeveloped which comprises digital, neuromorphic, unconventional and possible\nfuture \"computing\" paradigms. The main contribution of this paper is a\nwide-scope survey of existing formal conceptualizations of \"computing\". The\nsurvey inspects approaches rooted in three different kinds of background\nmathematics: discrete-symbolic formalisms, probabilistic modeling, and\ndynamical-systems oriented views. It turns out that different choices of\nbackground mathematics lead to decisively different understandings of what\n\"computing\" is. Across all of this diversity, a unifying coordinate system for\ntheorizing about \"computing\" can be distilled. Within these coordinates I\nlocate anchor points for a foundational formal theory of a future\ncomputing-engineering discipline that includes, but will reach beyond, digital\nand neuromorphic computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2020 10:37:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 22:45:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 3 Apr 2021 09:24:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Jaeger", "Herbert", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.12110", "submitter": "Steven Kisseleff", "authors": "Steven Kisseleff, Symeon Chatzinotas and Bj\\\"orn Ottersten", "title": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Challenging Environments:\n  Underwater, Underground, Industrial and Disaster", "comments": "16 pages, 13 figures, submitted for publication in IEEE journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced to improve\nthe signal propagation characteristics by focusing the signal power in the\npreferred direction, thus making the communication environment \"smart\".

In this paper, we focus on\nmodulation design for molecular communication via diffusion systems. In these\nsystems, chemical signals are transported using diffusion, possibly assisted by\nflow, from the transmitter to the receiver. This tutorial presents recent\nadvancements in modulation and demodulation schemes for molecular communication\nvia diffusion. We compare five different modulation types: concentration-based,\ntype-based, timing-based, spatial, and higher-order modulation techniques. The\nend-to-end system designs for each modulation scheme are presented. In\naddition, the key metrics used in the literature to evaluate the performance of\nthese techniques are also presented.

We propose SwitchX mapping of\nweights onto crossbars such that the power consumed by the crossbars and the\nimpact of crossbar non-idealities, that lead to degradation in computational\naccuracy, are minimized. Essentially, SwitchX maps the binary weights in such\nmanner that the crossbar comprises of more HRS than LRS synapses. Increased HRS\nin a crossbar will decrease the overall output dot-product current and thus\nlead to power savings. Interestingly, BNNs mapped onto crossbars with SwitchX\nalso exhibit better robustness against adversarial attacks than the\ncorresponding software BNN baseline as well as the standard crossbar mapped\nBNNs. Finally, we combine SwitchX with state-aware training (that further\nincreases the feasibility of HRS states during weight mapping) to boost the\nrobustness and energy-efficiency of BNN on hardware. We find that this approach\nyields stronger defense against adversarial attacks than Adversarial training,\na state-of-the-art software defense.
