Mazes are prototype models in graph\ntheory, topology, robotics, traffic optimization, psychology, and in many other\nareas of science and technology. However, when maze complexity increases their\nsolution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming. Here, we show that a\nnetwork of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non-trivial\nproblem quite easily. In particular, maze solving by the network of memristors\noccurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network\nparticipate simultaneously in the calculation. The result of the calculation is\nthen recorded into the memristors' states, and can be used and/or recovered at\na later time. Furthermore, the network of memristors finds all possible\nsolutions in multiple-solution mazes, and sorts out the solution paths\naccording to their length. Our results demonstrate not only the first\napplication of memristive networks to the field of massively-parallel\ncomputing, but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find\napplications in different research fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 21:09:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2011 11:02:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pershin", "Yuriy V.", ""], ["Di Ventra", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0215", "submitter": "Dmitri Maslov", "authors": "Dmitri Maslov and Mehdi Saeedi", "title": "Reversible Circuit Optimization via Leaving the Boolean Domain", "comments": "14 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits\n  and Systems 30(6):806-816, 2011", "doi": "10.1109/TCAD.2011.2105555", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For years, the quantum/reversible circuit community has been convinced that:\na) the addition of auxiliary qubits is instrumental in constructing a smaller\nquantum circuit; and, b) the introduction of quantum gates inside reversible\ncircuits may result in more efficient designs.

One of\nthe major limiting factors in computing such circuits is the sheer number of\nreversible functions. Even restricting synthesis to 4-bit reversible functions\nresults in a huge search space (16! {\\approx} 2^{44} functions). The output of\nsuch a search alone, counting only the space required to list Toffoli gates for\nevery function, would require over 100 terabytes of storage. In this paper, we\npresent two algorithms: one, that synthesizes an optimal circuit for any 4-bit\nreversible specification, and another that synthesizes all optimal\nimplementations. We employ several techniques to make the problem tractable. We\nreport results from several experiments, including synthesis of all optimal\n4-bit permutations, synthesis of random 4-bit permutations, optimal synthesis\nof all 4-bit linear reversible circuits, synthesis of existing benchmark\nfunctions; we compose a list of the hardest permutations to synthesize, and\nshow distribution of optimal circuits. We further illustrate that our proposed\napproach may be extended to accommodate physical constraints via reporting\nLNN-optimal reversible circuits. Our results have important implications in the\ndesign and optimization of reversible and quantum circuits, testing circuit\nsynthesis heuristics, and performing experiments in the area of quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Mar 2011 15:07:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 19:08:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Golubitsky", "Oleg", ""], ["Maslov", "Dmitri", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3478", "submitter": "Stefano Pirandola", "authors": "Stefano Pirandola", "title": "Quantum Reading of a Classical Digital Memory", "comments": "PRL selected by the APS editors for a synopsis in \"Physics\".
