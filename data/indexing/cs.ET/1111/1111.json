The limiting storage density in magnetic recording\nis investigated treating the writing of bits as a thermodynamic process. A\n'thermal writability' factor is introduced and it is shown that storage\ndensities will be limited to 15 to 20 TBit/in^2 unless technology can move\nbeyond the currently available write field magnitudes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 15:08:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Mar 2012 20:20:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "R.
