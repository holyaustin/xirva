To reduce the sensing overhead, an\nSU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs\nbased on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is\nbuilt to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of\nchannel conditions: time-invariant channel and time-varying channel. An\noptimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to\noptimize the important design parameters.
