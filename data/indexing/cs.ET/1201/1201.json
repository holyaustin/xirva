The main innovation\nis to let a display of high refresh rate optically broadcast so-called atom\nframes, which are designed through non-negative matrix factorization to form\nbases for a class of images, and different viewers perceive selfintended images\nby using display-synchronized viewing devices and their own human visual\nsystems to fuse appropriately weighted atom frames. This work is essentially a\nscheme of temporal psychovisual modulation in visible spectrum, using an\noptoelectronic modulator coupled with a biological demodulator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jan 2012 03:16:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Zhai", "Guangtao", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2043", "submitter": "Keivan Navi", "authors": "Mehdi Ghasemi, Mohammad Hossein Moaiyeri and Keivan Navi", "title": "A New Full Adder Cell for Molecular Electronics", "comments": "13 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of VLSI design & Communication\n  System(VLSICS) Vol.2, No.4, pp.1-13, Dec. 2011", "doi": "10.5121/vlsic.2011.2401", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to high power consumption and difficulties with minimizing the CMOS\ntransistor size, molecular electronics has been introduced as an emerging\ntechnology.

This full adder is consisted of resonant tunneling diodes and\ntransistors which are implemented via molecular electronics.

The temperature generated in an IC may vary\nwith floor plan of the chip. This paper proposes an integration and thermal\nanalysis methodology to extract the peak temperature and temperature\ndistribution of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional multiprocessor system-on-chip.\nAs we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures\ncompared to 2-dimensional ones due to the reduced space in intra-layer and\ninter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable\nto analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature\ndistribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation\nICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the\nother parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in\nexponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot\ntemperature value due to increase in leakage power. In this paper, we have\nanalysed the temperature developed in an IC with four identical processors at\n2.4 GHz in different floorplans. The analysis has been done for both 2D and 3D\narrangements. In the 3D arrangement, a three layered structure has been\nconsidered with two Silicon layers and a thermal interface material (TIM) in\nbetween them.
