In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed\ninto six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has\nbeen known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of\nits CNOT-optimality.\n  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and\nimplement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe\nthe cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity\nof such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective\ncircuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least\n2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of\nthree-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla\nqubits are available.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Mar 2008 19:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shende", "Vivek V.", ""], ["Markov", "Igor L.", ""]]}]
