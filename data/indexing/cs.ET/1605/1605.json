While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic\nInter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar\nlayout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing\nrequirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion\nat large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a\nrecently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that\npresents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D\nconnectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric\ncomponents enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic\ngates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to\nconventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future\nscalability. In this paper, we present a methodology using relevant metrics to\nevaluate and quantify the benefits of Skybridge vs. state-of-the-art\ntransistor-level monolithic 3D IC (T-MI) and 2D in terms of routability and its\nimpact on large-scale circuits. This is enabled by a new device-to-system\ndesign flow with commercial CAD tools that we developed for large-scale\nSkybridge IC designs in 16nm node. Evaluation for standard benchmark circuits\nshows that Skybridge yields up to 1.6x lower routing demand against T-MI with\nno routing congestion (routing demand to resource ratio < 1) at all metal\nlayers. This 3D routability in conjunction with compact vertical gate design in\nSkybridge translate into benefits of up to 3x lower power and 11x higher\ndensity over 2D CMOS, while TLM-3DIC approach only has up to 22% power saving\nand 2x density improvement over 2D CMOS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 23:57:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 May 2016 22:59:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Jiajun", ""], ["Li", "Mingyu", ""], ["Khasanvis", "Santosh", ""], ["Rahman", "Mostafizur", ""], ["Moritz", "Csaba Andras", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.00684", "submitter": "Maria Mera Collantes", "authors": "Maria I.
