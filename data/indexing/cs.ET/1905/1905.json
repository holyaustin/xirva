It is of particular interest to develop an\nSOT-MRAM device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in order to\nleverage the greater density and thermal stability achievable with PMA as\nopposed to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. However, the orthogonality between SOT\nand PMA prevents deterministic directional switching without an additional\ndevice component that breaks the symmetry, such as an external magnetic field\nor complex physical structure; not only do these components complicate\nfabrication, they also are not robust to variations in fabrication and applied\nswitching current. This letter therefore proposes a simple SOT-MRAM structure\nwith PMA in which deterministic toggle switching is achieved without requiring\nadditional device components. Furthermore, this toggle PMA SOT-MRAM is shown to\nbe far more robust than previous approaches for directional PMA SOT-MRAM, with\ngreater than 50% tolerance to applied switching current magnitude. This letter\ndescribes the physical structure and toggle switching mechanism, provides\nmicromagnetic simulations demonstrating its feasibility, and evaluates the\nrobustness and tolerance to material parameters to guide the fabrication of\noptimized devices that will jumpstart the third generation of MRAM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 11:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "Naimul", ""], ["Lainez-Garcia", "Susana P.", ""], ["Garcia-Sanchez", "Felipe", ""], ["Friedman", "Joseph S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01426", "submitter": "Amandeep Bhatia", "authors": "Amandeep Singh Bhatia, Mandeep Kaur Saggi, Ajay Kumar, Sushma Jain", "title": "Matrix Product State Based Quantum Classifier", "comments": "9", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.ET cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, interest in expressing the success of neural networks to the\nquantum computing has increased significantly.

We address the routing problem for families of\nquantum circuits defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to\na potential gate. Our main result is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates\non distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits can be ordered and\nparallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical\nqubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in\nthe case where gates acting on all $\\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are\ndesired. We highlight two classes of problems for which our method is\nparticularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates, as\nin the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz\n(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single\nlevel of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut can be implemented in linear depth, and\na single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it applies to sets of\ngates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant\ncriterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized\ntime-evolution of fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation, and also to non-standard mixers in QAOA. Using our method, a\nsingle Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary\nbasis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the\nunitary coupled cluster singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2\n\\eta)$ depth, where $\\eta$ is the number of electrons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 May 2019 16:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["O'Gorman", "Bryan", ""], ["Huggins", "William J.", ""], ["Rieffel", "Eleanor G.", ""], ["Whaley", "K.

Simulation results for these\nnoise models indicate over 90% mean reliability (fidelity) for our circuit\nconstruction, versus under 30% for the qubit-only baseline.
