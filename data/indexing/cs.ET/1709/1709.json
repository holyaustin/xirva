We\ncalculate this cost exactly for the special case where $P$ represents a\nsingle-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in\nterms of the nonnegative rank of $P$. These results show that having access to\none extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states,\nis sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a\nthermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed\nform of the master equation.

This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems\nto compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system\nconfiguration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning\nprocesses active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the\nhomeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer\nthan conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an\nultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,\nthat can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long\ntime scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights\nof all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences,\nto preserve the effects of learning.

Our work shows that Ising machines\ncan be realized using almost any nonlinear self-sustaining oscillators with\nlogic values encoded in their phases. Many types of such oscillators are\nreadily available for large-scale integration, with potentials in high-speed\nand low-power operation. In this paper, we describe the operation and mechanism\nof oscillator-based Ising machines. The feasibility of our scheme is\ndemonstrated through several examples in simulation and hardware, among which a\nsimulation study reports average solutions exceeding those from state-of-art\nIsing machines on a benchmark combinatorial optimization problem of size 2000.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Sep 2017 19:03:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 23:27:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Tianshi", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Jaijeet", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.08184", "submitter": "Alex James Dr", "authors": "Timur Ibrayev, Ulan Myrzakhan, Olga Krestinskaya, Aidana Irmanova,\n  Alex Pappachen James", "title": "On-chip Face Recognition System Design with Memristive Hierarchical\n  Temporal Memory", "comments": "Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hierarchical Temporal Memory is a new machine learning algorithm intended to\nmimic the working principle of neocortex, part of the human brain, which is\nresponsible for learning, classification, and making predictions.
