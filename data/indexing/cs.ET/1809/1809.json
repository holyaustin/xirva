However, a key challenge with\nresistive crossbars is that they suffer from a range of device and circuit\nlevel non-idealities such as interconnect parasitics, peripheral circuits,\nsneak paths, and process variations. These non-idealities can lead to errors in\nVMMs, eventually degrading the DNN's accuracy. It is therefore critical to\nstudy the impact of crossbar non-idealities on the accuracy of large-scale\nDNNs. However, this is challenging because existing device and circuit models\nare too slow to use in application-level evaluations.\n  We present RxNN, a fast and accurate simulation framework to evaluate\nlarge-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar systems. RxNN splits and maps the\ncomputations involved in each DNN layer into crossbar operations, and evaluates\nthem using a Fast Crossbar Model (FCM) that accurately captures the errors\narising due to crossbar non-idealities while being four-to-five orders of\nmagnitude faster than circuit simulation. FCM models a crossbar-based VMM\noperation using three stages - non-linear models for the input and output\nperipheral circuits (DACs and ADCs), and an equivalent non-ideal conductance\nmatrix for the core crossbar array. We implement RxNN by extending the Caffe\nmachine learning framework and use it to evaluate a suite of six large-scale\nDNNs developed for the ImageNet Challenge. Our experiments reveal that\nresistive crossbar non-idealities can lead to significant accuracy degradations\n(9.6%-32%) for these large-scale DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nis the first quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of large-scale DNNs on\nresistive crossbar based hardware.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 22:22:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:20:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2020 03:33:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Shubham", ""], ["Sengupta", "Abhronil", ""], ["Roy", "Kaushik", ""], ["Raghunathan", "Anand", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00419", "submitter": "Alex James Dr", "authors": "Olga Krestinskaya, Akshay Kumar Maan, Alex Pappachen James", "title": "Programmable Memristive Threshold Logic Gate Array", "comments": "IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (IEEE APCCAS\n  2018)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes the implementation of programmable threshold logic gate\n(TLG) crossbar array based on modified TLG cells for high speed processing and\ncomputation.

Quantum circuits based on\nClifford+T gates can easily be made fault-tolerant but the T gate is very\ncostly to implement. The small number of qubits available in existing quantum\ncomputers adds another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing\nT-count and qubit cost have become important optimization goals. The design of\nquantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers\nand designs have been proposed in the literature. However, these designs suffer\nfrom excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce\nsignificant garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to\neliminate these outputs. In this work, we propose two quantum integer division\ncircuits. The first proposed quantum integer division circuit is based on the\nrestoring division algorithm and the second proposed design implements the\nnon-restoring division algorithm. Both proposed designs are optimized in terms\nof T-count, T-depth and qubits. Both proposed quantum circuit designs are based\non (i) a quantum subtractor, (ii) a quantum adder-subtractor circuit, and (iii)\na novel quantum conditional addition circuit. Our proposed restoring division\ncircuit achieves average T-count savings from $79.03 \\%$ to $91.69 \\%$ compared\nto the existing works. Our proposed non-restoring division circuit achieves\naverage T-count savings from $49.75 \\%$ to $90.37 \\%$ compared to the existing\nworks. Further, both our proposed designs have linear T-depth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:25:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Thapliyal", "Himanshu", ""], ["Mu\u00f1oz-Coreas", "Edgard", ""], ["Varun", "T.

Hence, we\npropose a moment matching approximation by a normal inverse Gaussian (NIG)\ndistribution and we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail probability.\nNumerical evaluations showed that the NIG approximation matches very well with\nthe exact solution obtained by numerical convolution of the IG density\nfunctions.
