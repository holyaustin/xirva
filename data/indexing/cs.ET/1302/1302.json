On the\nother hand, cooperative communication with the help of relay nodes improves the\nperformance of wireless communication networks by increasing the system\nthroughput or the reliability as well as the range and efficient energy\nutilization. In order to investigate the cooperation in EH nodes, in this\npaper, we consider the problem of optimal power and rate allocation in the\ndegraded full-duplex Gaussian relay channel in which source and relay can\nharvest energy from their environments. We consider the general stochastic\nenergy arrivals at the source and the relay with known EH times and amounts at\nthe transmitters before the start of transmission.

We\npropose a method based on a mathematical theorem proposed by Terkelsen [1] to\ntransform it to a solvable convex optimization form.

Therefore,\na novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is\nproposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced\ncognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under\ntwo cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference\n(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for\nincreasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within\nfinite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed\nscheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher\ntarget SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower\nvalue for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In\norder to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the\nproposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation\nallows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a\ndesired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite\nhorizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive\noptimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost\nless energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:04:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Hao", ""], ["Jagannathan", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.2191", "submitter": "Omid Kavehei", "authors": "Omid Kavehei and Chun Hosung and Damith Ranasinghe and Stan Skafidas", "title": "mrPUF: A Memristive Device based Physical Unclonable Function", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.other cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exploit the intrinsic complexity and\nirreproducibility of physical systems to generate secret information.
