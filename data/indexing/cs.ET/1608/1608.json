Capable of Turing universal computation, the\naTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed\nso that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute\nprescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was\nshown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a\nsingle tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set\ncan be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly\nusing that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics\nmodulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given\nmakes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key\nlocations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating\na directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.\nThe question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally\nrequired. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed\nsystems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no\nuniversal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This\nprovides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is\nitself a fundamentally nondeterministic process.

The\nsynaptic weight of the proposed device can be strengthened/weakened by\npositive/negative stimuli, mimicking the potentiation/depression process of a\nbiological synapse. Both short-term plasticity(STP) and long-term\npotentiation(LTP) functionalities have been demonstrated for a spiking\ntime-dependent plasticity(STDP) scheme. This proposal suggests new\npossibilities for synaptic devices for use in spiking neuromorphic computing\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 09:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Yangqi", ""], ["Kang", "Wang", ""], ["Zhang", "Xichao", ""], ["Zhou", "Yan", ""], ["Zhao", "Weisheng", ""]]}]
