The goal is to provide a framework accommodating such\nreductions in a global manner and without any loss of generality in the working\nassumptions; that is, we avoid global hypotheses imposing the existence of a\nclassical circuit variable controlling each device. Classical (voltage/current\nbut also flux/charge) models are easily obtained as particular cases of a\ngeneral homogeneous model. Our approach extends the results introduced for\nlinear circuits in a previous paper, by means of a systematic use of global\nparametrizations of smooth planar curves. This makes it possible to formulate\nreduced models in terms of homogeneous variables also in the nonlinear context:\ncontrary to voltages and currents (and also to fluxes and charges), homogeneous\nvariables qualify as state variables in reduced models of uncoupled circuits\nwithout any restriction in the characteristics of devices. The inherent\nsymmetry of this formalism makes it possible to address in broad generality\ncertain analytical problems in nonlinear circuit theory, such as the\nstate-space problem and related issues involving impasse phenomena, as well as\nindex analyses of differential-algebraic models. Our framework applies also to\ncircuits with memristors, and can be extended to include controlled sources and\ncoupling effects. Several examples illustrate the results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2019 16:33:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2020 22:25:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Riaza", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.01771", "submitter": "Emre Neftci", "authors": "M.

Different from existing works that analyzes the\ntraditional routing techniques on special network topologies, we present a\ncomprehensive entanglement routing model that reflects the differences between\nquantum networks and classical networks and new entanglement routing algorithms\nthat utilize the unique properties of quantum networks. Evaluation results show\nthat the proposed algorithm Q-CAST increases the number of successful\nlong-distance entanglements by a big margin compared to other methods. The\nmodel and simulator developed by this work may encourage more network\nresearchers to study the entanglement routing problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2019 05:38:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Sep 2019 20:48:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 05:50:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Shouqian", ""], ["Qian", "Chen", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.11145", "submitter": "Timo C.

The\ntechniques used consisted of the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO),\nthe Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU), and the Phase Estimation Algorithm\n(PEA). The molecules studied were $H_2$ with and without spin, as well as\n$He_2$ without spin. Hamiltonians were created under the LCAO basis, and\nreconstructed using the Jordan-Winger transform in order to create a linear\ncombination of Pauli spin operators. The lengths of each molecular Hamiltonian\ngreatly increased from the $H_2$ without spin, to $He_2$. This resulted in a\nreduced ability to simulate the Hamiltonians under ideal conditions. Thus, only\nlow orders of l = 1 and l = 2 were used when expanding the Hamiltonian in\naccordance to the LCU method of simulation. The resulting Hamiltonians were\nmeasured using PEA, and plotted against function of $\\frac{2\\pi(K)}{N}$ and the\nprobability distribution of each register. The resolution of the graph was\ndependent on the amount of registers, N, being used. However, the reduction of\norder hardly changed the image of the $H_2$ graphs. Qualitative comparisons\nbetween the three molecules were drawn.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 19:33:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wright", "Jerimiah", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.11988", "submitter": "Ahsan Javed Awan Dr", "authors": "Jiaying Yang, Ahsan Javed Awan and Gemma Vall-Llosera", "title": "Support Vector Machines on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.LG quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Support vector machine algorithms are considered essential for the\nimplementation of automation in a radio access network.
