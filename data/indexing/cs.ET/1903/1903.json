Due to key differences\nbetween SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as\nadvanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification\ntechniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework\nfocuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of SFQ logic:\nfanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The\ncombinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are:\nKogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select\nISCAS'85 combinational benchmark circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ\ncircuit designs for verification detection were experimented with - including\nstuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional bugs like\nincorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark\nconsisting of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties\nand present the performance of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark\ncircuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM standard allows the\nVeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal\nverification techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Mar 2019 04:36:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Alvin D.", ""], ["Su", "Kevin", ""], ["Sun", "Hang", ""], ["Fayyazi", "Arash", ""], ["Pedram", "Massoud", ""], ["Nazarian", "Shahin", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.07163", "submitter": "Tianshi Wang", "authors": "Tianshi Wang, Jaijeet Roychowdhury", "title": "OIM: Oscillator-based Ising Machines for Solving Combinatorial\n  Optimisation Problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new way to make Ising machines, i.e., using networks of coupled\nself-sustaining nonlinear oscillators.

We provide experimental demonstrations solving NP-hard\nmax-cut problems directly in analog crossbar arrays, and supplement this with\nexperimentally-grounded simulations to explore scalability with problem size,\nproviding the success probabilities, time and energy to solution, and\ninteractions with intrinsic analog noise. Compared to fully digital approaches,\nand present-day quantum and optical accelerators, we forecast the mem-HNN to\nhave over four orders of magnitude higher solution throughput per power\nconsumption. This suggests substantially improved performance and scalability\ncompared to current quantum annealing approaches, while operating at room\ntemperature and taking advantage of existing CMOS technology augmented with\nemerging analog non-volatile memristors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 23:57:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 23:48:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Fuxi", ""], ["Kumar", "Suhas", ""], ["Van Vaerenbergh", "Thomas", ""], ["Liu", "Rui", ""], ["Li", "Can", ""], ["Yu", "Shimeng", ""], ["Xia", "Qiangfei", ""], ["Yang", "J.

Typically a\nreservoir computer is constructed by connecting a large number of nonlinear\nnodes in a network, driving the nodes with an input signal and using the node\noutputs to fit a training signal. In this work, we set up reservoirs where the\nedges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0, and\nproceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1\nto -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to\ncharacterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much\nwe have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a\nfinite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are\nsymmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for\ncharacterizing the network. We find that changing the number of edges flipped\nin the network changes the rank of the covariance of a matrix consisting of the\ntime series from the different nodes in the network, and speculate that this\nrank is important for understanding the reservoir computer performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 11:01:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 12:33:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Aug 2019 13:35:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Carroll", "Thomas L.", ""], ["Pecora", "Louis M.", ""]]}]
