A quantum-walk-based algorithm\nthat is standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The\nlackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search two-dimensional\ngrids whose vertices have a self-loop of weight $l$. In this paper, we address\nseveral issues related to the application of the lackadaisical quantum walk to\nsuccessfully search for multiple solutions on grids. Firstly, we show that only\none of the two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for\nsimulations. We also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on\nthe space density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions.\nFurthermore, this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for\nmultiple solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an\noptimal adjustment of the self-loop weight $l$ for such scenarios of arbitrary\ndimensions. It turns out the other fits of $l$ found in the literature are\nparticular cases. Finally, we observe a two-to-one relation between the steps\nof the lackadaisical quantum walk and the ones of Grover's algorithm, which\nrequires modifications in the stopping condition. In conclusion, this work\ndeals with practical issues one should consider when applying the lackadaisical\nquantum walk, besides expanding the technique to a wider range of search\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["de Carvalho", "Jonathan H.

With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the\ninput vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results\ncan be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight\ncan be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all\ncells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures\neither use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an\noffset to weights so that all values become positive.

To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a\nfine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of\ntrying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is\nto enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that\nall weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally\navoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated\nusing alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized\noptimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights.

We develop NuOp, a flexible\ncompilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose\napplication operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four\nimportant quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of\nRigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model.\nOur experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to\nattain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while\nreducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several\nvendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has\npotential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 15:15:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Murali", "Prakash", ""], ["Lao", "Lingling", ""], ["Martonosi", "Margaret", ""], ["Browne", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15599", "submitter": "Nirmalya Thakur", "authors": "Nirmalya Thakur and Chia Y.

Their increasing population is associated with their\nincreasing needs due to problems like physical disabilities, cognitive issues,\nweakened memory and disorganized behavior, that elderly people face with\nincreasing age. To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to\nenhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based\nsolutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent\nAffect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of\nelderly people in the context of their day to day interactions with technology\nin an IoT-based environment, holds immense potential for serving as a long-term\nsolution for improving the user experience of elderly in smart homes. This work\ntherefore proposes the framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware environment\nfor elderly people that can not only analyze the affective components of their\ninteractions but also predict their likely user experience even before they\nstart engaging in any activity in the given smart home environment. This\nforecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,\nthereby increasing the assistive and adaptive nature of such intelligent\nsystems. To uphold the efficacy of this proposed framework for improving the\nquality of life of elderly people in smart homes, it has been tested on three\ndatasets and the results are presented and discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:34:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Thakur", "Nirmalya", ""], ["Han", "Chia Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.16173", "submitter": "Andriy Miranskyy", "authors": "Mushahid Khan and Andriy Miranskyy", "title": "String Comparison on a Quantum Computer Using Hamming Distance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.DS physics.bio-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Hamming distance is ubiquitous in computing.
