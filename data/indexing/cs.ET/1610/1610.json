It is based on embedded nonvolatile floating-gate cell arrays\nredesigned from a commercial 180-nm NOR flash memory. The arrays allow precise\n(~1%) individual tuning of all memory cells, having long-term analog-level\nretention and low noise. Each array performs a very fast and energy-efficient\nanalog vector-by-matrix multiplication, which is the bottleneck for signal\npropagation in most neuromorphic networks. All functional components of the\nprototype circuit, including 2 synaptic arrays with 101,780 floating-gate\nsynaptic cells, 74 analog neurons, and the peripheral circuitry for weight\nadjustment and I/O operations, have a total area below 1 mm^2. Its testing on\nthe common MNIST benchmark set (at this stage, with a relatively low weight\nimport precision) has shown a classification fidelity of 94.65%, close to the\n96.2% obtained in simulation. The classification of one pattern takes less than\n1 us time and ~20 nJ energy - both numbers much better than for digital\nimplementations of the same task. Estimates show that this performance may be\nfurther improved using a better neuron design and a more advanced memory\ntechnology, leading to a >10^2 advantage in speed and a >10^4 advantage in\nenergy efficiency over the state-of-the-art purely digital (GPU and custom)\ncircuits, at classification of large, complex patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 22:50:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 23:27:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bayat", "F.
