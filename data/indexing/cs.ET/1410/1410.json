Due to high randomness in the\nindividual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria\nis almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that a population of\nbacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the network capable of\nmolecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a\nreliable bio node out of many unreliable bacteria.\n  In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes in such a network\nwhere information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the\ntransmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node\npropagate through the diffusion channel. Then, the concentration of molecules\nis sensed by the bacteria population in the receiver node which would decode\nthe information and output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in\nthe communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,\ntransmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits of the\ninformation transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties. Finally, we\nconsider M-ary signaling schemes and study their achievable rates and\ncorresponding error probabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Oct 2014 19:48:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Einolghozati", "Arash", ""], ["Sardari", "Mohsen", ""], ["Fekri", "Faramarz", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1086", "submitter": "Arash Einolghozati", "authors": "Arash Einolghozati, Mohsen Sardari, Faramarz Fekri", "title": "Relaying in Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.IT math.IT q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in\ncommunications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes\nformed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,\nwe used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such\ncommunication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules\nthat a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the\nnumber of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls\nwith distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a\nmolecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the\ndifferent or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the\ntransmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the\nrelay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the\nreceiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type\nof molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of\nconcentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number\nof bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,\nwe obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that\nmulti-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the\nsecond scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary\nsignaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability\nof M-ary communication significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Oct 2014 20:08:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Einolghozati", "Arash", ""], ["Sardari", "Mohsen", ""], ["Fekri", "Faramarz", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1257", "submitter": "Abhronil Sengupta", "authors": "Abhronil Sengupta, Sri Harsha Choday, Yusung Kim, and Kaushik Roy", "title": "Spin Orbit Torque Based Electronic Neuron", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.4917011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A device based on current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) that functions as\nan electronic neuron is proposed in this work.

In this paper, we start with an\nanalytical modeling of a spherical absorbing receiver under messenger molecule\ndegradation and show that our formulations are in agreement with the simulation\nresults of a similar topology. Next, we identify how such signal\ncharacteristics as pulse peak time and pulse amplitude are affected by\ndegradation. Indeed, we show analytically how in MCvD, signal shaping is\nachieved through degradation. We also compare communication under messenger\nmolecule degradation with the case of no-degradation and electromagnetic\ncommunication in terms of channel characteristics. Lastly, we evaluate the\ncommunication performance of the scenarios having various degradation rates.\nHere, we assess the system performance according to traditional network metrics\nsuch as the level of inter-symbol interference, detection performance, bit\nerror rate, and channel capacity. Our results indicate that introducing\ndegradation significantly improves the system performance when the rate of\ndegradation is appropriately selected. We make a thorough analysis of the\ncommunication scenario by taking into account different detection thresholds,\nsymbol durations, and communication distances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 08:11:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Heren", "Akif Cem", ""], ["Yilmaz", "H.

Among the proposed methods, molecular\ncommunication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main\nchallenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits\ncommunication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy\nefficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a\npre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a\ndecision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the\noptimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally\ncalculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD\nsystem suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,\nnew modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of\nISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a\nmodulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is\nproposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.\nFurthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes\nthe residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a\nnew energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute\nfor the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are\ncompared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more\nadvantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower\ncomputational complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 10:26:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tepekule", "Burcu", ""], ["Pusane", "Ali E.", ""], ["Yilmaz", "H.
