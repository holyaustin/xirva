The heart of the DNA computing is the DNA hybridization,\nhowever, it is also the source of errors. Thus the success of the DNA computing\ndepends on the error control techniques. The classical coding theory techniques\nhave provided foundation for the current information and communication\ntechnology (ICT). Thus it is natural to expect that coding theory will be the\nfoundational subject for the DNA computing paradigm. For the successful\nexperiments with DNA computing usually we design DNA strings which are\nsufficiently dissimilar. This leads to the construction of a large set of DNA\nstrings which satisfy certain combinatorial and thermodynamic constraints. Over\nthe last 16 years, many approaches such as combinatorial, algebraic,\ncomputational have been used to construct such DNA strings. In this work, we\nsurvey this interesting area of DNA coding theory by providing key ideas of the\narea and current known results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 14:44:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Limbachiya", "Dixita", ""], ["Rao", "Bansari", ""], ["Gupta", "Manish K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00667", "submitter": "Sai Zhang", "authors": "Sai Zhang, Mingu Kang, Charbel Sakr, Naresh Shanbhag", "title": "Reducing the Energy Cost of Inference via In-sensor Information\n  Processing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is much interest in incorporating inference capabilities into\nsensor-rich embedded platforms such as autonomous vehicles, wearables, and\nothers. A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract\ninformation locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This\nnecessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical\nsensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and\ncomputational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements\nof the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy\nconsumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in\ntransferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)\nand the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor\n(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing\narchitecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by\nembedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and\nretraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal\ncomputations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a\nsensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure\nfrom the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be\ndesigned by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in\nthe analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)\narray. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral\nand energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the\nprocess, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine\nlearning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying\ncomputational fabric.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 18:43:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Sai", ""], ["Kang", "Mingu", ""], ["Sakr", "Charbel", ""], ["Shanbhag", "Naresh", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00956", "submitter": "Artemy Kolchinsky", "authors": "Artemy Kolchinsky, David H.
