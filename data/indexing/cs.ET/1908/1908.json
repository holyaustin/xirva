Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising\nspin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing\ncomputers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which\nhas many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model\nsolvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the\npast. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers\nfor many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the\nbalancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete\ngraph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such\nglobal update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU\ncomputing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To\nmitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model\nand the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still\npreserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver\nessentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a\nmore efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing\ncut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut\npartitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on\nG-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU\ntimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 04:56:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cook", "Chase", ""], ["Jin", "Wentian", ""], ["Tan", "Sheldon X. -D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.00542", "submitter": "Susan Mniszewski", "authors": "Jason P.

The QUBO formulation is for general use on\neither annealing or gate-based quantum computers.

We find that the sampling time needed to\nidentify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the\nalkane.

Unfortunately, if two requests go to the same bank, they\nhave to be served one after another, leading to lower system performance. We\nobserve that a modern PCM bank is implemented as a collection of partitions\nthat operate mostly independently while sharing a few global peripheral\nstructures, which include the sense amplifiers (to read) and the write drivers\n(to write). Based on this observation, we propose PALP, a new mechanism that\nenables partition-level parallelism within each PCM bank, and exploits such\nparallelism by using the memory controller's access scheduling decisions.

First, we introduce new PCM commands to\nenable parallelism in a bank's partitions in order to resolve the read-write\nbank conflicts, with minimal changes needed to PCM logic and its interface.\nSecond, we propose simple circuit modifications that introduce a new operating\nmode for the write drivers, in addition to their default mode of serving write\nrequests. When configured in this new mode, the write drivers can resolve the\nread-read bank conflicts, working jointly with the sense amplifiers. Finally,\nwe propose a new access scheduling mechanism in PCM that improves performance\nby prioritizing those requests that exploit partition-level parallelism over\nother requests, including the long outstanding ones.
