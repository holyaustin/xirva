The principal components of\nthe watermark are embedded in the original image, leaving the detector with a\ncomplimentary set of singular vectors for watermark extraction. The above step\ninvariably ensures that watermark extraction from the embedded watermark image,\nusing a modified matrix, is not possible, thereby removing a major drawback of\nan earlier proposed algorithm by Liu and Tan (2002).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2008 10:17:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Chirag", ""], ["Arora", "Siddharth", ""], ["Panigrahi", "Prasanta K.", ""]]}]
