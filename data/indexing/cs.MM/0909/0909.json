An additional goal was to\nprovide enough flexibility to allow the standard to be applied to a wide\nvariety of applications. To achieve better coding efficiency, H.264 AVC uses\nseveral techniques such as inter mode and intra mode prediction with variable\nsize motion compensation, which adopts Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO). This\nincreases the computational complexity of the encoder especially for devices\nwith lower processing capabilities such as mobile and other handheld devices.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithm to reduce the number of mode and sub\nmode evaluations in inter mode prediction. Experimental results show that this\nfast intra mode selection algorithm can lessen about 75 percent encoding time\nwith little loss of bit rate and visual quality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 18:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rungta", "Sourabh", ""], ["Verma", "Kshitij", ""], ["Tripathi", "Neeta", ""], ["Shukla", "Anupam", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2816", "submitter": "Christian Feldbauer", "authors": "Emine Zerrin Sakir and Christian Feldbauer", "title": "Efficient Quality-Based Playout Buffer Algorithm", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Playout buffers are used in VoIP systems to compensate for network delay\njitter by making a trade-off between delay and loss. In this work we propose a\nplayout buffer algorithm that makes the trade-off based on maximization of\nconversational speech quality, aiming to keep the computational complexity\nlowest possible. We model the network delay using a Pareto distribution and\nshow that it is a good compromise between providing an appropriate fit to the\nnetwork delay characteristics and yielding a low arithmetical complexity. We\nuse the ITU-T E-Model as the quality model and simplify its delay impairment\nfunction. The proposed playout buffer algorithm finds the optimum playout delay\nusing a closed-form solution that minimizes the sum of the simplified delay\nimpairment factor and the loss-dependent equipment impairment factor of the\nE-model.
