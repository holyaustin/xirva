In this scheme, peer places the\ninitial offset as the offset reported by other reference peer with a shift\nproportional to the buffer width or offset lag of this reference peer. This\nwill introduce a stable placement that supports larger buffer width for peers\nand small buffer width for tracker. Real deployed placement method in PPLive is\nstudied through measurement. It shows that, instead of based on offset lag, the\nplacement is based on buffer width of the reference peer to facilitate the\ninitial chunk fetching. We will prove that, such a PP scheme may not be stable\nunder arbitrary buffer occupation in the reference peer. The required average\nbuffer width then is derived. A simple good peer selection mechanism to check\nthe buffer occupation of reference peer is proposed for a stable PP scheme\nbased on buffer width\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Oct 2008 00:15:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chunxi", ""], ["Chen", "Changjia", ""]]}]
