In contrast to building a template from a single\nframe, we train a robust object representation model from a large amount of\ndata. Tracking is viewed as a binary classification problem, and a\ndiscriminative classification rule is learned to distinguish between the object\nand background. We adopt a support vector machine (SVM) for training. The\ntracker is then implemented by maximizing the classification score.

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users'\nheterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,\ndistortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as\nwell as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission\nstrategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous\ncharacteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission\npriorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This\nDAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer\nactions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected\nfor transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the\ncomplexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly\nincrease w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and\nexponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current\npackets depend on. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nsolution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layer\nsolutions. Moreover, we show that our solution provides the upper bound\nperformance for the cross-layer optimization solutions with delayed feedback\nsuch as the well-known RaDiO framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2009 22:09:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Fangwen", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4205", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Cristian Anghel, Vlad Muia, Miodrag Stoianovici", "title": "Development and Optimization of a Multimedia Product", "comments": "6 pages, exposed on 5th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2009, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
