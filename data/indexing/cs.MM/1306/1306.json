The term QoS refers to deterministic network behaviour, so\nthat data can be transported with a minimum of packet loss, delay and maximum\nbandwidth. QoE is a subjective measure that involves human dimensions; it ties\ntogether user perception, expectations, and experience of the application and\nnetwork performance. The Holy Grail of subjective measurement is to predict it\nfrom the objective measurements; in other words predict QoE from a given set of\nQoS parameters or vice versa. Whilst there are many quality models for\nmultimedia, most of them are only partial solutions to predicting QoE from a\ngiven QoS. This contribution analyses a number of previous attempts and\noptimisation techniquesthat can reliably compute the weighting coefficients for\nthe QoS/QoE mapping.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jun 2013 15:53:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alreshoodi", "Mohammed", ""], ["Woods", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1373", "submitter": "Kgotlaetsile Mathews Modieginyane MSc", "authors": "Kgotlaetsile Mathews Modieginyane, Zenzo Polite Ncube and Naison\n  Gasela", "title": "CUDA Based Performance Evaluation of the Computational Efficiency of the\n  DCT Image Compression Technique on Both the CPU and GPU", "comments": "15 Pages, 11 Figures, 4 Tables, Advanced Computing: An International\n  Journal (ACIJ), Three Author Pictures (with little Bio for each) at last page", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent advances in computing such as the massively parallel GPUs (Graphical\nProcessing Units),coupled with the need to store and deliver large quantities\nof digital data especially images, has brought a number of challenges for\nComputer Scientists, the research community and other stakeholders.

By caching a portion of the video files at the\nrelays (RS) using a novel MDS-coded random cache scheme, the base station (BS)\nand RSs opportunistically employ CoMP to achieve spatial multiplexing gain\nwithout expensive payload backhaul. We study a two timescale joint optimization\nof power and cache control to support real-time video streaming. The cache\ncontrol is to create more CoMP opportunities and is adaptive to the long-term\npopularity of the video files. The power control is to guarantee the QoS\nrequirements and is adaptive to the channel state information (CSI), the cache\nstate at the RS and the queue state information (QSI) at the users. The joint\nproblem is decomposed into an inner power control problem and an outer cache\ncontrol problem. We first derive a closed-form power control policy from an\napproximated Bellman equation. Based on this, we transform the outer problem\ninto a convex stochastic optimization problem and propose a stochastic\nsubgradient algorithm to solve it. Finally, the proposed solution is shown to\nbe asymptotically optimal for high SNR and small timeslot duration. Its\nsuperior performance over various baselines is verified by simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 03:17:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 08:28:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2013 02:49:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "An", ""], ["Lau", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2727", "submitter": "Tanaya Guha", "authors": "Tanaya Guha, Ehsan Nezhadarya, Rabab K Ward", "title": "Sparse Representation-based Image Quality Assessment", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, submitted to a journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.image.2014.09.010", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.MM eess.IV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A successful approach to image quality assessment involves comparing the\nstructural information between a distorted and its reference image. However,\nextracting structural information that is perceptually important to our visual\nsystem is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by employing a\nsparse representation-based approach and proposes a new metric called the\n\\emph{sparse representation-based quality} (SPARQ) \\emph{index}. The proposed\nmethod learns the inherent structures of the reference image as a set of basis\nvectors, such that any structure in the image can be represented by a linear\ncombination of only a few of those basis vectors. This sparse strategy is\nemployed because it is known to generate basis vectors that are qualitatively\nsimilar to the receptive field of the simple cells present in the mammalian\nprimary visual cortex. The visual quality of the distorted image is estimated\nby comparing the structures of the reference and the distorted images in terms\nof the learnt basis vectors resembling cortical cells. Our approach is\nevaluated on six publicly available subject-rated image quality assessment\ndatasets. The proposed SPARQ index consistently exhibits high correlation with\nthe subjective ratings on all datasets and performs better or at par with the\nstate-of-the-art.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Guha", "Tanaya", ""], ["Nezhadarya", "Ehsan", ""], ["Ward", "Rabab K", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.5066", "submitter": "Song-Jin Im", "authors": "Chol-Su Kim, Kwang-Hyok Jong, Song-Jin Im", "title": "Document watermarking based on digital holographic principle", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new method for document watermarking based on the digital Fourier hologram\nis proposed.
