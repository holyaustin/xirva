Buffer utilization is also maximized irrespective of the load on the\nVideo-on-Demand system. Overload can lead the server getting slowed down. By\nstoring the first few seconds of popular video clips, a multimedia local server\ncan shield the users from the delay, throughput, and loss properties of the\npath between the local server and the central server. The key idea of\ncontrolled multicast is used to allow clients to share a segment of a video\nstream even when the requests arrive at different times. This dynamic buffer\nallocation algorithm is simulated and its performance is evaluated based on the\nbuffer utilization by multimedia servers and average buffer allocation for the\nmost popular videos. Our simulation results shows efficient utilization of\nnetwork bandwidth and reduced hard disk utilization hence resulting in increase\nin the number of requests being served.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2010 09:27:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["nair", "T.
