(m,k)-frame method is issued from the notion of\n(m,k)-firm realtime constraints which means that among k invocations of a task,\nm invocations must meet their deadline. Our simulation studies show the\nusefulness of (m,k)-frame method to adapt the QoS to the real conditions in a\nmultimedia application, according to the current system load.

The proposed solution\nsolved the cross-layer optimization offline, under the assumption that the\nmultimedia system's probabilistic dynamics were known a priori. In practice,\nhowever, these dynamics are unknown a priori and therefore must be learned\nonline. In this paper, we address this problem by allowing the multimedia\nsystem layers to learn, through repeated interactions with each other, to\nautonomously optimize the system's long-term performance at run-time. We\npropose two reinforcement learning algorithms for optimizing the system under\ndifferent design constraints: the first algorithm solves the cross-layer\noptimization in a centralized manner, and the second solves it in a\ndecentralized manner. We analyze both algorithms in terms of their required\ncomputation, memory, and inter-layer communication overheads. After noting that\nthe proposed reinforcement learning algorithms learn too slowly, we introduce a\ncomplementary accelerated learning algorithm that exploits partial knowledge\nabout the system's dynamics in order to dramatically improve the system's\nperformance. In our experiments, we demonstrate that decentralized learning can\nperform as well as centralized learning, while enabling the layers to act\nautonomously. Additionally, we show that existing application-independent\nreinforcement learning algorithms, and existing myopic learning algorithms\ndeployed in multimedia systems, perform significantly worse than our proposed\napplication-aware and foresighted learning methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2009 17:48:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mastronarde", "Nicholas", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}]
