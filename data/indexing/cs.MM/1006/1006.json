This\npaper presents a novel technique for Image steganography based on Block-DCT,\nwhere DCT is used to transform original image (cover image) blocks from spatial\ndomain to frequency domain. Firstly a gray level image of size M x N is divided\ninto no joint 8 x 8 blocks and a two dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (2-d\nDCT) is performed on each of the P = MN / 64 blocks. Then Huffman encoding is\nalso performed on the secret messages/images before embedding and each bit of\nHuffman code of secret message/image is embedded in the frequency domain by\naltering the least significant bit of each of the DCT coefficients of cover\nimage blocks. The experimental results show that the algorithm has a high\ncapacity and a good invisibility. Moreover PSNR of cover image with stego-image\nshows the better results in comparison with other existing steganography\napproaches. Furthermore, satisfactory security is maintained since the secret\nmessage/image cannot be extracted without knowing decoding rules and Huffman\ntable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 06:59:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Nag", "A.", ""], ["Biswas", "S.", ""], ["Sarkar", "D.", ""], ["Sarkar", "P.
