These include the severe pitch shift and tempo change attacks which\nexisting systems fail to detect. First, we propose a novel two dimensional\nrepresentation for audio signals called the time-chroma image. This image is\nbased on a modification of the concept of chroma in the music literature and is\nshown to achieve better performance in song identification. Then, we propose a\nnovel fingerprinting algorithm that extracts local fingerprints from the\ntime-chroma image. The proposed local fingerprinting algorithm is invariant to\ntime/frequency scale changes in audio signals. It also outperforms existing\nmethods like SIFT by a great extent. Finally, we introduce a song\nidentification algorithm that uses the proposed fingerprints. The resulting\ncopy detection system is shown to significantly outperform existing methods.\nBesides being able to detect whether a song (or a part of it) has been copied,\nthe proposed system can accurately estimate the amount of pitch shift and/or\ntempo change that might have been applied to a song.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 20:35:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Malekesmaeili", "Mani", ""], ["Ward", "Rabab K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.1235", "submitter": "Sabu Thampi m", "authors": "Sabu M Thampi", "title": "A Review on P2P Video Streaming", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main objective of this article is to provide an overview of P2P based\nVideo-on-Demand and live streaming services.

Since each pixels inside the stego\nimage is divisible by five then the whole stego image could be divided by five\nto get new range of pixels 0..51. Basically, the reminder of each number that\nis not divisible by five is either 1,2,3 or 4 when divided by 5. Subsequently,\nthen a 4-by-4 window size has been implemented to accommodate the proposed\ntechnique. For each 4-by-4 window inside the cover image, a number from 1 to 4\ncould be embedded secretly from the stego image. The previous discussion must\nbe applied separately for each of the R, G, and B arrays. Moreover, a stego-key\ncould be combined with the proposed algorithm to make it difficult for any\nadversary to extract the secret image from the cover image.
