This is a very\npopular instant messaging protocol used by many messaging platforms such as\nGoogle Talk, Cisco, LiveJournal and many others. Our paper describes how to\nsend a secret message from one XMPP client to another, without raising the\nsuspicion of any intermediaries. The methods described primarily focus on using\nthe underlying protocol as a means for steganography, unlike other related\nworks that try to hide data in the content of instant messages. In doing so, we\nprovide a more robust means of data hiding and additionally offer some\npreliminary analysis of its general security, in particular against\nentropic-based steganalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2013 12:00:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Patuck", "Reshad", ""], ["Hernandez-Castro", "Julio", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.1221", "submitter": "Diego Valsesia", "authors": "Diego Valsesia, Enrico Magli", "title": "Spatially Scalable Compressed Image Sensing with Hybrid Transform and\n  Inter-layer Prediction Model", "comments": "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal\n  Processing, September 30-October 3, 2013, Pula, Italy", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CV cs.MM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Compressive imaging is an emerging application of compressed sensing, devoted\nto acquisition, encoding and reconstruction of images using random projections\nas measurements. In this paper we propose a novel method to provide a scalable\nencoding of an image acquired by means of compressed sensing techniques. Two\nbit-streams are generated to provide two distinct quality levels: a\nlow-resolution base layer and full-resolution enhancement layer. In the\nproposed method we exploit a fast preview of the image at the encoder in order\nto perform inter-layer prediction and encode the prediction residuals only. The\nproposed method successfully provides resolution and quality scalability with\nmodest complexity and it provides gains in the quality of the reconstructed\nimages with respect to separate encoding of the quality layers. Remarkably, we\nalso show that the scheme can also provide significant gains with respect to a\ndirect, non-scalable system, thus accomplishing two features at once:\nscalability and improved reconstruction performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Oct 2013 10:45:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Valsesia", "Diego", ""], ["Magli", "Enrico", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.1582", "submitter": "Varun Singh", "authors": "Marcin Nagy, Varun Singh, Joerg Ott, Lars Eggert", "title": "Congestion Control using FEC for Conversational Multimedia Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2557642.2557649", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a new rate control algorithm for conversational\nmultimedia flows.

A straightforward interpretation is that if no losses\noccur, the sender can increase the sending rate to include the FEC bit rate,\nand in the case of losses due to congestion the redundant packets help in\nrecovering the lost packets.
