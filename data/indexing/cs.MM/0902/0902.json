As shown in this\npaper, when posed for chunk-based systems, and as a consequence of the\nstore-and-forward way in which chunks are delivered across the network, this\nquestion has a fundamentally different answer with respect to the case of\nsystems where the streamed content is distributed through one or more flows\n(sub-streams). To circumvent the complexity emerging when directly dealing with\ndelay, we express performance in term of a convenient metric, called \"stream\ndiffusion metric\". We show that it is directly related to the end-to-end\nminimum delay achievable in a P2P streaming network. In a homogeneous scenario,\nwe derive a performance bound for such metric, and we show how this bound\nrelates to two fundamental parameters: the upload bandwidth available at each\nnode, and the number of neighbors a node may deliver chunks to. In this bound,\nk-step Fibonacci sequences do emerge, and appear to set the fundamental laws\nthat characterize the optimal operation of chunk-based systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 10:05:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2010 17:56:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bianchi", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Melazzi", "Nicola Blefari", ""], ["Bracciale", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Piccolo", "Francesca Lo", ""], ["Salsano", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2187", "submitter": "Joao Lima", "authors": "Joao Paulo Lima, Veronica Teichrieb, Judith Kelner", "title": "A Standalone Markerless 3D Tracker for Handheld Augmented Reality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an implementation of a markerless tracking technique\ntargeted to the Windows Mobile Pocket PC platform. The primary aim of this work\nis to allow the development of standalone augmented reality applications for\nhandheld devices based on natural feature tracking. In order to achieve this\ngoal, a subset of two computer vision libraries was ported to the Pocket PC\nplatform. They were also adapted to use fixed point math, with the purpose of\nimproving the overall performance of the routines. The port of these libraries\nopens up the possibility of having other computer vision tasks being executed\non mobile platforms. A model based tracking approach that relies on edge\ninformation was adopted. Since it does not require a high processing power, it\nis suitable for constrained devices such as handhelds. The OpenGL ES graphics\nlibrary was used to perform computer vision tasks, taking advantage of existing\ngraphics hardware acceleration.

A Markov Decision Problem with an\naverage cost criterion is formulated where the possible actions are to either\ncontinue the retransmission process of an erroneous packet at the next time\nslot or to drop the packet and move on to the next packet awaiting for\ntransmission. The cost per slot is a linear combination of the current queue\nlength and a penalty term in case dropping is chosen as action. The\ninvestigation seeks policies that provide the best possible average packet\ndelay-dropping trade-off for Quality of Service guarantees. An optimal\ndeterministic stationary policy is shown to exist, several structural\nproperties of which are obtained. Based on that, a class of suboptimal\n<L,K>-policies is introduced. These suggest that it is almost optimal to use a\nK-truncated ARQ protocol as long as the queue length is lower than L, else send\nall packets in one shot. The work concludes with an evaluation of the optimal\ndelay-dropping tradeoff using dynamic programming and a comparison between the\noptimal and suboptimal policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2009 19:48:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Giovanidis", "Anastasios", ""], ["Wunder", "Gerhard", ""], ["Buehler", "Joerg", ""]]}]
