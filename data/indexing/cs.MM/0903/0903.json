These environment dynamics are often ignored in existing\nmulti-user video transmission solutions. To comply with the decentralized\nnature of wireless networks, we propose to decompose the MUMDP into local MDPs\nusing Lagrangian relaxation. Unlike in conventional multi-user video\ntransmission solutions stemming from the network utility maximization\nframework, the proposed decomposition enables each wireless user to\nindividually solve its own dynamic cross-layer optimization (i.e. the local\nMDP) and the network coordinator to update the Lagrangian multipliers (i.e.\nresource prices) based on not only current, but also future resource needs of\nall users, such that the long-term video quality of all users is maximized.\nHowever, solving the MUMDP requires statistical knowledge of the experienced\nenvironment dynamics, which is often unavailable before transmission time. To\novercome this obstacle, we then propose a novel online learning algorithm,\nwhich allows the wireless users to update their policies in multiple states\nduring one time slot. This is different from conventional learning solutions,\nwhich often update one state per time slot. The proposed learning algorithm can\nsignificantly improve the learning performance, thereby dramatically improving\nthe video quality experienced by the wireless users over time. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MUMDP framework as compared\nto conventional multi-user video transmission solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2009 04:49:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Fangwen", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2272", "submitter": "Antonio Ortega", "authors": "Sang-Yong Lee and Antonio Ortega", "title": "A Novel Approach for Compression of Images Captured using Bayer Color\n  Filter Arrays", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new approach for image compression in digital cameras, where the\ngoal is to achieve better quality at a given rate by using the characteristics\nof a Bayer color filter array. Most digital cameras produce color images by\nusing a single CCD plate, so that each pixel in an image has only one color\ncomponent and therefore an interpolation method is needed to produce a full\ncolor image. After the image processing stage, in order to reduce the memory\nrequirements of the camera, a lossless or lossy compression stage often\nfollows. But in this scheme, before decreasing redundancy through compression,\nredundancy is increased in an interpolation stage. In order to avoid increasing\nthe redundancy before compression, we propose algorithms for image compression\nin which the order of the compression and interpolation stages is reversed. We\nintroduce image transform algorithms, since non interpolated images cannot be\ndirectly compressed with general image coders. The simulation results show that\nour algorithm outperforms conventional methods with various color interpolation\nmethods in a wide range of compression ratios. Our proposed algorithm provides\nnot only better quality but also lower encoding complexity because the amount\nof luminance data used is only half of that in conventional methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2009 07:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Sang-Yong", ""], ["Ortega", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.3103", "submitter": "Chunhua Shen", "authors": "Chunhua Shen, Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, and Jian Zhang", "title": "Efficiently Learning a Detection Cascade with Sparse Eigenvectors", "comments": "12 pages, conference version published in CVPR2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.AI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we first show that feature selection methods other than\nboosting can also be used for training an efficient object detector.

In most of the cases, the\noverlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However,\nthis causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying\nphysical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary\ndistances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data\ntransmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should\nresemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the\nproximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based\nclustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust\noverlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of\ncontent pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven\nmesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to\ncarry the long haul traffic and less stable nodes with intermittent presence\nare organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery\nprocedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good\nlocality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead\ninduced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal as demonstrated by the\nanalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 15:58:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2009 22:41:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Asaduzzaman", "Shah", ""], ["Qiao", "Ying", ""], ["Bochmann", "Gregor v.", ""]]}]
