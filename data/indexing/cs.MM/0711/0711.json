However,\ntill now, no solutions for the security of fractal encoded images have been\nprovided. In this paper, a secure fractal image coding scheme is proposed and\nevaluated, which encrypts some of the fractal parameters during fractal\nencoding, and thus, produces the encrypted and encoded image. The encrypted\nimage can only be recovered by the correct key. To keep secure and efficient,\nonly the suitable parameters are selected and encrypted through in-vestigating\nthe properties of various fractal parameters, including parameter space,\nparameter distribu-tion and parameter sensitivity. The encryption process does\nnot change the file format, keeps secure in perception, and costs little time\nor computational resources. These properties make it suitable for secure image\nencoding or transmission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 03:53:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lian", "Shiguo", ""]]}]
