The science\nwelcomes any tinny contribution that may increase the compression ratio by\nwhichever insignificant percentage. Therefore, the essential contribution in\nthis paper is to increase the compression ratio for the well known Portable\nNetwork Graphics (PNG) image file format. The contribution starts with\nconverting the original PNG image into k-Modulus Method (k-MM). Practically,\ntaking k equals to ten, and then the pixels in the constructed image will be\nintegers divisible by ten. Since PNG uses Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm,\nthen the ability to reduce file size will increase according to the repetition\nin pixels in each k-by-k window according to the transformation done by k-MM.\nExperimental results show that the proposed technique (k-PNG) produces high\ncompression ratio with smaller file size in comparison to the original PNG\nfile.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 22:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jassim", "Firas A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0642", "submitter": "Firas Ajil Jassim", "authors": "Firas A.

This paper is to create a practical steganographic\nimplementation to hide text inside grey scale images. The secret message is\nhidden inside the cover image using Five Modulus Method. The novel algorithm is\ncalled (ST-FMM. FMM which consists of transforming all the pixels within the\n5X5 window size into its corresponding multiples of 5. After that, the secret\nmessage is hidden inside the 5X5 window as a non-multiples of 5. Since the\nmodulus of non-multiples of 5 are 1,2,3 and 4, therefore; if the reminder is\none of these, then this pixel represents a secret character. The secret key\nthat has to be sent is the window size. The main advantage of this novel\nalgorithm is to keep the size of the cover image constant while the secret\nmessage increased in size. Peak signal-to-noise ratio is captured for each of\nthe images tested. Based on the PSNR value of each images, the stego image has\nhigh PSNR value. Hence this new steganography algorithm is very efficient to\nhide the data inside the image.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2013 09:33:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Jassim", "Firas A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0849", "submitter": "James Yang", "authors": "James Yifei Yang and Bruce Hajek", "title": "Single Video Performance Analysis for Video-on-Demand Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the content placement problem for cache delivery video-on-demand\nsystems under static random network topologies with fixed heavy-tailed video\ndemand.
