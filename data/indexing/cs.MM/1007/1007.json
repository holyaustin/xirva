This image will be act as reference image to hide the text. Using this\ngrey scale reference image any text can be hidden. Single character of a text\ncan be represented by 8-bit. The 8-bit character can be split into 4X2 bit\ninformation. If the reference image and the data file are transmitted through\nnetwork separately, we can achieve the effect of Steganography. Here the image\nis not at all distorted because said image is only used for referencing. Any\nhuge mount of text material can be hidden using a very small image. Decipher\nthe text is not possible intercepting the image or data file separately. So, it\nis more secure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 09:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bandyopadhyay", "Samir Kumar", ""], ["Maitra", "Indra Kanta", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4134", "submitter": "Svebor Karaman", "authors": "Svebor Karaman (LaBRI), Jenny Benois-Pineau (LaBRI), R\\'emi M\\'egret\n  (IMS), Vladislavs Dovgalecs (IMS), Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Dartigues, Yann\n  Ga\\\"estel (ISPED)", "title": "Human Daily Activities Indexing in Videos from Wearable Cameras for\n  Monitoring of Patients with Dementia Diseases", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ICPR 2010, Istanbul : Turquie (2010)", "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2010.999", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our research focuses on analysing human activities according to a known\nbehaviorist scenario, in case of noisy and high dimensional collected data.

This paper deals with a fuzzy inference filter to\nchoose the larger entropy of coefficients to embed watermarks. Unlike most\nprevious watermarking frameworks which embedded watermarks in the larger\ncoefficients of inner coarser subbands, the proposed technique is based on\nutilizing a context model and fuzzy inference filter by embedding watermarks in\nthe larger-entropy coefficients of coarser DWT subbands. The proposed\napproaches allow us to embed adaptive casting degree of watermarks for\ntransparency and robustness to the general image-processing attacks such as\nsmoothing, sharpening, and JPEG compression. The approach has no need the\noriginal host image to extract watermarks. Our schemes have been shown to\nprovide very good results in both image transparency and robustness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 07:41:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Ming-Shing", "", "Aletheia University, Taiwan"]]}]
