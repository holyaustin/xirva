Recently, the web is evolving as a popular platform for\neverything we do on the Internet including email, text chat, voice calls,\ndiscussions, enterprise apps and multi-party collaboration. Unfortunately,\nthere is a disconnect between web and traditional Internet telephony protocols\nas they have ignored the constraints and requirements of each other.\nConsequently, the Flash Player is being used as a web browser plugin by many\ndevelopers for web-based voice and video calls. We describe the challenges of\nvideo communication using a web browser, present a simple API using a Flash\nPlayer application, show how it supports wide range of web communication\nscenarios in the cloud, and describe how it can interoperate with Session\nInitiation Protocol (SIP)-based systems. We describe both the advantages and\nchallenges of Flash Player based communication applications. The presented API\ncould guide future work on communication-related web protocol extensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Kundan", ""], ["Davids", "Carol", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.0690", "submitter": "Emilio Ferrara", "authors": "Salvatore Catanese, Emilio Ferrara, Giacomo Fiumara, Francesco Pagano", "title": "A Framework for Designing 3D Virtual Environments", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure, Proceedings of the 4th International ICST\n  Conference On Intelligent Technologies For Interactive Entertainment, 2011", "journal-ref": "Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social\n  Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering Volume 78, 2012, pp 209-218", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-30214-5_23", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The process of design and development of virtual environments can be\nsupported by tools and frameworks, to save time in technical aspects and\nfocusing on the content.

We believe that an emphasis on low end-to-end delays between any two\nparties in the conference is a must, and the source sending rate in a session\nshould adapt to bandwidth availability and congestion. We present Celerity, a\nmulti-party conferencing solution specifically designed to achieve our\nobjectives. It is entirely Peer-to-Peer (P2P), and as such eliminating the cost\nof maintaining centrally administered servers. It is designed to deliver video\nwith low end-to-end delays, at quality levels commensurate with available\nnetwork resources over arbitrary network topologies where bottlenecks can be\nanywhere in the network. This is in contrast to commonly assumed P2P scenarios\nwhere bandwidth bottlenecks reside only at the edge of the network. The\nhighlight in our design is a distributed and adaptive rate control protocol,\nthat can discover and adapt to arbitrary topologies and network conditions\nquickly, converging to efficient link rate allocations allowed by the\nunderlying network. In accordance with adaptive link rate control, source video\nencoding rates are also dynamically controlled to optimize video quality in\narbitrary and unpredictable network conditions. We have implemented Celerity in\na prototype system, and demonstrate its superior performance over existing\nsolutions in a local experimental testbed and over the Internet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2011 14:14:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 Jul 2011 08:28:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 09:51:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 16:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "X.", ""], ["Chen", "M.", ""], ["Li", "B.", ""], ["Zhao", "Y.", ""], ["Wu", "Y.", ""], ["Li", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.2222", "submitter": "Radu Arsinte", "authors": "Radu Arsinte", "title": "Study of a Hybrid - Analog TV and Ethernet- Home Data Link using a\n  Coaxial Cable", "comments": "5 pages, 12 figures; Acta Technica Napocensis, Electronics and\n  telecommunications, No.1/2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper presents an implementation and compatibility tests of a simple home\nnetwork implemented in a nonconventional manner using a CATV coaxial cable.\nReusing the cable, normally designated to supply RF modulated TV signals from\ncable TV networks, makes possible to add data services as well.
