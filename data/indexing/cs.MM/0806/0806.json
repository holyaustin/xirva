The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is used as an\napproximation of one-dimensional probability density function for transform\ncoefficients obtained by modulated lapped transform (MLT) or modified cosine\ntransform (MDCT) filterbank. The rationale of the model is provided in\ncomparison with theoretically achievable rate-distortion function. The\nrate-distortion function computed for the random sequence obtained from a real\nsequence of samples from a large database is compared with that computed for\nrandom sequence obtained by a GGD random generator. A simple algorithm of\nconstructing the Extended Zero Zone (EZZ) quantizer is proposed. Simulation\nresults show that the EZZ quantizer yields a negligible loss in terms of coding\nefficiency compared to optimal scalar quantizers. Furthermore, we describe an\nadaptive version of the EZZ quantizer which works efficiently with low bitrate\nrequirements for transmitting side information\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2008 12:19:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kudryashov", "Boris D.", ""], ["Porov", "Anton V.", ""], ["Oh", "Eunmi L.", ""]]}]
