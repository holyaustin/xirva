Usually products are designed and built by considering\ngeneral usage patterns and Prototyping is used to mimic the static or working\nbehaviour of an actual product before manufacturing the product. The user does\nnot have any control on the design of the product. Personalized design\npostpones design to a later stage. It allows for personalized selection of\nindividual components by the user. This is implemented by displaying the\nindividual components over a physical model constructed using Cardboard or\nThermocol in the actual size and shape of the original product. The components\nof the equipment or product such as screen, buttons etc. are then projected\nusing a projector connected to the computer into the physical model. Users can\ninteract with the prototype like the original working equipment and they can\nselect, shape, position the individual components displayed on the interaction\npanel using simple hand gestures. Computer Vision techniques as well as sound\nprocessing techniques are used to detect and recognize the user gestures\ncaptured using a web camera and microphone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 20:26:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zacharia", "Kurien", ""], ["Elias", "Eldo P.", ""], ["Varghese", "Surekha Mariam", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2368", "submitter": "Afzal  Godil", "authors": "Sarah Tang and Afzal Godil", "title": "An evaluation of local shape descriptors for 3D shape retrieval", "comments": "IS&T/SPIE Electronic Imaging 2012, Proceedings Vol. 8290\n  Three-Dimensional Image Processing (3DIP) and Applications II, Atilla M.\n  Baskurt; Robert Sitnik, Editors, 82900N Dates: Tuesday-Thursday 24 - 26\n  January 2012, Paper 8290-22", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.912153", "report-no": "Paper 8290-22, Proceedings Vol. 8290", "categories": "cs.CV cs.CG cs.DL cs.IR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As the usage of 3D models increases, so does the importance of developing\naccurate 3D shape retrieval algorithms.

In this paper, a new technique has been proposed\nby combining the JPEG algorithm and Symbol Reduction Huffman technique for\nachieving more compression ratio. The symbols reduction technique reduces the\nnumber of symbols by combining together to form a new symbol. As a result of\nthis technique the number of Huffman code to be generated also reduced.
