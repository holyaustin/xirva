They also wish to seamlessly change the\nPoAs during their ongoing sessions to improve service quality and/or reduce\nmonetary cost. If appropriately handled, multihomed mobile nodes offer a\npotential solution to this issue. In this sense, the management of multihomed\nmobile nodes in heterogeneous environment is a key research topic. In this\npaper, we present an improvement of SIP mobility (pre-call plus mid-call\nmobility) to support seamless mobility of multihomed mobile nodes in\nheterogeneous wireless networks. Pre-call mobility is extended to associate\nuser identifier (i.e. SIP URI) and interface identifiers (i.e. IP addresses).\nThe multiple addresses of a mobile device are weighted by the user to create a\npriority list in the SIP server so as to guarantee resilient reachability of\nmobile nodes and to avoid unnecessary signaling through wireless links, thus\nsaving radio resources. Then, three variations of mid-call mobility, called\nhard, hybrid and soft procedures, are also proposed. Their main aim is to\nminimize, or even avoid, packet losses during interface switching at the mobile\nnode. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a wireless heterogeneous\ntestbed composed of 802.11 WLAN plus 3.5 cellular network, which are fully\ncontrolled and configurable. The testbed has been used to study the performance\nand the robustness of the three proposed mid-call mobility procedures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2009 13:55:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dini", "Paolo", ""], ["Nin-Guerrero", "Jaume", ""], ["Mangues-Bafalluy", "Josep", ""], ["Dai", "Lillian", ""], ["Addepalli", "Sateesh", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3082", "submitter": "Bela Genge", "authors": "Ovidiu Ratoi, Piroska Haller, Ioan Salomie, Bela Genge", "title": "Component based platform for multimedia applications", "comments": "7th IEEE RoEduNet International Conference, Cluj-Napoca, Romania,\n  Aug. 2008, pp. 40-43, ISBN 978-973-662-393-6", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a platform for distributed multimedia applications which\nsimplifies the development process and at the same time ensures application\nportability, flexibility and performance.

In this paper we\npropose a new watermarking technique, based on bit plane, which enhances\nrobustness and capacity of the watermark, as well as maintains transparency of\nthe watermark and fidelity of the image. In the proposed technique, higher\nstrength bit plane of digital signature watermark is embedded in to a\nsignificant bit plane of the original image. The combination of bit planes\n(image and watermark) selection is an important issue. Therefore, a mechanism\nis developed for appropriate bit plane selection. Ten different attacks are\nselected to test different alternatives. These attacks are given different\nweightings as appropriate to user requirement. A weighted correlation\ncoefficient for retrieved watermark is estimated for each of the alternatives.\nBased on these estimated values optimal bit plane combination is identified for\na given user requirement. The proposed method is found to be useful for\nauthentication and to prove legal ownership. We observed better results by our\nproposed method in comparison with the previously reported work on pseudorandom\nwatermark embedded in least significant bit (LSB) plane.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 18:52:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kejgir", "Sushma", ""], ["Kokare", "Manesh", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4074", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Priti Maheswary and Namita Srivastava", "title": "Retrieval of Remote Sensing Images Using Colour and Texture Attribute", "comments": "5 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 4, No. 1 & No. 2, August 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.IR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Grouping images into semantically meaningful categories using low-level\nvisual feature is a challenging and important problem in content-based image\nretrieval.
