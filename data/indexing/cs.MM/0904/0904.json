In this paper, we\npresent an extension of an existing distributed software and network\narchitecture for collaborative teleoperation based on networked human-scaled\nmixed reality and mobile platform. The first teleoperation system was composed\nby a VR application and a Web application. However the 2 systems cannot be used\ntogether and it is impossible to control a distant robot simultaneously. Our\ngoal is to update the teleoperation system to permit a heterogeneous\ncollaborative teleoperation between the 2 platforms. An important feature of\nthis interface is based on different Mobile platforms to control one or many\nrobots.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2009 11:21:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Domingues", "Christophe", "", "IBISC"], ["Otmane", "Samir", "", "IBISC"], ["Davesne", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "IBISC"], ["Mallem", "Malik", "", "IBISC"]]}, {"id": "0904.3693", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Dieter Penteliuc Cotosman", "title": "The Multimedia Product - between Design and Information, Design and\n  Utility and Design and Entertainment", "comments": "28 pages,exposed on 1st \"European Conference on Computer Sciences &\n  Applications\" - XA2006, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.

In current erasure coding\nschemes, the packets that are not rebuilt at the receiver side are either lost\nor delayed by at least one RTT before transmission to the application. The\npresent contribution aims at demonstrating that Tetrys coding scheme can fill\nthe gap between real-time applications requirements and full reliability.\nIndeed, we show that in several cases, Tetrys can recover lost packets below\none RTT over lossy and best-effort networks. We also show that Tetrys allows to\nenable full reliability without delay compromise and as a result: significantly\nimproves the performance of time constrained applications. For instance, our\nevaluations present that video-conferencing applications obtain a PSNR gain up\nto 7dB compared to classic block-based erasure codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 16:09:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 07:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 12 Nov 2010 09:03:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 12:41:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tournoux", "Pierre-Ugo", ""], ["Lochin", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Lacan", "Jerome", ""], ["Bouabdallah", "Amine", ""], ["Roca", "Vincent", ""]]}]
