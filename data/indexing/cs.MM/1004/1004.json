Speaker identification required to make a claim on\nthe identity of speaker from the Ns trained speaker in its user database. In\nthis study, we propose the combination of clustering algorithm and the\nclassification technique - subtractive and Radial Basis Function (RBF). The\nproposed technique is chosen because RBF is a simpler network structures and\nfaster learning algorithm. RBF finds the input to output map using the local\napproximators which will combine the linear of the approximators and cause the\nlinear combiner have few weights. Besides that, RBF neural network model using\nsubtractive clustering algorithm for selecting the hidden node centers, which\ncan achieve faster training speed. In the meantime, the RBF network was trained\nwith a regularization term so as to minimize the variances of the nodes in the\nhidden layer and perform more accu-rate prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 09:57:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Albidewi", "Ibrahim A.", ""], ["Ann", "Yap Teck", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4459", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Anjali Malviya and S.

The\navailability of a system, enhancing human ability to perceive the observed\nscenario, is crucial to improve the performance of a surveillance system. The\ninfrared (IR) camera captures thermal image of object in night-time\nenvironment, when only limited visual information can be captured by RGB\ncamera. The fusion of data recorded by an IR sensor and a visible RGB camera\ncan produce information otherwise not obtainable by viewing the sensor outputs\nseparately. In this paper we consider the problem of fusing two video streams\nacquired by an RGB camera and an IR sensor. The pedestrians, distinctly\ncaptured by IR video, are separated and fused with the RGB video. The\nalgorithms implemented involve estimation of the background, followed by\ndetection of object from the IR Video, after necessary denoising. Finally a\nsuitable fusion algorithm is employed to combine the extracted pedestrians with\nthe visual output. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed video fusion scheme, for night vision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 10:01:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Malviya", "Anjali", ""], ["Bhirud", "S.
