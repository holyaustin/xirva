In this paper a novel approach\nfor compensating the distortion of any interpolation based on modular method\nhas been proposed. In this method the performance of the modular method is\noptimized by adding only some simply calculated coefficients. This approach\ncauses drastic improvement in terms of SNRs with fewer modules compared to the\nclassical modular method. Simulation results clearly confirm the improvement of\nthe proposed method and also its superior robustness against additive noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 20:20:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ayremlou", "Ali", ""], ["Tofighi", "Mohammad", ""], ["Marvasti", "Farokh", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.2893", "submitter": "Patrick Seeling", "authors": "Patrick Seeling", "title": "Web Conferencing Traffic - An Analysis using DimDim as Example", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5121/ijcnc.2010.2601", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present an evaluation of the Ethernet traffic for host and\nattendees of the popular opensource web conferencing system DimDim. While\ntraditional Internet-centric approaches such as the MBONE have been used over\nthe past decades, current trends for web-based conference systems make\nexclusive use of application-layer multicast. To allow for network dimensioning\nand QoS provisioning, an understanding of the underlying traffic\ncharacteristics is required. We find in our exemplary evaluations that the host\nof a web conference session produces a large amount of Ethernet traffic,\nlargely due to the required control of the conference session, that is\nheavily-tailed distributed and exhibits additionally long-range dependence. For\ndifferent groups of activities within a web conference session, we find\ndistinctive characteristics of the generated traffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Nov 2010 12:11:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Seeling", "Patrick", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5458", "submitter": "Hossein Hosseini", "authors": "H.

We add a\nredundancy to the original image by mapping the transform coefficients with\nsmall amplitudes to zero and the resultant sparsity pattern is used as the side\ninformation in the recovery stage. If the side information is not available,\nthe receiver has to estimate the sparsity pattern. At the end, the recovery is\ndone by consecutive projecting between two spatial and transform sets.\nExperimental results show that our method works well for both structural and\ntexture images and outperforms other techniques in objective and subjective\nperformance measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 18:58:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseini", "H.", ""], ["Marvasti", "N.
