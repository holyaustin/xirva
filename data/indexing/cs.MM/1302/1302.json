To address these concerns, we propose a privacy-preserving photo\nencoding algorithm that extracts and encrypts a small, but significant,\ncomponent of the photo, while preserving the remainder in a public,\nstandards-compatible, part. These two components can be separately stored. This\ntechnique significantly reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy of\nautomated detection and recognition on the public part, while preserving the\nability of the provider to perform server-side transformations to conserve\ndownload bandwidth usage.
