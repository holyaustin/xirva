To attack this difficulty,\nwe propose a new approach called collaborative receptive field learning to\nextract specific receptive fields (RF's) or regions from multiple images, and\nthe selected RF's are supposed to focus on the foreground objects of a common\ncategory. To this end, we solve the problem by maximizing a submodular function\nover a similarity graph constructed by a pool of RF candidates. However,\nmeasuring pairwise distance of RF's for building the similarity graph is a\nnontrivial problem. Hence, we introduce a similarity metric called\npyramid-error distance (PED) to measure their pairwise distances through\nsumming up pyramid-like matching errors over a set of low-level features.\nBesides, in consistent with the proposed PED, we construct a simple\nnonparametric classifier for classification. Experimental results show that our\nmethod effectively discovers the foreground objects in images, and improves\nclassification performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Feb 2014 10:11:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kong", "Shu", ""], ["Jiang", "Zhuolin", ""], ["Yang", "Qiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.0812", "submitter": "Radu Arsinte", "authors": "Alexandru Florin Antone and Radu Arsinte", "title": "A Study on the Optimal Implementation of Statistical Multiplexing in DVB\n  Distribution Systems", "comments": "8 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": "Informatics and IT Today, Volume 1, July 2013, pp.19-27", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper presents an overview of the main methods used to improve the\nefficiency of DVB systems, based on multiplexing, through a study on the impact\nof the multiplexing methods used in DVB, having as a final goal a better usage\nof the data capacity and the possibility to insert new services into the\noriginal DVB Transport Stream.

While much of the existing research\nhas focused on extracting robust and secure content descriptors, a significant\nopen challenge still remains: Most existing video hashing methods are fallible\nto temporal desynchronization. That is, when the query video results by\ndeleting or inserting some frames from the reference video, most existing\nmethods assume the positions of the deleted (or inserted) frames are either\nperfectly known or reliably estimated. This assumption may be okay under\ntypical transcoding and frame-rate changes but is highly inappropriate in\nadversarial scenarios such as anti-piracy video search. For example, an illegal\nuploader will try to bypass the 'piracy check' mechanism of YouTube/Dailymotion\netc by performing a cleverly designed non-uniform resampling of the video. We\npresent a new solution based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which can implement\nautomatic synchronization and can be used together with existing video hashing\nmethods. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new robust\nfeature extraction method called flow hashing (FH), based on frame averaging\nand optical flow descriptors. Finally, a fusion mechanism called distance\nboosting is proposed to combine the information extracted by DTW and FH.\nExperiments on real video collections show that such a hash extraction and\ncomparison enables unprecedented robustness under both spatial and temporal\nattacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 21:02:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Mu", ""], ["Monga", "Vishal", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.5979", "submitter": "Renato J Cintra", "authors": "V.
