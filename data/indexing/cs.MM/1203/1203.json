But these methods are not good for\npreserving the local content of the image which is a major factor for various\nimages like medical and aerial images. Therefore new method is proposed here.\nThis method is referred as \"Human vision thresholding with enhancement\ntechnique for dark blurred images for local content preservation\". It uses\nhuman vision thresholding together with an existing enhancement method for dark\nblurred images. Furthermore a comparative study with another method for local\ncontent preservation is done which is further extended to make it suitable for\ncontrast improvement.

Watermarking has variety of\napplications like: Copyright Protection, Owner Identification, Copy Protection\nand Data Hiding etc., depending upon the type of watermark insertion algorithm.\nWatermark remains in the content after applying various attacks without any\ndistortions. The blind watermarking method used in the system is based on a\nwavelet transform, a fuzzy inference system and a multi-resolution\nrepresentation (MRR) of the 3d model. The watermark scrambled by Arnold\nTransform is embedded in the wavelet coefficients at third resolution level of\nthe MRR. Fuzzy logic approach used in the method makes it to approximate the\nbest possible gain with an accurate scaling factor so that the watermark\nremains invisible. The fuzzy input variables are computed for each wavelet\ncoefficient in the 3D model. The output of the fuzzy system is a single value\nwhich is a perceptual value for each corresponding wavelet coefficient. Thus,\nthe fuzzy perceptual mask combines all these non-linear variables to build a\nsimple, easy to use HVS model.
