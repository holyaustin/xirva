Specifically the video sequence is partitioned\ninto spatio temporal units and the single shots are projected onto the 3D\nwavelet domain. First a grayscale watermark image is decomposed into a series\nof bitplanes that are preprocessed with a random location matrix. After that\nthe preprocessed bitplanes are adaptively spread spectrum and added in 3D\nwavelet coefficients of the video shot. Our video watermarking algorithm is\nrobust against the attacks of frame dropping, averaging and swapping.\nFurthermore, it allows blind retrieval of embedded watermark which does not\nneed the original video and the watermark is perceptually invisible. The\nalgorithm design, evaluation, and experimentation of the proposed scheme are\ndescribed in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 20:07:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Essaouabi", "A.", ""], ["Regragui", "F.", ""], ["Ibnelhaj", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0499", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Vani Perumal, Jagannathan Ramaswamy", "title": "An Innovative Scheme For Effectual Fingerprint Data Compression Using\n  Bezier Curve Representations", "comments": "9 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 149-157, October 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.CV cs.CR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Naturally, with the mounting application of biometric systems, there arises a\ndifficulty in storing and handling those acquired biometric data. Fingerprint\nrecognition has been recognized as one of the most mature and established\ntechnique among all the biometrics systems. In recent times, with fingerprint\nrecognition receiving increasingly more attention the amount of fingerprints\ncollected has been constantly creating enormous problems in storage and\ntransmission. Henceforth, the compression of fingerprints has emerged as an\nindispensable step in automated fingerprint recognition systems. Several\nresearchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image\ncompression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for\neffective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in\nthe fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using\nthe approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all\nthe ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of\nall the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint\nimage. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the stored\ncontrol points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed\nfingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation. The proposed scheme achieves\nconsiderable memory reduction in storing the fingerprint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2009 05:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Perumal", "Vani", ""], ["Ramaswamy", "Jagannathan", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.4642", "submitter": "Isabel Rodet", "authors": "Nicolas Castagn\\'e (ACROE), Claude Cadoz (ACROE, ICA), Ali Allaoui\n  (ACROE, ICA), Olivier Michel Tache (ACROE)", "title": "G3 : GENESIS software envrionment update", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Computer Music Conference (ICMC), Montr\\'eal :\n  Canada (2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SD cs.HC cs.MM cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  GENESIS3 is the new version of the GENESIS software environment for musical\ncreation by means of mass-interaction physics network modeling.
