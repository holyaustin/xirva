In the literature, we often consider two kinds of fusion schemes: The\nearly fusion and the late fusion. In this paper we focus on late classifier\nfusion, where one combines the scores of each modality at the decision level.\nTo tackle this problem, we investigate a recent and elegant well-founded\nquadratic program named MinCq coming from the Machine Learning PAC-Bayes\ntheory. MinCq looks for the weighted combination, over a set of real-valued\nfunctions seen as voters, leading to the lowest misclassification rate, while\nmaking use of the voters' diversity. We provide evidence that this method is\nnaturally adapted to late fusion procedure. We propose an extension of MinCq by\nadding an order- preserving pairwise loss for ranking, helping to improve Mean\nAveraged Precision measure. We confirm the good behavior of the MinCq-based\nfusion approaches with experiments on a real image benchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 15:09:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Morvant", "Emilie", "", "LIF"], ["Habrard", "Amaury", "", "LAHC"], ["Ayache", "St\u00e9phane", "", "LIF"]]}, {"id": "1207.2268", "submitter": "Imen Chaabouni Masmoudi", "authors": "Imen Chaabouni and Wiem Fourati and Med Salim Bouhlel", "title": "Improvement of ISOM by using filter", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables; JCSI (May 2012 issue, Volume 9, Issue\n  3) and having paper id IJCSI-2012-9-3-2860", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Image compression helps in storing the transmitted data in proficient way by\ndecreasing its redundancy. This technique helps in transferring more digital or\nmultimedia data over internet as it increases the storage space. It is\nimportant to maintain the image quality even if it is compressed to certain\nextent. Depend upon this the image compression is classified into two\ncategories : lossy and lossless image compression. There are many lossy digital\nimage compression techniques exists. Among this Incremental Self Organizing Map\nis a familiar one. The good pictures quality can be retrieved if image\ndenoising technique is used for compression and also provides better\ncompression ratio. Image denoising is an important pre-processing step for many\nimage analysis and computer vision system. It refers to the task of recovering\na good estimate of the true image from a degraded observation without altering\nand changing useful structure in the image such as discontinuities and edges.\nMany approaches have been proposed to remove the noise effectively while\npreserving the original image details and features as much as possible. This\npaper proposes a technique for image compression using Incremental Self\nOrganizing Map (ISOM) with Discret Wavelet Transform (DWT) by applying\nfiltering techniques which play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of a\nreconstructed image. The experimental result shows that the proposed technique\nobtained better compression ratio value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2012 08:49:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chaabouni", "Imen", ""], ["Fourati", "Wiem", ""], ["Bouhlel", "Med Salim", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.2863", "submitter": "Emmanuel Lochin", "authors": "Pierre-Ugo Tournoux, Tuan Tran Thai, Emmanuel Lochin, Jerome Lacan,\n  Vincent Roca", "title": "Erasure Coding and Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time\n  Communication", "comments": "IAB/IRTF Workshop on Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time\n  Communication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of real-time applications over the Internet is a challenging problem\nthat the QoS epoch attempted to solve by proposing the DiffServ architecture.\nToday, the only existing service provided by the Internet is still best-effort.\nAs a result, multimedia applications often perform on top of a transport layer\nthat provides a variable sending rate.

The key theoretical contribution is to\ncharacterize the distance between peers in a graph formed by the superposition\nof directed random Hamiltonian cycles, in which edges from one of the cycles\nmay be dropped at random.
