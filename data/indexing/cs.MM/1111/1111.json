This model is used\nwith a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer to track the accumulated difference\nbetween the receiving frame interval and the playout frame interval. We then\napply Lyapunov optimization to the model to systematically derive a pair of\ndecoupled optimization policies. We show that the occupancy of the\ndiscontinuity penalty virtual buffer is correlated to the video discontinuity\nand that this framework produces a very low playout distortion in addition to a\nsignificant reduction in the prebuffering requirements compared to existing\napproaches.
