The case of a monochrome board is\ntreated, but practically all conclusions and methods may be extended for colour\nacquisition. Basically, the proposed parameters are grouped in five sets as\nfollows:Internal noise;Video ADC cuantisation parameters;Analogue processing\nsection parameters;Dominant frequencies;Synchronisation (lock-in) accuracy. On\nbasis of this set of parameters was developed a software environment, in\nconjunction with a test signal generator that allows the \"test\" images. The\npaper also presents conclusions of evaluation for two types of video\nacquisition boards\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 08:57:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Arsinte", "Radu", ""], ["Miron", "Costin", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0405", "submitter": "Giulia Menconi", "authors": "Marco Franciosi, Giulia Menconi", "title": "Multi-dimensional sparse time series: feature extraction", "comments": "Keywords: multimedia mining, trend, entropy, Zipf law", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show an analysis of multi-dimensional time series via entropy and\nstatistical linguistic techniques. We define three markers encoding the\nbehavior of the series, after it has been translated into a multi-dimensional\nsymbolic sequence. The leading component and the trend of the series with\nrespect to a mobile window analysis result from the entropy analysis and label\nthe dynamical evolution of the series. The diversification formalizes the\ndifferentiation in the use of recurrent patterns, from a Zipf law point of\nview. These markers are the starting point of further analysis such as\nclassification or clustering of large database of multi-dimensional time\nseries, prediction of future behavior and attribution of new data.
