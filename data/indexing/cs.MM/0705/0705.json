Due to its nice property of utilizing but\nnot rejecting the host interference, it has a big advantage over the host\ninterference schemes in that the perceptual analysis can be easily implemented\nfor our scheme to achieve the locally bounded maximum embedding strength. Thus,\nin this work, we detail how to implement the perceptual analysis in our\ndouble-sided schemes since the perceptual analysis is very important for\nimproving the fidelity of watermarked contents. Through the extensive\nperformance comparisons, we can further validate the performance advantage of\nour double-sided schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2007 12:23:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Zhong", "Jidong", ""], ["Huang", "Shangteng", ""]]}]
