We propose a novel\nsolution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level\nknowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time. Instead, we\ntranslate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender's video packets into\na monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time\nhorizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability\nfor deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders' video\nstreams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA)\napproach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the\ndeadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA\napproach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends\non the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal\nfor weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time.
