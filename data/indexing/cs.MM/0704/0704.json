It is expected that P2P IPTV will contribute to increase the overall\nInternet traffic. In this context, it is important to measure the impact of P2P\nIPTV on the networks and to characterize this traffic. Dur- ing the 2006 FIFA\nWorld Cup, we performed an extensive measurement campaign. We measured network\ntraffic generated by broadcasting soc- cer games by the most popular P2P IPTV\napplications, namely PPLive, PPStream, SOPCast and TVAnts. From the collected\ndata, we charac- terized the P2P IPTV traffic structure at different time\nscales by using wavelet based transform method. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work, which presents a complete multiscale analysis of the\nP2P IPTV traffic. Our results show that the scaling properties of the TCP\ntraffic present periodic behavior whereas the UDP traffic is stationary and\nlead to long- range depedency characteristics. For all the applications, the\ndownload traffic has different characteristics than the upload traffic. The\nsignaling traffic has a significant impact on the download traffic but it has\nnegligible impact on the upload. Both sides of the traffic and its granularity\nhas to be taken into account to design accurate P2P IPTV traffic models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2007 16:18:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2007 14:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Silverston", "Thomas", ""], ["Fourmaux", "Olivier", ""], ["Salamatian", "Kave", ""]]}]
