The method involves feature-dimension reduction based on a piecewise\nlinear representation of a sequential feature trajectory extracted from a long\naudio stream. Two techniques enable us to obtain a piecewise linear\nrepresentation: the dynamic segmentation of feature trajectories and the\nsegment-based Karhunen-L\\'{o}eve (KL) transform. The proposed search method\nguarantees the same search results as the search method without the proposed\nfeature-dimension reduction method in principle. Experiment results indicate\nsignificant improvements in search speed. For example the proposed method\nreduced the total search time to approximately 1/12 that of previous methods\nand detected queries in approximately 0.3 seconds from a 200-hour audio\ndatabase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2007 03:06:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kimura", "Akisato", ""], ["Kashino", "Kunio", ""], ["Kurozumi", "Takayuki", ""], ["Murase", "Hiroshi", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4658", "submitter": "EDA Publishing Association", "authors": "A.

This paper\nproposes a new method that imposes compositionality to the system?s performance\nand makes different memory hierarchy optimizations possible for multimedia\ncommunicating tasks when running on embedded multiprocessor architectures. The\nmethod is based on a cache allocation strategy that assigns sets of the unified\ncache exclusively to tasks and to the communication buffers. We also\nanalytically formulate the problem and describe a method to compute the cache\npartitioning ratio for optimizing the throughput and the consumed power. When\napplied to a multiprocessor with memory hierarchy our technique delivers also\nperformance gain.
