This capacity gain can often be leveraged by\nutilizing channel state information at the transmitter and the receiver. Users\nmake use of this channel state information for transmit signal adaptation. In\nthis correspondence, we derive the capacity region for the MIMO multiple access\nchannel (MIMO MAC) when partial channel state information is available at the\ntransmitters, where we assume a synchronous MIMO multiuser uplink. The partial\nchannel state information feedback has a cardinality constraint and is fed back\nfrom the basestation to the users using a limited rate feedback channel. Using\nthis feedback information, we propose a finite codebook design method to\nmaximize sum-rate. In this correspondence, the codebook is a set of transmit\nsignal covariance matrices. We also derive the capacity region and codebook\ndesign methods in the case that the covariance matrix is rank-one (i.e.,\nbeamforming). This is motivated by the fact that beamforming is optimal in\ncertain conditions. The simulation results show that when the number of\nfeedback bits increases, the capacity also increases. Even with a small number\nof feedback bits, the performance of the proposed system is close to an optimal\nsolution with the full feedback.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2008 04:56:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Il Han", ""], ["Love", "David J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3285", "submitter": "Radu Arsinte", "authors": "Radu Arsinte, Ciprian Ilioaei", "title": "Some Aspects of Testing Process for Transport Streams in Digital Video\n  Broadcasting", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Acta Technica Napocensis, Electronics and Telecommunications,\n  nr.1/2004 pp.59-74", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.MM", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper presents some aspects related to the DVB (Digital Video\nBroadcasting) investigation.
