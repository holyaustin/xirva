Underwater images when captured\nusually have Gaussian noise, speckle noise and salt and pepper noise. In this\nwork, five different image filtering algorithms are compared for the three\ndifferent noise types. The performances of the filters are compared using the\nPeak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE). The modified\nspatial median filter gives desirable results in terms of the above two\nparameters for the three different noise. Forty underwater images are taken for\nstudy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Dec 2009 12:33:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Padmavathi", "Dr. G.", ""], ["Subashini", "Dr. P.", ""], ["Kumar", "Mr. M.

The objective of the paper is to maximize the availability of streams\nfor the peers in the VoD system. We have achieved this by using data\nreplication technique in the peers. Hence, we proposed a new data replication\ntechnique to optimally store the videos in the peers. The new data replication\ntechnique generates more number of replicas than the existing techniques such\nas random, minimum request and maximize hit. We have also investigated by\napplying the CTMC model for the reliability of replications during the peer\nfailures. Our result shows that the mean lifetime of replicas are more under\nvarious circumstances. We have addressed the practical issues of efficient\nutilization of overall bandwidth and buffer in the VoD system.
