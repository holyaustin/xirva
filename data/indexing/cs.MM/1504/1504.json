We assume that only weak video-level annotations are\navailable for training. The goal is to use these weak labels to identify\ntemporal segments corresponding to the actions, and learn models that\ngeneralize to unconstrained web videos. We find that web images queried by\naction names serve as well-localized highlights for many actions, but are\nnoisily labeled. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective\nmethod that takes weak video labels and noisy image labels as input, and\ngenerates localized action frames as output. This is achieved by cross-domain\ntransfer between video frames and web images, using pre-trained deep\nconvolutional neural networks. We then use the localized action frames to train\naction recognition models with long short-term memory networks. We collect a\nfine-grained sports action data set FGA-240 of more than 130,000 YouTube\nvideos. It has 240 fine-grained actions under 85 sports activities.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep\nlearning framework for video classification, which is able to model static\nspatial information, short-term motion, as well as long-term temporal clues in\nthe videos. Specifically, the spatial and the short-term motion features are\nextracted separately by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These two\ntypes of CNN-based features are then combined in a regularized feature fusion\nnetwork for classification, which is able to learn and utilize feature\nrelationships for improved performance. In addition, Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks are applied on top of the two features to further model\nlonger-term temporal clues. The main contribution of this work is the hybrid\nlearning framework that can model several important aspects of the video data.\nWe also show that (1) combining the spatial and the short-term motion features\nin the regularized fusion network is better than direct classification and\nfusion using the CNN with a softmax layer, and (2) the sequence-based LSTM is\nhighly complementary to the traditional classification strategy without\nconsidering the temporal frame orders. Extensive experiments are conducted on\ntwo popular and challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101 Human Actions and the\nColumbia Consumer Videos (CCV).
