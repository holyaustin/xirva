The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet\nprotocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent\nrequirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource\nconstrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve\nperceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can\nbe addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer\nand link layer. Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this\nadaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless\nmedium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that\nthe rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the\nrequirements of the applications given the current channel and network\nconditions. A number of propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the\nliterature. In this chapter, an extensive review has been made on these\ncross-layer architectures that combine the application-layer, transport layer\nand the link layer controls. Particularly, the issues like channel estimation\ntechniques, adaptive controls at the application and link layers for energy\nefficiency, priority based scheduling, transmission rate control at the\ntransport layer, and adaptive automatic repeat request (ARQ) are discussed in\ndetail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2011 03:35:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2012 04:27:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1208", "submitter": "Aman Chadha Mr.", "authors": "Aman Chadha, Divya Jyoti, M.

Such methods utilize several training samples so as to achieve high\naccuracy. Moreover, several constraints are imposed on the end-user so that the\nsystem may work optimally, and as expected. For example, the user is made to\nsign within a small box, in order to limit their signature to a predefined set\nof dimensions, thus eliminating scaling. Moreover, the angular rotation with\nrespect to the referenced signature that will be inadvertently introduced as\nhuman error, hampers performance of biometric signature verification systems.\nTo eliminate this, traditionally, a user is asked to sign exactly on top of a\nreference line. In this paper, we propose a robust system that optimizes the\nsignature obtained from the user for a large range of variation in\nRotation-Scaling-Translation (RST) and resolves these error parameters in the\nuser signature according to the reference signature stored in the database.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2011 10:20:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chadha", "Aman", ""], ["Jyoti", "Divya", ""], ["Roja", "M.

In our work we tackle the problem of\nstructural organization of local features. The structural features we propose\nare nested multi-layered local graphs built upon sets of SURF feature points\nwith Delaunay triangulation. A Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) framework is applied\non these graphs, giving birth to a Bag-of-Graph-Words representation. The\nmulti-layer nature of the descriptors consists in scaling from trivial Delaunay\ngraphs - isolated feature points - by increasing the number of nodes layer by\nlayer up to graphs with maximal number of nodes. For each layer of graphs its\nown visual dictionary is built. The experiments conducted on the SIVAL and\nCaltech-101 data sets reveal that the graph features at different layers\nexhibit complementary performances on the same content and perform better than\nbaseline BoVW approach. The combination of all existing layers, yields\nsignificant improvement of the object recognition performance compared to\nsingle level approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 18:44:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Karaman", "Svebor", "", "LaBRI"], ["Benois-Pineau", "Jenny", "", "LaBRI"], ["M\u00e9gret", "R\u00e9mi", "", "IMS"], ["Bugeau", "Aur\u00e9lie", "", "LaBRI"]]}]
