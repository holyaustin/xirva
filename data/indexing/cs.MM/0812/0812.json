First, all the source images are decomposed\ninto low and high frequency sub-bands and then fusion of high frequency\nsub-bands is done by the means of Directive Contrast. Now, inverse wavelet\npacket transform is performed to reconstruct the fused image. The performance\nof the algorithm is carried out by the comparison made between proposed and\nexisting algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 17:29:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Balasubramanian", "R.", ""], ["Bhatnagar", "Gaurav", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1244", "submitter": "Fangwen Fu", "authors": "Fangwen Fu, Mihaela van der Schaar", "title": "Decomposition Principles and Online Learning in Cross-Layer Optimization\n  for Delay-Sensitive Applications", "comments": "30 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a general cross-layer optimization framework in\nwhich we explicitly consider both the heterogeneous and dynamically changing\ncharacteristics of delay-sensitive applications and the underlying time-varying\nnetwork conditions. We consider both the independently decodable data units\n(DUs, e.g. packets) and the interdependent DUs whose dependencies are captured\nby a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We first formulate the cross-layer design as\na non-linear constrained optimization problem by assuming complete knowledge of\nthe application characteristics and the underlying network conditions. The\nconstrained cross-layer optimization is decomposed into several cross-layer\noptimization subproblems for each DU and two master problems. The proposed\ndecomposition method determines the necessary message exchanges between layers\nfor achieving the optimal cross-layer solution. However, the attributes (e.g.\ndistortion impact, delay deadline etc) of future DUs as well as the network\nconditions are often unknown in the considered real-time applications. The\nimpact of current cross-layer actions on the future DUs can be characterized by\na state-value function in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Based on\nthe dynamic programming solution to the MDP, we develop a low-complexity\ncross-layer optimization algorithm using online learning for each DU\ntransmission. This online algorithm can be implemented in real-time in order to\ncope with unknown source characteristics, network dynamics and resource\nconstraints. Our numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nonline algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 23:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Fangwen", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2405", "submitter": "SeyyedMajid Valiollahzadeh", "authors": "SeyyedMajid Valiollahzadeh, Mohammad Nazari, Massoud Babaie-Zadeh,\n  Christian Jutten", "title": "A New Trend in Optimization on Multi Overcomplete Dictionary toward\n  Inpainting", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "ICASSP 2009", "categories": "cs.MM cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, great attention was intended toward overcomplete dictionaries and\nthe sparse representations they can provide.
