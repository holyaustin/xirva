In this embedding scheme, some\nusers are assigned the same fingerprint code with only different embedding\ndelay. The algorithm's robustness against collusion attacks is investigated.\nHowever, its robustness against common desynchronization attacks, e.g.,\ncropping and time shifting, is not considered. In this paper, desynchronization\nattacks are used to break the delay-based fingerprint embedding algorithm. To\nimprove the robustness, two means are proposed to keep the embedded fingerprint\ncodes synchronized, i.e., adding a synchronization fingerprint and adopting the\nrelative delay to detect users. Analyses and experiments are given to show the\nimprovements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2008 03:15:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lian", "Shiguo", ""]]}]
