We first formulate the transmission scheduling\nproblem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and systematically unravel the\nstructural properties (e.g. concavity in the state-value function and\nmonotonicity in the optimal scheduling policy) exhibited by the optimal\nsolutions. We then propose an online learning algorithm which preserves these\nstructural properties and achieves -optimal solutions for an arbitrarily small\n. The advantages of the proposed online method are that: (i) it does not\nrequire a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics and\n(ii) it adaptively approximates the state-value functions using piece-wise\nlinear functions and has low storage and computation complexity. We also extend\nthe proposed low-complexity online learning solution to the prioritized data\ntransmission. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves significantly better utility (or delay)-energy trade-offs when\ncomparing to existing state-of-art online optimization methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Mar 2010 04:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Fangwen", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.3080", "submitter": "Achmad Benny Mutiara", "authors": "A.

Several methods\nsuch as Liner Predictive Predictive Coding (LPC), Hidden Markov Model (HMM),\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) and etc are evaluated with a view to identify a\nstraight forward and effective method for voice signal.

The non-parametric method for modelling the human auditory\nperception system, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are utilize as\nextraction techniques. The non linear sequence alignment known as Dynamic Time\nWarping (DTW) introduced by Sakoe Chiba has been used as features matching\ntechniques.

The Laplacian Pyramid\n(LP) is used to capture the point discontinuities, and then followed by a\nDirectional Filter Bank (DFB) to link point discontinuities. The coefficients\nof down sampled low pass version of LP decomposed image are re-ordered in a\npre-determined manner and prediction algorithm is used to reduce entropy\n(bits/pixel). In addition, the coefficients of CT are quantized based on the\nenergy in the particular band. The superiority of proposed algorithm to JPEG is\nobserved in terms of reduced blocking artifacts. The results are also compared\nwith wavelet transform (WT). Superiority of CT to WT is observed when the image\ncontains more contours. The watermark image is embedded in the low pass image\nof contourlet decomposition. The watermark can be extracted with minimum error.\nIn terms of PSNR, the visual quality of the watermarked image is exceptional.\nThe proposed algorithm is robust to many image attacks and suitable for\ncopyright protection applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2010 06:51:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Swamy", "Kilari Veera", ""], ["Mohan", "B.
