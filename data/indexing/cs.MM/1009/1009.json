The key\nelement to successful femtocells/macrocell integration lies in its\nself-organizing capability. Provisioning of quality of service is the main\ntechnical challenge of the femtocell/macrocell integrated networks, while the\nmain administrative challenge is the choice of the proper evolutionary path\nfrom the existing macrocellular networks to the integrated network. In this\narticle, we introduce three integrated network architectures which, while\nincreasing the access capacity, they also reduce the deployment and operational\ncosts. Then, we discuss a number of technical issues, which are key to making\nsuch integration a reality, and we offer possible approaches to their solution.\nThese issues include efficient frequency and interference management, quality\nof service provisioning of the xDSL-based backhaul networks, and intelligent\nhandover control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 12:39:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Chowdhury", "Mostafa Zaman", ""], ["Jang", "Yeong Min", ""], ["Haas", "Zygmunt J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3779", "submitter": "Mostafa Zaman Chowdhury", "authors": "Mostafa Zaman Chowdhury and Yeong Min Jang", "title": "Handover Control for WCDMA Femtocell Networks", "comments": "Published in \"The Journal of Korea Information and Communication\n  Society\" for the volume of May 2010", "journal-ref": "The Journal of Korea Information and Communication Society, May\n  2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The ability to seamlessly switch between the macro networks and femtocell\nnetworks is a key driver for femtocell network deployment. The handover\nprocedures for the integrated femtocell/macrocell networks differ from the\nexisting handovers. Some modifications of existing network and protocol\narchitecture for the integration of femtocell networks with the existing\nmacrocell networks are also essential. These modifications change the signal\nflow for handover procedures due to different 2-tier cell (macrocell and\nfemtocell) environment. The handover between two networks should be performed\nwith minimum signaling. A frequent and unnecessary handover is another problem\nfor hierarchical femtocell/macrocell network environment that must be\nminimized. This work studies the details mobility management schemes for small\nand medium scale femtocell network deployment. To do that, firstly we present\ntwo different network architectures for small scale and medium scale WCDMA\nfemtocell deployment. The details handover call flow for these two network\narchitectures and CAC scheme to minimize the unnecessary handovers are proposed\nfor the integrated femtocell/macrocell networks.

These resources are often aggravated by many factors like the\ntemporal constraints for availability or node flooding by the requested\nreplicated file chunks. Thus replicated file chunks should be efficiently\ndisseminated in order to enable resource availability on-demand by the mobile\nusers. This work considers a cross layered middleware support system for\nefficient delay-sensitive streaming by using each device's connectivity and\nsocial interactions in a cross layered manner. The collaborative streaming is\nachieved through the epidemically replicated file chunk policy which uses a\ntransition-based approach of a chained model of an infectious disease with\nsusceptible, infected, recovered and death states. The Gossip-based stateful\nmodel enforces the mobile nodes whether to host a file chunk or not or, when no\nlonger a chunk is needed, to purge it. The proposed model is thoroughly\nevaluated through experimental simulation taking measures for the effective\nthroughput Eff as a function of the packet loss parameter in contrast with the\neffectiveness of the replication Gossip-based policy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 09:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mavromoustakis", "Constandinos X.", ""], ["Karatza", "Helen D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5762", "submitter": "Jiaji Wu", "authors": "Jiaji Wu, Yan Xing, Anand Paul, Yong Fang, Jechang Jeong, Licheng\n  Jiao, Guangming Shi", "title": "Morphological dilation image coding with context weights prediction", "comments": "33 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Signal Processing: Image\n  Communication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.MM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes an adaptive morphological dilation image coding with\ncontext weights prediction.
