The buffer is modeled as an M/M/1 queue, plus the consideration of\nbursty arrivals. When the buffer is empty, the service restarts after a certain\namount of packets are \\emph{prefetched}. With this goal, we propose two\napproaches to obtain the \\emph{exact distribution} of the number of buffer\nstarvations, one of which is based on \\emph{Ballot theorem}, and the other uses\nrecursive equations. The Ballot theorem approach gives an explicit result. We\nextend this approach to the scenario with a constant playback rate using\nT\\`{a}kacs Ballot theorem. The recursive approach, though not offering an\nexplicit result, can obtain the distribution of starvations with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) arrival process in which\nan ON/OFF bursty arrival process is considered in this work. We further compute\nthe starvation probability as a function of the amount of prefetched packets\nfor a large number of files via a fluid analysis. Among many potential\napplications of starvation analysis, we show how to apply it to optimize the\nobjective quality of experience (QoE) of media streaming, by exploiting the\ntradeoff between startup/rebuffering delay and starvations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2011 16:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Jan 2012 21:21:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2012 11:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 14:19:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 10:50:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Yuedong", ""], ["Altman", "Eitan", ""], ["El-Azouzi", "Rachid", ""], ["Haddad", "Majed", ""], ["Elayoubi", "Salaheddine", ""], ["Jimenez", "Tania", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0502", "submitter": "Ankit Chaudhary", "authors": "Jagdish Lal Raheja, Karen Das, Ankit Chaudhary", "title": "An Efficient Real Time Method of Fingertip Detection", "comments": "This paper was published in the 7th International Conference on\n  Trends in Industrial Measurements and Automation (TIMA 2011), CSIR Complex,\n  Chennai, India, 6-8 Jan, 2011, pp. 447-450", "journal-ref": "7th International Conference on Trends in Industrial Measurements\n  and Automation (TIMA 2011), CSIR Complex, Chennai, India, 6-8 Jan, 2011, pp.\n  447-450", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fingertips detection has been used in many applications, and it is very\npopular and commonly used in the area of Human Computer Interaction these days.\nThis paper presents a novel time efficient method that will lead to fingertip\ndetection after cropping the irrelevant parts of input image.

Until now, this task has been\nposed as a typical query-by-example task, where one submits a query song and\nthe system retrieves a list of possible matches ranked by their similarity to\nthe query. In this work, we propose a new approach which uses song communities\nto provide more relevant answers to a given query. Starting from the output of\na state-of-the-art system, songs are embedded in a complex weighted network\nwhose links represent similarity (related musical content). Communities inside\nthe network are then recognized as groups of covers and this information is\nused to enhance the results of the system. In particular, we show that this\napproach increases both the coherence and the accuracy of the system.\nFurthermore, we provide insight into the internal organization of individual\ncover song communities, showing that there is a tendency for the original song\nto be central within the community.

Differentiating from the traditional data compression approach, we\ndo not treat each buffer-map as an isolated data block, but consider the\ncorrelations between the sequentially exchanged buffer-maps. Under this\nframework, two buffer-map compression schemes are proposed and the correctness\nof the schemes is proved mathematically. Moreover, we derive the theoretical\nlimit of compression gain based on probability theory and information theory.\nBased on the system parameters of UUSee (a popular P2P streaming platform), our\nsimulations show that the buffer-map sizes are reduced by 86% and 90% (from 456\nbits down to only 66 bits and 46 bits) respectively after applying our schemes.\nFurthermore, by combining with the traditional compression methods (on\nindividual blocks), the sizes are decreased by 91% and 95% (to 42 bits and 24\nbits) respectively.
