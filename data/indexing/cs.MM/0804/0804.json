This also applies to\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and merging these two have already proven to be\nsuccessful (e.g. Skype). Even the existing standards of VoIP provide an\nassurance of security and Quality of Service (QoS), however, these features are\nusually optional and supported by limited number of implementations. As a\nresult, the lack of mandatory and widely applicable QoS and security guaranties\nmakes the contemporary VoIP systems vulnerable to attacks and network\ndisturbances. In this paper we are facing these issues and propose the SecMon\nsystem, which simultaneously provides a lightweight security mechanism and\nimproves quality parameters of the call. SecMon is intended specially for VoIP\nservice over P2P networks and its main advantage is that it provides\nauthentication, data integrity services, adaptive QoS and (D)DoS attack\ndetection. Moreover, the SecMon approach represents a low-bandwidth consumption\nsolution that is transparent to the users and possesses a self-organizing\ncapability. The above-mentioned features are accomplished mainly by utilizing\ntwo information hiding techniques: digital audio watermarking and network\nsteganography. These techniques are used to create covert channels that serve\nas transport channels for lightweight QoS measurement's results. Furthermore,\nthese metrics are aggregated in a reputation system that enables best route\npath selection in the P2P network. The reputation system helps also to mitigate\n(D)DoS attacks, maximize performance and increase transmission efficiency in\nthe network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2008 10:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ciszkowski", "Tomasz", ""], ["Eliasson", "Charlott", ""], ["Fiedler", "Markus", ""], ["Kotulski", "Zbigniew", ""], ["Lupu", "Radu", ""], ["Mazurczyk", "Wojciech", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4865", "submitter": "Fabricio  Benevenuto", "authors": "Fabricio Benevenuto, Fernando Duarte, Tiago Rodrigues, Virgilio\n  Almeida, Jussara Almeida, Keith Ross", "title": "Characterizing Video Responses in Social Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Video sharing sites, such as YouTube, use video responses to enhance the\nsocial interactions among their users.
