However, the expressing power of these\n\"single-example\" queries fails when the user's delicate query intent is not\navailable as a single example. Recently, the well-known skyline operator was\nreused in metric similarity search as a \"multi-example\" query type. When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline\noperator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances\n(similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric\nskyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all\nthe examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In\nthis paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use\nof PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the\noriginal M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs. In\nexperiments we also evaluate the partial metric skyline processing, where only\na controlled number of skyline objects is retrieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Skopal", "Tomas", ""], ["Lokoc", "Jakub", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.1468", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "P.

In this context request to service delay, network traffic,\ncongestion and server overloading are the main parameters to be considered in\nvideo streaming over the internet that effect the quality of service (QoS). In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient architecture as a cluster of proxy servers\nand clients that uses a peer to peer (P2P) approach to cooperatively stream the\nvideo using chaining technique. We consider the following two key issues in the\nproposed architecture (1) Prefix caching technique to accommodate more number\nof videos close to client (2) Cooperative client and proxy chaining to achieve\nthe network efficiency. Our simulation results shows that the proposed approach\nyields a prefix caching close to the optimal solution minimizing WAN bandwidth\nusage on server-proxy path by utilizing the proxy-client and client-client path\nbandwidth, which is much cheaper than the expensive server proxy path\nbandwidth, server load, and client rejection ratio significantly using\nchaining.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2009 11:26:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Dakshayini", "M", ""], ["Nair", "T R GopalaKrishnan", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4186", "submitter": "Hsien-Po Shiang", "authors": "Hsien-Po Shiang, Mihaela van der Schaar", "title": "Media-TCP: A Quality-Centric TCP-Friendly Congestion Control for\n  Multimedia Transmission", "comments": "15 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables, and 2 algorithms", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a quality-centric congestion control for multimedia\nstreaming over IP networks, which we refer to as media-TCP. Unlike existing\ncongestion control schemes that adapt a user's sending rate merely to the\nnetwork condition, our solution adapts the sending rate to both the network\ncondition and the application characteristics by explicitly considering the\ndistortion impacts, delay deadlines, and interdependencies of different video\npacket classes. Hence, our media-aware solution is able to provide differential\nservices for transmitting various packet classes and thereby, further improves\nthe multimedia streaming quality. We model this problem using a Finite-Horizon\nMarkov Decision Process (FHMDP) and determine the optimal congestion control\npolicy that maximizes the long-term multimedia quality, while adhering to the\nhorizon- TCP-friendliness constraint, which ensures long-term fairness with\nexisting TCP applications. We show that the FHMDP problem can be decomposed\ninto multiple optimal stopping problems, which admit a low-complexity\nthreshold-based solution. Moreover, unlike existing congestion control\napproaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,\nthe proposed media-TCP aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimedia\nusers. We also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users to\nachieve quality-based fairness using media-TCP congestion control. Our\nsimulation results show that the proposed media-TCP achieves more than 3dB\nimprovement in terms of PSNR over the conventional TCP congestion control\napproaches, with the largest improvements observed for real-time streaming\napplications requiring stringent playback delays.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2009 21:53:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Shiang", "Hsien-Po", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}]
