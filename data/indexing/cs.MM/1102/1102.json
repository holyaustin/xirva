Most solutions for\nproviding incentives in P2P networks are based on direct reciprocity, which are\nnot appropriate for most P2P multimedia sharing networks due to the unique\nfeatures exhibited by such networks: large populations of anonymous agents\ninteracting infrequently, asymmetric interests of peers, network errors, and\nmultiple concurrent transactions. In this paper, we design and rigorously\nanalyze a new family of incentive protocols that utilizes indirect reciprocity\nwhich is based on the design of efficient social norms. In the proposed P2P\nprotocols, the social norms consist of a social strategy, which represents the\nrule prescribing to the peers when they should or should not provide content to\nother peers, and a reputation scheme, which rewards or punishes peers depending\non whether they comply or not with the social strategy. We first define the\nconcept of a sustainable social norm, under which no peer has an incentive to\ndeviate. We then formulate the problem of designing optimal social norms, which\nselects the social norm that maximizes the network performance among all\nsustainable social norms. Hence, we prove that it becomes in the self-interest\nof peers to contribute their content to the network rather than to free-ride.\nWe also investigate the impact of various punishment schemes on the social\nwelfare as well as how should the optimal social norms be designed if\naltruistic and malicious peers are active in the network. Our results show that\noptimal social norms are capable of providing significant improvements in the\nsharing efficiency of multimedia P2P networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 04:36:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1600", "submitter": "Farhat  Masood", "authors": "Farhat Masood (National University of Sciences and Technology,\n  Pakistan)", "title": "A Study on Digital Video Broadcasting to a Handheld Device (DVB-H),\n  Operating in UHF Band", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computing Research Repository - CORR, vol. abs/1102.1, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we will understand that the development of the Digital Video\nBroadcasting to a Handheld (DVB-H) standard makes it possible to deliver live\nbroadcast television to a mobile handheld device.

Due to stringent QoS\nrequirements of video streams and specific characterization of utility\nexperienced by end-users, one has to solve nonconvex and even nonsmooth NUM\nformulation for such streams, where dual methods often prove incompetent.\nConvexification plays an important role in this work as it permits the use of\nexisting dual methods to solve an approximate to the NUM problem iteratively\nand distributively. Hence, to tackle the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity, we aim\nat reformulating the NUM problem through approximation and transformation of\nthe ideal discretely adaptive utility function for scalable video streams. The\nreformulated problem is shown to be a D.C. (Difference of Convex) problem. We\nleveraged Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach to replace the nonconvex\nD.C. problem by a sequence of convex problems that aim to approximate the\noriginal D.C. problem. We then solve each convex problem produced by SCP\napproach using existing dual methods. This procedure is the essence of two\ndistributed iterative rate control algorithms proposed in this paper, for which\none can show the convergence to a locally optimal point of the nonconvex D.C.\nproblem and equivalently to a locally optimal point of an approximate to the\noriginal nonconvex problem.

The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized\nfashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,\nand the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willing\nto act as cooperative relays. A pricing-based distributed resource allocation\nframework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestion\nin the network. Specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmission\nproblem as an MU Markov decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the\ncooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, the\nvideo users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varying\nnetwork conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategies\nacross time due to the shared wireless resource. Although MDPs notoriously\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriate\nsimplications and approximations, the complexity of the MU-MDP can be\nsignificantly mitigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that integrating\ncooperative decisions into the MU-MDP optimization can increase the resource\nprice in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease the\nprice in networks that support high transmission rates. Additionally, our\nresults show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to\nachieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 dB peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with less than 0.8 dB quality loss by users with\nstrong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energy\nconsumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant node\nwould require to achieve an equivalent PSNR without exploiting cooperative\ndiversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 19:11:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 23:32:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mastronarde", "Nicholas", ""], ["Verde", "Francesco", ""], ["Darsena", "Donatella", ""], ["Scaglione", "Anna", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5699", "submitter": "Rachit Mohan Garg", "authors": "Rachit Mohan Garg, Yamini Sood, Neha Tyagi", "title": "Ontology based approach for video transmission over the network", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": "The International journal of Multimedia & Its Applications (IJMA)\n  Vol.3, No.1, February 2011", "doi": "10.5121/ijma.2011.3106", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the increase in the bandwidth & the transmission speed over the\ninternet, transmission of multimedia objects like video, audio, images has\nbecome an easier work.
