This paper proposes a new feature vector called profile\nfor a keypoint in a bag of visual words model of an image. The profile of a\nkeypoint captures the spatial geometry of all the other keypoints in an image\nwith respect to itself, and is very effective in discriminating true matches\nfrom false matches. Sub-image search using profiles is a single-phase process\nrequiring no geometric validation, yields high precision on natural images, and\nworks well on small visual codebook. The proposed search technique differs from\ntraditional methods that first generate a set of candidates disregarding\nspatial information and then verify them geometrically. Conventional methods\nalso use large codebooks. We achieve a precision of 81% on a combined data set\nof synthetic and real natural images using a codebook size of 500 for top-10\nqueries; that is 31% higher than the conventional candidate generation\napproach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Oct 2010 17:42:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Vishwakarma", ""], ["Singh", "Ambuj K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2432", "submitter": "Gorge Sarah Prof.", "authors": "Rachit Mohan Garg, Shipra Kapoor, Kapil Kumar, Mohd.

Capacity, robustness and invisibility are important parameters\nin information hiding and are quite difficult to achieve in a single algorithm.\nThis paper proposes a novel steganography technique for digital color image\nwhich achieves the purported targets. The professed methodology employs a\ncomplete random scheme for pixel selection and embedding of data. Of the three\ncolour channels (Red, Green, Blue) in a given colour image, the least two\nsignificant bits of any one of the channels of the color image is used to\nchannelize the embedding capacity of the remaining two channels. We have\ndevised three approaches to achieve various levels of our desired targets. In\nthe first approach, Red is the default guide but it results in localization of\nMSE in the remaining two channels, which makes it slightly vulnerable. In the\nsecond approach, user gets the liberty to select the guiding channel (Red,\nGreen or Blue) to guide the remaining two channels. It will increase the\nrobustness and imperceptibility of the embedded image however the MSE factor\nwill still remain as a drawback. The third approach improves the performance\nfactor as a cyclic methodology is employed and the guiding channel is selected\nin a cyclic fashion. This ensures the uniform distribution of MSE, which gives\nbetter robustness and imperceptibility along with enhanced embedding capacity.\nThe imperceptibility has been enhanced by suitably adapting optimal pixel\nadjustment process (OPAP) on the stego covers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Oct 2010 19:07:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Amirtharajan", "R.", ""], ["Behera", "Sandeep Kumar", ""], ["Swarup", "Motamarri Abhilash", ""], ["K", "Mohamed Ashfaaq", ""], ["Rayappan", "John Bosco Balaguru", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4084", "submitter": "Kamrul Hasan Talukder", "authors": "Kamrul Hasan Talukder and Koichi Harada", "title": "Haar Wavelet Based Approach for Image Compression and Quality Assessment\n  of Compressed Image", "comments": "8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with standard references on\n  JPEG without attribution", "journal-ref": "IAENG International Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 36,\n  Issue 1, 2007", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the increasing growth of technology and the entrance into the digital\nage, we have to handle a vast amount of information every time which often\npresents difficulties.

Wavelets provide a mathematical way of encoding information in such a way\nthat it is layered according to level of detail. This layering facilitates\napproximations at various intermediate stages.

The particular\nwavelet chosen and used here is the simplest wavelet form namely the Haar\nWavelet. The 2D discret wavelet transform (DWT) has been applied and the detail\nmatrices from the information matrix of the image have been estimated. The\nreconstructed image is synthesized using the estimated detail matrices and\ninformation matrix provided by the Wavelet transform. The quality of the\ncompressed images has been evaluated using some factors like Compression Ratio\n(CR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Picture\nQuality Scale (PQS) etc.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Oct 2010 01:52:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Talukder", "Kamrul Hasan", ""], ["Harada", "Koichi", ""]]}]
