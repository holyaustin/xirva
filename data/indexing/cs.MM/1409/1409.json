The goal of a CBIR algorithm is to retrieve\nsemantically similar images in response to a query image submitted by the end\nuser. CBIR is a hard problem because of the phenomenon known as $\\textit\n{semantic gap}$.\n  In this thesis, we aim at analyzing the performance of a CBIR system build\nusing local feature vectors and Intermediate Matching Kernel. We also propose a\nTwo-Step Matching process for reducing the response time of the CBIR systems.\nFurther, we develop a Meta-Learning framework for improving the retrieval\nperformance of these systems. Our results show that the Two-Step Matching\nprocess significantly reduces response time and the Meta-Learning Framework\nimproves the retrieval performance by more than two fold. We also analyze the\nperformance of various image classification systems that use different image\nrepresentations constructed from the local feature vectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 15:17:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Verma", "Vikas", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0915", "submitter": "H.

The result is not only congestion and poor\nQuality-of-Experience, but also an unprecedented energy drain at both the\nnetwork and user devices. In order to sustain this continued growth, novel\ndisruptive paradigms of media delivery are urgently needed. We envision that\ntwo key contemporary advancements can be leveraged to develop greener media\ndelivery platforms: 1) the proliferation of navigation hardware and software in\nmobile devices has created an era of location-awareness, where both the current\nand future user locations can be predicted; and 2) the rise of context-aware\nnetwork architectures and self-organizing functionalities is enabling context\nsignaling and in-network adaptation. With these developments in mind, this\narticle investigates the opportunities of exploiting location-awareness to\nenable green end-to-end media delivery. In particular, we discuss and propose\napproaches for location-based adaptive video quality planning, in-network\ncaching, content prefetching, and long-term radio resource management. To\nprovide insights on the energy savings, we then present a cross-layer framework\nthat jointly optimizes resource allocation and multi-user video quality using\nlocation predictions.

Clusters of related non-obvious attributes,\ncalled interpretation dimensions, emerge when people are asked to compare\nimages, and provide important insight on aspects of social images that are\nconsidered relevant.

The layered data is encoded by means of Prioritized\nRandom Linear Coding (PRLC) in order to be resilient to channel loss while\nrespecting the unequal levels of importance in the data, and data blocks are\ntransmitted simultaneously in order to reduce decoding delays and improve the\ndelivery performance. We formulate the optimal coding and scheduling decisions\nproblem in our novel framework with the help of Markov Decision Processes\n(MDP), which are effective tools for modeling adapting streaming systems.\nReinforcement learning approaches are then proposed to derive reduced\ncomputational complexity solutions to the adaptive coding and scheduling\nproblems. The novel reinforcement learning approaches and the MDP solution are\nexamined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission. Our\nmethods offer large performance gains over competing methods that deliver the\ndata blocks sequentially. The experimental evaluation also shows that our novel\nalgorithms offer continuous playback and guarantee small quality variations\nwhich is not the case for baseline solutions. Finally, our work highlights the\nadvantages of reinforcement learning algorithms to forecast the temporal\nevolution of data demands and to decide the optimal coding and scheduling\ndecisions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 18:47:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Thomos", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Kurdoglu", "Eymen", ""], ["Frossard", "Pascal", ""], ["Van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}]
