In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to\nfill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 10:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lui", "Lok Ming", ""], ["Wen", "Chengfeng", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.2064", "submitter": "Youssef Bassil", "authors": "Youssef Bassil", "title": "An Image Steganography Scheme using Randomized Algorithm and\n  Context-Free Grammar", "comments": "LACSC - Lebanese Association for Computational Sciences,\n  http://www.lacsc.org", "journal-ref": "Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Technology (JACST), Vol.\n  1, No. 4, pp. 291-305, 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Currently, cryptography is in wide use as it is being exploited in various\ndomains from data confidentiality to data integrity and message authentication.\nBasically, cryptography shuffles data so that they become unreadable by\nunauthorized parties.

Fundamentally, steganography\nconceals secret data into innocent-looking mediums called carriers which can\nthen travel from the sender to the receiver safe and unnoticed. This paper\nproposes a novel steganography scheme for hiding digital data into uncompressed\nimage files using a randomized algorithm and a context-free grammar.

The English text is generated at runtime using a context-free grammar\ncoupled with a lexicon of English words. The proposed scheme is stealthy, and\nhard to be noticed, detected, and recovered.

The difference between steganography and cryptography is\nthat steganography is a stealthy method of communication that only the\ncommunicating parties are aware of; while, cryptography is an overt method of\ncommunication that anyone is aware of, despite its payload is scribbled.\nTypically, an irrecoverable steganography algorithm is the algorithm that makes\nit hard for malicious third parties to discover how it works and how to recover\nthe secret data out of the carrier file. One popular way to achieve\nirrecoverability is to digitally process the carrier file after hiding the\nsecret data into it. However, such process is irreversible as it would destroy\nthe concealed data. This paper proposes a new image steganography method for\ntextual data, as well as for any form of digital data, based on adjusting the\nbrightness of the carrier image after covering the secret data into it. The\nalgorithm used is parameterized as it can be configured using three different\nparameters defined by the communicating parties. They include the amount of\nbrightness to apply on the carrier image after the completion of the covering\nprocess, the color channels whose brightness should be adjusted, and the bytes\nthat should carry in the secret data. The novelty of the proposed method is\nthat it embeds bits of the secret data into the three LSBs of the bytes that\ncompose the carrier image in such a way that does not destroy the secret data\nwhen restoring back the original brightness of the carrier image.
