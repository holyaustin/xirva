Thus in this work, we discuss\nhow to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a\nsummary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major\nwatermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely\ncenters upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and\ndetectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to\na particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the\noptimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection\nschemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum\nschemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with\nthe perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level\ndiscourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this\nwork, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs\nfrom the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not\nreject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be\neasily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of\nembedding strength.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2007 05:37:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhong", "Jidong", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1141", "submitter": "Matthias Brust R.", "authors": "Adrian Andronache, Matthias R.

Contrary to infrastructured\nnetworks, in multi-hop ad-hoc networks each node acts as a router as well as\nsender and receiver. Some applications, however, requires hierarchical\narrangements that-for practical reasons-has to be done locally and\nself-organized. An additional challenge is to deal with mobility that causes\npermanent network partitioning and re-organizations. Technically, these\nproblems can be tackled by providing additional uplinks to a backbone network,\nwhich can be used to access resources in the Internet as well as to inter-link\nmultiple ad-hoc network partitions, creating a hybrid wireless network. In this\npaper, we present a prototypically implemented hybrid wireless network system\noptimized for multimedia content distribution. To efficiently manage the ad-hoc\ncommunicating devices a weighted clustering algorithm is introduced. The\nproposed localized algorithm deals with mobility, but does not require\ngeographical information or distances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jun 2007 09:31:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Andronache", "Adrian", ""], ["Brust", "Matthias R.", ""], ["Rothkugel", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.3076", "submitter": "Shiguo Lian", "authors": "Shiguo Lian, Zhongxuan Liu, Zhen Ren, Haila Wang", "title": "On the Performance of Joint Fingerprint Embedding and Decryption Scheme", "comments": "10 pages,9 figures.
