Apart\nfrom characterizing existing steganographic methods we provide new insights by\npresenting two new techniques. The first one is network steganography solution\nwhich exploits free/unused protocols' fields and is known for IP, UDP or TCP\nprotocols but has never been applied to RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) and\nRTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) which are characteristic for VoIP. The second\nmethod, called LACK (Lost Audio Packets Steganography), provides hybrid\nstorage-timing covert channel by utilizing delayed audio packets. The results\nof the experiment, that was performed to estimate a total amount of data that\ncan be covertly transferred during typical VoIP conversation phase, regardless\nof steganalysis, are also included in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 May 2008 20:46:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Aug 2008 10:40:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mazurczyk", "Wojciech", ""], ["Szczypiorski", "Krzysztof", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3538", "submitter": "Wojciech Mazurczyk", "authors": "Wojciech Mazurczyk and Krzysztof Szczypiorski", "title": "Covert Channels in SIP for VoIP signalling", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-69403-8_9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we evaluate available steganographic techniques for SIP\n(Session Initiation Protocol) that can be used for creating covert channels\nduring signaling phase of VoIP (Voice over IP) call.
