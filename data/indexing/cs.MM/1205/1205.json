Steganography, the concealing of information, arose early\non as an extremely useful method for covert information transmission.\nSteganography is the art of hiding secret message within a larger image or\nmessage such that the hidden message or an image is undetectable; this is in\ncontrast to cryptography, where the existence of the message itself is not\ndisguised, but the content is obscure. The goal of a steganographic method is\nto minimize the visually apparent and statistical differences between the cover\ndata and a steganogram while maximizing the size of the payload. Current\ndigital image steganography presents the challenge of hiding message in a\ndigital image in a way that is robust to image manipulation and attack.

The benefits of the LSB are its simplicity to embed the bits of the\nmessage directly into the LSB plane of cover-image and many techniques using\nthese methods. The LSB does not result in a human perceptible difference\nbecause the amplitude of the change is little therefore the human eye the\nresulting stego image will look identical to the cover image and this allows\nhigh perceptual transparency of the LSB.

However, this kind of convenience with which authorized\nusers can access information, turns out to be a mixed blessing due to\ninformation piracy. The emerging field of Digital Rights Management (DRM)\nsystems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital\ncontent. In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) DRM system, called \"Imaging\nSystem with Watermarking and Attack Resilience\" (ISWAR), is presented that\ngenerates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for\nprotection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security\nattacks. In addition to the methods, in the object-oriented sense, for\nperforming traditional encryption and decryption, the system implements methods\nfor visible and invisible watermarking. This paper presents one visible and one\ninvisible watermarking algorithm that have been integrated in the system. The\nqualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking\nalgorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked\nimages are produced by the algorithms. With the help of experimental results it\nis demonstrated that the presented invisible watermarking techniques are\nresilient to the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method for\nproviding constant protection to ownership rights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 05:25:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mohanty", "Saraju P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4572", "submitter": "Jing Liu", "authors": "Jing Liu, Fei Qiao, Qi Wei, Huazhong Yang", "title": "A Novel Video Compression Approach Based on Underdetermined Blind Source\n  Separation", "comments": "4 pages with 4 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops a new video compression approach based on underdetermined\nblind source separation.

Many of these\npatterns and metrics have been consistently stable for a period of more than\nfifty years, thus pointing towards a great degree of conventionalism.\nNonetheless, we prove important changes or trends related to the restriction of\npitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette, and the growing\nloudness levels.
