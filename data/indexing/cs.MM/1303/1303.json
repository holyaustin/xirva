IVUS can detect myocardial infarction (heart attack) that remains\nignored and unattended when only angioplasty is done. During the past decade,\nit became easier for some individuals or groups to copy and transmits digital\ninformation without the permission of the owner. For increasing authentication\nand security of copyrights, digital watermarking, an information hiding\ntechnique, was introduced. Achieving watermarking technique with lesser amount\nof distortion in biomedical data is a challenging task. Watermark can be\nembedded into an image or in a video. As video data is a huge amount of\ninformation, therefore a large storage area is needed which is not feasible. In\nthis case motion vector based video compression is done to reduce size. In this\npresent paper, an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) is embedded as watermark\nwithin an IVUS video and then motion vector is calculated. This proposed method\nproves robustness as the extracted watermark has good PSNR value and less MSE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Mar 2013 14:08:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Nilanjan", ""], ["Acharjee", "Suvojit", ""], ["Biswas", "Debalina", ""], ["Das", "Achintya", ""], ["Chaudhuri", "Sheli Sinha", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.2330", "submitter": "Sreelakshmi M S", "authors": "M.S.Sreelakshmi, D.

We have tested this technique on several\nimages and found that it is quite satisfactory.
