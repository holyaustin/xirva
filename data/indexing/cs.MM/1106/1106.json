The Standard Model of particle physics postulates that a hypothetical\nparticle, the Higgs boson, is responsible for the breaking of the symmetry\nbetween the electromagnetic force and the weak force. This phase transition may\nhave been responsible for triggering Baryogenesis, the generation of an\nabundance of matter over anti-matter. This hypothesis is known as Electroweak\nBaryogenesis. In this simulation, aspects of bubble nucleation in Standard\nModel Electroweak Baryogenesis were examined and modeled using Mathematica, and\nsonified using SuperCollider3. The resulting simulation, which has been used\nfor pedagogical purposes by one of the authors, suggests interesting\npossibilities for the integration of science and aesthetics as well as auditory\nperception. The sonification component in particular also had the unexpected\nbenefit of being useful in debugging the Mathematica code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 20:22:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Winters", "R.

Each pixel in the sensor has a binary response, giving only a one-bit\nquantized measurement of the local light intensity. To analyze its performance,\nwe formulate the oversampled binary sensing scheme as a parameter estimation\nproblem based on quantized Poisson statistics. We show that, with a\nsingle-photon quantization threshold and large oversampling factors, the\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the estimation variance approaches that of\nan ideal unquantized sensor, that is, as if there were no quantization in the\nsensor measurements. Furthermore, the CRLB is shown to be asymptotically\nachievable by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). By showing that the\nlog-likelihood function of our problem is concave, we guarantee the global\noptimality of iterative algorithms in finding the MLE. Numerical results on\nboth synthetic data and images taken by a prototype sensor verify our\ntheoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our image\nreconstruction algorithm. They also suggest the potential application of the\noversampled binary sensing scheme in high dynamic range photography.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2011 03:52:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 23:08:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Feng", ""], ["Lu", "Yue M.", ""], ["Sbaiz", "Luciano", ""], ["Vetterli", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2729", "submitter": "Svebor Karaman", "authors": "Svebor Karaman (LaBRI), Jenny Benois-Pineau (LaBRI), R\\'emi M\\'egret\n  (IMS)", "title": "Nested Graph Words for Object Recognition", "comments": "Preliminary version of accepted paper \"Multi-Layer Local Graph Words\n  for Object Recognition\".

Despite the very large literature\nexisting on the scalability issues in CBIR in the sense of retrieval\napproaches, the scalability of media and scalability of features remain an\nissue. In our work we tackle the problem of scalability and structural\norganization of features. The proposed features are nested local graphs built\nupon sets of SURF feature points with Delaunay triangulation. A\nBag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) framework is applied on these graphs, giving birth\nto a Bag-of-Graph-Words representation. The nested nature of the descriptors\nconsists in scaling from trivial Delaunay graphs - isolated feature points - by\nincreasing the number of nodes layer by layer up to graphs with maximal number\nof nodes. For each layer of graphs its proper visual dictionary is built. The\nexperiments conducted on the SIVAL data set reveal that the graph features at\ndifferent layers exhibit complementary performances on the same content. The\nnested approach, the combination of all existing layers, yields significant\nimprovement of the object recognition performance compared to single level\napproaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 14:43:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Apr 2014 08:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Karaman", "Svebor", "", "LaBRI"], ["Benois-Pineau", "Jenny", "", "LaBRI"], ["M\u00e9gret", "R\u00e9mi", "", "IMS"]]}, {"id": "1106.4451", "submitter": "Svebor Karaman", "authors": "Svebor Karaman (LaBRI), Jenny Benois-Pineau (LaBRI), Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois\n  Dartigues, Yann Ga\\\"estel (ISPED), R\\'emi M\\'egret (IMS), Julien Pinquier\n  (IRIT)", "title": "Activities of Daily Living Indexing by Hierarchical HMM for Dementia\n  Diagnostics", "comments": "2011 9th International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing\n  (CBMI), Madrid : Spain (2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/CBMI.2011.5972524", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a method for indexing human ac- tivities in videos\ncaptured from a wearable camera being worn by patients, for studies of\nprogression of the dementia diseases.

The recorded videos have strong motion and sharp lighting\nchanges, inducing noise for the analysis. The proposed approach is based on a\ntwo steps analysis. First, we propose a new approach to segment this type of\nvideo, based on apparent motion. Each segment is characterized by two original\nmotion de- scriptors, as well as color, and audio descriptors. Second, a\nHidden-Markov Model formulation is used to merge the multimodal audio and video\nfeatures, and classify the test segments.

In\nparticular, the client-server web protocol over reliable TCP is not always\nsuitable for end-to-end low latency media path needed for interactive voice and\nvideo communication. To solve this, we compare the available platform options\nusing the existing technologies such as modifying the web programming language\nand protocol, using an existing web browser plugin, and a separate host\nresident application that the web browser can talk to. We argue that using a\nseparate application as an adaptor is a promising short term as well as\nlong-term strategy for voice and video communications on the web. Our project\naims at developing the open technology and sample implementations for web-based\nreal-time voice and video communication applications. We describe the\narchitecture of our project including (1) a RESTful web communication API over\nHTTP inspired by SIP message flows, (2) a web-friendly set of metadata for\nsession description, and (3) an UDP-based end-to-end media path. All other\ntelephony functions reside in the web application itself and/or in web feature\nservers. The adaptor approach allows us to easily add new voice and video\ncodecs and NAT traversal technologies such as Host Identity Protocol. We want\nto make web-based communication accessible to millions of web developers,\nmaximize the end user experience and security, and preserve the huge global\ninvestment in and experience from SIP systems while adhering to web standards\nand development tools as much as possible.
