Some works (e.g. Network Utility Maximization (NUM)) are myopic:\nthey choose actions to maximize instantaneous video quality while ignoring the\nfuture impact of these actions. Such myopic solutions are known to be inferior\nto foresighted solutions that optimize the long-term video quality.\nAlternatively, foresighted solutions such as rate-distortion optimized packet\nscheduling focus on single-user wireless video transmission, while ignoring the\nresource allocation among the users.\n  In this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing joint\nforesighted resource allocation and packet scheduling among multiple users\ntransmitting video over a shared wireless network. A key challenge in\ndeveloping foresighted solutions for multiple video users is that the users'\ndecisions are coupled. To decouple the users' decisions, we adopt a novel dual\ndecomposition approach, which differs from the conventional optimization\nsolutions such as NUM, and determines foresighted policies. Specifically, we\npropose an informationally-decentralized algorithm in which the network manager\nupdates resource \"prices\" (i.e. the dual variables associated with the resource\nconstraints), and the users make individual video packet scheduling decisions\nbased on these prices.
