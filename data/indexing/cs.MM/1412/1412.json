This results in large amounts of highly redundant\ndata, which needs to be properly handled during encoding and transmission over\nresource-constrained channels. In this work, we study coding and transmission\nstrategies in multicamera systems, where correlated sources send data through a\nbottleneck channel to a central server, which eventually transmits views to\ndifferent interactive users. We propose a dynamic correlation-aware packet\nscheduling optimization under delay, bandwidth, and interactivity constraints.\nThe optimization relies both on a novel rate-distortion model, which captures\nthe importance of each view in the 3D scene reconstruction, and on an objective\nfunction that optimizes resources based on a client navigation model. The\nlatter takes into account the distortion experienced by interactive clients as\nwell as the distortion variations that might be observed by clients during\nmultiview navigation. We solve the scheduling problem with a novel\ntrellis-based solution, which permits to formally decompose the multivariate\noptimization problem thereby significantly reducing the computation complexity.\nSimulation results show the gain of the proposed algorithm compared to baseline\nscheduling policies. More in details, we show the gain offered by our dynamic\nscheduling policy compared to static camera allocation strategies and to\nschemes with constant coding strategies. Finally, we show that the best\nscheduling policy consistently adapts to the most likely user navigation path\nand that it minimizes distortion variations that can be very disturbing for\nusers in traditional navigation systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 16:02:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Toni", "Laura", ""], ["Maugey", "Thomas", ""], ["Frossard", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.1780", "submitter": "Olivier Aubert", "authors": "Olivier Aubert, Joscha Jaeger", "title": "Annotating Video with Open Educational Resources in a Flipped Classroom\n  Scenario", "comments": "OCWC Global Conference, Apr 2014, Llubljana, Slovenia", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A wealth of Open Educational Resources is now available, and beyond the first\nand evident problem of finding them, the issue of articulating a set of\nresources is arising.

Since QoS requirements are not as stringent for\nnon-real-time traffic types, as opposed to real-time traffic, more calls can be\naccommodated by releasing some bandwidth from the already admitted\nnon-real-time traffic calls.
