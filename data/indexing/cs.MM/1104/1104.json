The current OpenGIS Web Map Service (WMS) specification\nsupports the ability for an information provider to specify very basic styling\noptions by advertising a preset collection of visual portrayals for each\navailable data set. However, while a WMS currently can provide the user with a\nchoice of style options, the WMS can only tell the user the name of each style.\nIt cannot tell the user what portrayal will look like on the map. More\nimportantly, the user has no way of defining their own styling rules. The\nability for a human or machine client to define these rules requires a styling\nlanguage that the client and server can both understand. Defining this\nlanguage, called the StyledLayerDescriptor (SLD), is the main focus of this\npaper, and it can be used to portray the output of Web Map Servers, Web Feature\nServers and Web Coverage Servers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2011 11:06:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kodge", "B.

We introduce a novel\napproach in order to achieve it, based on a dedicated high-level functional\nprogramming language, called Liquidsoap, for generating, manipulating and\nbroadcasting multimedia streams. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based\non configuration files or static graphical interfaces, it also allows the user\nto build complex and highly customized systems. This language is based on a\nmodel for streams and contains operators and constructions, which make it\nadapted to the generation of streams. The interpreter of the language also\nensures many properties concerning the good execution of the stream generation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Apr 2011 07:01:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Baelde", "David", "", "LIX"], ["Beauxis", "Romain", "", "LIX, INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France"], ["Mimram", "Samuel", "", "CEA LIST"]]}, {"id": "1104.4959", "submitter": "Evgeny Sagatov Mr.", "authors": "Evgeny S.

Content filtering\nfor social networks is an increasingly demanded task: due to their popularity,\nthe number of abuses also tends to increase, annoying the user base and\ndisrupting their services. We systematically evaluate several approaches for\nprocessing the visual information: using static and dynamic (motionaware)\nfeatures, with and without considering the context, and with or without latent\nsemantic analysis (LSA).
