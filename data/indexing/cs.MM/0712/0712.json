In this paper, the security of the scheme is studied and the\nfollowing problems are found: (1) a differential chosen-plaintext attack can\nbreak the scheme with only three chosen plain-images; (2) there is a number of\nweak keys and some equivalent keys for encryption; (3) the scheme is not\nsensitive to the changes of plain-images; and (4) the compound chaotic sequence\ndoes not work as a good random number resource.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Dec 2007 04:02:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2007 06:08:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chengqing", ""], ["Li", "Shujun", ""], ["Chen", "Guanrong", ""], ["Halang", "Wolfgang A.", ""]]}]
