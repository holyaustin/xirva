To find the intersection of the tubular components, CSD\ntranslationally sweeps the object in decomposition intervals to identify\ncritical points at which the shape of the object changes substantially. CSD\ncuts the object at critical points and assigns the same label to parts along\nthe same sub-skeleton, thereby constructing a semantic component. The proposed\nmethod further reconstructs the acquired semantic components at the\nintersection of object parts using generalized cylinders.

We propose to\novercome these by deforming a random point cloud to the object shape through\ntwo steps: feature blending and deformation. In the first step, the global and\npoint-specific shape features extracted from a 2D object image are blended with\nthe encoded feature of a randomly generated point cloud, and then this mixture\nis sent to the deformation step to produce the final representative point set\nof the object. In the deformation process, we introduce a new layer termed as\nGraphX that considers the inter-relationship between points like common graph\nconvolutions but operates on unordered sets. Moreover, with a simple trick, the\nproposed model can generate an arbitrary-sized point cloud, which is the first\ndeep method to do so.

The common approach of encoding\nshapes as points in a high-dimensional latent feature space suggests treating\nshape differences as vectors in that space. Instead, we treat shape differences\nas primary objects in their own right and propose to encode them in their own\nlatent space. In a setting where the shapes themselves are encoded in terms of\nfine-grained part hierarchies, we demonstrate that a separate encoding of shape\ndeltas or differences provides a principled way to deal with inhomogeneities in\nthe shape space due to different combinatorial part structures, while also\nallowing for compactness in the representation, as well as edit abstraction and\ntransfer. Our approach is based on a conditional variational autoencoder for\nencoding and decoding shape deltas, conditioned on a source shape. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in multiple shape\nmodification and generation tasks, and provide comparison and ablation studies\non the PartNet dataset, one of the largest publicly available 3D datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2019 18:08:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Mo", "Kaichun", ""], ["Guerrero", "Paul", ""], ["Yi", "Li", ""], ["Su", "Hao", ""], ["Wonka", "Peter", ""], ["Mitra", "Niloy", ""], ["Guibas", "Leonidas J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.11494", "submitter": "Christopher Thraves Caro", "authors": "Rosa Becerra and Christopher Thraves Caro", "title": "The Sitting Closer to Friends than Enemies Problem in Trees", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CG math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  A metric space $\\mathcal{T}$ is a \\emph{real tree} if for any pair of points\n$x, y \\in \\mathcal{T}$ all topological embeddings $\\sigma$ of the segment\n$[0,1]$ into $\\mathcal{T}$, such that $\\sigma (0)=x$ and $\\sigma (1)=y$, have\nthe same image (which is then a geodesic segment from $x$ to $y$).
