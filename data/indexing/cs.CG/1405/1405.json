This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond\nto $n/2$-separators.

In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating\nhyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is\ndesirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls\nonly.

Due to\nthe fact that the extreme points of a point set do not alter when all points\nare rotated in the same angle, four groups of extreme points with min or max x\nor y coordinates can be found in the original point set and three rotated point\nsets. These 16 extreme points are then used to form a convex polygon. We check\nall input points and discard the points that locate inside the convex polygon.\nWe use the remaining points to calculate the expected convex hull.

Indeed, estimating the\nshape dimension is often the first step in studying the processes or phenomena\nassociated to the data. Among the many dimension detection algorithms proposed\nin various fields, a few can provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness\nof the estimated dimension. However, the correctness usually requires certain\nregularity of the input: the input points are either uniformly randomly sampled\nin a statistical setting, or they form the so-called\n$(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-sample which can be neither too dense nor too sparse.\n  Here, we propose a purely topological technique to detect dimensions. Our\nalgorithm is provably correct and works under a more relaxed sampling\ncondition: we do not require uniformity, and we also allow Hausdorff noise. Our\napproach detects dimension by determining local homology. The computation of\nthis topological structure is much less sensitive to the local distribution of\npoints, which leads to the relaxation of the sampling conditions. Furthermore,\nby leveraging various developments in computational topology, we show that this\nlocal homology at a point $z$ can be computed \\emph{exactly} for manifolds\nusing Vietoris-Rips complexes whose vertices are confined within a local\nneighborhood of $z$.
