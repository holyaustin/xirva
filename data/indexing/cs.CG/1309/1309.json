We consider a triangulated terrain with $m>1$ viewpoints\n(or guards) located on the terrain surface. A point on the terrain is\nconsidered \\emph{visible} if it has an unobstructed line of sight to at least\none viewpoint. We study several natural and fundamental visibility structures:\n(1) the visibility map, which is a partition of the terrain into visible and\ninvisible regions; (2) the \\emph{colored} visibility map, which is a partition\nof the terrain into regions whose points have exactly the same visible\nviewpoints; and (3) the Voronoi visibility map, which is a partition of the\nterrain into regions whose points have the same closest visible viewpoint. We\nstudy the complexity of each structure for both 1.5D and 2.5D terrains, and\nprovide efficient algorithms to construct them. Our algorithm for the\nvisibility map in 2.5D terrains improves on the only existing algorithm in this\nsetting. To the best of our knowledge, the other structures have not been\nstudied before.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2013 14:26:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 21:29:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 09:49:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hurtado", "Ferran", ""], ["L\u00f6ffler", "Maarten", ""], ["Matos", "In\u00eas", ""], ["Sacrist\u00e1n", "Vera", ""], ["Saumell", "Maria", ""], ["Silveira", "Rodrigo I.", ""], ["Staals", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6131", "submitter": "Mahmuda Ahmed", "authors": "Mahmuda Ahmed, Brittany Terese Fasy, Kyle S.

Given street maps of the same city collected\nfrom different sources, researchers often need to know how and where they\ndiffer. However, the majority of current graph comparison algorithms are based\non structural properties of graphs, such as their degree distribution or their\nlocal connectivity properties, and do not consider their spatial embedding.\nThis ignores a key property of road networks since similarity of travel over\ntwo road networks is intimately tied to the specific spatial embedding.\nLikewise, many current street map comparison algorithms focus on the spatial\nembeddings only and do not take structural properties into account, which makes\nthese algorithms insensitive to local connectivity properties and shortest path\nsimilarities. We propose a new path-based distance measure to compare two\nplanar geometric graphs embedded in the plane. Our distance measure takes\nstructural as well as spatial properties into account by imposing a distance\nmeasure between two road networks based on the Hausdorff distance between the\ntwo sets of travel paths they represent. We show that this distance can be\napproximated in polynomial time and that it preserves structural and spatial\nproperties of the graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2013 12:42:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 05:08:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 08:41:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 14 Feb 2015 02:17:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "Mahmuda", ""], ["Fasy", "Brittany Terese", ""], ["Hickmann", "Kyle S.", ""], ["Wenk", "Carola", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6628", "submitter": "Michael A.

An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one\nsmallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an\n$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in\naddition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends\na classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm\nfor the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.\nFinally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is\nbetween 2 and 4. The upper bound, which implies an approximation algorithm of\nthe same factor, follows from a simple com- binatorial argument, while the\nlower bound represents the best known lower bound on the duality gap, even in\nthe general case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Sep 2013 20:39:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jan 2014 15:44:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Correa", "Jos\u00e9 R.", ""], ["Feuilloley", "Laurent", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Lantero", "Pablo", ""], ["Soto", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.7084", "submitter": "Ilias Diakonikolas", "authors": "Constantinos Daskalakis, Ilias Diakonikolas, Mihalis Yannakakis", "title": "How good is the Chord algorithm?", "comments": "47 pages, full version of SODA 2010 paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Chord algorithm is a popular, simple method for the succinct\napproximation of curves, which is widely used, under different names, in a\nvariety of areas, such as, multiobjective and parametric optimization,\ncomputational geometry, and graphics.
