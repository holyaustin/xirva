This\narticle presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the\navailable computational resources to process the parts of the input that are\nrelevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the\nhypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),\nrepresenting how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large\nbandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is\ncomputationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large\nnumber of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework\nwith two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute\nlower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds\nare much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by\nincreasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to\ndiscard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of\nshapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention\nMechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,\nwith the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of\ncomputation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses\nare discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed\nto find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the\nproblem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input.

The goal is to find a consistent labeling of P under\nrotation that maximizes the number of visible labels for all rotation angles\nsuch that the labels remain horizontal while the map is rotated. A labeling is\nconsistent if a single active interval of angles is selected for each label\nsuch that labels neither intersect each other nor occlude points in P at any\nrotation angle. We first introduce a general model for labeling rotating maps\nand derive basic geometric properties of consistent solutions. We show\nNP-completeness of the active interval maximization problem even for\nunit-square labels.
