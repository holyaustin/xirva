For this version of the algorithm we show that only two pairwise\ncomparisons are required in the combine step, for each point that lies in the 2\ndelta-wide vertical slab. The correctness of the algorithm is shown for all\nMinkowski distances with p>=1. We also show empirically that, although the time\ncomplexity of the algorithm is still O(n lg n), the reduction in the total\nnumber of comparisons leads to a significant reduction in the total execution\ntime, for inputs with size sufficiently large.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 09:52:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 00:05:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2013 18:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pereira", "Jos\u00e9 C.", ""], ["Lobo", "Fernando G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6200", "submitter": "Benjamin Burton", "authors": "Benjamin A.

Because this enumeration is\nsubject to extra combinatorial constraints, the only practical algorithms to\ndate have been variants of the classical double description method. In this\npaper we present the first practical normal surface enumeration algorithm that\nbreaks out of the double description paradigm. This new algorithm is based on a\ntree traversal with feasibility and domination tests, and it enjoys a number of\nadvantages over the double description method: incremental output,\nsignificantly lower time and space complexity, and a natural suitability for\nparallelisation. Experimental comparisons of running times are included.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 13:13:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 22:47:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Burton", "Benjamin A.", ""], ["Ozlen", "Melih", ""]]}]
