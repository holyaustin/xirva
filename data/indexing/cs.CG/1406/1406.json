As a consequence, they have been successfully employed\nin discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety\nof mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold\ntopology, geometry, and others). However, due to the large variety of\napplications, requirements vary from field to field and thus different types of\ntriangulations, different tools, and different frameworks are used in different\nareas of research. This is why today closely related research areas are\nsometimes largely disjoint leaving potential reciprocal benefits unused.\n  To address these potentials a workshop on Triangulations was held at\nOberwolfach Research Institute in 2012. Since then many new collaborations\nbetween researchers of different mathematical communities have been\nestablished. Regarding the computational geometry community, the theory of\nmanifolds continues to contribute to advances in more applied areas of the\nfield. Many researchers are interested in fundamental mathematical research\nabout triangulations and thus will benefit from a broad set of knowledge about\ndifferent research areas using different techniques.\n  We hope that this workshop brought together researchers from many different\nfields of computational geometry to have fruitful discussions which will lead\nto new interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 11:36:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Spreer", "Jonathan", "", "Organisers"], ["Wagner", "Uli", "", "Organisers"], ["Burton", "Benjamin A.", ""], ["Murai", "Satoshi", ""], ["Sedgwick", "Eric", ""], ["Segerman", "Henry", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1368", "submitter": "Jan Kyn\\v{c}l", "authors": "Sergio Cabello, Josef Cibulka, Jan Kyn\\v{c}l, Maria Saumell, Pavel\n  Valtr", "title": "Peeling potatoes near-optimally in near-linear time", "comments": "30 pages, 7 figures; minor revision.

Tree fractals and pinch-point fractals are special\ncases of pier fractals. In this paper, we study \\emph{scaled pier fractals},\nwhere a \\emph{scaled fractal} is the shape obtained by replacing each point in\nthe original fractal by a $c \\times c$ block of points, for some $c \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^+$. We prove that no scaled discrete self-similar pier fractal\nstrictly self-assembles, at any temperature, in Winfree's abstract Tile\nAssembly Model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 00:34:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Furcy", "David", ""], ["Summers", "Scott M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4822", "submitter": "Aruni Choudhary", "authors": "Aruni Choudhary, Michael Kerber", "title": "Local Doubling Dimension of Point Sets", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the notion of t-restricted doubling dimension of a point set in\nEuclidean space as the local intrinsic dimension up to scale t.
