For $k=2,3$ and $4$,\nupper bounds on the edge density have been developed for the case of simple\ngraphs by Pach and T\\'oth, Pach et al. and Ackerman, which have been used to\nimprove the well-known \"Crossing Lemma\". Recently, we proved that these bounds\nalso apply to non-simple $2$- and $3$-planar graphs without homotopic parallel\nedges and self-loops.\n  In this paper, we completely characterize optimal $2$- and $3$-planar graphs,\ni.e., those that achieve the aforementioned upper bounds. We prove that they\nhave a remarkably simple regular structure, although they might be non-simple.\nThe new characterization allows us to develop notable insights concerning new\ninclusion relationships with other graph classes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 22:13:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bekos", "Michael A.", ""], ["Kaufmann", "Michael", ""], ["Raftopoulou", "Chrysanthi N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06983", "submitter": "Giovanni Paolini", "authors": "Giovanni Paolini", "title": "Collapsibility to a subcomplex of a given dimension is NP-complete", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Discrete & Computational Geometry 59 (1), pp. 246-251 (2018)", "doi": "10.1007/s00454-017-9915-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.CC math.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we extend the works of Tancer and of Malgouyres and Franc\\'es,\nshowing that $(d,k)$-collapsibility is NP-complete for $d\\geq k+2$ except\n$(2,0)$.

In recent years, several related\nstructures have been used to study maps on data, including Reeb spaces, mappers\nand multiscale mappers. The construction of these structures also relies on the\nso-called \\emph{nerve} of a cover of the domain.\n  In this paper, we aim to analyze the topological information encoded in these\nstructures in order to provide better understanding of these structures and\nfacilitate their practical usage.\n  More specifically, we show that the one-dimensional homology of the nerve\ncomplex $N(\\mathcal{U})$ of a path-connected cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of a domain\n$X$ cannot be richer than that of the domain $X$ itself. Intuitively, this\nresult means that no new $H_1$-homology class can be \"created\" under a natural\nmap from $X$ to the nerve complex $N(\\mathcal{U})$. Equipping $X$ with a\npseudometric $d$, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of\n$H_1(X)$ that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of \\emph{size}\nof the covering elements in $\\mathcal{U}$. These fundamental results about\nnerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the $H_1$-homology of Reeb spaces,\nmappers and multiscale mappers.\n  The analysis of $H_1$-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher\ndimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a\nGromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and\ninterleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology\ngroups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Tamal K.", ""], ["Memoli", "Facundo", ""], ["Wang", "Yusu", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.08491", "submitter": "Adam Candy", "authors": "Adam S.

This is particularly acute for\nsimulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,\nfully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous\nparameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence,\nit can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data\nhandling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons\nrigorously. This paper takes a novel approach to spatial discretisation,\nconsidering it much like a numerical simulation model problem of its own. It\nintroduces a generalised, extensible, self-documenting approach to carefully\ndescribe, and necessarily fully, the constraints over the heterogeneous\nparameter space that determine how a domain is spatially discretised. This\nadditionally provides a method to accurately record these constraints, using\nhigh-level natural language based abstractions, that enables full accounts of\nprovenance, sharing and distribution. Together with this description, a\ngeneralised consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical\nmodels is developed, that is automated, robust and repeatable, quick-to-draft,\nrigorously verified and consistent to the source data throughout. This\ninterprets the description above to execute a self-consistent spatial\ndiscretisation process, which is automatically validated to expected discrete\ncharacteristics and metrics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 16:55:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Candy", "Adam S.", ""], ["Pietrzak", "Julie D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.09533", "submitter": "Wolfgang Mulzer", "authors": "Bahareh Banyassady, Man-Kwun Chiu, Matias Korman, Wolfgang Mulzer,\n  Andr\\'e van Renssen, Marcel Roeloffzen, Paul Seiferth, Yannik Stein, Birgit\n  Vogtenhuber, Max Willert", "title": "Routing in Polygonal Domains", "comments": "13 pages, 7 figures; a preliminary version appeared at ISAAC 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comgeo.2019.101593", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of routing a data packet through the visibility graph\nof a polygonal domain $P$ with $n$ vertices and $h$ holes.
