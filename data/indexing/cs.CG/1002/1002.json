However, the number of\nvertices for sums of more polytopes was unknown so far. In this paper, we study\nsums of polytopes in general orientations, and show a linear relation between\nthe number of faces of a sum of $r$ polytopes in dimension $d$, with $r\\geq d$,\nand the number of faces in the sums of less than $d$ of the summand polytopes.\nWe deduce from this exact formula a tight bound on the maximum possible number\nof vertices of the Minkowski sum of any number of polytopes in any dimension.\nIn particular, the linear relation implies that a sum of $r$ polytopes in\ndimension $d$ has a number of vertices in $O(n^{d-1})$ of the total number of\nvertices in the summands, even when $r\\geq d$. This bound is tight, in the\nsense that some sums do have that many vertices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2010 20:23:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Weibel", "Christophe", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.0963", "submitter": "Hoyoung Jeung", "authors": "Hoyoung Jeung, Man Lung Yiu, Xiaofang Zhou, Christian S.

This paper\nconsiders the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of\nobjects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this\npaper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in\norder to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is\nrelevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and\ncarpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on\ntrajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve\ncorrectly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three\nefficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known\nfilter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification\ntechniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the\nsimplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the\nsimplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement\nstep, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys.\nOur comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the\npaper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and\nefficient on real-world trajectory data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 11:34:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Jeung", "Hoyoung", ""], ["Yiu", "Man Lung", ""], ["Zhou", "Xiaofang", ""], ["Jensen", "Christian S.", ""], ["Shen", "Heng Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1092", "submitter": "Pat Morin", "authors": "Prosenjit Bose, Luc Devroye, Karim Douieb, Vida Dujmovic, James King,\n  and Pat Morin", "title": "Odds-On Trees", "comments": "19 pages, 0 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let R^d -> A be a query problem over R^d for which there exists a data\nstructure S that can compute P(q) in O(log n) time for any query point q in\nR^d.
