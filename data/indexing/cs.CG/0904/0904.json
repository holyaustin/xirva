Our main result is a {\\em weakly robust} polynomial time approximation\nscheme (PTAS) for UDGs expressed with edge-lengths, it either (i) computes a\nclique partition or (ii) gives a certificate that the graph is not a UDG; for\nthe case (i) that it computes a clique partition, we show that it is guaranteed\nto be within $(1+\\eps)$ ratio of the optimum if the input is UDG; however if\nthe input is not a UDG it either computes a clique partition as in case (i)\nwith no guarantee on the quality of the clique partition or detects that it is\nnot a UDG. Noting that recognition of UDG's is NP-hard even if we are given\nedge lengths, our PTAS is a weakly-robust algorithm.
