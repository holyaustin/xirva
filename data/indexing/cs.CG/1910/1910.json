Here, adjacency relations are taken in the form of a\ndimensionless rectangular arrangement (RA) ensuring the existence of a RFP,\nwhile dimensional constraints are given in terms of minimum width and aspect\nratio range for each room. A linear optimization model is then presented to\nobtain a feasible dimensioned RFP for user-defined constraints. A GUI is also\ndeveloped for the automated generation of RFPs. The proposed model is able to\ngenerate feasible solutions for every possible RA in a reasonable amount of\ntime.

We expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1)\nthe abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (IU) [FOCS\n2012], and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU [FOCS 2016]. IU for\na model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal\ntile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model\n(or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same\nresultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems\nbeing simulated modulo only a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed\nthe standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show this is also the\ncase for the 3D version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed the class of\naTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU,\nimplying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations.\nHere, however, we show that in 3D the class of directed aTAM systems is\nactually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. We then\nconsider the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we\nintroduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in\nthe plane, but also to traveling in the plane, and prove that the Planar aTAM\nis not IU, and that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also\nis not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial\naTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that it is IU.\n  To prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented\nwhat we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in\nany tile assembly model.
