Let shift$(G,\\delta)$ denote the minimum number of vertices that need\nto be moved to untangle $\\delta$. We show that shift$(G,\\delta)$ is NP-hard to\ncompute and to approximate. Our hardness results extend to a version of\n\\textsc{1BendPointSetEmbeddability}, a well-known graph-drawing problem.\n  Further we define fix$(G,\\delta)=n-shift(G,\\delta)$ to be the maximum number\nof vertices of a planar $n$-vertex graph $G$ that can be fixed when untangling\n$\\delta$. We give an algorithm that fixes at least $\\sqrt{((\\log n)-1)/\\log\n\\log n}$ vertices when untangling a drawing of an $n$-vertex graph $G$. If $G$\nis outerplanar, the same algorithm fixes at least $\\sqrt{n/2}$ vertices.
