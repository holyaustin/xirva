The topology of these\nintersections is codified within a set of (0-2)-dimensional chain complexes.\nThe target of this paper is to merge the local chains by using the equivalence\nrelations of {\\epsilon}-congruence between 0-, 1-, and 2-cells (elementary\nchains). In particular, we reduce the block-diagonal coboundary matrices\n[\\Delta_0] and [\\Delta_1], used as matrix accumulators of the local coboundary\nchains, to the global matrices [\\delta_0] and [\\delta_1], representative of\ncongruence topology, i.e., of congruence quotients between all 0-,1-,2-cells,\nvia elementary algebraic operations on their columns.

A\ntwo-dimensional packing problem is defined by the type of pieces, containers,\nand motions that are allowed. The aim is to decide if a given set of pieces can\nbe placed inside a given container. The pieces must be placed so that they are\npairwise interior-disjoint, and only motions of the allowed type can be used to\nmove them there. We establish a framework which enables us to show that for\nmany combinations of allowed pieces, containers, and motions, the resulting\nproblem is $\\exists\\mathbb R$-complete. This means that the problem is\nequivalent (under polynomial time reductions) to deciding whether a given\nsystem of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a\nreal solution. We consider packing problems where only translations are allowed\nas the motions, and problems where arbitrary rigid motions are allowed, i.e.,\nboth translations and rotations. When rotations are allowed, we show that the\nfollowing combinations of allowed pieces and containers are $\\exists\\mathbb\nR$-complete:\n  $\\bullet$ simple polygons, each of which has at most 8 corners, into a\nsquare,\n  $\\bullet$ convex objects bounded by line segments and hyperbolic curves into\na square,\n  $\\bullet$ convex polygons into a container bounded by line segments and\nhyperbolic curves.\n  Restricted to translations, we show that the following combinations are\n$\\exists\\mathbb R$-complete:\n  $\\bullet$ objects bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves into a square,\n  $\\bullet$ convex polygons into a container bounded by segments and hyperbolic\ncurves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:58:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Abrahamsen", "Mikkel", ""], ["Miltzow", "Tillmann", ""], ["Seiferth", "Nadja", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.07566", "submitter": "Esther Galby", "authors": "Esther Galby and Andrea Munaro", "title": "Approximating Independent Set and Dominating Set on VPG graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider Independent Set and Dominating Set restricted to VPG graphs (or,\nequivalently, string graphs).

Intuitively, adaptive sampling seems to be limited to trivial multi-pass\nalgorithms in the streaming model of computation due to its inherently\nsequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after\nthe previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case\nby giving the first one-pass algorithms for adaptive sampling on turnstile\nstreams and using space $\\text{poly}(d,k,\\log n)$, where $k$ is the number of\nadaptive sampling rounds to be performed.\n  Our adaptive sampling procedure has a number of applications to various data\nsummarization problems that either improve state-of-the-art or have only been\npreviously studied in the more relaxed row-arrival model. We give the first\nrelative-error algorithms for column subset selection, subspace approximation,\nprojective clustering, and volume maximization on turnstile streams that use\nspace sublinear in $n$. We complement our volume maximization algorithmic\nresults with lower bounds that are tight up to lower order terms, even for\nmulti-pass algorithms. By a similar construction, we also obtain lower bounds\nfor volume maximization in the row-arrival model, which we match with\ncompetitive upper bounds.\n  See paper for full abstract.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 05:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mahabadi", "Sepideh", ""], ["Razenshteyn", "Ilya", ""], ["Woodruff", "David P.", ""], ["Zhou", "Samson", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.11128", "submitter": "Tom Needham", "authors": "Qitong Jiang, Sebastian Kurtek, Tom Needham", "title": "The Weighted Euler Curve Transform for Shape and Image Analysis", "comments": "To appear in CVPR conference workshop proceedings for DIFF-CVML 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.AT stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Euler Curve Transform (ECT) of Turner et al.\\ is a complete invariant of\nan embedded simplicial complex, which is amenable to statistical analysis.

A realisation of a curve is a\npolyline connecting one point from each region.
