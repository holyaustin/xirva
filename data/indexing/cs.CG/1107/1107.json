Bukh et al. showed the existence of a (d-2)-flat\nat depth (d-1) n / (2d-1) - O(1) (the case k = d-2).\n  In this paper we concentrate on the case k=1 (the case of \"centerlines\"), in\nwhich the conjectured value for the leading constant is 2/(d+2). We prove that\n2/(d+2) is an *upper bound* for the leading constant. Specifically, we show\nthat for every fixed d and every n there exists an n-point set in R^d for which\nno line in R^d lies at depth larger than 2n/(d+2) + o(n).

Our primary aim is to minimize\nthe algebraic degree, while, at the same time, taking into account the amount\nof operations needed to compute our predicate of interest.\n  In our predicate analysis we show that the Incircle predicate can be answered\nby evaluating the signs of algebraic expressions of degree at most 6; this is\nhalf the algebraic degree we get when we evaluate the Incircle predicate using\nthe current state-of-the-art approach. In the most demanding cases of our\npredicate evaluation, we reduce the problem of answering the Incircle predicate\nto the problem of computing the sign of the value of a linear polynomial (in\none variable), when evaluated at a known specific root of a quadratic\npolynomial (again in one variable). Another important aspect of our approach is\nthat, from a geometric point of view, we answer the most difficult case of the\npredicate via implicitly performing point locations on an appropriately defined\nsubdivision of the place induced by the Voronoi circle implicated in the\nIncircle predicate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 13:04:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kamarianakis", "Manos N.", ""], ["Karavelas", "Menelaos I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5665", "submitter": "Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson", "authors": "Vin de Silva, Dmitriy Morozov, Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson", "title": "Dualities in persistent (co)homology", "comments": "16 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the Inverse Problems special issue\n  on Topological Data Analysis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/0266-5611/27/12/124003", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AT cs.CG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  We consider sequences of absolute and relative homology and cohomology groups\nthat arise naturally for a filtered cell complex.
