Many algorithms, for example grid-based numerical PDE\nsolvers, have to access all neighbor cells of each grid cell during a grid\ntraversal. While the array indices of neighbors can be stored in a cell, they\nstill have to be computed for initialization or when the grid is adaptively\nrefined. A fast neighbor-finding algorithm can thus significantly improve the\nruntime of computations on multidimensional grids.\n  In this thesis, we show how neighbors on many regular grids ordered by\nspace-filling curves can be found in an average-case time complexity of $O(1)$.\nIn general, this assumes that the local orientation (i.e. a variable of a\ndescribing grammar) of the SFC inside the grid cell is known in advance, which\ncan be efficiently realized during traversals. Supported SFCs include Hilbert,\nPeano and Sierpinski curves in arbitrary dimensions. We assume that integer\narithmetic operations can be performed in $O(1)$, i.e. independent of the size\nof the integer. We do not deal with the case of adaptively refined grids here.\nHowever, it appears that a generalization of the algorithm to suitable adaptive\ngrids is possible. To formulate the neighbor-finding algorithm and prove its\ncorrectness and runtime properties, a modeling framework is introduced. This\nframework extends the idea of vertex-labeling to a description using grammars\nand matrices. With the sfcpp library, we provide a C++ implementation to render\nSFCs generated by such models and automatically compute all lookup tables\nneeded for the neighbor-finding algorithm. Furthermore, optimized\nneighbor-finding implementations for various SFCs are included for which we\nprovide runtime measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:54:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:02:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2019 11:20:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Holzm\u00fcller", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.06991", "submitter": "Nhan Tran", "authors": "Nhan Tran", "title": "Applications of potential theoretic mother bodies in Electrostatics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Any polyhedron accommodates a type of potential theoretic skeleton called a\nmother body.

RTP asks for a transformation by a rectangle partition between two\nrectangles of the same area. We are interested in the minimum RTP which\nrequires to minimize the partition size. We mainly focus on the strict\nrectangle transformation problem (SRTP) in which rotation is not allowed in\ntransforming. We show that SRTP has no finite solution if the ratio of the two\nparallel side lengths of input rectangles is irrational. So we turn to its\ncomplement denoted by SIRTP, in which case all side lengths can be assumed\nintegral. We give a polynomial time algorithm ALGSIRTP which gives a solution\nat most $q/p+O(\\sqrt{p})$ to SIRTP$(p,q)$ ($q\\geq p$), where $p$ and $q$ are\ntwo integer side lengths of input rectangles $p\\times q$ and $q\\times p$, and\nso ALGSIRTP is a $O(\\sqrt{p})$-approximation algorithm for minimum\nSIRTP$(p,q)$. On the other hand, we show that there is not constant solution to\nSIRTP$(p,q)$ for all integers $p$ and $q$ ($q>p$) even though the ratio $q/p$\nis within any constant range.
