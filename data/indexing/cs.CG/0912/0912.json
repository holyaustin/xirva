Recall that here H\nis said to be an (r, cr, p, q)-sensitive hash family if all pairs x, y in\n{0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at most r have probability at least p of collision under\na randomly chosen h in H, whereas all pairs x, y in {0,1}^d with dist(x,y) at\nleast cr have probability at most q of collision. Typically, one considers d\ntending to infinity, with c fixed and q bounded away from 0.\n  For its applications to approximate nearest neighbor search in high\ndimensions, the quality of an LSH family H is governed by how small its \"rho\nparameter\" rho = ln(1/p)/ln(1/q) is as a function of the parameter c. The\nseminal paper of Indyk and Motwani showed that for each c, the extremely simple\nfamily H = {x -> x_i : i in d} achieves rho at most 1/c. The only known lower\nbound, due to Motwani, Naor, and Panigrahy, is that rho must be at least .46/c\n(minus o_d(1)).\n  In this paper we show an optimal lower bound: rho must be at least 1/c (minus\no_d(1)). This lower bound for Hamming space yields a lower bound of 1/c^2 for\nEuclidean space (or the unit sphere) and 1/c for the Jaccard distance on sets;\nboth of these match known upper bounds. Our proof is simple; the essence is\nthat the noise stability of a boolean function at e^{-t} is a log-convex\nfunction of t.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 20:34:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["O'Donnell", "Ryan", ""], ["Wu", "Yi", ""], ["Zhou", "Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0284", "submitter": "Thomas Schick", "authors": "Laurent Bartholdi (1), Thomas Schick (1), Nat Smale (2), Steve Smale\n  (3), Anthony W.

The goal of this work was centered in a new algorithm for the\nimplementation of the Spherical layout; we called it the Weighted Spherical\nCentroidal Voronoi Tessellations (WSCVT). In this paper we present a detailed\ndescription of this new implementation and a comparison with the TriSphere\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2009 03:53:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Larrea", "Martin", ""], ["Urribarri", "Dana", ""], ["Martig", "Sergio", ""], ["Castro", "Silvia", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4164", "submitter": "Akitoshi Kawamura", "authors": "Keiko Imai, Akitoshi Kawamura, Ji\\v{r}\\'i Matou\\v{s}ek, Daniel Reem,\n  Takeshi Tokuyama", "title": "Distance k-Sectors Exist", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Computational Geometry 43(9):713-720, November 2010", "doi": "10.1016/j.comgeo.2010.05.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.MG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The bisector of two nonempty sets P and Q in a metric space is the set of all\npoints with equal distance to P and to Q. A distance k-sector of P and Q, where\nk is an integer, is a (k-1)-tuple (C_1, C_2, ..., C_{k-1}) such that C_i is the\nbisector of C_{i-1} and C_{i+1} for every i = 1, 2, ..., k-1, where C_0 = P and\nC_k = Q. This notion, for the case where P and Q are points in Euclidean plane,\nwas introduced by Asano, Matousek, and Tokuyama, motivated by a question of\nMurata in VLSI design. They established the existence and uniqueness of the\ndistance trisector in this special case. We prove the existence of a distance\nk-sector for all k and for every two disjoint, nonempty, closed sets P and Q in\nEuclidean spaces of any (finite) dimension, or more generally, in proper\ngeodesic spaces (uniqueness remains open). The core of the proof is a new\nnotion of k-gradation for P and Q, whose existence (even in an arbitrary metric\nspace) is proved using the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem, by a method\nintroduced by Reem and Reich for a slightly different purpose.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2009 16:29:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Imai", "Keiko", ""], ["Kawamura", "Akitoshi", ""], ["Matou\u0161ek", "Ji\u0159\u00ed", ""], ["Reem", "Daniel", ""], ["Tokuyama", "Takeshi", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4884", "submitter": "Raghu Meka", "authors": "Prahladh Harsha, Adam Klivans and Raghu Meka", "title": "An Invariance Principle for Polytopes", "comments": "Added a lowerbound and minor corrections", "journal-ref": "JACM, 59(6):29, 2012", "doi": "10.1145/2395116.2395118", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.CG cs.DM cs.LG math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let X be randomly chosen from {-1,1}^n, and let Y be randomly chosen from the\nstandard spherical Gaussian on R^n.

The novelty of our\ninvariance principle is the polylogarithmic dependence on k. Previously, only\nbounds that were at least linear in k were known. We give two important\napplications of our main result: (1) A polylogarithmic in k bound on the\nBoolean noise sensitivity of intersections of k \"regular\" halfspaces (previous\nwork gave bounds linear in k). (2) A pseudorandom generator (PRG) with seed\nlength O((log n)*poly(log k,1/delta)) that delta-fools all polytopes with k\nfaces with respect to the Gaussian distribution. We also obtain PRGs with\nsimilar parameters that fool polytopes formed by intersection of regular\nhalfspaces over the hypercube. Using our PRG constructions, we obtain the first\ndeterministic quasi-polynomial time algorithms for approximately counting the\nnumber of solutions to a broad class of integer programs, including dense\ncovering problems and contingency tables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2009 15:35:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2012 23:33:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Harsha", "Prahladh", ""], ["Klivans", "Adam", ""], ["Meka", "Raghu", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4936", "submitter": "Li Chen", "authors": "Li Chen", "title": "Genus Computing for 3D digital objects: algorithm and implementation", "comments": "12 pages 7 figures.
