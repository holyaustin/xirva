We answer this question in the negative, thereby showing\nthat low Cayley complexity is a property of the graph G (independent of the\nnon-edge f).\n  Then, we give a simple characterization of graphs with low Cayley complexity,\nleading to an efficient algorithmic characterization, i.e. an efficient\nalgorithm for recognizing such graphs.\n  Next, we show a surprising result that (graph) planarity is equivalent to low\nCayley complexity for a natural subclass of 1-dof triangle-decomposable graphs.\nWhile this is a finite forbidden minor graph characterization of low Cayley\ncomplexity, we provide counterexamples showing impossibility of such finite\nforbidden minor characterizations when the above subclass is enlarged.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2011 19:38:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 03:58:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2012 15:31:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2012 04:05:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sitharam", "Meera", ""], ["Wang", "Menghan", ""], ["Gao", "Heping", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.6160", "submitter": "Katharine Turner", "authors": "Katharine Turner", "title": "Cone fields and topological sampling in manifolds with bounded curvature", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.AT math.DG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Often noisy point clouds are given as an approximation of a particular\ncompact set of interest.
