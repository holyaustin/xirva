We apply this approach\nto percolation in continuum models, finding overlaps between objects with\nreal-valued positions and orientations. In particular, we find precise values\nof the percolation transition for disks, squares, rotated squares, and rotated\nsticks in two dimensions, and confirm that these transitions behave as\nconformal field theory predicts. The running time and memory use of our\nalgorithm are essentially linear as a function of the number of objects at\ncriticality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2012 23:45:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Dec 2012 12:37:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Mertens", "Stephan", ""], ["Moore", "Cristopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5091", "submitter": "John Steenbergen", "authors": "John Steenbergen and Caroline Klivans and Sayan Mukherjee", "title": "A Cheeger-Type Inequality on Simplicial Complexes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a variation on Cheeger numbers related to the\ncoboundary expanders recently defined by Dotterer and Kahle.
