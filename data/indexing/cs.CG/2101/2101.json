These problems allow range updates (such as filling all cells in a\nrange with a constant) and queries (such as finding the sum or maximum of\nvalues in a range). In this work, we consider these operations along with\nupdates that replace each cell in a range with the minimum, maximum, or sum of\nits existing value, and a constant.

Depending on this property, we can analyse whether an\nexisting moment-based feature is invariant to motion blur. Surprisingly, we\nfind some geometric moment invariants are invariants to not only spatial\ntransform but also motion blur.
