For example the contour tree and contour statistics can be used\nas a means for interaction and filtering or as signatures. In the context of\ntensor field analysis, such methods are also interesting for the analysis of\nderived scalar invariants. While there are standard algorithms to compute and\nanalyze contours, they are not directly applicable to tensor invariants when\nusing component-wise tensor interpolation. In this chapter we present an\naccurate derivation of the contour spectrum for invariants with quadratic\nbehavior computed from two-dimensional piece-wise linear tensor fields. For\nthis work, we are mostly motivated by a consistent treatment of the anisotropy\nfield, which plays an important role as stability measure for tensor field\ntopology. We show that it is possible to derive an analytical expression for\nthe distribution of the invariant values in this setting, which is exemplary\ngiven for the anisotropy in all details. Our derivation is based on a\ntopological sub-division of the mesh in triangles that exhibit a monotonic\nbehavior. This triangulation can also directly be used to compute the accurate\ncontour tree with standard algorithms. We compare the results to a na\\\"ive\napproach based on linear interpolation on the original mesh or the subdivision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 21:57:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Masood", "Talha Bin", ""], ["Hotz", "Ingrid", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.01227", "submitter": "Tomohiro Tachi", "authors": "Seri Nishimoto, Takashi Horiyama and Tomohiro Tachi", "title": "Geodesic Folding of Tetrahedron", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary\n  Study of Symmetry, Symmetry: Art and Science, 2019, Special Issue: 11th\n  Congress and Exhibition of SIS, Kanazawa, Japan, November 25-30, 2019", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we show the geometric properties of a family of polyhedra\nobtained by folding a regular tetrahedron along regular triangular grids.

A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where T\npoints are sampled uniformly in [0,1], and the goal is to immediately color\nthem $\\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As random\ncoloring incurs $\\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds are\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n \\log (T/n)})$ for vector balancing and $1$ for interval\nbalancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline\nbounds in the online setting for these problems.
