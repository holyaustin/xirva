In particular, this\nallows us to reduce problems of computing the kernel distance between various\ntypes of objects such as curves, surfaces, and distributions to computing the\nkernel distance between point sets.

This problem is of great practical\nsignificance in various mechanical engineering domains, such as the design of\ncommunication satellites. Two constructive heuristics are proposed, one for\npacking circular items and the other for packing rectangular items. These work\nby first optimizing object placement order, and then optimizing object\npositioning. Based on these heuristics, an ant colony optimization (ACO)\nalgorithm is described to search first for optimal positioning order, and then\nfor the optimal layout. We describe the results of numerical experiments, in\nwhich we test two versions of our ACO algorithm alongside local search methods\npreviously described in the literature. Our results show that the constructive\nheuristic-based ACO performs better than existing methods on larger problem\ninstances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jan 2010 18:07:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Yi-Chun", ""], ["Dong", "Fang-Min", ""], ["Liu", "Yong", ""], ["Xiao", "Ren-Bin", ""], ["Amos", "Martyn", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.4119", "submitter": "Stephane Gaubert", "authors": "Xavier Allamigeon, Stephane Gaubert, Eric Goubault", "title": "The tropical double description method", "comments": "12 pages, prepared for the Proceedings of the Symposium on\n  Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science, 2010, Nancy, France", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2010.2443", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a tropical analogue of the classical double description method\nallowing one to compute an internal representation (in terms of vertices) of a\npolyhedron defined externally (by inequalities).

Two fast search algorithms with the complexity are realized. The\nestablishing of the hierarchy-tree and the fast searching of spatial bodies are\ngeneral, which are independent of spatial dimensions. Therefore, it is easy to\nextend the skill to other fields.
