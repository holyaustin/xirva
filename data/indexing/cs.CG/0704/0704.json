The best\nknown algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a\nrun time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a\nrecursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator\nof a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out\nmultiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting\nreference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen\nto minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity\nanalysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time\nand $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2007 07:21:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Qing", ""], ["Ding", "Shengchao", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3197", "submitter": "Reinhard Klette", "authors": "Fajie Li and Reinhard Klette", "title": "Euclidean Shortest Paths in Simple Cube Curves at a Glance", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "CITR-TR-198", "categories": "cs.CG cs.DM", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper reports about the development of two provably correct approximate\nalgorithms which calculate the Euclidean shortest path (ESP) within a given\ncube-curve with arbitrary accuracy, defined by $\\epsilon >0$, and in time\ncomplexity $\\kappa(\\epsilon) \\cdot {\\cal O}(n)$, where $\\kappa(\\epsilon)$ is\nthe length difference between the path used for initialization and the\nminimum-length path, divided by $\\epsilon$.
