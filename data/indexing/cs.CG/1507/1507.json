Given an initial guess, these are optimized such that the\nmechanical boundary forces that are responsible for the deformation are of a\nsimple nature. We show a heuristic way to approximate the nonlinear\noptimization problem by a sequence of convex problems using finite elements.\nThe deformation cost, i.e, the forces, is measured on a coarse scale while\nICP-like matching is done on the fine scale. We demonstrate the plausibility of\nour algorithm on examples taken from different datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 13:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Simon", "Konrad", ""], ["Sheorey", "Sameer", ""], ["Jacobs", "David", ""], ["Basri", "Ronen", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08080", "submitter": "Wolfgang Mulzer", "authors": "Oswin Aichholzer, Vincent Kusters, Wolfgang Mulzer, Alexander Pilz,\n  Manuel Wettstein", "title": "An Optimal Algorithm for Reconstructing Point Set Order Types from\n  Radial Orderings", "comments": "23 pages, 11 figures; a preliminary version appeared at ISAAC 2015", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications\n  (IJCGA), 27(1n2), 2017, pp. 57-83", "doi": "10.1142/S0218195917600044", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $P$ be a set of $n$ labeled points in the plane. The radial system of $P$\ndescribes, for each $p\\in P$, the order in which a ray that rotates around $p$\nencounters the points in $P \\setminus \\{p\\}$. This notion is related to the\norder type of $P$, which describes the orientation (clockwise or\ncounterclockwise) of every ordered triple in $P$. Given only the order type,\nthe radial system is uniquely determined and can easily be obtained. The\nconverse, however, is not true. Indeed, let $R$ be the radial system of $P$,\nand let $T(R)$ be the set of all order types with radial system $R$ (we define\n$T(R) = \\emptyset$ for the case that $R$ is not a valid radial system).\nAichholzer et al. (Reconstructing Point Set Order Types from Radial Orderings,\nin ISAAC 2014) show that $T(R)$ may contain up to $n-1$ order types. They also\nprovide polynomial-time algorithms to compute $T(R)$ when only $R$ is given.\n  We describe a new algorithm for finding $T(R)$. The algorithm constructs the\nconvex hulls of all possible point sets with the radial system $R$. After that,\norientation queries on point triples can be answered in constant time. A\nrepresentation of this set of convex hulls can be found in $O(n)$ queries to\nthe radial system, using $O(n)$ additional processing time. This is optimal.\nOur results also generalize to abstract order types.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 09:50:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2016 18:20:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Aichholzer", "Oswin", ""], ["Kusters", "Vincent", ""], ["Mulzer", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Pilz", "Alexander", ""], ["Wettstein", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08374", "submitter": "Chandrajit Bajaj", "authors": "Muhibur Rasheed and Chandrajit Bajaj", "title": "Characterization and Construction of a Family of Highly Symmetric\n  Spherical Polyhedra with Application in Modeling Self-Assembling Structures", "comments": "25 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UT-TR-2014", "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The regular polyhedra have the highest order of 3D symmetries and are\nexceptionally at- tractive templates for (self)-assembly using minimal types of\nbuilding blocks, from nano-cages and virus capsids to large scale constructions\nlike glass domes.
