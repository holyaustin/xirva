Given a set of points in the plane, a\n$\\theta$-graph partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones,\neach having aperture $\\theta=2\\pi/m$, and adds an edge to the `closest' vertex\nin each cone. We show that for any integer $k \\geq 1$, $\\theta$-graphs with\n$4k+2$ cones have a spanning ratio of $1+2\\sin(\\theta/2)$ and we provide a\nmatching lower bound, showing that this spanning ratio tight.\n  Next, we show that for any integer $k \\geq 1$, $\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$\ncones have spanning ratio at most\n$1+2\\sin(\\theta/2)/(\\cos(\\theta/2)-\\sin(\\theta/2))$. We also show that\n$\\theta$-graphs with $4k+3$ and $4k+5$ cones have spanning ratio at most\n$\\cos(\\theta/4)/(\\cos(\\theta/2)-\\sin(3\\theta/4))$. This is a significant\nimprovement on all families of $\\theta$-graphs for which exact bounds are not\nknown. For example, the spanning ratio of the $\\theta$-graph with 7 cones is\ndecreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 3.5132. These spanning proofs also\nimply improved upper bounds on the competitiveness of the $\\theta$-routing\nalgorithm. In particular, we show that the $\\theta$-routing algorithm is\n$(1+2\\sin(\\theta/2)/(\\cos(\\theta/2)-\\sin(\\theta/2)))$-competitive on\n$\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones and that this ratio is tight.\n  Finally, we present improved lower bounds on the spanning ratio of these\ngraphs. Using these bounds, we provide a partial order on these families of\n$\\theta$-graphs. In particular, we show that $\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones\nhave spanning ratio at least $1+2\\tan(\\theta/2)+2\\tan^2(\\theta/2)$. This is\nsomewhat surprising since, for equal values of $k$, the spanning ratio of\n$\\theta$-graphs with $4k+4$ cones is greater than that of $\\theta$-graphs with\n$4k+2$ cones, showing that increasing the number of cones can make the spanning\nratio worse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Apr 2014 19:24:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bose", "Prosenjit", ""], ["De Carufel", "Jean-Lou", ""], ["Morin", "Pat", ""], ["van Renssen", "Andr\u00e9", ""], ["Verdonschot", "Sander", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.6583", "submitter": "Andreas Beyer", "authors": "Andreas Beyer, Hubert Mara, Susanne Kr\\\"omker", "title": "ILATO Project: Fusion of Optical Surface Models and Volumetric CT Data", "comments": "Part of the OAGM 2014 proceedings (arXiv:1404.3538)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "OAGM/2014/17", "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Project ILATO focuses on Improving Limited Angle computed Tomography by\nOptical data integration in order to enhance image quality and shorten\nacquisition times in X-ray based industrial quality inspection.
