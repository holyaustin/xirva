The definitions of\n$\\epsilon$-interleavings and $d_I$ generalize readily to multidimensional\npersistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional\ninterleavings, with a view towards applications to topological data analysis.\nWe present four main results. First, we show that on 1-D persistence modules,\n$d_I$ is equal to the bottleneck distance $d_B$. This result, which first\nappeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several\nother places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a\ncharacterization of the $\\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional\npersistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two\n$\\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this\ncharacterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a\nprime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result\nis the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability\nproperty generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in\naddition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence\nmodules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\\leq d_I$. We also show\nthat a variant of this universality result holds for $d_B$, over arbitrary\nfields. Finally, we show that $d_I$ restricts to a metric on isomorphism\nclasses of finitely presented multidimensional persistence modules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 06:05:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 06:11:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 16:10:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 21:08:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Lesnick", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5593", "submitter": "Markus Perling", "authors": "Markus Perling", "title": "Resolutions and Cohomologies of Toric Sheaves.

First, over the polynomial ring, we determine in\nexplicit combinatorial terms the Z^n-graded Betti numbers and local cohomology\nof reflexive modules whose associated filtrations form a hyperplane\narrangement. Second, for the non-smooth, simplicial case in dimension d >= 3,\nwe construct new examples of indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules of\nrank d - 1.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jun 2011 08:44:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Perling", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5723", "submitter": "Dmitrii V.

In\nthis paper, we show that the Rubik's Cube also has a rich underlying\nalgorithmic structure.

The upper bound comes from\neffectively parallelizing standard Theta(n^2) solution algorithms, while the\nlower bound follows from a counting argument. The upper bound gives an\nasymptotically optimal algorithm for solving a general Rubik's Cube in the\nworst case. Given a specific starting state, we show how to find the shortest\nsolution in an n x O(1) x O(1) Rubik's Cube. Finally, we show that finding this\noptimal solution becomes NP-hard in an n x n x 1 Rubik's Cube when the\npositions and colors of some of the cubies are ignored (not used in determining\nwhether the cube is solved).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jun 2011 17:35:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Demaine", "Erik D.", ""], ["Demaine", "Martin L.", ""], ["Eisenstat", "Sarah", ""], ["Lubiw", "Anna", ""], ["Winslow", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6148", "submitter": "Vincent Delos", "authors": "Denis Teissandier (LMP), Vincent Delos (LMP), Yves Cou\\'etard (LMP)", "title": "Operations on polytopes: application to tolerance analysis", "comments": "6th CIRP Seminar on CAT, Enschede : Netherlands (1999)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG physics.class-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article presents numerical methods in order to solve problems of\ntolerance analysis.
