Capable of Turing universal computation, the\naTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed\nso that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute\nprescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was\nshown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a\nsingle tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set\ncan be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly\nusing that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics\nmodulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given\nmakes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key\nlocations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating\na directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.\nThe question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally\nrequired. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed\nsystems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no\nuniversal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This\nprovides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is\nitself a fundamentally nondeterministic process.

If\nno solution exists, the solver is expected to announce that no solution has\nbeen found. Owing to the complexity, type or difficulty of a constraint\nproblem, it is possible that the solver does not find a solution even though\none may exist. Thus, there may be false negatives, but there should never be\nfalse positives. Intuitively, the ability to find solutions can be considered a\nmeasure of solver's competence. We consider static constraint problems and\ntheir solvers. We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as\ndynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,\ninteractively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining\nall stipulated constraints. However, if we have a solver for static constraint\nproblems that is sufficiently fast and competent, we can build a dynamic\ngeometry program from it by solving the static problem for a sufficiently dense\nsampling of the trajectory of the moving element(s). The work we survey has its\nroots in applications, especially in mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD).\nThe constraint solvers used in MCAD took a quantum leap in the 1990s. These\napproaches solve a geometric constraint problem by an initial, graph-based\nstructural analysis that extracts generic subproblems and determines how they\nwould combine to form a complete solution.
