Given a set of\ndata points, the goal of SNN is to design a data structure that, given a\ncollection of queries, finds a collection of close points that are compatible\nwith each other. Formally, we are given $k$ query points $Q=q_1,\\cdots,q_k$,\nand a compatibility graph $G$ with vertices in $Q$, and the goal is to return\ndata points $p_1,\\cdots,p_k$ that minimize (i) the weighted sum of the\ndistances from $q_i$ to $p_i$ and (ii) the weighted sum, over all edges $(i,j)$\nin the compatibility graph $G$, of the distances between $p_i$ and $p_j$. The\nproblem has several applications, where one wants to return a set of consistent\nanswers to multiple related queries. This generalizes well-studied\ncomputational problems, including NN, Aggregate NN and the 0-extension problem.\n  In this paper we propose and analyze the following general two-step method\nfor designing efficient data structures for SNN. In the first step, for each\nquery point $q_i$ we find its (approximate) nearest neighbor point $\\hat{p}_i$;\nthis can be done efficiently using existing approximate nearest neighbor\nstructures. In the second step, we solve an off-line optimization problem over\nsets $q_1,\\cdots,q_k$ and $\\hat{p}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{p}_k$; this can be done\nefficiently given that $k$ is much smaller than $n$. Even though\n$\\hat{p}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{p}_k$ might not constitute the optimal answers to\nqueries $q_1,\\cdots,q_k$, we show that, for the unweighted case, the resulting\nalgorithm is $O(\\log k/\\log \\log k)$-approximation. Also, we show that the\napproximation factor can be in fact reduced to a constant for compatibility\ngraphs frequently occurring in practice.\n  Finally, we show that the \"empirical approximation factor\" provided by the\nabove approach is very close to 1.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 22:31:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Indyk", "Piotr", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Robert", ""], ["Mahabadi", "Sepideh", ""], ["Yuan", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.02870", "submitter": "Andrei Asinowski", "authors": "Andrei Asinowski, Christian Krattenthaler, Toufik Mansour", "title": "Counting triangulations of some classes of subdivided convex polygons", "comments": "26 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": "Europ.

Up to now such a fixed ultimate optimal escape path for a known\nshape for any starting position is only known for some special convex shapes\n(i.e., circles, strips of a given width, fat convex bodies, some isosceles\ntriangles).

General image curves provide a complementary feature\nwhen keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges\nnot addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves.\nWe address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a\nframework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including\nstationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo\ncorrespondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview\nepipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves.

Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from\nthat of two corresponding image curves.
