Halfspace depth is a measure of data depth. Given a set S of points and a\npoint p, the halfspace depth (or rank) k of p is defined as the minimum number\nof points of S contained in any closed halfspace with p on its boundary.\nComputing halfspace depth is NP-hard, and it is equivalent to the Maximum\nFeasible Subsystem problem. In this thesis a mixed integer program is\nformulated with the big-M method for the halfspace depth problem. We suggest a\nbranch and cut algorithm. In this algorithm, Chinneck's heuristic algorithm is\nused to find an upper bound and a related technique based on sensitivity\nanalysis is used for branching.

Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this\nnotion of \\emph{evenness}.

Finally,\nwe characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of\ngenerated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling.
