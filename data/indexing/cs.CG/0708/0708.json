We consider ensemble\nsimulations of tessellations generated by points whose regular positions are\nperturbed through a Gaussian noise controlled by the parameter alpha. We study\nthe number of sides, the area, and the perimeter of the Voronoi cells. For\nalpha>0, hexagons are the most common class of cells, and 2-parameter gamma\ndistributions describe well the statistics of the geometrical characteristics.\nThe symmetry break due to noise destroys the square tessellation, whereas the\nhoneycomb hexagonal tessellation is very stable and all Voronoi cells are\nhexagon for small but finite noise with alpha<0.1. For a moderate amount of\nGaussian noise, memory of the specific unperturbed tessellation is lost,\nbecause the statistics of the two perturbed tessellations is indistinguishable.\nWhen alpha>2, results converge to those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The\nproperties of n-sided cells change with alpha until the Poisson-Voronoi limit\nis reached for alpha>2. The Desch law for perimeters is confirmed to be not\nvalid and a square root dependence on n is established. The ensemble mean of\nthe cells area and perimeter restricted to the hexagonal cells coincides with\nthe full ensemble mean; this might imply that the number of sides acts as a\nthermodynamic state variable fluctuating about n=6; this reinforces the idea\nthat hexagons, beyond their ubiquitous numerical prominence, can be taken as\ngeneric polygons in 2D Voronoi tessellations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2007 15:23:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lucarini", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1909", "submitter": "Maike Buchin", "authors": "Kevin Buchin and Maike Buchin", "title": "Lower Bounds for the Complexity of the Voronoi Diagram of Polygonal\n  Curves under the Discrete Frechet Distance", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.CC", "license": null, "abstract": "  We give lower bounds for the combinatorial complexity of the Voronoi diagram\nof polygonal curves under the discrete Frechet distance.

We consider general\nsites in m-spaces (a simple generalization of metric spaces) and prove several\nexistence and (non)uniqueness results in this setting. In contrast to previous\nworks, our (rather simple) proofs are based on purely order theoretic\narguments. Many explicit examples are given, and some of them illustrate new\nphenomena which occur in the general case.
