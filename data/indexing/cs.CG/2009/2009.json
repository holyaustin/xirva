With very few exceptions, projection techniques\nare designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as\nto preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean\ndistance for example.

The lazy witness\ncomplex economically defines such a representation using only a few selected\npoints, called landmarks.\n  Topological data analysis traditionally considers a point cloud in a\nEuclidean space. In many situations, however, data is available in the form of\na weighted graph. A graph along with the geodesic distance defines a metric\nspace. This metric space of a graph is amenable to topological data analysis.\n  We discuss the computation of persistent homologies on a weighted graph. We\npresent a lazy witness complex approach leveraging the notion of $\\epsilon$-net\nthat we adapt to weighted graphs and their geodesic distance to select\nlandmarks. We show that the value of the $\\epsilon$ parameter of the\n$\\epsilon$-net provides control on the trade-off between choice and number of\nlandmarks and the quality of the approximate simplicial representation.\n  We present three algorithms for constructing an $\\epsilon$-net of a graph. We\ncomparatively and empirically evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the\nchoice of landmarks that they induce for the topological data analysis of\ndifferent real-world graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:11:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Arafat", "Naheed Anjum", ""], ["Basu", "Debabrota", ""], ["Bressan", "St\u00e9phane", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14004", "submitter": "Piyush Srivastava", "authors": "Hariharan Narayanan and Piyush Srivastava", "title": "On the mixing time of coordinate Hit-and-Run", "comments": "14 pages, fixed minor typos and added reference to independent work", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CG math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We obtain a polynomial upper bound on the mixing time $T_{CHR}(\\epsilon)$ of\nthe coordinate Hit-and-Run random walk on an $n-$dimensional convex body, where\n$T_{CHR}(\\epsilon)$ is the number of steps needed in order to reach within\n$\\epsilon$ of the uniform distribution with respect to the total variation\ndistance, starting from a warm start (i.e., a distribution which has a density\nwith respect to the uniform distribution on the convex body that is bounded\nabove by a constant).

Recent\nadvancements in deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have\nboosted significantly the performance of face recognition based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) facial texture images and outperformed the previous state\nof the art using conventional methods. However, the accuracy of 2D face\nrecognition is still challenged by the change of pose, illumination, make-up,\nand expression. On the other hand, the geometric information contained in\nthree-dimensional (3D) face data has the potential to overcome the fundamental\nlimitations of 2D face data.\n  We propose a multi-Channel deep 3D face network for face recognition based on\n3D face data. We compute the geometric information of a 3D face based on its\npiecewise-linear triangular mesh structure and then conformally flatten\ngeometric information along with the color from 3D to 2D plane to leverage the\nstate-of-the-art deep CNN architectures. We modify the input layer of the\nnetwork to take images with nine channels instead of three only such that more\ngeometric information can be explicitly fed to it. We pre-train the network\nusing images from the VGG-Face \\cite{Parkhi2015} and then fine-tune it with the\ngenerated multi-channel face images. The face recognition accuracy of the\nmulti-Channel deep 3D face network has achieved 98.6.
