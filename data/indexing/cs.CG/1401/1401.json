These spanners ahve arbitrary low\nstretch, and weight only a constant factor greater than that of the minimum\nspanning tree of the points (with dependence on the stretch and Euclidean\ndimention). A central open problem in this field asks whether other spaces\nadmit low weight spanners as well - for example metric space with low intrinsic\ndimension - yet only a handful of results of this type are known.\n  In this paper, we consider snowflake metric spaces of low intrinsic\ndimension. The {\\alpha}-snowflake of a metric (X,{\\delta}) is the metric\n(X,${\\delta}^{\\alpha}$) for 0<{\\alpha}<1. By utilizing an approach completely\ndifferent than those used for Euclidean spaces, we demonstrate that snowflake\nmetrics admit light spanners. Further, we show that the spanner is of diameter\nO($\\log$n), a result not possible for Euclidean spaces. As an immediate\ncorollary to our spanner, we obtain dramatic improvments in algorithms for the\ntraveling salesman problem in this setting, achieving a polynomial-time\napproximation scheme with near-linear runtime. Along the way, we show that all\n${\\ell}_p$ spaces admit light spanners, a result of interest in its own right.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 18:57:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Gottlieb", "Lee-Ad", ""], ["Solomon", "Shay", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.5330", "submitter": "Mohamed A.

The most important\nobjective in graph drawing is minimization of the number of crossings in the\ndrawing, as the aesthetics and readability of graph drawings depend on the\nnumber of edge crossings. VLSI layouts with fewer crossings are more easily\nrealizable and consequently cheaper. A straight-line drawing of a planar graph\nG of n vertices is a drawing of G such that each edge is drawn as a\nstraight-line segment without edge crossings. However, a problem with current\ngraph layout methods which are capable of producing satisfactory results for a\nwide range of graphs is that they often put an extremely high demand on\ncomputational resources. This paper introduces a new layout method, which\nnicely draws internally convex of planar graph that consumes only little\ncomputational resources and does not need any heavy duty preprocessing. Here,\nwe use two methods: The first is self organizing map known from unsupervised\nneural networks which is known as (SOM) and the second method is Inverse Self\nOrganized Map (ISOM).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 14:45:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["El-Sayed", "Mohamed A.", ""], ["Abdel-Khalek", "S.", ""], ["Amin", "Hanan H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.5583", "submitter": "Brian Brubach", "authors": "Brian Brubach", "title": "Improved Online Square-into-Square Packing", "comments": "15 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show an improved bound and new algorithm for the online\nsquare-into-square packing problem.
