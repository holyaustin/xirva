The persistent homology is a key tool in topological data\nanalysis and studies topological features of data that persist over many\nscales. The fastest algorithm for computing persistent homology of a filtration\nhas time $O(M(u)+u^2\\log^2 u)$, where $u$ is the number of updates (additions\nor deletions of simplices), $M(u)=O(u^{2.376})$ is the time for multiplication\nof $u\\times u$ matrices. For a space of $n$ points given by their pairwise\ndistances, we approximate the Vietoris-Rips filtration by a zigzag filtration\nconsisting of $u=o(n)$ updates, which is sublinear in $n$. The constant depends\non a given error of approximation and on the doubling dimension of the metric\nspace. Then the persistent homology of this sublinear-size filtration can be\ncomputed in time $o(n^2)$, which is subquadratic in $n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 10:39:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Sep 2017 10:03:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kurlin", "Vitaliy", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.1559", "submitter": "Bartosz Walczak", "authors": "Alexandre Rok and Bartosz Walczak", "title": "Outerstring graphs are $\\chi$-bounded", "comments": "Introduction extended by a survey of results on (outer)string graphs,\n  some minor corrections", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An outerstring graph is an intersection graph of curves that lie in a common\nhalf-plane and have one endpoint on the boundary of that half-plane.

A crossing-free structure on $P$\nis a plane graph with vertex set $P$. Examples of crossing-free structures\ninclude triangulations of $P$, spanning cycles of $P$, also known as\npolygonalizations of $P$, among others. In this paper we develop a general\ntechnique for computing the number of crossing-free structures of an input set\n$P$. We apply the technique to obtain algorithms for computing the number of\ntriangulations, matchings, and spanning cycles of $P$. The running time of our\nalgorithms is upper bounded by $n^{O(k)}$, where $k$ is the number of onion\nlayers of $P$. In particular, for $k = O(1)$ our algorithms run in polynomial\ntime. In addition, we show that our algorithm for counting triangulations is\nnever slower than $O^{*}(3.1414^{n})$, even when $k = \\Theta(n)$. Given that\nthere are several well-studied configurations of points with at least\n$\\Omega(3.464^{n})$ triangulations, and some even with $\\Omega(8^{n})$\ntriangulations, our algorithm asymptotically outperforms any enumeration\nalgorithm for such instances. In fact, it is widely believed that any set of\n$n$ points must have at least $\\Omega(3.464^{n})$ triangulations. If this is\ntrue, then our algorithm is strictly sub-linear in the number of triangulations\ncounted. We also show that our techniques are general enough to solve the\n\"Restricted-Triangulation-Counting-Problem\", which we prove to be $W[2]$-hard\nin the parameter $k$.
