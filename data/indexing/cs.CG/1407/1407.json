We further assemble the Sierpinski\ntriangle within the $3$-HAM at scale factor 3 and 990 tile types. For the\nSierpinski carpet, we present a $2$-HAM result that works at scale factor 3 and\nuses 1,216 tile types. We further include analysis showing that the aTAM is\nincapable of strictly assembling the non-tree Sierpinski triangle considered in\nthis paper, and that multiple hands are needed for the near-perfect assembly of\nthe Sierpinski triangle and the Sierpinski carpet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2014 22:47:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 May 2015 22:46:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chalk", "Cameron T.", ""], ["Fernandez", "Dominic A.", ""], ["Huerta", "Alejandro", ""], ["Maldonado", "Mario A.", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert T.", ""], ["Sweet", "Leslie", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8194", "submitter": "Akitoshi Kawamura", "authors": "Akitoshi Kawamura, Yusuke Kobayashi", "title": "Fence patrolling by mobile agents with distinct speeds", "comments": "12 pages, 8 figures; preliminary version presented at ISAAC 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00446-014-0226-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.MA cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Suppose we want to patrol a fence (line segment) using k mobile agents with\ngiven speeds v_1, ..., v_k so that every point on the fence is visited by an\nagent at least once in every unit time period. Czyzowicz et al. conjectured\nthat the maximum length of the fence that can be patrolled is (v_1 + ... +\nv_k)/2, which is achieved by the simple strategy where each agent i moves back\nand forth in a segment of length v_i/2. We disprove this conjecture by a\ncounterexample involving k = 6 agents. We also show that the conjecture is true\nfor k = 2, 3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 20:00:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kawamura", "Akitoshi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Yusuke", ""]]}]
