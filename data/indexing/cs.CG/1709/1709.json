Moreover, robots are non-rigid, in that they may be stopped by the\nscheduler at each move before reaching their destination (but are guaranteed to\ntravel at least a fixed unknown distance before being stopped).\n  We show that despite these strong limitations, it is possible to arrange\n$3m+3k$ of these weak entities in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ to simulate the behavior of a\nstronger robot that is rigid (i.e., it always reaches its destination) and is\nendowed with $k$ registers of persistent memory, each of which can store a real\nnumber.
