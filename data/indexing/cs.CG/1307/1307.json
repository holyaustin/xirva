A set $S$ is $\\epsilon$-far\n$(0<\\epsilon\\leq1)$ from being $(k,G)$-clusterable if at least $\\epsilon n$\npoints need to be removed from $S$ to make it $(k,G)$-clusterable. We solve\nthis problem for $k=1$ and when $G$ is a symmetric convex object. For $k>1$, we\nsolve a weaker version of this problem. Finally, as an application of our\ntesting result, in clustering with outliers, we show that one can find the\napproximate clusters by querying a constant size sample, with high probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 10:19:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Dec 2013 12:57:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Sourav", ""], ["Pratap", "Rameshwar", ""], ["Roy", "Sasanka", ""], ["Saraf", "Shubhangi", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.8300", "submitter": "Katharine Turner", "authors": "Katharine Turner", "title": "Medians of populations of persistence diagrams", "comments": "22 pages, 13 figures.

They are topological summaries that capture both topological and\ngeometric structure within data. Recently there has been a surge of interest in\ndeveloping tools to statistically analyse populations of persistence diagrams,\na process hampered by the complicated geometry of the space of persistence\ndiagrams. In this paper we study the median of a set of diagrams, defined as\nthe minimizer of an appropriate cost function analogous to the sum of distances\nused for samples of real numbers. We then characterize the local minima of this\ncost function and in doing so characterize the median. We also do some\ncomparative analysis of the properties of the median and the mean.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 12:26:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Feb 2019 00:33:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Turner", "Katharine", ""]]}]
