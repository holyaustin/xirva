In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors\nsuch as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to\ncharacterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One\nof the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based\nvisualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such\ntopological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In\nthis paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and\nuse it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree\nthat minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a\nwell-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic\nstrategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not\nfully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that\nresembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and\noutputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural\nsimilarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty\ninformation for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty,\nreferred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees.\nFinally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees\nthat arise from ensembles of scalar fields.

Our main\nconcern is to make origami extrusions of polyhedrons using 3D gadgets with\nsimple outgoing pleats, where a simple pleat is a pair of a mountain fold and a\nvalley fold which are parallel to each other. In this paper we present a new\ntype of 3D gadgets with simple outgoing pleats in origami extrusions and their\nconstruction. Our 3D gadgets are downward compatible with the conventional\npyramid-supported gadgets developed by Calros Natan as a generalization of the\ncube gadget, in the sense that in many cases we can replace the conventional\ngadgets with the new ones with the same outgoing pleats while the converse is\nnot always possible. We can also change angles of the outgoing pleats under\ncertain conditions. Unlike the conventional pyramid-supported 3D gadgets, the\nnew ones have flat back sides above the ambient paper, and thus we can make\nflat-foldable origami extrusions. Furthermore, since our new 3D gadgets are\nless interfering with adjacent gadgets than the conventional ones, we can use\nwider pleats at one time to make the extrusion higher. For example, we prove\nthat the maximal height of the prism of any convex polygon (resp. any triangle)\nthat can be extruded with our new gadgets is more than 4/3 times (resp.\n$\\sqrt{2}$ times) of that with the conventional ones.

We guarantee the\nexistence of a single, continuous tool path covering each connected piece of\nthe domain in every layer. We present a tool path algorithm that traverses each\nsuch continuous tool path with no crossovers. The key construction at the heart\nof our framework is an Euler transformation which converts a 2-dimensional cell\ncomplex K into a new 2-complex K^ such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton G^\nof K^ has even degree. Hence G^ is Eulerian, and a Eulerian tour can be\nfollowed to print all edges in a continuous fashion. We start with a mesh K of\nthe union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. We\ncompute its Euler transformation K^. In the slicing step, we clip K^ at each\nlayer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler.\nWe then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes\ncreated by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra\nsupport edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges\nwithout support in the next layer. These support edges maintain the Euler\nnature of the complex. Finally we describe a tree-based search algorithm that\nbuilds the continuous tool path by traversing \"concentric\" cycles in the Euler\ncomplex. Our algorithm produces a tool path that avoids material collisions and\ncrossovers, and can be printed in a continuous fashion irrespective of complex\ngeometry or topology of the domain (e.g., holes).
