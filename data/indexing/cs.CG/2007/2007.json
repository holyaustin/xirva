One of the most widely used algorithms for\napproximately optimizing the SVM objective is Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD), which requires only $O(\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\epsilon})$ random samples, and\nwhich immediately yields a streaming algorithm that uses\n$O(\\frac{d}{\\lambda\\epsilon})$ space. For related problems, better streaming\nalgorithms are only known for smooth functions, unlike the SVM objective that\nwe focus on in this work. We initiate an investigation of the space complexity\nfor both finding an approximate optimum of this objective, and for the related\n``point estimation'' problem of sketching the data set to evaluate the function\nvalue $F_\\lambda$ on any query $(\\theta, b)$. We show that, for both problems,\nfor dimensions $d=1,2$, one can obtain streaming algorithms with space\npolynomially smaller than $\\frac{1}{\\lambda\\epsilon}$, which is the complexity\nof SGD for strongly convex functions like the bias-regularized SVM, and which\nis known to be tight in general, even for $d=1$. We also prove polynomial lower\nbounds for both point estimation and optimization. In particular, for point\nestimation we obtain a tight bound of $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ for $d=1$ and\na nearly tight lower bound of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d/{\\epsilon}^2)$ for $d =\n\\Omega( \\log(1/\\epsilon))$. Finally, for optimization, we prove a\n$\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ lower bound for $d = \\Omega( \\log(1/\\epsilon))$,\nand show similar bounds when $d$ is constant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 17:10:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Andoni", "Alexandr", ""], ["Burns", "Collin", ""], ["Li", "Yi", ""], ["Mahabadi", "Sepideh", ""], ["Woodruff", "David P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.04081", "submitter": "Micha Sharir", "authors": "Micha Sharir and Noam Solomon", "title": "Incidences with curves in three dimensions", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1610.01560", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study incidence problems involving points and curves in $R^3$.

This paper provides a fundamental\nalgebraic formulation for 3DGS by developing equilibrium equations around the\nedges of the primal diagram and satisfying the equations by the closeness of\nthe polygons constructed by the edges of the corresponding faces in the\ndual/reciprocal diagram. The research provides multiple numerical methods for\nsolving the equilibrium equations and explains the advantage of using each\ntechnique. The approach of this paper can be used for compression-and-tension\ncombined form-finding and analysis as it allows constructing both the form and\nforce diagram based on the interpretation of the input diagram. Besides, the\npaper expands on the geometric/static degrees of (in)determinacies of the\ndiagrams using the algebraic formulation and shows how these properties can be\nused for the constrained manipulation of the polyhedrons in an interactive\nenvironment without breaking the reciprocity between the two.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 20:07:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hablicsek", "M\u00e1rton", ""], ["Akbarzadeh", "Masoud", ""], ["Guo", "Yi", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15784", "submitter": "David Eppstein", "authors": "Man-Kwun Chiu, Erik D.

It is based on the \\emph{signed}\ndistance function to the curves or other objects from a fixed set of landmark\npoints.

Slfs explains the\ncomplexity of shapes such as non-closed curves where the notion of local\norientation is in dispute -- but is more general than the well-known concept of\n(unsigned) local feature size, and is for instance infinite for closed simple\ncurves.
