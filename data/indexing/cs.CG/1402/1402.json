The objective is to produce a\ncovering of an unknown workspace by a fixed number of robots such that the\ncovered region is maximized, solving the Maximum Area Triangulation Problem\n(MATP). The resulting triangulation is a physical data structure that is a\ncompact representation of the workspace; it contains distributed knowledge of\neach triangle, adjacent triangles, and the dual graph of the workspace.\nAlgorithms can store information in this physical data structure, such as a\nrouting table for robot navigation Our algorithm builds a triangulation in a\nclosed environment, starting from a single location. It provides coverage with\na breadth-first search pattern and completeness guarantees. We show the\ncomputational and communication requirements to build and maintain the\ntriangulation and its dual graph are small. Finally, we present a physical\nnavigation algorithm that uses the dual graph, and show that the resulting path\nlengths are within a constant factor of the shortest-path Euclidean distance.\nWe validate our theoretical results with experiments on triangulating a region\nwith a system of low-cost robots. Analysis of the resulting quality of the\ntriangulation shows that most of the triangles are of high quality, and cover a\nlarge area.

To avoid such problems, we introduce a\ngraph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the generation of iso-surfaces employs\nlabeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$ is the set of vertices\nof a cuboid $C\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and\n$\\mathcal{F}\\,:\\,V\\rightarrow [0,1]$.

We name this\nstructure $\\alpha$-MST. Let $P$ be a set of points in the plane and let $0 <\n\\alpha \\le 2\\pi$ be an angle. An $\\alpha$-ST of $P$ is a spanning tree of the\ncomplete Euclidean graph induced by $P$, with the additional property that for\neach point $p \\in P$, the smallest angle around $p$ containing all the edges\nadjacent to $p$ is at most $\\alpha$.

In this paper,\nwe study the problem of computing an $\\alpha$-MST for several common values of\n$\\alpha$.\n  Motivated by wireless networks, we formulate the problem in terms of\ndirectional antennas. With each point $p \\in P$, we associate a wedge $W_p$ of\nangle $\\alpha$ and apex $p$. The goal is to assign an orientation and a radius\n$r_p$ to each wedge $W_p$, such that the resulting graph is connected and its\nMST is an $\\alpha$-MST.

Given a set of feature\ncorrespondences, our algorithm searches for an optimal folding-free mapping\nthat satisfies the prescribed landmark constraints. The standard conformality\ndistortion defined for mappings between 2-dimensional spaces is first\ngeneralized to the $n$-dimensional conformality distortion $K(f)$ for a mapping\n$f$ between $n$-dimensional Euclidean spaces $(n \\geq 3)$. We then propose a\nvariational model involving $K(f)$ to tackle the landmark-matching problem in\nhigher dimensional spaces. The generalized conformality term $K(f)$ enforces\nthe bijectivity of the optimized mapping and minimizes its local geometric\ndistortions even with large deformations. Another challenge is the high\ncomputational cost of the proposed model. To tackle this, we have also proposed\na numerical method to solve the optimization problem more efficiently.\nAlternating direction method with multiplier (ADMM) is applied to split the\noptimization problem into two subproblems. Preconditioned conjugate gradient\nmethod with multi-grid preconditioner is applied to solve one of the\nsub-problems, while a fixed-point iteration is proposed to solve another\nsubproblem.
