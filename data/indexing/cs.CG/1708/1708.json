The lesson drawn\nby the theorems proved in the thesis is that surprisingly small compromise is\nnecessary on the efficacy of the solutions to make the approach work. The\nproblems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical\napplications.\n  The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A\nsharp extremal bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most\n8-vertex polygons using established techniques in the field of art gallery\nproblems. This fills in the gap between already known results for partitioning\ninto at most 6- and 10-vertex orthogonal polygons.\n  Next, these techniques are further developed to prove a new type of extremal\nart gallery result. The novelty provided by this approach is that it\nestablishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem has\nstrong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an\n$\\frac83$-approximation algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with\nrectangular vision.\n  In the second part, the graph theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is\nstudied in complete and complete grid graphs. Once again, the extremal approach\nis conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem.\n  In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the\nmaximum degree of realizable demand graphs is 4 times higher than previous best\nresults. The techniques developed are then used to solve the classical extremal\nedge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete base\ngraphs.\n  The complete grid base graph lies on the other end of the spectrum in terms\ndensity amongst path-pairable graphs. It is shown that complete grid graphs are\nrelatively efficient in routing edge-disjoint paths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:50:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Nov 2017 21:19:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mezei", "Tam\u00e1s R\u00f3bert", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08778", "submitter": "Marcel Radermacher", "authors": "Tamara Mchedlidze, Marcel Radermacher, Ignaz Rutter", "title": "Aligned Drawings of Planar Graphs", "comments": "Preliminary work appeared in the Proceedings of the 25th\n  International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2017)", "journal-ref": "J.
