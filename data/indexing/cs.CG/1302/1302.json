A k-track layout of a graph\nconsists of a vertex k-colouring, and a total order of each vertex colour\nclass, such that between each pair of colour classes no two edges cross. The\nqueue-number (track-number) of a graph G, is the minimum k such that G has a\nk-queue (k-track) layout.\n  This paper proves that every n-vertex planar graph has track number and queue\nnumber at most O(log n).

In this\npaper, we show that the problem is NP-hard when the collection only contains\nfat regions with bounded ply $\\Delta$ (even when they are axis-aligned\nrectangles of aspect ratio $1 : (1 + \\varepsilon)$). We also show that the\nproblem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) for unit disks and for\nsimilarly-sized $\\beta$-fat regions with bounded ply $\\Delta$ and $O(1)$\npairwise boundary intersections. Furthermore, we can use our FPT algorithm to\nconstruct an $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm that runs in\n$O(2^{f(\\Delta, \\varepsilon,\\beta)}n^5)$ time, where $f\\in\nO(\\frac{\\Delta^4\\beta^8}{\\varepsilon^4}\\log(\\beta\\Delta/\\varepsilon))$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 18:54:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 16:02:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Mar 2014 10:46:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 01:59:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 10:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Korman", "Matias", ""], ["L\u00f6ffler", "Maarten", ""], ["Silveira", "Rodrigo I.", ""], ["Strash", "Darren", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.5328", "submitter": "Wolfgang Mulzer", "authors": "Maarten L\\\"offler and Wolfgang Mulzer", "title": "Unions of Onions: Preprocessing Imprecise Points for Fast Onion\n  Decomposition", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures; a preliminary version appeared at WADS 2013", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computational Geometry, 5(1), 2014, 1-13", "doi": "10.20382/jocg.v5i1a1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be a set of $n$ pairwise disjoint unit disks in the plane.\nWe describe how to build a data structure for $\\mathcal{D}$ so that for any\npoint set $P$ containing exactly one point from each disk, we can quickly find\nthe onion decomposition (convex layers) of $P$.\n  Our data structure can be built in $O(n \\log n)$ time and has linear size.\nGiven $P$, we can find its onion decomposition in $O(n \\log k)$ time, where $k$\nis the number of layers.
