This paper surveys\ngeneralisations of this result for graphs on surfaces, minor-closed classes,\nvarious non-minor-closed classes, and graph classes with polynomial growth. We\nthen explore how graph product structure might be applicable to more broadly\ndefined graph classes. In particular, we characterise when a graph class\ndefined by a cartesian or strong product has bounded or polynomial expansion.\nWe then explore graph product structure theorems for various geometrically\ndefined graph classes, and present several open problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 01:45:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2020 21:40:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Dvo\u0159\u00e1k", "Zden\u011bk", ""], ["Huynh", "Tony", ""], ["Joret", "Gwena\u00ebl", ""], ["Liu", "Chun-Hung", ""], ["Wood", "David R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.08899", "submitter": "Yu Nakahata", "authors": "Yu Nakahata, Takashi Horiyama, Shin-ichi Minato, Katsuhisa Yamanaka", "title": "Compiling Crossing-free Geometric Graphs with Connectivity Constraint\n  for Fast Enumeration, Random Sampling, and Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given $n$ points in the plane, we propose algorithms to compile connected\ncrossing-free geometric graphs into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The DAGs\nallow efficient counting, enumeration, random sampling, and optimization. Our\nalgorithms rely on Wettstein's framework to compile several crossing-free\ngeometric graphs. One of the remarkable contributions of Wettstein is to allow\ndealing with geometric graphs with connectivity, since it is known to be\ndifficult to efficiently represent geometric graphs with such global property.\nTo achieve this, Wettstein proposed specialized techniques for crossing-free\nspanning trees and crossing-free spanning cycles and invented compiling\nalgorithms running in $\\mathrm{O}(7.044^n)$ time and $\\mathrm{O}(5.619^n)$\ntime, respectively.\n  Our first contribution is to propose a technique to deal with the\nconnectivity constraint more simply and efficiently. It makes the design and\nanalysis of algorithms easier, and yields improved time complexity. Our\nalgorithms achieve $\\mathrm{O}(6^n)$ time and $\\mathrm{O}(4^n)$ time for\ncompiling crossing-free spanning trees and crossing-free spanning cycles,\nrespectively. As the second contribution, we propose an algorithm to optimize\nthe area surrounded by crossing-free spanning cycles. To achieve this, we\nmodify the DAG so that it has additional information. Our algorithm runs in\n$\\mathrm{O}(4.829^n)$ time to find an area-minimized (or maximized)\ncrossing-free spanning cycle of a given point set.

Relaxing these\nconstraints permits constructing better FV codes. More specifically, recent\nwork has shown that AIFV-$m$ codes can beat Huffman coding. AIFV-$m$ codes\nconstruct am $m$-tuple of different coding trees between which the code\nalternates and are only almost instantaneous (AI). This means that decoding a\nword might require a delay of a finite number of bits.\n  Current algorithms for constructing optimal AIFV-$m$ codes are iterative\nprocesses that construct progressively \"better sets\" of code trees.
