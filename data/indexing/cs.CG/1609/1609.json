In this\npaper, we extend two leading non-rigid structure from motion (SfM) algorithms\nto exploit symmetry constraints. We model the both methods as energy\nminimization, in which we also recover the missing observations caused by\nocclusions. In particularly, we show that by rotating the coordinate system,\nthe energy can be decoupled into two independent terms, which still exploit\nsymmetry, to apply matrix factorization separately on each of them for\ninitialization. The results on the Pascal3D+ dataset show that our methods\nsignificantly improve performance over baseline methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 13:57:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Yuan", ""], ["Yuille", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.07082", "submitter": "Frank Nielsen", "authors": "Frank Nielsen and Boris Muzellec and Richard Nock", "title": "Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification using Curved Mahalanobis\n  Distances", "comments": "21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016 paper entitled\n  \"classification With Mixtures of Curved Mahalanobis Metrics\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CG cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the supervised classification problem of machine learning in\nCayley-Klein projective geometries: We show how to learn a curved Mahalanobis\nmetric distance corresponding to either the hyperbolic geometry or the elliptic\ngeometry using the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) framework.
