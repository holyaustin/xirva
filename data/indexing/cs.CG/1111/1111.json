In this setting,\nexperimentation is essential for understanding the limits of practicality, as\nwell as for gauging the relative merits of competing algorithms.\n  In this paper we focus on normal surface theory, a key tool that appears\nthroughout low-dimensional topology. Stepping beyond the well-studied problem\nof computing vertex normal surfaces (essentially extreme rays of a polyhedral\ncone), we turn our attention to the more complex task of computing fundamental\nnormal surfaces (essentially an integral basis for such a cone). We develop,\nimplement and experimentally compare a primal and a dual algorithm, both of\nwhich combine domain-specific techniques with classical Hilbert basis\nalgorithms. Our experiments indicate that we can solve extremely large problems\nthat were once though intractable. As a practical application of our\ntechniques, we fill gaps from the KnotInfo database by computing 398\npreviously-unknown crosscap numbers of knots.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 06:01:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2013 16:09:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Burton", "Benjamin A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7100", "submitter": "Thorsten Theobald", "authors": "Richard J.
