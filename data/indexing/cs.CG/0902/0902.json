This problem is a constraint version\nof the well-known k-center problem in which the centers are constrained to lie\nin a particular region such as a segment, a line, and a polygon. We first\nconsider the simplest version of the problem where the line l is given in\nadvance; we can solve this problem in O(n log^2 n) time. We then investigate\nthe cases where only the orientation of the line l is fixed and where the line\nl can be arbitrary. We can solve these problems in O(n^2 log^2 n) time and in\nO(n^4 log^2 n) expected time, respectively. For the last two problems, we\npresent (1 + e)-approximation algorithms, which run in O((1/e) n log^2 n) time\nand O((1/e^2) n log^2 n) time, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Feb 2009 02:00:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Brass", "Peter", ""], ["Knauer", "Christian", ""], ["Na", "Hyeon-Suk", ""], ["Shin", "Chan-Su", ""], ["Vigneron", "Antoine", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4337", "submitter": "Ludmila Scharf", "authors": "Helmut Alt, Ludmila Scharf, Daria Schymura", "title": "Probabilistic Matching of Planar Regions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze a probabilistic algorithm for matching shapes modeled by planar\nregions under translations and rigid motions (rotation and translation).
