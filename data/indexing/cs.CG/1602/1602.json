This problem occurs both as\na natural question in low-dimensional topology, and as a first non-trivial\ninstance of embeddability of complexes into $3$-manifolds.\n  We prove that the problem is NP-hard, thus adding to the relatively few\nhardness results that are currently known in 3-manifold topology. In addition,\nwe show that the problem lies in NP when the Euler genus g is odd, and we give\nan explicit algorithm in this case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 12:45:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 12:33:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Burton", "Benjamin A.", ""], ["de Mesmay", "Arnaud", ""], ["Wagner", "Uli", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08156", "submitter": "Chien-Chun Ni", "authors": "Chien-Chun Ni, Zhengyu Su, Jie Gao and Xianfeng David Gu", "title": "Capacitated Kinetic Clustering in Mobile Networks by Optimal\n  Transportation Theory", "comments": "9 pages, 10 figures.

This paper focuses on the\ndevelopment of \\emph{distributed} and computationally efficient algorithms that\nadapt to the motion of both terminals and base stations. Suggested by the\noptimal transportation theory, we exploit the structural property of the\noptimal solution, which can be represented by a power diagram on the base\nstations such that the total usage of nodes within each power cell equals the\ncapacity of the corresponding base station. We show by using the kinetic data\nstructure framework the first analytical upper bound on the number of changes\nin the optimal solution, i.e., its stability. On the algorithm side, using the\npower diagram formulation we show that the solution can be represented in size\nproportional to the number of base stations and can be solved by an iterative,\nlocal algorithm. In particular, this algorithm can naturally exploit the\ncontinuity of motion and has orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions\nusing min-cost matching and linear programming, and thus is able to handle\nlarge scale data under mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 00:11:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ni", "Chien-Chun", ""], ["Su", "Zhengyu", ""], ["Gao", "Jie", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng David", ""]]}]
