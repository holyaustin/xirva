We\nfirst address voxel-based polyhedra (polycubes), formed as the union of a\ncollection of cubical (axis-aligned) voxels. We analyze the ways in which the\nskeleton may intersect each voxel of the polyhedron, and show that the skeleton\nmay be constructed by a simple voxel-sweeping algorithm taking constant time\nper voxel. In addition, we describe a more complex algorithm for straight\nskeletons of voxel-based polyhedra, which takes time proportional to the area\nof the surfaces of the straight skeleton rather than the volume of the\npolyhedron. We also consider more general polyhedra with axis-parallel edges\nand faces, and show that any n-vertex polyhedron of this type has a straight\nskeleton with O(n^2) features. We provide algorithms for constructing the\nstraight skeleton, with running time O(min(n^2 log n, k log^{O(1)} n)) where k\nis the output complexity. Next, we discuss the straight skeleton of a general\nnonconvex polyhedron. We show that it has an ambiguity issue, and suggest a\nconsistent method to resolve it. We prove that the straight skeleton of a\ngeneral polyhedron has a superquadratic complexity in the worst case. Finally,\nwe report on an implementation of a simple algorithm for the general case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 22:52:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Barequet", "Gill", ""], ["Eppstein", "David", ""], ["Goodrich", "Michael T.", ""], ["Vaxman", "Amir", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0162", "submitter": "Stefanie Wuhrer", "authors": "Stefanie Wuhrer, Prosenjit Bose, Chang Shu, Joseph O'Rourke, Alan\n  Brunton", "title": "Morphing of Triangular Meshes in Shape Space", "comments": "Improved experimental results", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Shape Modeling, 16(1-2):195-212, 2010", "doi": "10.1142/S0218654310001341", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel approach to morph between two isometric poses of the same\nnon-rigid object given as triangular meshes.

The topological properties of the VT of the SC and FCC crystals are\nunstable with respect to the introduction of noise, because the corresponding\npolyhedra are geometrically degenerate, whereas the tessellation of the BCC\ncrystal is topologically stable even against noise of small but finite\nintensity. For weak noise, the mean area of the perturbed BCC and FCC crystals\nVT increases quadratically with a. In the case of perturbed SCC crystals, there\nis an optimal amount of noise that minimizes the mean area of the cells.\nAlready for a moderate noise (a>0.5), the properties of the three perturbed VT\nare indistinguishable, and for intense noise (a>2), results converge to the\nPoisson-VT limit. Notably, 2-parameter gamma distributions are an excellent\nmodel for the empirical of of all considered properties. The VT of the\nperturbed BCC and FCC structures are local maxima for the isoperimetric\nquotient, which measures the degre of sphericity of the cells, among space\nfilling VT. In the BCC case, this suggests a weaker form of the recentluy\ndisproved Kelvin conjecture. Due to the fluctuations of the shape of the cells,\nanomalous scalings with exponents >3/2 is observed between the area and the\nvolumes of the cells, and, except for the FCC case, also for a->0. In the\nPoisson-VT limit, the exponent is about 1.67. As the number of faces is\npositively correlated with the sphericity of the cells, the anomalous scaling\nis heavily reduced when we perform powerlaw fits separately on cells with a\nspecific number of faces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 May 2008 00:36:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lucarini", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4147", "submitter": "Meng He", "authors": "Prosenjit Bose, Eric Y.
