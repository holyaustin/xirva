The new\nmethodology decouples the roadmap generation from sampling and produces: (1) a\nquery-able atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin structure,\nenergy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of\nbasins; and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes\n(configurational entropy), and path probabilities.

For $d \\ge 3$, the problem is\nAPX-hard; it is known to admit, for any $\\eps > 0$, an\n$O(n^\\eps)$-approximation.\n  In the generalized minimum Manhattan network problem (GMMN), we are given a\nset $R$ of $n$ terminal pairs, and the goal is to find a minimum-length\nrectilinear network such that each pair in $R$ is connected by a Manhattan\npath. GMMN is a generalization of both MMN and the well-known rectilinear\nSteiner arborescence problem (RSA). So far, only special cases of GMMN have\nbeen considered.\n  We present an $O(\\log^{d+1} n)$-approximation algorithm for GMMN (and, hence,\nMMN) in $d \\ge 2$ dimensions and an $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for 2D.\nWe show that an existing $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm for RSA in 2D\ngeneralizes easily to $d>2$ dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 10:31:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Apr 2012 19:43:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Aparna", ""], ["Fleszar", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Kobourov", "Stephen", ""], ["Spoerhase", "Joachim", ""], ["Veeramoni", "Sankar", ""], ["Wolff", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6786", "submitter": "Donald Sheehy", "authors": "Donald R.

It is a sequence of simplicial complexes built on a metric space to\nadd topological structure to an otherwise disconnected set of points. It is\nwidely used because it encodes useful information about the topology of the\nunderlying metric space. This information is often extracted from its so-called\npersistence diagram. Unfortunately, this filtration is often too large to\nconstruct in full. We show how to construct an O(n)-size filtered simplicial\ncomplex on an $n$-point metric space such that its persistence diagram is a\ngood approximation to that of the Vietoris-Rips filtration. This new filtration\ncan be constructed in $O(n\\log n)$ time. The constant factors in both the size\nand the running time depend only on the doubling dimension of the metric space\nand the desired tightness of the approximation. For the first time, this makes\nit computationally tractable to approximate the persistence diagram of the\nVietoris-Rips filtration across all scales for large data sets.\n  We describe two different sparse filtrations. The first is a zigzag\nfiltration that removes points as the scale increases. The second is a\n(non-zigzag) filtration that yields the same persistence diagram. Both methods\nare based on a hierarchical net-tree and yield the same guarantees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 12:22:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 13:36:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sheehy", "Donald R.", ""]]}]
