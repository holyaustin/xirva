Unlike a\nGabriel graph, there is no unique locally Gabriel graph on a given point set\nsince no edge in a locally Gabriel graph is necessarily included or excluded.\nThus the edge set of the graph can be customized to optimize certain network\nparameters depending on the application. In this paper, we show the following\ncombinatorial bounds on edge complexity and independent sets of locally Gabriel\ngraphs:\n  (i) For any $n$, there exists locally Gabriel graphs with $\\Omega(n^{5/4})$\nedges. This improves upon the previous best bound of $\\Omega(n^{1+\\frac{1}{\\log\n\\log n}})$.\n  (ii) For various subclasses of convex point sets, we show tight linear bounds\non the maximum edge complexity of locally Gabriel graphs.\n  (iii) For any locally Gabriel graph on any $n$ point set, there exists an\nindependent set of size $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2012 18:35:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Govindarajan", "Sathish", ""], ["Khopkar", "Abhijeet", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.4415", "submitter": "Bal\\'azs Keszegh", "authors": "Bal\\'azs Keszegh, Nathan Lemons, D\\\"om\\\"ot\\\"or P\\'alv\\\"olgyi", "title": "Online and quasi-online colorings of wedges and intervals", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider proper online colorings of hypergraphs defined by geometric\nregions.
