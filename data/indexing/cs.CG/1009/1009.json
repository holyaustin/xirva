We distinguish two\nfundamental scenarios under which uncertainty arises. In the favorable\nBest-Case Uncertainty (BU), each input point can be chosen from a given set to\nyield the best possible objective value. In the unfavorable Worst-Case\nUncertainty (WU), the input set has worst possible objective value among all\npossible point locations, which are uncertain due, for example, to imprecise\ndata. We consider these notions of uncertainty for the bottleneck spanning tree\nproblem, giving rise to the following Best-Case Connectivity with Uncertainty\n(BCU) problem: Given a family of geometric regions, choose one point per\nregion, such that the longest edge length of an associated geometric spanning\ntree is minimized. We show that this problem is NP-hard even for very simple\nscenarios in which the regions are line segments or squares. On the other hand,\nwe give an exact solution for the case in which there are n+k regions, where k\nof the regions are line segments and n of the regions are fixed points. We then\ngive approximation algorithms for cases where the regions are either all line\nsegments or all unit discs. We also provide approximation methods for the\ncorresponding Worst-Case Connectivity with Uncertainty (WCU) problem: Given a\nset of uncertainty regions, find the minimal distance r such that for any\nchoice of points, one per region, there is a spanning tree among the points\nwith edge length at most r.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 17:11:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Sep 2010 12:34:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 12:59:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 31 Dec 2016 18:45:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chambers", "Erin", ""], ["Erickson", "Alejandro", ""], ["Fekete", "S\u00e1ndor", ""], ["Lenchner", "Jonathan", ""], ["Sember", "Jeff", ""], ["Srinivasan", "Venkatesh", ""], ["Stege", "Ulrike", ""], ["Stolpner", "Svetlana", ""], ["Weibel", "Christophe", ""], ["Whitesides", "Sue", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3527", "submitter": "Darren Strash", "authors": "Michael T.

Using this result we\nderive the following applications:\n  (1) Impossibility results for 2-query LCCs over the complex numbers: A\n2-query locally correctable code (LCC) is an error correcting code in which\nevery codeword coordinate can be recovered, probabilistically, by reading at\nmost two other code positions. Such codes have numerous applications and\nconstructions (with exponential encoding length) are known over finite fields\nof small characteristic. We show that infinite families of such linear 2-query\nLCCs do not exist over the complex numbers.\n  (2) Generalization of results in combinatorial geometry: We prove a\nquantitative analog of the Sylvester-Gallai theorem: Let $v_1,...,v_m$ be a set\nof points in $\\C^d$ such that for every $i \\in [m]$ there exists at least\n$\\delta m$ values of $j \\in [m]$ such that the line through $v_i,v_j$ contains\na third point in the set.

The first part\ndeals with the decomposition of multiple coverings of the plane. We say that a\nplanar set is cover-decomposable if there is a constant m such that any m-fold\ncovering of the plane with its translates is decomposable into two disjoint\ncoverings of the whole plane. Pach conjectured that every convex set is\ncover-decomposable. We verify his conjecture for polygons. Moreover, if m is\nlarge enough, we prove that any m-fold covering can even be decomposed into k\ncoverings. Then we show that the situation is exactly the opposite in 3\ndimensions, for any polyhedron and any $m$ we construct an m-fold covering of\nthe space that is not decomposable. We also give constructions that show that\nconcave polygons are usually not cover-decomposable. We start the first part\nwith a detailed survey of all results on the cover-decomposability of polygons.\n  The second part investigates another geometric partition problem, related to\nplanar representation of graphs. The slope number of a graph G is the smallest\nnumber s with the property that G has a straight-line drawing with edges of at\nmost s distinct slopes and with no bends. We examine the slope number of\nbounded degree graphs. Our main results are that if the maximum degree is at\nleast 5, then the slope number tends to infinity as the number of vertices\ngrows but every graph with maximum degree at most 3 can be embedded with only\nfive slopes. We also prove that such an embedding exists for the related notion\ncalled slope parameter. Finally, we study the planar slope number, defined only\nfor planar graphs as the smallest number s with the property that the graph has\na straight-line drawing in the plane without any crossings such that the edges\nare segments of only s distinct slopes. We show that the planar slope number of\nplanar graphs with bounded degree is bounded.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Sep 2010 15:45:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Sep 2010 07:21:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["P\u00e1lv\u00f6lgyi", "D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5344", "submitter": "Vincent Pilaud", "authors": "Vincent Pilaud and Michel Pocchiola", "title": "Multitriangulations, pseudotriangulations and primitive sorting networks", "comments": "60 pages, 40 figures; minor corrections and improvements of\n  presentation", "journal-ref": "Discrete Comput.
