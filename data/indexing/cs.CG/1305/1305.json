Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching.

This paper first presents some\nthoughts on the available algorithms in terms of memory usage leading to a very\nsimple scan-line-based algorithm aiming at answering that challenge. Although\nsub-optimal in terms of speed it is optimal if both speed and memory space are\ntaken together and is very easy to implement. For N segments and k\nintersections it uses only N additional integers and lists the intersections in\nO(N^1.26) or corrects them in O((N+k) N^0.26) at most in average, with a high\nprobability of a much lower exponent around 0.16 and even as low as 0.1. It is\ntherefore well adapted for inclusion in larger software and seems like a good\ncompromise. Worst-case is in O(N^2). Then the paper will focus on differences\nbetween available methods and the brute-force algorithm and a solution is\nproposed. Although sub-optimal its applications could mainly be to answer in a\nfast way a number of scattered unrelated intersection queries using minimal\ncomplexity and additional resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 May 2013 16:38:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 15:35:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Souviron", "Jean", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4757", "submitter": "Parasaran Raman", "authors": "Parasaran Raman and Suresh Venkatasubramanian", "title": "Power to the Points: Validating Data Memberships in Clusterings", "comments": "18 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A clustering is an implicit assignment of labels of points, based on\nproximity to other points. It is these labels that are then used for downstream\nanalysis (either focusing on individual clusters, or identifying\nrepresentatives of clusters and so on). Thus, in order to trust a clustering as\na first step in exploratory data analysis, we must trust the labels assigned to\nindividual data. Without supervision, how can we validate this assignment? In\nthis paper, we present a method to attach affinity scores to the implicit\nlabels of individual points in a clustering. The affinity scores capture the\nconfidence level of the cluster that claims to \"own\" the point. This method is\nvery general: it can be used with clusterings derived from Euclidean data,\nkernelized data, or even data derived from information spaces. It smoothly\nincorporates importance functions on clusters, allowing us to eight different\nclusters differently. It is also efficient: assigning an affinity score to a\npoint depends only polynomially on the number of clusters and is independent of\nthe number of points in the data. The dimensionality of the underlying space\nonly appears in preprocessing. We demonstrate the value of our approach with an\nexperimental study that illustrates the use of these scores in different data\nanalysis tasks, as well as the efficiency and flexibility of the method. We\nalso demonstrate useful visualizations of these scores; these might prove\nuseful within an interactive analytics framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2013 08:51:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Raman", "Parasaran", ""], ["Venkatasubramanian", "Suresh", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.5209", "submitter": "Jean-Lou De Carufel", "authors": "Jean-Lou De Carufel, Carsten Grimm, Anil Maheshwari, Megan Owen,\n  Michiel Smid", "title": "A Note on the Unsolvability of the Weighted Region Shortest Path Problem", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let S be a subdivision of the plane into polygonal regions, where each region\nhas an associated positive weight.

Our framework is\nadapted to the well-established industry-standard brep format to enable its\nimplementation in modern CAD systems. This is achieved via a \"local analysis\",\nwhich covers parametrization and singularities, as well as a \"global theory\"\nwhich tackles face-boundaries, self-intersections and trim curves. Central to\nthe local analysis is the \"funnel\" which serves as a natural parameter space\nfor the basic surfaces constituting the sweep. The trimming problem is reduced\nto the problem of surface-surface intersections of these basic surfaces. Based\non the complexity of these intersections, we introduce a novel classification\nof sweeps as either decomposable or non-decomposable. Further, we construct an\n{\\em invariant} function $\\theta$ on the funnel which efficiently separates\ndecomposable and non-decomposable sweeps. Through a geometric theorem we also\nshow intimate connections between $\\theta$, local curvatures and the inverse\ntrajectory used in earlier works as an approach towards trimming. In contrast\nto the inverse trajectory approach, $\\theta$ is robust and is the key to a\ncomplete structural understanding, and an efficient computation of both, the\nsingular locus and the trim curves, which are central to a stable\nimplementation.
