This can be used, for instance, to show that sliding window\nembeddings of periodic signals recover topological loops, and that sliding\nwindow embeddings of quasiperiodic signals recover high-dimensional torii.\nHowever, in spite of these motivating examples, Takens' theorem does not in\ngeneral prescribe how to choose such an observation function given particular\ndynamics in a state space. In this work, we state conditions on observation\nfunctions defined on compact Riemannian manifolds, that lead to successful\nreconstructions for particular dynamics. We apply our theory and construct\nfamilies of time series whose sliding window embeddings trace tori, Klein\nbottles, spheres, and projective planes. This greatly enriches the set of\nexamples of time series known to concentrate on various shapes via sliding\nwindow embeddings, and will hopefully help other researchers in identifying\nthem in naturally occurring phenomena. We also present numerical experiments\nshowing how to recover low dimensional representations of the underlying\ndynamics on state space, by using the persistent cohomology of sliding window\nembeddings and Eilenberg-MacLane (i.e., circular and real projective)\ncoordinates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2018 11:47:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2018 08:45:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2019 22:33:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Boyan", ""], ["Tralie", "Christopher J.", ""], ["Antia", "Alice", ""], ["Lin", "Michael", ""], ["Perea", "Jose A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.07159", "submitter": "Ioana O.

The problem is a generalization of\nthe classical Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP) on points and has been widely\nstudied in the literature. For the case of disjoint uniform disks of radius\n$R$, Dumitrescu and Mitchell[2001] show that the optimal TSP tour on the\ncenters of the disks is a $3.547$-approximation to the TSPN version. The core\nof their analysis is based on bounding the detour that the optimal TSPN tour\nhas to make in order to visit the centers of each disk and shows that it is at\nmost $2Rn$ in the worst case. H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula[2011] asked\nwhether this bound is tight when $R$ is small and conjectured that it is at\nmost $\\sqrt{3}Rn$.\n  We further investigate this question and derive structural properties of the\noptimal TSPN tour to describe the cases in which the bound is smaller than\n$2Rn$. Specifically, we show that if the optimal TSPN tour is not a straight\nline, at least one of the following is guaranteed to be true: the bound is\nsmaller than $1.999Rn$ or the $TSP$ on the centers is a $2$-approximation. The\nlatter bound of $2$ is the best that we can get in general. Our framework is\nbased on using the optimality of the TSPN tour to identify local structures for\nwhich the detour is large and then using their geometry to derive better lower\nbounds on the length of the TSPN tour. This leads to an improved approximation\nfactor of $3.53$ for disjoint uniform disks and $6.728$ for the general case.\nWe further show that the H\\\"{a}me, Hyyti\\\"{a} and Hakula conjecture is true for\nthe case of three disks and discuss the method used to obtain it. Along the\nway, we will uncover one way in which the TSPN problem is structurally\ndifferent from the classical TSP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2018 13:04:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bercea", "Ioana O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.07214", "submitter": "Satyabrata Jana", "authors": "Satyabrata Jana, Supantha Pandit", "title": "Covering and Packing of Rectilinear Subdivision", "comments": "12 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study a class of geometric covering and packing problems for bounded\nregions on the plane.

An \\textsc{L}-path is a $1$-bend path having the shape `\\textsc{L}'.\nA \\emph{vertically-stabbed-\\textsc{L} graph} is an intersection graph of\n\\textsc{L}-paths intersecting a common vertical line. We give a polynomial time\n$8$-approximation algorithm for \\textsc{MDS} problem on\nvertically-stabbed-\\textsc{L} graphs whose APX-hardness was shown by\nBandyapadhyay et al. (\\textsc{MFCS}, 2018). To prove the above result, we\nneeded to study the \\emph{Stabbing segments with rays} (\\textsc{SSR}) problem\nintroduced by Katz et al. (\\textsc{Comput. Geom. 2005}). In the \\textsc{SSR}\nproblem, the input is a set of (disjoint) leftward-directed rays, and a set of\n(disjoint) vertical segments. The objective is to select a minimum number of\nrays that intersect all vertical segments. We give a $O((n+m)\\log (n+m))$-time\n$2$-approximation algorithm for the \\textsc{SSR} problem where $n$ and $m$ are\nthe number of rays and segments in the input. A \\emph{unit $k$-bend path} is a\n$k$-bend path whose segments are of unit length. A graph is a \\emph{unit\n$B_k$-VPG graph} if it is an intersection graph of unit $k$-bend paths. Any\nstring graph is a unit-$B_k$-VPG graph for some finite $k$. Using our result on\n\\textsc{SSR}-problem, we give a polynomial time $O(k^4)$-approximation\nalgorithm for \\textsc{MDS} problem on unit $B_k$-VPG graphs for $k\\geq 0$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2018 13:38:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2018 16:38:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Dibyayan", ""], ["Das", "Sandip", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Joydeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10078", "submitter": "Jordi Vermeulen", "authors": "Vahideh Keikha and Mees van de Kerkhof and Marc van Kreveld and Irina\n  Kostitsyna and Maarten L\\\"offler and Frank Staals and J\\'er\\^ome Urhausen and\n  Jordi L.

Our approach has several salient features that distinguishes it\nfrom previous work. It is not limited to filtrations (i.e. sequences of nested\nsimplicial subcomplexes) but works for other types of sequences like towers and\nzigzags. To strong collapse a simplicial complex, we only need to store the\nmaximal simplices of the complex, not the full set of all its simplices, which\nsaves a lot of space and time. Moreover, the complexes in the sequence can be\nstrong collapsed independently and in parallel. Finally, we can compromize\nbetween precision and time by choosing the number of simplicial complexes of\nthe sequence we strong collapse.
