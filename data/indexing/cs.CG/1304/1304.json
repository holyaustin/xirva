(1) The\noracle returns the index of a \"most violated\" constraint, measured by the\nEuclidean distance of the proposed solution and the half-spaces defined by the\nconstraints.

However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$.

The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once.

The traveling speed along the highway is assumed to be faster than\nthat off the highway, and the shortest time-path between a distant pair may\ninvolve traveling along the highway. The time-convex hull ${TCH}(P)$ of a point\nset $P$ is the smallest set containing both $P$ and \\emph{all} shortest\ntime-paths between any two points in ${TCH}(P)$. In this paper we give an\nalgorithm that computes the time-convex hull under the $L_p$ metric in optimal\n$O(n\\log n)$ time for a given set of $n$ points and a real number $p$ with\n$1\\le p \\le \\infty$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 02:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dai", "Bang-Sin", ""], ["Kao", "Mong-Jen", ""], ["Lee", "D.

Specifically, for any $n$-point doubling metric, any\n$\\eps > 0$, and any integer $0 \\le k \\le n-2$, our construction provides a\n$k$-fault-tolerant $(1+\\eps)$-spanner with optimal degree $O(k)$ within optimal\ntime $O(n \\log n + k n)$.\n  We then strengthen this result to provide near-optimal (up to a factor of\n$\\log k$) guarantees on the diameter and weight of our spanners, namely,\ndiameter $O(\\log n)$ and weight $O(k^2 + k \\log n) \\cdot \\omega(MST)$, while\npreserving the optimal guarantees on the degree $O(k)$ and the running time\n$O(n \\log n + k n)$.\n  Our result settles several fundamental open questions in this area,\nculminating a long line of research that started with the STOC'95 paper of Arya\net al.\\ and the STOC'98 paper of Levcopoulos et al.\n  On the way to this result we develop a new technique for constructing\nspanners in doubling metrics. Our spanner construction is based on a novel\n\\emph{hierarchical cover} of the metric, whereas most previous constructions of\nspanners for doubling and Euclidean metrics (such as the net-tree spanner) are\nbased on \\emph{hierarchical partitions} of the metric. We demonstrate the power\nof hierarchical covers in the context of geometric spanners by improving the\nstate-of-the-art results in this area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 19:58:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2013 19:52:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Solomon", "Shay", ""]]}]
