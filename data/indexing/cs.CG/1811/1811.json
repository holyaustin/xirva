Optimization\ntechniques offer design aids in creating cost-effective structures that meet\nthe prescribed structural objectives. The fundamental problem in existing\napproaches lies in the difficulty to quantify the structural performance as\neach unique design leads to a new set of analyses to determine the structural\nrobustness and such analyses can be very costly due to the complexity of in-use\nforces experienced by the structure. This work develops computationally\ntractable methods tailored to maximize the structural performance of AM\nproducts. A geometry preserving build orientation optimization method as well\nas data-driven shape optimization approaches to structural design are\npresented.

Roughly speaking, a metric\ntree is a metric space that can be realized by the shortest path metric on a\ntree. Previously, Agarwal et al. showed that even for trees with unit edge\nlength, it is NP hard to approximate the GH distance between them within a\nfactor of 3. In this paper, we present a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nalgorithm that can approximate the GH distance between two general metric trees\nwithin a factor of 14.\n  Interestingly, the development of our algorithm is made possible by a\nconnection between the GH distance for metric trees and the interleaving\ndistance for the so-called merge trees. The merge trees arise in practice\nnaturally as a simple yet meaningful topological summary, and are of\nindependent interest. It turns out that an exact or approximation algorithm for\nthe interleaving distance leads to an approximation algorithm for the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance. One of the key contributions of our work is that we\nre-define the interleaving distance in a way that makes it easier to develop\ndynamic programming approaches to compute it.

Currently, computing descriptors for complex data characterized\nby multiple functions is becoming an important task in several applications,\nincluding physics, chemistry, medicine, geography, etc. Multiparameter\nPersistent Homology (MPH) generalizes persistent homology opening to the\nexploration and analysis of shapes endowed with multiple filtering functions.\nStill, computational constraints prevent MPH to be feasible over real-sized\ndata. In this paper, we consider discrete Morse Theory as a tool to simplify\nthe computation of MPH on a multiparameter dataset. We propose a new algorithm,\nwell suited for parallel and distributed implementations and we provide the\nfirst evaluation of the impact on MPH computations of a preprocessing approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:39:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Scaramuccia", "Sara", ""], ["Iuricich", "Federico", ""], ["De Floriani", "Leila", ""], ["Landi", "Claudia", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.05659", "submitter": "Alexander Gribov", "authors": "Alexander Gribov", "title": "An Efficient Combinatorial Algorithm for Optimal Compression of a\n  Polyline with Segments and Arcs", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures, extended abstract published at the conference", "journal-ref": "An Efficient Combinatorial Algorithm for Optimal Compression of a\n  Polyline with Segments and Arcs, in 2017 14th IAPR International Conference\n  on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), vol. 02, November 2017, pp. 7-8", "doi": "10.1109/ICDAR.2017.251", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The task of finding the optimal compression of a polyline with straight-line\nsegments and arcs is performed in many applications, such as polyline\ncompression, noise filtering, and feature recognition.

The reconstruction is based on basis functions\nwhich are optimized to provide a good fit to the point scan while satisfying\npredefined topological constraints. We optimize the parameters of a model to\nobtain likelihood function over the reconstruction domain. The topological\nconstraints are captured by persistence diagrams which are incorporated in the\noptimization algorithm promote the correct topology. The result is a novel\ntopology-aware technique which can: 1.) weed out topological noise from point\nscans, and 2.) capture certain nuanced properties of the underlying shape which\ncould otherwise be lost while performing surface reconstruction. We showcase\nresults reconstructing shapes with multiple potential topologies, compare to\nother classical surface construction techniques, and show the completion of\nreal scan data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 23:55:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 19:49:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00fcel-Gabrielsson", "Rickard", ""], ["Ganapathi-Subramanian", "Vignesh", ""], ["Skraba", "Primoz", ""], ["Guibas", "Leonidas J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12604", "submitter": "Na Lei", "authors": "Wei Chen, Xiaopeng Zheng, Jingyao Ke, Na Lei, Zhongxuan Luo and\n  Xianfeng Gu", "title": "Metric Based Quadrilateral Mesh Generation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work proposes a novel metric based algorithm for quadrilateral mesh\ngenerating.
