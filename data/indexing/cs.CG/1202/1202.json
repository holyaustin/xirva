The algorithm\ntransports $O(g\\log n)$ memory and finishes in time $O(g^2n^2)$, where $n$ is\nthe size of the graph. It requires access to a homology basis for the surface.\nThis algorithm, GFR, may be viewed as a suitable generalization of Face Routing\n(FR), the well-known algorithm for plane graphs, which we previously showed\ndoes {\\it not} guarantee delivery in graphs embedded on positive genus\nsurfaces. The problem for such surfaces is the potential presence of\nhomologically non-trivial closed walks which may be traversed by the right-hand\nrule. We use an interesting mathematical property of homology bases (proven in\nLemma \\ref{lem:connectFaceBdr}) to show that such walks will not impede GFR. FR\nis at the base of most routing algorithms used in modern (2D) ad hoc networks:\nthese algorithms all involve additional local techniques to deal with\nedge-crossings so FR may be applied. GFR should be viewed in the same light, as\na base algorithm which could for example be tailored to sensor networks on\nsurfaces in 3D. Currently there are no known efficient local, logarithmic\nmemory algorithms for 3D ad hoc networks. From a theoretical point of view our\nwork suggests that the efficiency advantages from which FR benefits are related\nto the codimension one nature of an embedded graph in a surface rather than the\nflatness of that surface (planarity).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 03:30:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fraser", "Maia", ""]]}]
