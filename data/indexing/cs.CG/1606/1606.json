Moreover, stylistic geometry is\noften used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore\ndiscretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon\n$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for\nthe schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a\nsimple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and\nconnected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.\n  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance\nvia the Fr\\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that\napproximates the minimal Fr\\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane\ngraph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area\npreservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is\nspecified.\n  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance\nvia the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less\nstrict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.\nThis result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal\ntiling, and if area preservation is required. Moreover, it is independent of\nwhether we allow the set of faces to have holes or not.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 09:09:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Meulemans", "Wouter", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.06508", "submitter": "Walter Mascarenhas", "authors": "Walter F.
