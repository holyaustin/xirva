So yes, in a\ncomputational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely\nremoves this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),\nthen the computational \"power\" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing\nuniversal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \\times N$ squares)\nbecomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only\nTuring universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \\times N$\nsquares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,\nSchweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical \"power\" of a\nseemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which\n(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single\nnegative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact.

Next, we provide results for a variation\nof the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except\nthat the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\\ge\n1$.

We consider a\ncomputational version, where X, Y are given as finite simplicial complexes, and\nthe goal is to compute [X,Y], i.e., all homotopy classes of such maps. We solve\nthis problem in the stable range, where for some d >= 2, we have dim X <= 2d -\n2 and Y is (d - 1)-connected; in particular, Y can be the d-dimensional sphere\nS^d. The algorithm combines classical tools and ideas from homotopy theory\n(obstruction theory, Postnikov systems, and simplicial sets) with algorithmic\ntools from effective algebraic topology (locally effective simplicial sets and\nobjects with effective homology). In contrast, [X,Y] is known to be\nuncomputable for general X,Y, since for X = S^1 it includes a well known\nundecidable problem: testing triviality of the fundamental group of Y. In\nfollow-up papers, the algorithm is shown to run in polynomial time for d fixed,\nand extended to other problems, such as the extension problem, where we are\ngiven a subspace A of X and a map A -> Y and ask whether it extends to a map X\n-> Y, or computing the Z_2-index---everything in the stable range. Outside the\nstable range, the extension problem is undecidable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 12:51:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2011 11:59:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2011 09:38:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 11:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["\u010cadek", "Martin", ""], ["Kr\u010d\u00e1l", "Marek", ""], ["Matou\u0161ek", "Ji\u0159\u00ed", ""], ["Sergeraert", "Francis", ""], ["Vok\u0159\u00ednek", "Luk\u00e1\u0161", ""], ["Wagner", "Uli", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6305", "submitter": "Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson", "authors": "Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson", "title": "Interleaved computation for persistent homology", "comments": "5 pages, draft version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Mittag-Leffler-2011spring", "categories": "cs.CG math.AT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  We describe an approach to bounded-memory computation of persistent homology\nand betti barcodes, in which a computational state is maintained with updates\nintroducing new edges to the underlying neighbourhood graph and percolating the\nresulting changes into the simplex stream feeding the persistence algorithm.\n  We further discuss the memory consumption and resulting speed and complexity\nbehaviours of the resulting algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 14:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Vejdemo-Johansson", "Mikael", ""]]}]
