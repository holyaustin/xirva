Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the\nnumber of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms\nis the existence of an orthogonal representation that describes such drawings\ncombinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around each vertex\nand the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric\ninformation such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths.\n  We generalize this idea to ortho-radial representations of ortho-radial\ndrawings, which are embeddings into an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are\nconcentric circles around the origin and straight-line spokes emanating from\nthe origin but excluding the origin itself. Unlike the orthogonal case, there\nexist ortho-radial representations that do not admit a corresponding drawing,\nfor example so-called strictly monotone cycles. An ortho-radial drawing is\ncalled valid if it does not contain a strictly monotone cycle. Our first result\nis that an ortho-radial representation admits a corresponding drawing if and\nonly if it is valid. Previously such a characterization was only known for\northo-radial drawings of paths, cycles, and theta graphs, and in the special\ncase of rectangular drawings of cubic graphs, where the contour of each face is\nrequired to be a rectangle. Further, we give a quadratic-time algorithm that\ntests for an ortho-radial representation whether it is valid, and we show how\nto draw a valid ortho-radial representation in the same running time.\n  Altogether, this reduces the problem of computing a minimum-bend ortho-radial\ndrawing to the task of computing a valid ortho-radial representation with the\nminimum number of bends, and hence establishes an ortho-radial analogue of the\ntopology-shape-metrics framework for planar orthogonal drawings by Tamassia.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:32:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Barth", "Lukas", ""], ["Niedermann", "Benjamin", ""], ["Rutter", "Ignaz", ""], ["Wolf", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.06020", "submitter": "Maurice Weiler", "authors": "Maurice Weiler, Patrick Forr\\'e, Erik Verlinde, Max Welling", "title": "Coordinate Independent Convolutional Networks -- Isometry and Gauge\n  Equivariant Convolutions on Riemannian Manifolds", "comments": "The implementation of orientation independent M\\\"obius convolutions\n  is publicly available at https://github.com/mauriceweiler/MobiusCNNs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CG cs.CV stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the vast success of deep convolutional networks, there is a\ngreat interest in generalizing convolutions to non-Euclidean manifolds. A major\ncomplication in comparison to flat spaces is that it is unclear in which\nalignment a convolution kernel should be applied on a manifold. The underlying\nreason for this ambiguity is that general manifolds do not come with a\ncanonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore\nhave to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the\nparticular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference\n-- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate\nindependence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the\nnetwork to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local\nreference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the\nG-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge\nequivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate\nindependent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries\nthat are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a\ncoordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of\ncoordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on\nthe M\\\"obius strip.

One way of identifying adaptive\nmutations is by looking at convergent mutations, mutations in the same genomic\nposition that occur independently. However, the large number of currently\navailable genomes precludes the efficient use of phylogeny-based techniques.\nHere, we establish a fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach for\nthe early warning and surveillance of emerging adaptive mutations based on\npersistent homology. It identifies convergent events merely by their\ntopological footprint and thus overcomes limitations of current phylogenetic\ninference techniques.
