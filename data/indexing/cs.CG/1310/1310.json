Our algorithmic design ensures that the data is\ndistributed over the nodes without redundancy; this permits the computation of\nmuch larger instances than on a single machine. Moreover, we observe that the\nparallelism at least compensates for the overhead caused by communication\nbetween nodes, and often even speeds up the computation compared to sequential\nand even parallel shared memory algorithms.

A necessary condition for a\nsimplicial mapping of a mesh to be injective is that it either maintains the\norientation of all elements or flips all the elements. However, these\nconditions are known to be insufficient for injectivity of a simplicial map. In\nthis paper we provide additional simple conditions that, together with the\nabove mentioned necessary conditions guarantee injectivity of the simplicial\nmap.\n  The first set of conditions generalizes classical global inversion theorems\nto the mesh (piecewise-linear) case. That is, proves that in case the boundary\nsimplicial map is bijective and the necessary condition holds then the map is\ninjective and onto the target domain. The second set of conditions is concerned\nwith mapping of a mesh to a polytope and replaces the (often hard) requirement\nof a bijective boundary map with a collection of linear constraints and\nguarantees that the resulting map is injective over the interior of the mesh\nand onto. These linear conditions provide a practical tool for optimizing a map\nof the mesh onto a given polytope while allowing the boundary map to adjust\nfreely and keeping the injectivity property in the interior of the mesh. The\nthird set of conditions adds to the second set the requirement that the\nboundary maps are orientation preserving as-well (with a proper definition of\nboundary map orientation). This set of conditions guarantees that the map is\ninjective on the boundary of the mesh as-well as its interior.

The $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the\nconvex polygon setting might be of independent interest, as it generalizes\nlower bounds on certain sorting models. When simultaneous flips are allowed,\nthe upper bound for convex polygons decreases to $O(\\log^2 n)$, although we no\nlonger have a matching lower bound.\n  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated\npolygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This\nis in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is\nconnected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a\ncomplete characterization of the orbits. This allows us to decide connectivity\nof the flip graph of a spiral polygon in linear time.

There are two principle\ntypes of MCS, one is the Rigid Multiple Camera System (RMCS); the other is the\nArticulated Camera System (ACS). In a RMCS, the relative poses (relative 3-D\nposition and orientation) between the cameras are invariant. While, in an ACS,\nthe cameras are articulated through movable joints, the relative pose between\nthem may change. Therefore, through calibration of an ACS we want to find not\nonly the relative poses between the cameras but also the positions of the\njoints in the ACS.\n  In this paper, we developed calibration algorithms for the ACS using a simple\nconstraint: the joint is fixed relative to the cameras connected with it during\nthe transformations of the ACS. When the transformations of the cameras in an\nACS can be estimated relative to the same coordinate system, the positions of\nthe joints in the ACS can be calculated by solving linear equations. However,\nin a non-overlapping view ACS, only the ego-transformations of the cameras and\ncan be estimated. We proposed a two-steps method to deal with this problem. In\nboth methods, the ACS is assumed to have performed general transformations in a\nstatic environment. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods are\ntested by simulation and real experiments. In the real experiment, the\nintrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the ACS are obtained simultaneously by\nour calibration procedure using the same image sequences, no extra data\ncapturing step is required. The corresponding trajectory is recovered and\nillustrated using the calibration results of the ACS. Since the estimated\ntranslations of different cameras in an ACS may scaled by different scale\nfactors, a scale factor estimation algorithm is also proposed. To our\nknowledge, we are the first to study the calibration of ACS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Oct 2013 14:26:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Junzhou", ""], ["Wong", "Kin Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.5202", "submitter": "Omur  Arslan", "authors": "Omur Arslan, Dan P.
