A product is modeled by $d$ real-valued qualities whose sum\ndetermines the unit cost of producing the product.

An $O(n\\log n)$ time algorithm is given for the case,\n$d=1$, of linear products, and $O(n(\\log n)^{d+1})$ time approximation\nalgorithms are given for products with any constant number, $d$, of qualities.\nTo achieve the latter result, an $O(nk^{d-1})$ bound on the complexity of an\narrangement of homothetic simplices in $\\R^d$ is given, where $k$ is the\nmaximum number of simplices that all contain a single points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2009 14:38:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gudmundsson", "Joachim", ""], ["Morin", "Pat", ""], ["Smid", "Michiel", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0696", "submitter": "Megan Owen", "authors": "Megan Owen", "title": "Computing Geodesic Distances in Tree Space", "comments": "24 pages, 7 figures; v2: substantially revised for clarity", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.DM math.MG q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present two algorithms for computing the geodesic distance between\nphylogenetic trees in tree space, as introduced by Billera, Holmes, and\nVogtmann (2001).
