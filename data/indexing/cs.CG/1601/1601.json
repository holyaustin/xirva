The adaptive filter (AF) performance is\nassessed via a 3D point-clouds registration problem, which contains a rotation\nestimation step. Calculating the AF computational complexity suggests that it\ncan contribute to reduce the cost of a full-blown 3D registration algorithm,\nespecially when the number of points to be processed grows. Moreover, the\nemployed GA/GC framework allows for easily applying the resulting filter to\nestimating rotors in higher dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 15:38:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lopes", "Wilder B.", ""], ["Al-Nuaimi", "Anas", ""], ["Lopes", "Cassio G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06865", "submitter": "David Eppstein", "authors": "David Eppstein and Mereke van Garderen and Bettina Speckmann and\n  Torsten Ueckerdt", "title": "Convex-Arc Drawings of Pseudolines", "comments": "11 pages, 8 figures.
