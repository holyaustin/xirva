The\ncase of this problem on polygonal obstacles is well studied. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem version on curved obstacles, commonly modeled as\nsplinegons. A splinegon can be viewed as replacing each edge of a polygon by a\nconvex curved edge (polygons are special splinegons). Each curved edge is\nassumed to be of O(1) complexity. Given in the plane two points s and t and a\nset of $h$ pairwise disjoint splinegons with a total of $n$ vertices, we\ncompute a shortest s-to-t path avoiding the splinegons, in\n$O(n+h\\log^{1+\\epsilon}h+k)$ time, where k is a parameter sensitive to the\nstructures of the input splinegons and is upper-bounded by $O(h^2)$. In\nparticular, when all splinegons are convex, $k$ is proportional to the number\nof common tangents in the free space (called \"free common tangents\") among the\nsplinegons. We develop techniques for solving the problem on the general\n(non-convex) splinegon domain, which also improve several previous results. In\nparticular, our techniques produce an optimal output-sensitive algorithm for a\nbasic visibility problem of computing all free common tangents among $h$\npairwise disjoint convex splinegons with a total of $n$ vertices. Our algorithm\nruns in $O(n+h\\log h+k)$ time and $O(n)$ space, where $k$ is the number of all\nfree common tangents.

They have been the subject of extensive investigation\nduring the last decades. Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of\na given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of\nsubsets called the generators or the sites. Consider the following question:\ndoes a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a\nsmall change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means\nnatural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either\nbecause of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical\nerrors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it\nis important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real\nones well. The traditional approach to Voronoi diagrams, and, in particular, to\n(variants of) this question, is combinatorial. However, it seems that there has\nbeen a very limited discussion in the geometric sense (the shape of the cells),\nmainly an intuitive one, without proofs, in Euclidean spaces. We formalize this\nquestion precisely, and then show that the answer is positive in the case of\nR^d, or, more generally, in (possibly infinite dimensional) uniformly convex\nnormed spaces, assuming there is a common positive lower bound on the distance\nbetween the sites.

All our results are in\nthe standard word RAM model for points in rank space:\n  ** We present two data structures for 2-d orthogonal range emptiness. The\nfirst achieves O(n lglg n) space and O(lglg n) query time. This improves the\nprevious results by Alstrup, Brodal, and Rauhe(FOCS'00), with O(n lg^eps n)\nspace and O(lglg n) query time, or with O(nlglg n) space and O(lg^2 lg n) query\ntime. Our second data structure uses O(n) space and answers queries in O(lg^eps\nn) time. The best previous O(n)-space data structure, due to Nekrich (WADS'07),\nanswers queries in O(lg n/lglg n) time.\n  ** For 3-d orthogonal range reporting, we obtain space O(n lg^{1+eps} n) and\nquery time O(lglg n + k), for any constant eps>0. This improves previous\nresults by Afshani (ESA'08), Karpinski and Nekrich (COCOON'09), and Chan\n(SODA'11), with O(n lg^3 n) space and O(lglg n + k) query time, or with O(n\nlg^{1+eps} n) space and O(lg^2 lg n + k) query time. This implies improved\nbounds for orthogonal range reporting in all constant dimensions above 3.\n  ** We give a randomized algorithm for 4-d offline dominance range\nreporting/emptiness with running time O(n lg n + k). This resolves two open\nproblems from Preparata and Shamos' seminal book:\n  **** given n axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, we can report all k\nenclosure pairs in O(n lg n + k) expected time. The best known result was an\nO([n lg n + k] lglg n) algorithm from SoCG'95 by Gupta, Janardan, Smid, and\nDasgupta.\n  **** given n points in 4-d, we can find all maximal points in O(n lg n)\nexpected time. The best previous result was an O(n lg n lglg n) algorithm due\nto Gabow, Bentley, and Tarjan (STOC'84). This implies record time bounds for\nthe maxima problem in all constant dimensions above 4.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2011 23:32:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Timothy M.", ""], ["Larsen", "Kasper Green", ""], ["Patrascu", "Mihai", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5855", "submitter": "Ilona Kosinska", "authors": "Ilona D.

The procedure enables to produce meshes of a\nprescribed volume V_0 of elements. The finite volume meshes are used with the\nFinite Element approach. The FEM analysis enables to deal with a set of coupled\nnonlinear differential equations that describes the electrodiffusional problem.\nMesh quality and accuracy of FEM solutions are also examined. High quality of\nFEM type space-dependent approximation and correctness of discrete\napproximation in time are ensured by finding solutions to the 3D Laplace\nproblem and to the 3D diffusion equation, respectively. Their comparison with\nanalytical solutions confirms accuracy of obtained approximations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 09:24:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kosinska", "Ilona D.", "", "Wroclaw University of Technology, Institute of\n  Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation, Poland"]]}]
