This work is motivated by, and extends, results on removal as\nproposed for chance-constrained optimization.\n  For many relevant values of $r$, $\\delta$, and $k$, we prove matching upper\nand lower bounds for the expected number of constraints violated by a random\nsample, after the removal of $k$ constraints. For a large range of values of\n$k$, the new upper bounds improve the previously best bounds for LP-type\nproblems, which moreover had only been known in special cases, and not in the\ngenerality we consider. Moreover, we show that our results extend from finite\nto infinite spaces, for chance-constrained optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 09:28:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 14:17:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 22:38:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Clarkson", "Kenneth L.", ""], ["G\u00e4rtner", "Bernd", ""], ["Lengler", "Johannes", ""], ["Szedlak", "May", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.04303", "submitter": "Marcio Oshiro", "authors": "Cristina G.

For the Euclidean counterpart, the best\nalgorithms compute the geodesic diameter in $O(n^{7.73})$ or $O(n^7(h+\\log n))$\ntime, and compute the geodesic center in $O(n^{11}\\log n)$ time. Therefore, our\nalgorithms are significantly faster than the algorithms for the Euclidean\nproblems.

Apollonius diagrams\narguably provide the most natural division of space for many materials and\ntechnology problems, but compared to Voronoi and power diagrams, their use has\nbeen limited, presumably by the complexity of their calculation. In this work,\nwe report explicit equations for the vertices of the Apollonius diagram in a\nd-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that there are special lines that\ncontain vertices of more than one type of diagram and this property can be\nexploited to develop simple vertex expressions for the Apollonius diagram.\nFinding the Apollonius vertices is not significantly more difficult or\nexpensive than computing those of the power diagram and have application beyond\ntheir use in calculating the diagram. The expressions reported here lend\nthemselves to the use of standard vector and matrix libraries and the stability\nand precision their use implies. They can also be used in algorithms with\nmulti-precision numeric types and those adhering to the exact algorithms\nparadigm.
