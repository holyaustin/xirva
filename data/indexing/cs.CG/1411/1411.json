An $\\epsilon$-kernel coreset\napproximates the width of a point set in any direction.

A\nmethod from computational topology called zigzag persistent homology takes this\nsequence of simplicial complexes as input, and returns a `barcode' containing\nthe birth and death times of homological features in this sequence. We derive\nuseful statistics from this output for analyzing time-varying coverage\nproperties. Further, we propose a method which returns specific representative\ncycles for these homological features, at each point along the birth-death\nintervals. These representative cycles are then used to track coverage holes in\nthe network, and obtain size estimates for individual holes at each time point.\nA weighted barcode, incorporating the size information, is then used as a\nvisual and quantitative descriptor of the dynamic network coverage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 19:19:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Gamble", "Jennifer", ""], ["Chintakunta", "Harish", ""], ["Krim", "Hamid", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7753", "submitter": "Abhishek Bhowmick", "authors": "Chandrajit Bajaj, Abhishek Bhowmick, Eshan Chattopadhyay, David\n  Zuckerman", "title": "On Low Discrepancy Samplings in Product Spaces of Motion Groups", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Deterministically generating near-uniform point samplings of the motion\ngroups like SO(3), SE(3) and their n-wise products SO(3)^n, SE(3)^n is\nfundamental to numerous applications in computational and data sciences. The\nnatural measure of sampling quality is discrepancy. In this work, our main goal\nis construct low discrepancy deterministic samplings in product spaces of the\nmotion groups. To this end, we develop a novel strategy (using a two-step\ndiscrepancy construction) that leads to an almost exponential improvement in\nsize (from the trivial direct product). To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first nontrivial construction for SO(3)^n, SE(3)^n and the hypertorus T^n.\n  We also construct new low discrepancy samplings of S^2 and SO(3). The central\ncomponent in our construction for SO(3) is an explicit construction of N points\nin S^2 with discrepancy \\tilde{\\O}(1/\\sqrt{N}) with respect to convex sets,\nmatching the bound achieved for the special case of spherical caps in\n\\cite{ABD_12}.

We generalize this definition of measure over all metric spaces\nby appealing to covering and packing radius. The definition of gap ratio needs\nonly a metric unlike discrepancy, a widely used uniformity measure, that\ndepends on the notion of a range space and its volume. We also show some\ninteresting connections of gap ratio to Delaunay triangulation and discrepancy\nin the Euclidean plane. The major focus of this work is on solving optimization\nrelated questions about selecting uniform point samples from metric spaces; the\nuniformity being measured using gap ratio. We consider discrete spaces like\ngraph and set of points in the Euclidean space and continuous spaces like the\nunit square and path connected spaces. We deduce lower bounds, prove hardness\nand approximation hardness results. We show that a general approximation\nalgorithm framework gives different approximation ratios for different metric\nspaces based on the lower bound we deduce.
