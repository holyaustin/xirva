Motivated by applications in wireless routing, relaxed versions of\nthese graphs known as \\emph{Locally Delaunay Graphs} ($LDGs$) and \\emph{Locally\nGabriel Graphs} ($LGGs$) were proposed. We propose another generalization of\n$LGGs$ called \\emph{Generalized Locally Gabriel Graphs} ($GLGGs$) in the\ncontext when certain edges are forbidden in the graph. Unlike a Gabriel Graph,\nthere is no unique $LGG$ or $GLGG$ for a given point set because no edge is\nnecessarily included or excluded. This property allows us to choose an\n$LGG/GLGG$ that optimizes a parameter of interest in the graph. We show that\ncomputing an edge maximum $GLGG$ for a given problem instance is NP-hard and\nalso APX-hard. We also show that computing an $LGG$ on a given point set with\ndilation $\\le k$ is NP-hard. Finally, we give an algorithm to verify whether a\ngiven geometric graph $G=(V,E)$ is a valid $LGG$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2011 08:29:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2012 10:43:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Khopkar", "Abhijeet", ""], ["Govindarajan", "Sathish", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2995", "submitter": "Antonio Campello", "authors": "Antonio Campello and Jo\\~ao Strapasson", "title": "On sequences of projections of the cubic lattice", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Computational and Applied Mathematics, 32(1):57-69, 2013", "doi": "10.1007/s40314-013-0009-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study sequences of lattices which are, up to similarity,\nprojections of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ onto a hyperplane $\\bm{v}^{\\perp}$, with\n$\\bm{v} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ and converge to a target lattice $\\Lambda$ which\nis equivalent to an integer lattice.

For example, they have been successfully employed in\ncorrespondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In the recent years,\nsignificant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the\nspectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the\nshape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and\nthe wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are\ncomputationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can\ngracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate\na generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to\nbe optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the\nstatistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the \"signal\") and\nthose of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the\n\"noise\"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be\nlearned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal\nprocessing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral\ndescriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of\nthe proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Oct 2011 04:26:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bronstein", "Alexander M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5657", "submitter": "Timothy McNicholl Ph.D.", "authors": "Timothy H.
