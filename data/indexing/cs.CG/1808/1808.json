Structures are tracked based on the\noptimal matching between persistence diagrams with respect to the Wasserstein\nmetric. This fundamentally relies on solving the assignment problem, a special\ncase of optimal transport, for all consecutive timesteps. Our approach relies\non two main contributions. First, we revisit the seminal assignment algorithm\nby Kuhn and Munkres which we specifically adapt to the problem of matching\npersistence diagrams in an efficient way. Second, we propose an extension of\nthe Wasserstein metric that significantly improves the geometrical stability of\nthe matching of domain-embedded persistence pairs. We show that this\ngeometrical lifting has the additional positive side-effect of improving the\nassignment matrix sparsity and therefore computing time. The global framework\nimplements a coarse-grained parallelism by computing persistence diagrams and\nfinding optimal matchings in parallel for every couple of consecutive\ntimesteps. Critical trajectories are constructed by associating successively\nmatched persistence pairs over time. Merging and splitting events are detected\nwith a geometrical threshold in a post-processing stage. Extensive experiments\non real-life datasets show that our matching approach is an order of magnitude\nfaster than the seminal Munkres algorithm. Moreover, compared to a modern\napproximation method, our method provides competitive runtimes while yielding\nexact results.

Moreover, if the sufficient criterion applies to one plane\ntriangulation, then all embeddings of the underlying planar graph are also\narea-universal. Until now, it is open whether area-universality is a property\nof a plane or planar graph.\n  We use the developed machinery to present area-universal families of\ntriangulations. Among them we characterize area-universality of accordion\ngraphs showing that area-universal and non-area-universal graphs may be\nstructural very similar.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 17:44:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2018 11:56:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kleist", "Linda", ""]]}]
