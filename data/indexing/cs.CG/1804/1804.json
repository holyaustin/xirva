In this paper, we develop theoretical\nfoundations for this approach. First, we present a novel formulation of the\nunderlying inference problem. Specifically, we introduce and study the novelty\nprofile, a simple, stable statistic of an evolutionary history which not only\ncounts recombination events but also quantifies how recombination creates\ngenetic diversity. We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the\ntopological approach to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We\nthen study the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the novelty profile using\nbarcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary\nhistory can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree,\nwhich differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in\nthis regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the $1^\\mathrm{st}$ barcode\nyields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of\nrecombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty. In\naddition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones\nwhich hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish\nthese results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations\narising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step towards\na probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a\nfixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the\nintervals of the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ barcode are independent random variables.\nUsing simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to\nrecombination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 14:56:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:46:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lesnick", "Michael", ""], ["Rabad\u00e1n", "Ra\u00fal", ""], ["Rosenbloom", "Daniel I.

Part of the challenge in\nstudying chatter is that machining equations that describe its occurrence are\noften nonlinear delay differential equations. The majority of the available\ntools for chatter identification rely on defining a metric that captures the\ncharacteristics of chatter, and a threshold that signals its occurrence. The\ndifficulty in choosing these parameters can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing\nmachine learning techniques. However, even with a successful classification\nalgorithm, the transferability of typical machine learning methods from one\ndata set to another remains very limited. In this paper we combine supervised\nmachine learning with Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to obtain a descriptor of\nthe process which can detect chatter.

We test the approach using deterministic and stochastic\nturning models, where the stochasticity is introduced via the cutting\ncoefficient term. Our results show a 97% successful classification rate on the\ndeterministic model labeled by the stability diagram obtained using the\nspectral element method.
