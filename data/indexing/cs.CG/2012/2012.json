As clusters might contain a large number of objects,\nhaving a representative for each cluster significantly facilitates\nunderstanding a clustering. Clustering methods relying on such representatives\nare called center-based. In this work we consider the problem of center-based\nclustering of trajectories.\n  In this setting, the representative of a cluster is again a trajectory. To\nobtain a compact representation of the clusters and to avoid overfitting, we\nrestrict the complexity of the representative trajectories by a parameter l.\nThis restriction, however, makes discrete distance measures like dynamic time\nwarping (DTW) less suited.\n  There is recent work on center-based clustering of trajectories with a\ncontinuous distance measure, namely, the Fr\\'echet distance. While the\nFr\\'echet distance allows for restriction of the center complexity, it can also\nbe sensitive to outliers, whereas averaging-type distance measures, like DTW,\nare less so. To obtain a trajectory clustering algorithm that allows\nrestricting center complexity and is more robust to outliers, we propose the\nusage of a continuous version of DTW as distance measure, which we call\ncontinuous dynamic time warping (CDTW). Our contribution is twofold:\n  1. To combat the lack of practical algorithms for CDTW, we develop an\napproximation algorithm that computes it.\n  2. We develop the first clustering algorithm under this distance measure and\nshow a practical way to compute a center from a set of trajectories and\nsubsequently iteratively improve it.\n  To obtain insights into the results of clustering under CDTW on practical\ndata, we conduct extensive experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 13:17:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Brankovic", "Milutin", ""], ["Buchin", "Kevin", ""], ["Klaren", "Koen", ""], ["Nusser", "Andr\u00e9", ""], ["Popov", "Aleksandr", ""], ["Wong", "Sampson", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.00675", "submitter": "Tananun Songdechakraiwut", "authors": "Tananun Songdechakraiwut and Moo K.

In this paper, we study a variant of the\nSelf-Organizing Map (SOM) that models the phenomenon of self-organization of\nthe particles forming a string when the string is tightened from one or both\nends. The proposed variant, called the String Tightening Self-Organizing Neural\nNetwork (STON), can be used to solve certain practical problems, such as\ncomputation of shortest homotopic paths, smoothing paths to avoid sharp turns,\nand computation of convex hull. These problems are of considerable interest in\ncomputational geometry, robotics path planning, AI (diagrammatic reasoning),\nVLSI routing, and geographical information systems. Given a set of obstacles\nand a string with two fixed terminal points in a two dimensional space, the\nSTON model continuously tightens the given string until the unique shortest\nconfiguration in terms of the Euclidean metric is reached. The STON minimizes\nthe total length of a string on convergence by dynamically creating and\nselecting feature vectors in a competitive manner. Proof of correctness of this\nanytime algorithm and experimental results obtained by its deployment are\npresented in the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2020 17:33:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Feb 2021 01:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Bonny", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.06874", "submitter": "Franz J.
