These fixed-angle chains can serve as models of protein\nbackbones. The corresponding problem in 3D is open. We show that three special\ncases of particular relevance to the protein model are solvable in polynomial\ntime. When all link lengths and all angles are equal, the maximum 3D span is\nachieved in a flat configuration and can be computed in constant time. When all\nangles are equal and the chain is simple (non-self-crossing), the maximum flat\nspan can be found in linear time. In 3D, when all angles are equal to 90 deg\n(but the link lengths arbitrary), the maximum 3D span is in general nonplanar\nbut can be found in quadratic time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2008 04:17:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 12:02:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Benbernou", "Nadia", ""], ["O'Rourke", "Joseph", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0586", "submitter": "Daniel Perrucci", "authors": "Gabriela Jeronimo, Daniel Perrucci, Juan Sabia", "title": "On sign conditions over real multivariate polynomials", "comments": "extended version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AG cs.CG cs.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new probabilistic algorithm to find a finite set of points\nintersecting the closure of each connected component of the realization of\nevery sign condition over a family of real polynomials defining regular\nhypersurfaces that intersect transversally.
