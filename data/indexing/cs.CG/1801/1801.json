Here, clustering refers to the problem of\npartitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space) into k clusters,\nminimizing some objective function f. Sketching, on the other hand, is the\nproblem of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of k\npoints. Specifically, we define the k-sketch of some mm-space M to be the\nnearest neighbor of M in the set of k-point mm-spaces, under some distance\nfunction \\rho on the set of mm-spaces. In this paper, we demonstrate a duality\nbetween general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a\ngeneral method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem\nto a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal\ncost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. 1. For metric spaces,\nwe consider the case where the clustering objective is minimizing the maximum\ncluster diameter. We show that the ratio between the sketching and clustering\nobjectives is constant over compact metric spaces. 2. We extend these results\nto the setting of metric measure spaces where we prove that the ratio of\nsketching to clustering objectives is bounded both above and below by some\nuniversal constants. In this setting, the clustering objective involves\nminimizing various notions of the l_p-diameters} of the clusters. 3. We\nconsider two competing notions of sketching for mm-spaces, with one of them\nbeing more demanding than the other. These notions arise from two different\ndefinitions of p-Gromov-Wasserstein distance that have appeared in the\nliterature. We then prove that whereas the gap between these can be arbitrarily\nlarge, in the case of doubling metric spaces the resulting sketching objectives\nare polynomially related.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jan 2018 05:15:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2018 14:39:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e9moli", "Facundo", ""], ["Sidiropoulos", "Anastasios", ""], ["Singhal", "Kritika", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.01288", "submitter": "Jeanne Pellerin", "authors": "Jeanne Pellerin and Kilian Verhetsel and Jean-Francois Remacle", "title": "There are 174 Subdivisions of the Hexahedron into Tetrahedra", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Transactions On Graphics, November 2018, Volume 37, Issue 6,\n  SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 Technical Papers, Article 266", "doi": "10.1145/3272127.3275037", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article answers an important theoretical question: How many different\nsubdivisions of the hexahedron into tetrahedra are there?

In this\nparadigm, GIS software simply modify geometry and attributes of database\nlayers, and those changes are used by the database to perform automated task.\n  This new paradigm has many advantages. The first one is genericity. With\nin-base interaction, any GIS software can be used to perform edition, whatever\nthe software is a Desktop sofware or a web application.

In this context,\ndiscrete Morse theory is used to reduce the problem of computing a topological\ninvariant of an input simplicial complex to computing the same topological\ninvariant of a (significantly smaller) collapsed cell or chain complex.\nConsequently, devising methods for obtaining gradient vector fields on\ncomplexes to reduce the size of the problem instance has become an emerging\ntheme over the last decade. While computing the optimal gradient vector field\non a simplicial complex is NP-hard, several heuristics have been observed to\ncompute near-optimal gradient vector fields on a wide variety of datasets.\nUnderstanding the theoretical limits of these strategies is therefore a\nfundamental problem in computational topology. In this paper, we consider the\napproximability of maximization and minimization variants of the Morse matching\nproblem, posed as open problems by Joswig and Pfetsch. We establish hardness\nresults for Max-Morse matching and Min-Morse matching. In particular, we show\nthat, for a simplicial complex with n simplices and dimension $d \\leq 3$, it is\nNP-hard to approximate Min-Morse matching within a factor of\n$O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$, for any $\\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, using an L-reduction\nfrom Degree 3 Max-Acyclic Subgraph to Max-Morse matching, we show that it is\nboth NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate Max-Morse matching for simplicial\ncomplexes of dimension $d \\leq 2$ within certain explicit constant factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jan 2018 12:41:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2018 15:04:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Ulrich", ""], ["Rathod", "Abhishek", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.08405", "submitter": "Wacharin Wichiramala", "authors": "Wacharin Wichiramala", "title": "A smaller cover for closed unit curves", "comments": "In the appendix, the computer code for numerical optimization is\n  provided together with explanation.

By translating this sequence to a set of points in the plane, a\nrollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal\nsub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.\nGiven a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for a\nmaximum-length subsequence that is a rollercoaster. It was conjectured that\nevery sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of length\nat least $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ for $n>7$, while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n/\\log n)$. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof is\nconstructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for computing a rollercoaster\nof this length. Extending the $O(n\\log n)$-time algorithm for computing a\nlongest increasing subsequence, we show how to compute a maximum-length\nrollercoaster within the same time bound. A maximum-length rollercoaster in a\npermutation of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ can be computed in $O(n \\log \\log n)$ time.\n  The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set\nembedding of caterpillars. A caterpillar is a tree such that deleting the\nleaves gives a path, called the spine. A top-view caterpillar is one of degree\n4 such that the two leaves adjacent to each vertex lie on opposite sides of the\nspine. As an application of our result on rollercoasters, we are able to find a\nplanar drawing of every $n$-node top-view caterpillar on every set of\n$\\frac{25}{3}n$ points in the plane, such that each edge is an orthogonal path\nwith one bend. This improves the previous best known upper bound on the number\nof required points, which is $O(n \\log n)$. We also show that such a drawing\ncan be obtained in linear time, provided that the points are given in sorted\norder.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jan 2018 19:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Biedl", "Therese", ""], ["Biniaz", "Ahmad", ""], ["Cummings", "Robert", ""], ["Lubiw", "Anna", ""], ["Manea", "Florin", ""], ["Nowotka", "Dirk", ""], ["Shallit", "Jeffrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10118", "submitter": "Tiago Novello", "authors": "Joao Paixao, Joao Lagoas, Thomas Lewiner, Tiago Novello", "title": "Greedy Morse matchings and discrete smoothness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.GT cs.CG cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Discrete Morse theory emerged as an essential tool for computational geometry\nand topology.

The distance to measure\n(DTM) was introduced by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and M{\\'e}rigot in [7] to face\nthe non-robustness of the distance to a compact set to noise and outliers. This\nfunction makes possible the inference of the topology of a compact subset of R\nd from a noisy cloud of n points lying nearby in the Wasserstein sense. In\npractice, these sub-level sets may be computed using approximations of the DTM\nsuch as the q-witnessed distance [10] or other power distance [6]. These\napproaches lead eventually to compute the homology of unions of n growing\nballs, that might become intractable whenever n is large. To simultaneously\nface the two problems of large number of points and noise, we introduce the\nk-power distance to measure (k-PDTM). This new approximation of the distance to\nmeasure may be thought of as a k-coreset based approximation of the DTM. Its\nsublevel sets consist in union of k-balls, k << n, and this distance is also\nproved robust to noise. We assess the quality of this approximation for k\npossibly dramatically smaller than n, for instance k = n 1 3 is proved to be\noptimal for 2-dimensional shapes.
