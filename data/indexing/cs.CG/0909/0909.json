This is achieved\nby placing one or two contrast tags in the scene at different distances from\nthe ToF camera. The white and black parts of the tags are situated at the same\ndistance to the camera but the distances measured by the camera are different.\nThis difference is used to compute a correction vector. The distance to black\nsurfaces is corrected by subtracting this vector from the captured vector\nimage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2009 18:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Falie", "D.", ""]]}]
