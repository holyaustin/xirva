Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the\ngeometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to\nrecover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that every\n$n$-vertex graph of genus $g$ and maximum degree $d$ satisfies $\\lambda_2(G) =\nO((g+1)^3 d/n)$. This recovers the $O(d/n)$ bound of Spielman and Teng for\nplanar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of $O((g+1) poly(d)/n)$, but our\nproof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus\nable to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by\nproving that $\\lambda_2(G) = O(d h^6 \\log h/n)$ whenever $G$ is $K_h$-minor\nfree. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to\nrecover $O(\\sqrt{n})$-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a\nfixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on\n$\\lambda_2$ for graphs which exclude small-depth minors in the sense of\nPlotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find\nsmall separators in a general class of geometric graphs.\n  Moreover, while the standard \"sweep\" algorithm applied to the second\neigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree,\nour approach produces a vector that works for arbitrary graphs. This yields an\nalternate proof of the result of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that every\nexcluded-minor family of graphs has $O(\\sqrt{n})$-node balanced separators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2008 16:45:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Aug 2008 15:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Biswal", "Punyashloka", ""], ["Lee", "James R.", ""], ["Rao", "Satish", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0284", "submitter": "Ji\\v{r}\\'i Lebl", "authors": "Jiri Lebl and Daniel Lichtblau", "title": "Uniqueness of certain polynomials constant on a line", "comments": "20 pages, latex; removed section 10 and address referee suggestions;\n  accepted to Linear Algebra and its Applications", "journal-ref": "Linear Algebra and Its Applications 433 (2010) pp. 824-837", "doi": "10.1016/j.laa.2010.04.020", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CV cs.CG math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a question with connections to linear algebra, real algebraic\ngeometry, combinatorics, and complex analysis.

In this paper, we study two more challenging, yet\nequally fundamental problems.\n  Subgraph connectivity asks to maintain an understanding of connectivity under\nvertex updates: updates can turn vertices on and off, and queries refer to the\nsubgraph induced by \"on\" vertices. (For instance, this is closer to\napplications in networks of routers, where node faults may occur.)\n  We describe a data structure supporting vertex updates in O (m^{2/3})\namortized time, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This greatly\nimproves over the previous result [Chan, STOC'02], which required fast matrix\nmultiplication and had an update time of O(m^0.94). The new data structure is\nalso simpler.\n  Geometric connectivity asks to maintain a dynamic set of n geometric objects,\nand query connectivity in their intersection graph. (For instance, the\nintersection graph of balls describes connectivity in a network of sensors with\nbounded transmission radius.)\n  Previously, nontrivial fully dynamic results were known only for special\ncases like axis-parallel line segments and rectangles. We provide similarly\nimproved update times, O (n^{2/3}), for these special cases. Moreover, we show\nhow to obtain sublinear update bounds for virtually all families of geometric\nobjects which allow sublinear-time range queries, such as arbitrary 2D line\nsegments, d-dimensional simplices, and d-dimensional balls.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2008 22:16:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Timothy M.", ""], ["Patrascu", "Mihai", ""], ["Roditty", "Liam", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2931", "submitter": "Gennady Pustylnik", "authors": "Gennady Pustylnik", "title": "Spatial planning with constraints on translational distances between\n  geometric objects", "comments": "33 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main constraint on relative position of geometric objects, used in\nspatial planning for computing the C-space maps (for example, in robotics, CAD,\nand packaging), is the relative non-overlapping of objects.

Indeed, based on the a number\nof experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States\nand District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road\nnetworks are quite non-planar.

In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed\ngraphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems.\nThis approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without\nmaking any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights.
