The \\emph{untangling problem} is to eliminate all edge crossings by\nmoving as few vertices as possible to new positions. Let $fix(G)$ denote the\nmaximum number of vertices that can be left fixed in the worst case. In the\n\\emph{allocation problem}, we are given a planar graph $G$ on $n$ vertices\ntogether with an $n$-point set $X$ in the plane and have to draw $G$ without\nedge crossings so that as many vertices as possible are located in $X$. Let\n$fit(G)$ denote the maximum number of points fitting this purpose in the worst\ncase. As $fix(G)\\le fit(G)$, we are interested in upper bounds for the latter\nand lower bounds for the former parameter.\n  For each $\\epsilon>0$, we construct an infinite sequence of graphs with\n$fit(G)=O(n^{\\sigma+\\epsilon})$, where $\\sigma<0.99$ is a known graph-theoretic\nconstant, namely the shortness exponent for the class of cubic polyhedral\ngraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of graphs with\n$fit(G)=o(n)$. On the other hand, we prove that $fix(G)\\ge\\sqrt{n/30}$ for all\n$G$ with tree-width at most 2. This extends the lower bound obtained by Goaoc\net al. [Discrete and Computational Geometry 42:542-569 (2009)] for outerplanar\ngraphs.\n  Our upper bound for $fit(G)$ is based on the fact that the constructed graphs\ncan have only few collinear vertices in any crossing-free drawing. To prove the\nlower bound for $fix(G)$, we show that graphs of tree-width 2 admit drawings\nthat have large sets of collinear vertices with some additional special\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 18:01:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2008 12:17:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 09:43:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 15:18:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 11 Nov 2011 12:09:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ravsky", "Alexander", ""], ["Verbitsky", "Oleg", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0341", "submitter": "David Eppstein", "authors": "David Eppstein and Michael T.

The maximum ratio between them, over all\nfinite point configurations in $\\RR^d$, is called the {\\em star Steiner ratio}\nin $\\RR^d$. It is conjectured that this ratio is $4/\\pi = 1.2732...$ in the\nplane and $4/3=1.3333...$ in three dimensions. Here we give upper bounds of\n1.3631 in the plane, and 1.3833 in 3-space, thereby substantially improving\nrecent upper bounds of 1.3999, and $\\sqrt{2}-10^{-4}$, respectively. Our\nresults also imply improved bounds on the maximum ratios between the minimum\nstar and the maximum matching in two and three dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2008 19:46:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dumitrescu", "Adrian", ""], ["T\u00f3th", "Csaba D.", ""], ["Xu", "Guangwu", ""]]}]
