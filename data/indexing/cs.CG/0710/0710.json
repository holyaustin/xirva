We answer a question of Spillner and Wolff [arXiv:0709.0170\n2007] by closing this gap for untangling trees. In particular, we show that for\ninfinitely many values of n, there is an n-vertex geometric tree that cannot be\nuntangled while keeping more than 3(n^{1/2}-1) vertices fixed. Moreover, we\nimprove the lower bound to (n/2)^{1/2}.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2007 13:13:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2007 15:04:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Bose", "Prosenjit", ""], ["Dujmovic", "Vida", ""], ["Hurtado", "Ferran", ""], ["Langerman", "Stefan", ""], ["Morin", "Pat", ""], ["Wood", "David R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4596", "submitter": "Naoto Morikawa", "authors": "Naoto Morikawa", "title": "Discrete differential geometry of tetrahedrons and encoding of local\n  protein structure", "comments": "12 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG math.MG q-bio.BM", "license": null, "abstract": "  Local protein structure analysis is informative to protein structure analysis\nand has been used successfully in protein structure prediction and others.\nProteins have recurring structural features, such as helix caps and beta turns,\nwhich often have strong amino acid sequence preferences.
