In most real-world applications, even though the\nenvironment is 3D, the grounded sensor nodes are usually deployed on 2D planar\nsurfaces. Examples of these surfaces include structures seen in both indoor\n(e.g. floors, doors, walls, tables etc.) and outdoor (e.g. mountains, valleys,\nhills etc.) environments. In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear\nas coplanar node clusters. We refer to this type of a deployment as a planar\ndeployment. When there is a planar deployment, the coplanarity causes\ndifficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because\na node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that\nnode are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are\nrendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar. We,\ntherefore propose an algorithm called Coplanarity Based Localization (CBL) that\ncan be used as an extension of any localization algorithm to avoid most flips\ncaused by coplanarity. CBL first performs a 2D localization among the nodes\nthat are clustered on the same surface, and then finds the positions of these\nclusters in 3D. We have carried out experiments using trilateration for 2D\nlocalization, and quadrilateration for 3D localization, and experimentally\nverified that exploiting the clustering information leads to a more precise\nlocalization than mere quadrilateration.
