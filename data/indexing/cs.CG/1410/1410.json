We present complexity results as well as a negative solvability\nresult. Still, we propose two practical algorithms for AGPF with fixed light\npositions (e.g. vertex guards) independent of the fading exponent, which we\ndemonstrate to work well in practice. One is based on a discrete approximation,\nthe other on non-linear programming by means of simplex-partitioning\nstrategies. The former approach yields a fully polynomial-time approximation\nscheme for AGPF with fixed light positions. The latter approach obtains better\nresults in our experimental evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 08:59:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 11:04:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 12:16:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 13:25:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2016 12:54:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ernestus", "Maximilian", ""], ["Friedrichs", "Stephan", ""], ["Hemmer", "Michael", ""], ["Kokem\u00fcller", "Jan", ""], ["Kr\u00f6ller", "Alexander", ""], ["Moeini", "Mahdi", ""], ["Schmidt", "Christiane", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6075", "submitter": "Vinayak Prabhu", "authors": "Rupak Majumdar and Vinayak S.

For two traces, from $[0,T]$ to values in a metric space $O$,\nit measures the best match between the traces when allowed continuous bijective\ntiming distortions. Formally, it computes the infimum, over all timing\ndistortions, of the maximum of two components: the first component quantifies\nthe {\\em timing discrepancy} of the timing distortion, and the second\nquantifies the mismatch (in the metric space $O$) of the values under the\ntiming distortion. Skorokhod distances appear in various fundamental hybrid\nsystems analysis concerns: from definitions of hybrid systems semantics and\nnotions of equivalence, to practical problems such as checking the closeness of\nmodels or the quality of simulations. Despite its popularity and extensive\ntheoretical use, the \\emph{computation} problem for the Skorokhod distance\nbetween two finite sampled-time hybrid traces has remained open.\n  We address in this work the problem of computing the Skorokhod distance\nbetween two polygonal traces (these traces arise when sampled-time traces are\ncompleted by linear interpolation between sample points). We provide the first\nalgorithm to compute the exact Skorokhod distance when trace values are in\n$\\reals^n$ for the $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_{\\infty}$ norms. Our algorithm, based\non a reduction to Frechet distances, is fully polynomial-time, and incorporates\nnovel polynomial-time procedures for a set of geometric primitives in\n$\\reals^n$ over the three norms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 15:31:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Majumdar", "Rupak", ""], ["Prabhu", "Vinayak S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6520", "submitter": "Jason S.
