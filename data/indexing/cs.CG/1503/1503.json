The polygonal TAM is an extension of Winfree's abstract tile assembly\nmodel (aTAM) which not only allows for square tiles (as in the aTAM) but also\nallows for tile shapes that are polygons. Although a number of self-assembly\nresults have shown computational universality at temperature 1, these are the\nfirst results to do so by fundamentally relying on tile placements in\ncontinuous, rather than discrete, space. With the square tiles of the aTAM, it\nis conjectured that the class of temperature 1 systems is not computationally\nuniversal. Here we show that the class of systems whose tiles are composed of a\nregular polygon P with n > 6 sides is computationally universal.
