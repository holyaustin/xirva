A rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of\neach region is equal to a pre-specified weight of the corresponding vertex. The\ncomplexity of a cartogram is determined by the maximum number of corners (or\nsides) required for any polygon. In a series of papers the polygonal complexity\nof such representations for maximal planar graphs has been reduced from the\ninitial 40 to 34, then to 12 and very recently to the currently best known 10.\nHere we describe a construction with 8-sided polygons, which is optimal in\nterms of polygonal complexity as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary.\nSpecifically, we show how to compute the combinatorial structure and how to\nrefine the representation into an area-universal rectangular layout in linear\ntime. The exact cartogram can be computed from the area-universal rectangular\nlayout with numerical iteration, or can be approximated with a hill-climbing\nheuristic.\n  We also describe an alternative construction for Hamiltonian maximal planar\ngraphs, which allows us to directly compute the cartograms in linear time.\nMoreover, we prove that even for Hamiltonian graphs 8-sided rectilinear\npolygons are necessary, by constructing a non-trivial lower bound example. The\ncomplexity of the cartograms can be reduced to 6 if the Hamiltonian path has\nthe extra property that it is one-legged, as in outer-planar graphs. Thus, we\nhave optimal representations (in terms of both polygonal complexity and running\ntime) for Hamiltonian maximal planar and maximal outer-planar graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 05:44:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "Md.

The method consists in constructing mappings\nfrom triangles in a background mesh to curvilinear ones that conform exactly to\nthe immersed domain. Constructing such a map relies on a novel way of\nparameterizing the immersed boundary over a collection of nearby edges with its\nclosest point projection. By interpolating the mappings to curvilinear\ntriangles at select points, we recover isoparametric mappings for the immersed\ndomain defined over the background mesh. Indeed, interpolating the constructed\nmappings just at the vertices of the background mesh yields a fast meshing\nalgorithm that involves only perturbing a few vertices near the boundary.\n  For the discretization of a curved domain to be robust, we have to impose\nrestrictions on the background mesh. Conversely, these restrictions define a\nfamily of domains that can be discretized with a given background mesh. We then\nsay that the background mesh is a universal mesh for such a family of domains.\nThe notion of universal meshes is particularly useful in free/moving boundary\nproblems because the same background mesh can serve as the universal mesh for\nthe evolving domain for time intervals that are independent of the time step.\nHence it facilitates a framework for finite element calculations over evolving\ndomains while using a fixed background mesh. Furthermore, since the evolving\ngeometry can be approximated with any desired order, numerical solutions can be\ncomputed with high-order accuracy.

The data structure and vector math package can be extended to support\nan arbitrary number of Euclidean spatial dimensions.\n  A model in 4-space is described by its bounding pure simplicial 3-complex. By\nintersecting a 3-flat with this 3-manifold, the algorithm will extract the\nrequested closed pure simplicial 2-complex surface enclosing the desired 3D\nslice.

In\nthis paper we make a significant technical step towards this goal: we show that\nthe Eilenberg-MacLane space K(Z,1), represented as a simplicial group, can be\nequipped with polynomial-time homology (this is a polynomial-time version of\neffective homology considered in previous works of the third author and\nco-workers). To this end, we construct a suitable discrete vector field, in the\nsense of Forman's discrete Morse theory, on K(Z,1). The construction is purely\ncombinatorial and it can be understood as a certain procedure for reducing\nfinite sequences of integers, without any reference to topology.The\nEilenberg-MacLane spaces are the basic building blocks in a Postnikov system,\nwhich is a \"layered\" representation of a topological space suitable for\nhomotopy-theoretic computations.\n  Employing the result of this paper together with some other results on\npolynomial-time homology, in another paper we obtain, for every fixed k, a\npolynomial-time algorithm for computing the k-th homotopy group pi_k(X) of a\ngiven simply connected space X, as well as the first k stages of a Postnikov\nsystem for X, and also a polynomial-time version of the algorithm of Cadek et\nal. mentioned above.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 14:24:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 20:37:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 12 May 2013 10:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Krcal", "Marek", ""], ["Matousek", "Jiri", ""], ["Sergeraert", "Francis", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6530", "submitter": "Purushottam Kar", "authors": "Purushottam Kar and Harish Karnick", "title": "Random Feature Maps for Dot Product Kernels", "comments": "To appear in the proceedings of the 15th International Conference on\n  Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2012).
