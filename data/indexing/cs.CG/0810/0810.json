The present work explores the trade-off between query time\nand preprocessing space for these quantities in 2D: exactly, in the approximate\ndeterministic, and in the probabilistic sense. We deduce the EXISTENCE of an\nO(m^2/n^2) space data structure for S that, given p and time O(log n), allows\nto approximate the ratio of occluded segments up to arbitrary constant absolute\nerror; here m denotes the size of the Visibility Graph--which may be quadratic,\nbut typically is just linear in the size n of the scene S. On the other hand,\nwe present a data structure CONSTRUCTIBLE in O(n*log(n)+m^2*polylog(n)/k)\npreprocessing time and space with similar approximation properties and query\ntime O(k*polylog n), where k<n is an arbitrary parameter. We describe an\nimplementation of this approach and demonstrate the practical benefit of the\nparameter k to trade memory for query time in an empirical evaluation on three\nclasses of benchmark scenes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2008 01:53:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Oct 2008 02:43:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2009 09:51:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Fischer", "Matthias", ""], ["Hilbig", "Matthias", ""], ["J\u00e4hn", "Claudius", ""], ["der Heide", "Friedhelm Meyer auf", ""], ["Ziegler", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1997", "submitter": "Heping Gao", "authors": "Heping Gao, Meera Sitharam", "title": "Characterizing 1-Dof Henneberg-I graphs with efficient configuration\n  spaces", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.RO cs.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We define and study exact, efficient representations of realization spaces of\na natural class of underconstrained 2D Euclidean Distance Constraint\nSystems(EDCS) or Frameworks based on 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs. Each\nrepresentation corresponds to a choice of parameters and yields a different\nparametrized configuration space. Our notion of efficiency is based on the\nalgebraic complexities of sampling the configuration space and of obtaining a\nrealization from the sample (parametrized) configuration. Significantly, we\ngive purely combinatorial characterizations that capture (i) the class of\ngraphs that have efficient configuration spaces and (ii) the possible choices\nof representation parameters that yield efficient configuration spaces for a\ngiven graph. Our results automatically yield an efficient algorithm for\nsampling realizations, without missing extreme or boundary realizations. In\naddition, our results formally show that our definition of efficient\nconfiguration space is robust and that our characterizations are tight. We\nchoose the class of 1-dof Henneberg-I graphs in order to take the next step in\na systematic and graded program of combinatorial characterizations of efficient\nconfiguration spaces. In particular, the results presented here are the first\ncharacterizations that go beyond graphs that have connected and convex\nconfiguration spaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Oct 2008 20:17:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Nov 2008 03:48:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Heping", ""], ["Sitharam", "Meera", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4423", "submitter": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica", "authors": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica", "title": "Efficient Algorithmic Techniques for Several Multidimensional Geometric\n  Data Management and Analysis Problems", "comments": "The algorithmic techniques presented in this paper were later used by\n  the author in developing solutions for algorithmic tasks in several contests\n  in which the author participated (see the attached zip archive for some\n  examples of task statements and solutions).
