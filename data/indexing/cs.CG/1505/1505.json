In the foreseeable future, cars will have the\nability to communicate with one another in order to better coordinate their\nmotion. This motivates a number of interesting algorithmic problems. One of the\nmost challenging aspects of traffic coordination involves traffic\nintersections. In this paper we consider two formulations of a simple and\nfundamental geometric optimization problem involving coordinating the motion of\nvehicles through an intersection.\n  We are given a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit\nlength line segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or\nvertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described by a\nstart and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question is whether,\nsubject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free motion plan so that\neach vehicle travels from its start position to its goal position prior to its\ndeadline.\n  We present three results. We begin by showing that this problem is\nNP-complete with a reduction from 3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained\nversion in which cars traveling horizontally can alter their speeds while cars\ntraveling vertically cannot.
