We provide several\ncounterexamples and a definition (due to Bubenik and Scott\n\\cite{categorification}) we feel should be preferred and under which the\ncritical value lemma does indeed hold. One of the counterexamples we have found\nis a height function on a compact smooth manifold. In the end we prove that,\ndespite all this, a modified version of the critical value lemma remains valid\nunder the original definition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 02:11:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Govc", "Dejan", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7154", "submitter": "Karl Bringmann", "authors": "Karl Bringmann", "title": "Bringing Order to Special Cases of Klee's Measure Problem", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Klee's Measure Problem (KMP) asks for the volume of the union of n\naxis-aligned boxes in d-space. Omitting logarithmic factors, the best algorithm\nhas runtime O*(n^{d/2}) [Overmars,Yap'91]. There are faster algorithms known\nfor several special cases: Cube-KMP (where all boxes are cubes), Unitcube-KMP\n(where all boxes are cubes of equal side length), Hypervolume (where all boxes\nshare a vertex), and k-Grounded (where the projection onto the first k\ndimensions is a Hypervolume instance).\n  In this paper we bring some order to these special cases by providing\nreductions among them. In addition to the trivial inclusions, we establish\nHypervolume as the easiest of these special cases, and show that the runtimes\nof Unitcube-KMP and Cube-KMP are polynomially related. More importantly, we\nshow that any algorithm for one of the special cases with runtime T(n,d)\nimplies an algorithm for the general case with runtime T(n,2d), yielding the\nfirst non-trivial relation between KMP and its special cases. This allows to\ntransfer W[1]-hardness of KMP to all special cases, proving that no n^{o(d)}\nalgorithm exists for any of the special cases under reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions. Furthermore, assuming that there is no improved\nalgorithm for the general case of KMP (no algorithm with runtime O(n^{d/2 -\neps})) this reduction shows that there is no algorithm with runtime\nO(n^{floor(d/2)/2 - eps}) for any of the special cases. Under the same\nassumption we show a tight lower bound for a recent algorithm for 2-Grounded\n[Yildiz,Suri'12].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 07:57:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 18:57:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bringmann", "Karl", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7512", "submitter": "Haitao Wang", "authors": "Danny Z.
