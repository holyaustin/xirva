More precisely, we give the first randomized\nEPTAS and deterministic PTAS for Maximum Clique in unit ball graphs. Our\napproximation algorithm also works on disk graphs with arbitrary radii. Almost\nthree decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found for Maximum\nClique on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson; Discrete Mathematics\n'90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question whether or not\ntractability can be extended to general disk graphs. Recently, it was shown\nthat the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk\ngraph [Bonnet, Giannopoulos, Kim, Rz\\k{a}\\.{z}ewski, Sikora; SoCG '18]. This\nenabled the authors to derive a QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm for Max\nClique on disk graphs. In this paper, we improve the approximability to a\nrandomized EPTAS (and a deterministic PTAS). More precisely, we obtain a\nrandomized EPTAS for computing the independence number on graphs having no\ndisjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph, bounded VC-dimension,\nand large independence number. We then address the question of computing Max\nClique for disks in higher dimensions. We show that intersection graphs of unit\nballs, like disk graphs, do not admit the complement of two odd cycles as an\ninduced subgraph. This, in combination with the first result, straightforwardly\nyields a randomized EPTAS for Max Clique on unit ball graphs. In stark\ncontrast, we show that on ball and unit 4-dimensional disk graphs, Max Clique\nis NP-hard and does not admit an approximation scheme even in\nsubexponential-time, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Mar 2018 18:32:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Apr 2018 16:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bonamy", "Marthe", ""], ["Bonnet", "\u00c9douard", ""], ["Bousquet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Charbit", "Pierre", ""], ["Thomass\u00e9", "St\u00e9phan", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.01931", "submitter": "Petr Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y", "authors": "Zden\\v{e}k Dvo\\v{r}\\'ak, Petr Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y, Bojan Mohar", "title": "Structure and generation of crossing-critical graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study c-crossing-critical graphs, which are the minimal graphs that\nrequire at least c edge-crossings when drawn in the plane.

In this paper, we give a construction algorithm with O( n+m(\nlog m+ log^2 n) ) time, and it is nearly optimal in the sense that if a single\nVoronoi vertex can be computed in O( log n ) time, then the construction time\nwill become the optimal O( n+m log m ). In other words, we reduce the problem\nof constructing the diagram in the optimal time to the problem of computing a\nsingle Voronoi vertex in O( log n ) time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2018 14:32:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chih-Hung", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03550", "submitter": "Lionov Wiratma", "authors": "Marc van Kreveld, Maarten L\\\"offler, Lionov Wiratma", "title": "On Optimal Polyline Simplification using the Hausdorff and Fr\\'echet\n  Distance", "comments": "Full version of the SoCG2018 paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We revisit the classical polygonal line simplification problem and study it\nusing the Hausdorff distance and Fr\\'echet distance.

The main results of this paper include two algorithms. The first\none is an optimal algorithm that takes $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ for computing the\nplanar spherical depth, and the second algorithm with the time complexity of\n$O(n^{\\frac{3}{2}+\\epsilon})$ is for computing the planar $\\beta$-skeleton\ndepth, $\\beta >1$. By reducing the problem of \\textit{Element Uniqueness}, we\nprove that computing the $\\beta$-skeleton depth requires $\\Omega(n \\log n)$\ntime. Some geometric properties of $\\beta$-skeleton depth are also investigated\nin this paper. These properties indicate that \\emph{simplicial depth} ($\\SD$)\nis linearly bounded by $\\beta$-skeleton depth. Some experimental bounds for\ndifferent depth functions are also obtained in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:40:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Shahsavarifar", "Rasoul", ""], ["Bremner", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06078", "submitter": "Ahmed Abdelkader", "authors": "Ahmed Abdelkader, Chandrajit L.

The study of Gromov hyperbolicity for geodesic metric spaces can be\nreduced to the study of graph hyperbolicity. The main contribution of this\npaper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This\ncharacterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale\nnetwork analysis. A sharp estimate of graph hyperbolicity is useful, e.g., in\nembedding an undirected graph into hyperbolic space with minimum distortion\n[Verbeek and Suri, SoCG'14].

Using our new characterization of graph hyperbolicity, we provide a\nsimple factor 8 approximation algorithm for computing the hyperbolicity of an\n$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ in optimal time $O(n^2)$ (assuming that the input is\nthe distance matrix of the graph). This algorithm leads to constant factor\napproximations of other graph-parameters related to hyperbolicity (thinness,\nslimness, and insize).

Our starting point is\nLinial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability\nis equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are\ninstances of Maximum Section of a Covering Space on graphs. We then observe\nthat the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell,\nFOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We\nfurther prove that inapproximability for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on\n(cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent to the Unique\nGames Conjecture. This gives the first new \"Unique Games-complete\" problem in\nover a decade.\n  Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA\n2010; Disc. Comput. Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that\ntheir question is almost equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main\ndifference is that they ask for inapproximability over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/k\\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact\nthat when the structure group $G$ of the covering space is Abelian - or more\ngenerally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering Space\nis the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization.\n  Although our most technically demanding result is an application of Unique\nGames to computational topology, we hope that our observations on the\ntopological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of\nalgebraic topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 04:15:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Grochow", "Joshua A.", ""], ["Tucker-Foltz", "Jamie", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06875", "submitter": "Arijit Ghosh", "authors": "Arijit Bishnu, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra and Sandeep Sen", "title": "On the streaming complexity of fundamental geometric problems", "comments": "23 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus on lower bounds and algorithms for some basic\ngeometric problems in the one-pass (insertion only) streaming model.

We show that bishellability implies seq-shellability and exhibit a\nnon-bishellable but seq-shellable drawing of $K_{11}$, therefore the class of\nseq-shellable drawings strictly contains the class of bishellable drawings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Mutzel", "Petra", ""], ["Oettershagen", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.07609", "submitter": "Anastasios Stefanou", "authors": "Elizabeth Munch, Anastasios Stefanou", "title": "The $\\ell^\\infty$-Cophenetic Metric for Phylogenetic Trees as an\n  Interleaving Distance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.CT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are many metrics available to compare phylogenetic trees since this is\na fundamental task in computational biology.
