More\nimportantly, we show that more complex queries and input curves lead to\nadditional logarithmic factors in the lower bound. Roughly speaking, the number\nof logarithmic factors added is linear in the number of edges added to the\nquery and input curve complexity.

This is especially the case when dealing with\ntextual data. Recent studies in machine learning, information theory and\nnetwork science have developed several novel instruments to extract the\nsemantics of unstructured data, and harness it to build a network of relations.\nSuch approaches serve as an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction and\npattern detection. This paper applies semantic network science to extract\nideological proximity in the international arena, by focusing on the data from\nGeneral Debates in the UN General Assembly on the topics of high salience to\ninternational community. UN General Debate corpus (UNGDC) covers all high-level\ndebates in the UN General Assembly from 1970 to 2014, covering all UN member\nstates. The research proceeds in three main steps. First, Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) is used to extract the topics of the UN speeches, and\ntherefore semantic information. Each country is then assigned a vector\nspecifying the exposure to each of the topics identified. This intermediate\noutput is then used in to construct a network of countries based on information\ntheoretical metrics where the links capture similar vectorial patterns in the\ntopic distributions. Topology of the networks is then analyzed through network\nproperties like density, path length and clustering. Finally, we identify\nspecific topological features of our networks using the map equation framework\nto detect communities in our networks of countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 10:09:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gurciullo", "Stefano", ""], ["Mikhaylov", "Slava", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09504", "submitter": "Arash Vaezi", "authors": "Arash Vaezi, Bodhayan Roy, Mohammad Ghodsi, Anil Maheshwari", "title": "Expanding Visibility Polygons by Mirrors upto at least K units", "comments": "The writing is not well and I should rewrite the paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider extending visibility polygon $(VP)$ of a given point $q$\n$(VP(q))$, inside a simple polygon $\\P$ by converting some edges of $\\P$ to\nmirrors. We will show that several variations of the problem of finding\nmirror-edges to add at least $k$ units of area to $VP(q)$ are NP-complete, or\nNP-hard. Which $k$ is a given value.\n  We deal with both single and multiple reflecting mirrors, and also specular\nor diffuse types of reflections.\n  In specular reflection, a single incoming direction is reflected into a\nsingle outgoing direction. In this paper diffuse reflection is regarded as\nreflecting lights at all possible angles from a given surface.\n  The paper deals with finding mirror-edges to add \\emph{at least} $k$ units of\narea to $VP(q)$. In the case of specular type of reflections we only consider\nsingle reflections, and the multiple case is still open.\n  Specular case of the problem is more tricky. We construct a simple polygon\nfor every given instance of a 3-SAT problem. There are some specific spikes\nwhich are visible only by some particular mirror-edges. Consequently, to have\nminimum number of mirror-edges it is required to choose only one of these\nmirrors to see a particular spike. There is a reduction polygon which contains\na clause-gadget corresponding to every clause, and a variable-gadget\ncorresponding to every variable.\n  3-SAT formula has $n$ variables and $m$ clauses, so the minimum number of\nmirrors required to add an area of at least $k$ to $V P(q)$ is $l = 3m+n+1$ if\nand only if the 3-SAT formula is satisfiable.\n  This reduction works in these two cases: adding at least $k$ vertex of $\\P$\nto $VP(q)$, and expanding $VP(q)$ at least $k$ units of area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 12:25:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 09:33:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Vaezi", "Arash", ""], ["Roy", "Bodhayan", ""], ["Ghodsi", "Mohammad", ""], ["Maheshwari", "Anil", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09904", "submitter": "Alfred Rossi", "authors": "Tamal K.
