In fact, the number of ways in which this may be done ranges from\nzero to infinite, depending on what properties of the Hilbert curve one\nconsiders to be essential.\n  In this work we take the point of view that a Hilbert curve should at least\nbe self-similar and traverse cubes octant by octant. We organize and explore\nthe space of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves and the potentially\nuseful properties which they may have. We discuss a notation system that allows\nus to distinguish the curves from one another and enumerate them. This system\nhas been implemented in a software prototype, available from the author's\nwebsite. Several examples of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves are\npresented, including a curve that visits the points on most sides of the unit\ncube in the order of the two-dimensional Hilbert curve; curves of which not\nonly the eight octants are similar to each other, but also the four quarters; a\ncurve with excellent locality-preserving properties and endpoints that are not\nvertices of the cube; a curve in which all but two octants are each other's\nimages with respect to reflections in axis-parallel planes; and curves that can\nbe sketched on a grid without using vertical line segments.

In particular, we show that\nprescribing an edge potential on a graph is equivalent to specifying an\nequivalence class of flat principal bundles, of which the triviality of\nholonomy dictates the synchronizability of the edge potential. We then develop\na twisted cohomology theory for associated vector bundles of the flat principal\nbundle arising from an edge potential, which is a discrete version of the\ntwisted cohomology in differential geometry. This theory realizes the\nobstruction to synchronizability as a cohomology group of the twisted de Rham\ncochain complex. We then build a discrete twisted Hodge theory --- a fibre\nbundle analog of the discrete Hodge theory on graphs --- which geometrically\nrealizes the graph connection Laplacian as a Hodge Laplacian of degree zero.\nMotivated by our geometric framework, we study the problem of learning group\nactions --- partitioning a collection of objects based on the local\nsynchronizability of pairwise correspondence relations.

As PETSc is already widely used, this will\nmake anisotropic mesh adaptation available to a much larger community.

A\nbarcode is simply a multiset of real intervals. Recent work of Edelsbrunner,\nJablonski, and Mrozek suggests an equivalent description of barcodes as\nfunctors R -> Mch, where R is the poset category of real numbers and Mch is the\ncategory whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are matchings (i.e.,\npartial injective functions). Such functors form a category Mch^R whose\nmorphisms are the natural transformations. Thus, this interpretation of\nbarcodes gives us a hitherto unstudied categorical structure on barcodes.
