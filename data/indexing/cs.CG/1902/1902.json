Starting with the\ncelebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, such reductions have been studied in\ndepth for the Euclidean $(\\ell_2)$ metric, but much less for the Manhattan\n$(\\ell_1)$ metric. Our primary motivation is the approximate nearest neighbor\nproblem in $\\ell_1$. We exploit its reduction to the decision-with-witness\nversion, called approximate \\textit{near} neighbor, which incurs a roughly\nlogarithmic overhead. In 2007, Indyk and Naor, in the context of approximate\nnearest neighbors, introduced the notion of nearest neighbor-preserving\nembeddings. These are randomized embeddings between two metric spaces with\nguaranteed bounded distortion only for the distances between a query point and\na point set. Such embeddings are known to exist for both $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_1$\nmetrics, as well as for doubling subsets of $\\ell_2$. The case that remained\nopen were doubling subsets of $\\ell_1$. In this paper, we propose a dimension\nreduction by means of a \\textit{near} neighbor-preserving embedding for\ndoubling subsets of $\\ell_1$. Our approach is to represent the pointset with a\ncarefully chosen covering set, then randomly project the latter. We study two\ntypes of covering sets: $c$-approximate $r$-nets and randomly shifted grids,\nand we discuss the tradeoff between them in terms of preprocessing time and\ntarget dimension.
