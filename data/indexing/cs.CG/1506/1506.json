We show that the result follows directly from\nstructural properties of local feature size of the Riemannian submanifold and\nsome elementary Euclidean geometry. We also show that using the tangent\nvariation result one can prove a new structural property of local feature size\nfunction. This structural property is a generalization of a result of Giesen\nand Wagner [GW04, Lem. 7].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Jun 2015 10:56:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 Oct 2015 19:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Boissonnat", "Jean-Daniel", ""], ["Dyer", "Ramsay", ""], ["Ghosh", "Arijit", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.06440", "submitter": "Oliver Knill", "authors": "Oliver Knill", "title": "The Jordan-Brouwer theorem for graphs", "comments": "26 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CG math.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove a discrete Jordan-Brouwer-Schoenflies separation theorem telling\nthat a (d-1)-sphere H embedded in a d-sphere G defines two different connected\ngraphs A,B in G such a way that the intersection of A and B is H and the union\nis G and such that the complementary graphs A,B are both d-balls. The graph\ntheoretic definitions are due to Evako: the unit sphere of a vertex x of a\ngraph G=(V,E) is the graph generated by {y | (x,y) in E} Inductively, a finite\nsimple graph is called contractible if there is a vertex x such that both its\nunit sphere S(x) as well as the graph generated by V-{x} are contractible.\nInductively, still following Evako, a d-sphere is a finite simple graph for\nwhich every unit sphere is a (d-1)-sphere and such that removing a single\nvertex renders the graph contractible. A d-ball B is a contractible graph for\nwhich each unit sphere S(x) is either a (d-1)-sphere in which case x is called\nan interior point, or S(x) is a (d-1)-ball in which case x is called a boundary\npoint and such that the set of boundary point vertices generates a\n(d-1)-sphere. These inductive definitions are based on the assumption that the\nempty graph is the unique (-1)-sphere and that the one-point graph K_1 is the\nunique 0-ball and that K_1 is contractible. The theorem needs the following\nnotion of embedding: a sphere H is embedded in a graph G if it is a sub-graph\nof G and if any intersection with any finite set of mutually adjacent unit\nspheres is a sphere. A knot of co-dimension k in G is a (d-k)-sphere H embedded\nin a d-sphere G.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 01:52:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Knill", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.07246", "submitter": "Martin Derka", "authors": "Therese Biedl, Martin Derka", "title": "$1$-String $B_1$-VPG Representations of Planar Partial $3$-Trees and\n  Some Subclasses", "comments": "To appear at the 27th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry,\n  Kingston, Ontario, August 10--12, 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Planar partial $3$-trees are subgraphs of those planar graphs obtained by\nrepeatedly inserting a vertex of degree $3$ into a face.

The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and\nfascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and\nnew algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a\nrapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and\ncomputational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and\n(2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation\nof PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the\ncomputation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of\nsynthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source\nimplementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we\nindicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different\ntypes of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the\ncomputation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the\ntutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in\nthe benchmarking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 00:00:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 12:40:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2015 13:03:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 12:47:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 00:48:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 21:08:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:10:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Otter", "Nina", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Tillmann", "Ulrike", ""], ["Grindrod", "Peter", ""], ["Harrington", "Heather A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.09061", "submitter": "Darryl Hill", "authors": "Prosenjit Bose, Darryl Hill, and Michiel Smid", "title": "Improved Spanning Ratio for Low Degree Plane Spanners", "comments": "39 pages, appendix has been integrated into the main paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe an algorithm that builds a plane spanner with a maximum degree of\n8 and a spanning ratio of approximately 4.414 with respect to the complete\ngraph.
