It is based on a watershed technique and uses a probability\npropagation scheme to improve the quality of the segmentation by circumventing\nthe discreteness of the sampling. It can be applied within spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions and geometry. This recursive segmentation of space yields, for a\n$d$-dimensional space, a $d-1$ succession of $n$-dimensional subspaces that\nfully characterize the topology of the density field. The final 1D manifold of\nthe hierarchy is the fully connected network of the primary critical lines of\nthe field : the skeleton. It corresponds to the subset of lines linking maxima\nto saddle points, and provides a definition of the filaments that compose the\ncosmic web as a precise physical object, which makes it possible to compute any\nof its properties such as its length, curvature, connectivity etc... When the\nskeleton extraction is applied to initial conditions of cosmological N-body\nsimulations and their present day non linear counterparts, it is shown that the\ntime evolution of the cosmic web, as traced by the skeleton, is well accounted\nfor by the Zel'dovich approximation. Comparing this skeleton to the initial\nskeleton undergoing the Zel'dovich mapping shows that two effects are competing\nduring the formation of the cosmic web: a general dilation of the larger\nfilaments that is captured by a simple deformation of the skeleton of the\ninitial conditions on the one hand, and the shrinking, fusion and disappearance\nof the more numerous smaller filaments on the other hand.
