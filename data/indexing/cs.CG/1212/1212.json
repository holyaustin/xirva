In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to\nfill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 10:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lui", "Lok Ming", ""], ["Wen", "Chengfeng", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1094", "submitter": "Daniel Reem", "authors": "Daniel Reem", "title": "The geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams in normed spaces which are\n  not uniformly convex", "comments": "29 pages; 10 figures; Sections 1,4,5, the abstract, and the\n  bibliography section were modified (mainly extended); a few typos were\n  corrected; added a section about topological properties of Voronoi cells", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.FA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Voronoi diagram is a geometric object which is widely used in many areas.\nRecently it has been shown that under mild conditions Voronoi diagrams have a\ncertain continuity property: small perturbations of the sites yield small\nperturbations in the shapes of the corresponding Voronoi cells.
