Zonohedra are an important\nsubclass of convex polyhedra having the property that the faces of a zonohedron\nare parallelograms and are in parallel pairs. In this paper we give\ncharacterization of graphs of zonohedra. We also give a linear time algorithm\nto recognize such a graph. In our quest for finding the algorithm, we prove\nthat in a zonohedron P both the number of zones and the number of faces in each\nzone is O(square root{n}), where n is the number of vertices of P.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2008 10:19:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Adnan", "Muhammad Abdullah", ""], ["Hasan", "Masud", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.1365", "submitter": "Don Shimamoto", "authors": "Don Shimamoto, Mary Wootters", "title": "Configuration spaces of convex and embedded polygons in the plane", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the configuration spaces of linkages whose underlying\ngraph is a single cycle.

Furthermore, we point\nout the weakened tolerance by geographical constraints on local cycles, and\npropose a practical strategy by adding a small fraction of shortcut links\nbetween randomly chosen nodes in order to improve the robustness to a similar\nlevel to that of the optimal bimodal networks with a larger degree\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ for the network size $N$.

The\ngeneration of the axial lines has been a key aspect of space syntax research,\nconventionally relying on hand-drawn axial lines of an urban environment, often\ncalled axial map, for urban morphological analysis. Although various attempts\nhave been made towards an automatic solution, few of them can produce the axial\nmap that consists of the least number of longest visibility lines, and none of\nthem really works for different urban environments. Our algorithms provide a\nbetter solution than existing ones.
