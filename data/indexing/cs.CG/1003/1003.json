Natural roads\nare joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This\napproach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road\nsegments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived\nroutes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the\nroutes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as\npossible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,\nbecause they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the\nroutes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the\nconnectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road\nsegments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North\nAmerica and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The\nexperimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns\nand shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google\nMaps. For example, the fewest-turn-and-shortest routes are on average 15%\nshorter than the routes suggested by Google Maps, while the number of turns is\njust half as much.
