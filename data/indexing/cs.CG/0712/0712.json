The technique has been researched\nextensively for full dimensional triangulations of point sets. However, an\nimportant case of triangulations which are not full dimensional is surface\ntriangulations in three dimensions. In this paper we address the question of\nconverting a surface triangulation to a subcomplex of the Delaunay\ntriangulation with edge flips. We show that the surface triangulations which\nclosely approximate a smooth surface with uniform density can be transformed to\na Delaunay triangulation with a simple edge flip algorithm. The condition on\nuniformity becomes less stringent with increasing density of the triangulation.\nIf the condition is dropped completely, the flip algorithm still terminates\nalthough the output surface triangulation becomes \"almost Delaunay\" instead of\nexactly Delaunay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 15:45:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Siu-Wing", ""], ["Dey", "Tamal K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2094", "submitter": "Zachary Abel", "authors": "Timothy G.

Our result generalizes and indeed\nbuilds upon the result from 1814 that polygons have common dissections (without\nhinges). We also extend our common dissection result to edge-hinged dissections\nof solid 3D polyhedra that have a common (unhinged) dissection, as determined\nby Dehn's 1900 solution to Hilbert's Third Problem. Our proofs are\nconstructive, giving explicit algorithms in all cases. For a constant number of\nplanar polygons, both the number of pieces and running time required by our\nconstruction are pseudopolynomial. This bound is the best possible, even for\nunhinged dissections.

However, the complexities\nof these methods scale up exponentially with d, which makes them impractical in\nmedium or high dimensions, even for handling low-dimensional submanifolds. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach that stands in-between classical\nreconstruction and topological estimation, and whose complexity scales up with\nthe intrinsic dimension of the data. Specifically, when the data points are\nsufficiently densely sampled from a smooth $m$-submanifold of $\\R^d$, our\nmethod retrieves the homology of the submanifold in time at most $c(m)n^5$,\nwhere $n$ is the size of the input and $c(m)$ is a constant depending solely on\n$m$. It can also provably well handle a wide range of compact subsets of\n$\\R^d$, though with worse complexities.

This line of\nresearch has not only enhanced our understanding of finite metrics, but has\nalso resulted in many algorithmic applications. However, we still do not\nunderstand the interaction between various graph-theoretic (topological)\nproperties of graphs, and the doubling (geometric) properties of the\nshortest-path metrics induced by them. For instance, the following natural\nquestion suggests itself: \\emph{given a finite doubling metric $(V,d)$, is\nthere always an \\underline{unweighted} graph $(V',E')$ with $V\\subseteq V'$\nsuch that the shortest path metric $d'$ on $V'$ is still doubling, and which\nagrees with $d$ on $V$.} This is often useful, given that unweighted graphs are\noften easier to reason about.\n  We show that for any metric space $(V,d)$, there is an \\emph{unweighted}\ngraph $(V',E')$ with shortest-path metric $d':V'\\times V' \\to \\R_{\\geq 0}$ such\nthat\n  -- for all $x,y \\in V$, the distances $d(x,y) \\leq d'(x,y) \\leq (1+\\eps)\n\\cdot d(x,y)$, and\n  -- the doubling dimension for $d'$ is not much more than that of $d$, where\nthis change depends only on $\\e$ and not on the size of the graph.\n  We show a similar result when both $(V,d)$ and $(V',E')$ are restricted to be\ntrees: this gives a simpler proof that doubling trees embed into constant\ndimensional Euclidean space with constant distortion.
