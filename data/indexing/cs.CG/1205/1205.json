An uncertain point\nis a point that does not have a fixed location, but rather is described by a\nprobability distribution. When these probability distributions are restricted\nto a finite number of locations, the points are called indecisive points. In\nparticular, we focus on geometric shape-fitting problems and on building\ncompact distributions to describe how the solutions to these problems vary with\nrespect to the uncertainty in the points. Our main results are: (1) a simple\nand efficient randomized approximation algorithm for calculating the\ndistribution of any statistic on uncertain data sets; (2) a polynomial,\ndeterministic and exact algorithm for computing the distribution of answers for\nany LP-type problem on an indecisive point set; and (3) the development of\nshape inclusion probability (SIP) functions which captures the ambient\ndistribution of shapes fit to uncertain or indecisive point sets and are\nadmissible to the two algorithmic constructions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 22:32:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Jorgensen", "Allan", ""], ["L\u00f6ffler", "Maarten", ""], ["Phillips", "Jeff M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0306", "submitter": "Oliver Knill", "authors": "Oliver Knill", "title": "An index formula for simple graphs", "comments": "24 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DG cs.CG math.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gauss-Bonnet for simple graphs G assures that the sum of curvatures K(x) over\nthe vertex set V of G is the Euler characteristic X(G). Poincare-Hopf tells\nthat for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know\nthat averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).\n  We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if\neach unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even\nd and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the\naverage of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.\n  We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This\nis done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2,\nwhere j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface\n{y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x). It is a subgraph of the line graph of\nG and geometric if G is geometric.\n  The index formula simplifies for geometric graphs: for even d it is j(f,x) =\n1-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is a (d-2)-dimensional graph. For odd d it becomes\nj(f,x) =-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is an odd dimensional graph. Because by\ninduction with respect to d, the X(B(f,x))=0 we know now that that j(f,x) is\nzero for all x and so, by taking expectation over f that curvature K(x) is zero\nfor all x.\n  We also point out that all these results hold almost verbatim for compact\nRiemannian manifolds and actually are much simpler there. The same integral\ngeometric index formula is valid if f is a Morse function, i(f,x) is the index\nof the gradient vector field and if S(x) is a sufficiently small geodesic\nsphere around x and B(f,x) which is S(x) intersected with the level surface {y\n| f(y)=f(x)}.

Like\nthe previous version, the data structure supports modifications of the\nsubdivision, such as insertions and deletions of edges, after the initial\npreprocessing. A major challenge is to retain the expected O(n log n)\npreprocessing time while providing the above (deterministic) space and\nquery-time guarantees. We describe an efficient preprocessing algorithm, which\nexplicitly verifies the length L of the longest query path in O(n log n) time.\nHowever, instead of using L, our implementation is based on the depth D of G.\nAlthough we prove that the worst case ratio of D and L is Theta(n/log n), we\nconjecture, based on our experimental results, that this solution achieves\nexpected O(n log n) preprocessing time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2012 13:31:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2012 10:07:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 23 Sep 2012 12:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hemmer", "Michael", ""], ["Kleinbort", "Michal", ""], ["Halperin", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.5691", "submitter": "Norbert Paul", "authors": "Norbert Paul", "title": "Signed Simplicial Decomposition and Overlay of n-D Polytope Complexes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Polytope complexes are the generalisation of polygon meshes in\ngeo-information systems (GIS) to arbitrary dimension, and a natural concept for\naccessing spatio-temporal information.
