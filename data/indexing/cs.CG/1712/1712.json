However, the current challenge lies in the lack of a general\nmathematical formulation that applies to objects of arbitrary shape. We propose\nthat a measure of shape complementarity can be obtained from the extent of\napproximate overlap between shape skeletons. A space-continuous implicit\ngeneralization of the skeleton, called the skeletal density function (SDF) is\ndefined over the Euclidean space that contains the individual assembly\npartners. The SDF shape descriptors capture the essential features that are\nrelevant to proper contact alignment, and are considerably more robust than the\nconventional explicit skeletal representations. We express the shape\ncomplementarity score as a convolution of the individual SDFs. The problem then\nbreaks down to a global optimization of the score over the configuration space\nof spatial relations, which can be efficiently implemented using fast Fourier\ntransforms (FFTs) on nonequispaced samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe scoring approach for several examples from 2D peg-in-hole alignment to more\ncomplex 3D examples in mechanical assembly and protein docking. We show that\nthe proposed method is reliable, inherently robust against small perturbations,\nand effective in steering gradient-based optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 09:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Behandish", "Morad", ""], ["Ilies", "Horea T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.00375", "submitter": "Arpita Baral", "authors": "Arpita Baral, Abhilash Gondane, Sanjib Sadhu, Priya Ranjan Sinha\n  Mahapatra", "title": "Maximum-width Axis-Parallel Empty Rectangular Annulus", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a set $P$ of $n$ points on $\\mathbb R^{2}$, we address the problem of\ncomputing an axis-parallel empty rectangular annulus $A$ of maximum-width such\nthat no point of $P$ lies inside $A$ but all points of $P$ must lie inside,\noutside and on the boundaries of two parallel rectangles forming the annulus\n$A$.

The problem can be generalized into the following\ngraph problem: Given a planar graph $G$ whose vertices are colored by color\nsets, two designated vertices $s, t \\in V(G)$, and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is there\nan $s$-$t$ path in $G$ that uses at most $k$ colors?

More formally, every point in $P$ is within\ndistance $\\epsilon$ from the convex hull of $S$. Such a subset $S$ is called an\n$\\epsilon$-hull. Computing an $\\epsilon$-hull is an important problem in\ncomputational geometry, machine learning, and approximation algorithms.\n  In many real world applications, the set $P$ is too large to fit in memory.\nWe consider the streaming model where the algorithm receives the points of $P$\nsequentially and strives to use a minimal amount of memory. Existing streaming\nalgorithms for computing an $\\epsilon$-hull require $O(\\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$\nspace, which is optimal for a worst-case input. However, this ignores the\nstructure of the data. The minimal size of an $\\epsilon$-hull of $P$, which we\ndenote by $\\text{OPT}$, can be much smaller. A natural question is whether a\nstreaming algorithm can compute an $\\epsilon$-hull using only $O(\\text{OPT})$\nspace.\n  We begin with lower bounds that show that it is not possible to have a\nsingle-pass streaming algorithm that computes an $\\epsilon$-hull with\n$O(\\text{OPT})$ space.
