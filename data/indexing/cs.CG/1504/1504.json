Some numerical\nmethods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are\nshown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann\nconformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the\nRiemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D\nsurfaces can be linked through the M\\\"obius transformation due to the conformal\ncharacteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface\ndeformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual\nparameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks.\nIn this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D\nsurfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the\nRiemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric\ndomains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors\nfor each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D\ndeformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and\nYau. Furthermore, by composition of the M\\\"obius transformation and the 3D\ndeformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean\ncurvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the\ncubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are\npresented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 03:27:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yueh", "Mei-Heng", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng David", ""], ["Lin", "Wen-Wei", ""], ["Wu", "Chin-Tien", ""], ["Yau", "Shing-Tung", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01076", "submitter": "Ilya Razenshteyn", "authors": "Arturs Backurs, Piotr Indyk, Eric Price, Ilya Razenshteyn, David P.\n  Woodruff", "title": "Nearly-optimal bounds for sparse recovery in generic norms, with\n  applications to $k$-median sketching", "comments": "29 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CG cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We initiate the study of trade-offs between sparsity and the number of\nmeasurements in sparse recovery schemes for generic norms.

Christ\net al. also give a characterization of CDRs in two dimensions, and they leave\nopen the question on how to characterize CDSes in two dimensions. In this\npaper, we answer the most important open question regarding CDSes in two\ndimensions by giving the characterization asked for by Christ et al. We obtain\nthe characterization by giving a set of necessary and sufficient conditions\nthat a CDS must satisfy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 21:12:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 03:55:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chowdhury", "Iffat", ""], ["Gibson", "Matt", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.07685", "submitter": "Sariel Har-Peled", "authors": "Boris Aronov, Sariel Har-Peled, Christian Knauer, Yusu Wang, Carola\n  Wenk", "title": "Fr\\'echet Distance for Curves, Revisited", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  $\\renewcommand{\\Re}{{\\rm I\\!\\hspace{-0.025em} R}}\n\\newcommand{\\eps}{{\\varepsilon}} \\newcommand{\\SetX}{\\mathsf{X}}\n\\newcommand{\\VorX}[1]{\\mathcal{V} \\pth{#1}} \\newcommand{\\Polygon}{\\mathsf{P}}\n\\newcommand{\\Space}{\\overline{\\mathsf{m}}}\n\\newcommand{\\pth}[2][\\!]{#1\\left({#2}\\right)}$ We revisit the problem of\ncomputing Fr\\'echet distance between polygonal curves under $L_1$, $L_2$, and\n$L_\\infty$ norms, focusing on discrete Fr\\'echet distance, where only distance\nbetween vertices is considered. We develop efficient algorithms for two natural\nclasses of curves. In particular, given two polygonal curves of $n$ vertices\neach, a $\\eps$-approximation of their discrete Fr\\'echet distance can be\ncomputed in roughly $O(n\\kappa^3\\log n/\\eps^3)$ time in three dimensions, if\none of the curves is \\emph{$\\kappa$-bounded}. Previously, only a\n$\\kappa$-approximation algorithm was known. If both curves are the so-called\n\\emph{\\backbone~curves}, which are widely used to model protein backbones in\nmolecular biology, we can $\\eps$-approximate their Fr\\'echet distance in near\nlinear time in two dimensions, and in roughly $O(n^{4/3}\\log nm)$ time in three\ndimensions. In the second part, we propose a pseudo--output-sensitive algorithm\nfor computing Fr\\'echet distance exactly. The complexity of the algorithm is a\nfunction of a quantity we call the \\emph{\\bwnumber{}}, which is quadratic in\nthe worst case, but tends to be much smaller in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 23:38:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Aronov", "Boris", ""], ["Har-Peled", "Sariel", ""], ["Knauer", "Christian", ""], ["Wang", "Yusu", ""], ["Wenk", "Carola", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.07883", "submitter": "Andrew Winslow", "authors": "Andrew Winslow", "title": "An Optimal Algorithm for Tiling the Plane with a Translated Polyomino", "comments": "In proceedings of ISAAC 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a $O(n)$-time algorithm for determining whether translations of a\npolyomino with $n$ edges can tile the plane.
