QCMC\ncomputes a quasi-conformal map from a multiply-connected domain $S$ onto a\npunctured disk $D_S$ associated with a given Beltrami differential. The\nBeltrami differential, which measures the conformality distortion, is a\ncomplex-valued function $\\mu:S\\to\\mathbb{C}$ with supremum norm strictly less\nthan 1. Every Beltrami differential gives a conformal structure of $S$. Hence,\nthe conformal module of $D_S$, which are the radii and centers of the inner\ncircles, can be fully determined by $\\mu$, up to a M\\\"obius transformation. In\nthis paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the\nconformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea\nis to minimize the Beltrami energy subject to the boundary constraints. The\noptimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a\npunctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain\nsimplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various\nfields, such as in computer graphics and vision.
