The coverage area of the antenna at point p is a circular\nsector of angle a and radius r, whose orientation is adjustable. For a given\norientation assignment, the induced symmetric communication graph (SCG) of P is\nthe undirected graph that contains the edge (u,v) iff v lies in u's sector and\nvice versa. In this paper we ask what is the smallest angle a for which there\nexists an integer n=n(a), such that for any set P of n antennas of angle a and\nunbounded range, one can orient the antennas so that the induced SCG is\nconnected, and the union of the corresponding wedges is the entire plane. We\nshow that the answer to this problem is a=\\pi/2, for which n=4. Moreover, we\nprove that if Q_1 and Q_2 are quadruplets of antennas of angle \\pi/2 and\nunbounded range, separated by a line, to which one applies the above\nconstruction, independently, then the induced SCG of Q_1 \\cup Q_2 is connected.\nThis latter result enables us to apply the construction locally, and to solve\nthe following two further problems.\n  In the first problem, we are given a connected unit disk graph (UDG),\ncorresponding to a set P of omni-directional antennas of range 1, and the goal\nis to replace these antennas by directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and range\nr=O(1) and to orient them, such that the induced SCG is connected, and,\nmoreover, is an O(1)-spanner of the UDG, w.r.t. hop distance. In our solution r\n= 14\\sqrt{2} and the spanning ratio is 8. In the second problem, we are given a\nset P of directional antennas of angle \\pi/2 and adjustable range. The goal is\nto assign to each antenna p, an orientation and a range r_p, such that the\nresulting SCG is connected, and \\sum_{p \\in P} r_p^\\beta is minimized, where\n\\beta \\ge 1 is a constant.

Our\napproach is output-sensitive as it makes one oracle call per vertex and facet.\nIt extends to any polytope whose oracle-based definition is advantageous, such\nas the secondary and discriminant polytopes. Our publicly available\nimplementation uses the experimental CGAL package triangulation. Our method\ncomputes 5-, 6- and 7-dimensional polytopes with 35K, 23K and 500 vertices,\nrespectively, within 2hrs, and the Newton polytopes of many important surface\nequations encountered in geometric modeling in <1sec, whereas the corresponding\nsecondary polytopes are intractable. It is faster than tropical geometry\nsoftware up to dimension 5 or 6. Hashing determinantal predicates accelerates\nexecution up to 100 times. One variant computes inner and outer approximations\nwith, respectively, 90% and 105% of the true volume, up to 25 times faster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 15:38:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 12:04:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 13:40:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 17:47:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Emiris", "Ioannis Z.", ""], ["Fisikopoulos", "Vissarion", ""], ["Konaxis", "Christos", ""], ["Pe\u00f1aranda", "Luis", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6022", "submitter": "Shay Solomon", "authors": "Shay Solomon and Michael Elkin", "title": "Balancing Degree, Diameter and Weight in Euclidean Spanners", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures; a preliminary version of this paper appeared in\n  ESA'10", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we devise a novel \\emph{unified} construction of Euclidean\nspanners that trades between the maximum degree, diameter and weight\ngracefully. For a positive integer k, our construction provides a\n(1+eps)-spanner with maximum degree O(k), diameter O(log_k n + alpha(k)),\nweight O(k \\cdot log_k n \\cdot log n) \\cdot w(MST(S)), and O(n) edges. Note\nthat for k= n^{1/alpha(n)} this gives rise to diameter O(alpha(n)), weight\nO(n^{1/alpha(n)} \\cdot log n \\cdot alpha(n)) \\cdot w(MST(S)) and maximum degree\nO(n^{1/alpha(n)}), which improves upon a classical result of Arya et al.\n\\cite{ADMSS95}; in the corresponding result from \\cite{ADMSS95} the spanner has\nthe same number of edges and diameter, but its weight and degree may be\narbitrarily large. Also, for k = O(1) this gives rise to maximum degree O(1),\ndiameter O(log n) and weight O(log^2 n) \\cdot w(MST(S)), which reproves another\nclassical result of Arya et al. \\cite{ADMSS95}. Our bound of O(log_k n +\nalpha(k)) on the diameter is optimal under the constraints that the maximum\ndegree is O(k) and the number of edges is O(n). Our bound on the weight is\noptimal up to a factor of log n. Our construction also provides a similar\ntradeoff in the complementary range of parameters, i.e., when the weight should\nbe smaller than log^2 n, but the diameter is allowed to grow beyond log n.\n  For random point sets in the d-dimensional unit cube, we \"shave\" a factor of\nlog n from the weight bound. Specifically, in this case our construction\nachieves maximum degree O(k), diameter O(log_k n + alpha(k)) and weight that is\nwith high probability O(k \\cdot log_k n) \\cdot w(MST(S)).\n  Finally, en route to these results we devise optimal constructions of\n1-spanners for general tree metrics, which are of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 17:49:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Solomon", "Shay", ""], ["Elkin", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6304", "submitter": "Eraldo Marinho", "authors": "Eraldo Pereira Marinho and Carmen Maria Andreazza", "title": "Anisotropic k-Nearest Neighbor Search Using Covariance Quadtree", "comments": "Work presented at the Minisymposia of Computational Geometry in the\n  joint events IX Argentinian Congress on Computational Mechanics, XXXI\n  Iberian-Latin-American Congress on Computational Methods in Engineering, II\n  South American Congress on Computational Mechanics, held in Buenos Aires in\n  15-18 November 2010; Mec\\'anica Computacional (Computational Mechanics) Vol.\n  XXIX, 2010, ISSN 1666-6070", "journal-ref": "2010, Mec\\'anica Computacional, Volume XXIX.

In the present method a component is irrelevant if\nits length is smaller than, or comparable to, the local inter-data spacing.\nThus, the covariance hyper-quadtree is fully adaptive to the local\ndimensionality. The proposed data-structure is used to compute the anisotropic\nK nearest neighbors (kNN), supported by the Mahalanobis metric. As an\napplication, we used the present k nearest neighbors method to perform density\nestimation over a noisy data distribution. Such estimation method can be\nfurther incorporated to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics, allowing computer\nsimulations of anisotropic fluid flows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 17:57:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Marinho", "Eraldo Pereira", ""], ["Andreazza", "Carmen Maria", ""]]}]
