The\n\\emph{2-page crossing number} of $K_{n} $, denoted by $\\nu_{2}(K_{n})$, is the\nminimum number of crossings determined by a 2-page book drawing of $K_{n}% $.\nSince $\\crg(K_{n}) \\le\\nu_{2}(K_{n})$ and $\\nu_{2}(K_{n}) \\le Z(n)$, a natural\nstep towards Hill's Conjecture is the %(formally) weaker conjecture\n$\\nu_{2}(K_{n}) = Z(n)$, popularized by Vrt'o. %As far as we know, this natural\n%conjecture was first raised by Imrich Vrt'o in 2007. %Prior to this paper,\nresults known for $\\nu_2(K_n)$ were basically %the same as for $\\crg (K_n)$.\nHere In this paper we develop a novel and innovative technique to investigate\ncrossings in drawings of $K_{n}$, and use it to prove that $\\nu_{2}(K_{n}) =\nZ(n) $. To this end, we extend the inherent geometric definition of $k$-edges\nfor finite sets of points in the plane to topological drawings of $K_{n}$. We\nalso introduce the concept of ${\\leq}{\\leq}k$-edges as a useful generalization\nof ${\\leq}k$-edges and extend a powerful theorem that expresses the number of\ncrossings in a rectilinear drawing of $K_{n}$ in terms of its number of $(\\le\nk)$-edges to the topological setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2012 12:57:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Abrego", "Bernardo M.", ""], ["Aichholzer", "Oswin", ""], ["Fernandez-Merchant", "Silvia", ""], ["Ramos", "Pedro", ""], ["Salazar", "Gelasio", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.5689", "submitter": "Alexander Gilbers", "authors": "Alexander Gilbers and Rolf Klein", "title": "A New Upper Bound for the VC-Dimension of Visibility Regions", "comments": "25 pages, 18 Figures.
