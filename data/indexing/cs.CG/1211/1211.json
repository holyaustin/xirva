Conformal mappings\nhave been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes\nangular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves\nthe local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,\nconformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a\nunique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the\nconformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,\na unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\\\"uller extremal mapping between two\nsurfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the\nQuasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\\\"uller mapping.

In particular, for every fixed\nk>1, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, for a 1-connected topological\nspace X given as a finite simplicial complex, or more generally, as a\nsimplicial set with polynomial-time homology, computes the k-th homotopy group\n\\pi_k(X), as well as the first k stages of a Postnikov system of X. Combined\nwith results of an earlier paper, this yields a polynomial-time computation of\n[X,Y], i.e., all homotopy classes of continuous mappings X -> Y, under the\nassumption that Y is (k-1)-connected and dim X < 2k-1. We also obtain a\npolynomial-time solution of the extension problem, where the input consists of\nfinite simplicial complexes X,Y, where Y is (k-1)-connected and dim X < 2k,\nplus a subspace A\\subseteq X and a (simplicial) map f:A -> Y, and the question\nis the extendability of f to all of X.\n  The algorithms are based on the notion of a simplicial set with\npolynomial-time homology, which is an enhancement of the notion of a simplicial\nset with effective homology developed earlier by Sergeraert and his co-workers.\nOur polynomial-time algorithms are obtained by showing that simplicial sets\nwith polynomial-time homology are closed under various operations, most\nnotably, Cartesian products, twisted Cartesian products, and classifying space.\nOne of the key components is also polynomial-time homology for the\nEilenberg--MacLane space K(Z,1), provided in another recent paper by Krcal,\nMatousek, and Sergeraert.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 19:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2014 10:03:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cadek", "Martin", ""], ["Krcal", "Marek", ""], ["Matousek", "Jiri", ""], ["Vokrinek", "Lukas", ""], ["Wagner", "Uli", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.3234", "submitter": "Jonathan Spreer", "authors": "Benjamin A.

We show that the behavior of graph Laplacian near these\nsingularities is quite different from that in the interior of the manifolds. In\nfact, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the Gibbs effect in the analysis of\nFourier series, can be observed in the behavior of graph Laplacian near such\npoints. Unlike in the interior of the domain, where graph Laplacian converges\nto the Laplace-Beltrami operator, near singularities graph Laplacian tends to a\nfirst-order differential operator, which exhibits different scaling behavior as\na function of the kernel width. One important implication is that while points\nnear the singularities occupy only a small part of the total volume, the\ndifference in scaling results in a disproportionately large contribution to the\ntotal behavior. Another significant finding is that while the scaling behavior\nof the operator is the same near different types of singularities, they are\nvery distinct at a more refined level of analysis.\n  We believe that a comprehensive understanding of these structures in addition\nto the standard case of a smooth manifold can take us a long way toward better\nmethods for analysis of complex non-linear data and can lead to significant\nprogress in algorithm design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2012 20:10:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Belkin", "Mikhail", ""], ["Que", "Qichao", ""], ["Wang", "Yusu", ""], ["Zhou", "Xueyuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7020", "submitter": "Olivier Devillers", "authors": "Olivier Devillers (INRIA Sophia Antipolis / INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France), Marc Glisse (INRIA Sophia Antipolis / INRIA Saclay - Ile de France),\n  Xavier Goaoc (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Guillaume Moroz (INRIA Nancy - Grand\n  Est / LORIA), Matthias Reitzner", "title": "The monotonicity of f-vectors of random polytopes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "N&deg; RR-8154 (2012)", "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-8154", "categories": "cs.CG math.MG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let K be a compact convex body in Rd, let Kn be the convex hull of n points\nchosen uniformly and independently in K, and let fi(Kn) denote the number of\ni-dimensional faces of Kn.

Currently, it is\nextremely challenging to generate large uniform antipodally symmetric point\nsets suitable for 3D radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this\nimportant and long-standing problem.\n  Methods: The proposed method is based upon constrained centroidal Voronoi\ntessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric. Geometrically\nintuitive approach to tessellating the upper hemisphere is also proposed.\n  Results: The average time complexity of the proposed centroidal tessellations\nwas shown to be effectively on the order of the product of the number of\niterations and the number of generators. For small sample size, the proposed\nmethod was comparable to the state-of-the-art iterative method in terms of the\nuniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is\ninfeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak\nand ringing artifact as compared to those of the commonly used methods.\n  Conclusion: This work solved a long-standing problem on generating uniform\nsampling points for 3D radial MRI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 02:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Koay", "Cheng Guan", ""]]}]
