For decades, this algorithm has been widely used by practitioners.\nHowever, it is not well studied theoretically. In this paper, we analyze the\nagglomerative complete linkage clustering algorithm. Assuming that the\ndimension $d$ is a constant, we show that for any $k$ the solution computed by\nthis algorithm is an $O(\\log k)$-approximation to the diameter $k$-clustering\nproblem. Our analysis does not only hold for the Euclidean distance but for any\nmetric that is based on a norm. Furthermore, we analyze the closely related\n$k$-center and discrete $k$-center problem.
