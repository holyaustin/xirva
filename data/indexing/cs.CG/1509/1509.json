Here, we have a set of\npoints in the plane and we want to connect them with straight line segments,\nsuch that there is a path between each pair of points that does not make a\nlarge detour. If we achieve this, the resulting graph is called a spanner. We\nfocus our attention on $\\Theta$-graphs, which are constructed by connecting\neach point with its nearest neighbour in a fixed number of cones. Although this\nconstruction is very straight-forward, it has proven challenging to fully\ndetermine the properties of the resulting graphs. We show that if the\nconstruction uses 5 cones, the resulting graphs are still spanners. This was\nthe only number of cones for which this question remained unanswered. We also\npresent a routing strategy on the half-$\\Theta_6$-graph, a variant of the graph\nwith 6 cones. We show that our routing strategy finds a path whose length is at\nmost a constant factor from the straight-line distance between the endpoints.\nMoreover, we show that this routing strategy is optimal.\n  In the second part, we turn our attention to flips in triangulations. A flip\nis a simple operation that transforms one triangulation into another. It turns\nout that with enough flips, we can transform any triangulation into any other.\nBut how many flips is enough? We present an improved upper bound of $5.2n -\n33.6$ on the maximum flip distance between any pair of triangulations with n\nvertices. Along the way, we prove matching lower bounds on each step in the\ncurrent algorithm, including a tight bound of $(3n - 9)/5$ flips needed to make\na triangulation 4-connected.

Unfortunately, deciding\nwhether such a sequence exist is believed to be very difficult in general.\n  In this article we present a method, based on uniform spanning trees, to\nestimate how difficult it is to collapse a given $3$-sphere triangulation after\nremoving a tetrahedron. In addition we show that out of all $3$-sphere\ntriangulations with eight vertices or less, exactly $22$ admit a non-collapsing\nsequence onto a contractible non-collapsible $2$-complex. As a side product we\nclassify all minimal triangulations of the dunce hat, and all contractible\nnon-collapsible $2$-complexes with at most $18$ triangles. This is complemented\nby large scale experiments on the collapsing difficulty of $9$- and $10$-vertex\nspheres.\n  Finally, we propose an easy-to-compute characterisation of $3$-sphere\ntriangulations which experimentally exhibit a low proportion of collapsing\nsequences, leading to a heuristic to produce $3$-sphere triangulations with\ndifficult combinatorial properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 07:36:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paix\u00e3o", "Jo\u00e3o", ""], ["Spreer", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07669", "submitter": "Andr\\'e van Renssen", "authors": "Boris Aronov, Matias Korman, Simon Pratt, Andr\\'e van Renssen, Marcel\n  Roeloffzen", "title": "Time-Space Trade-off Algorithms for Triangulating a Simple Polygon", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures, 1 algorithm", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An $s$-workspace algorithm is an algorithm that has read-only access to the\nvalues of the input, write-only access to the output, and only uses $O(s)$\nadditional words of space.
