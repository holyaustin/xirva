One phrasing of this result is that, if Q\ncan be \"sculpted\" from P by a series of slices with planes, then Q can be\ntailored from P. And there is a sense in which tailoring is finer than\nsculpting in that P may be tailored to polyhedra that are not achievable by\nsculpting P. It is an easy corollary that, if S is the surface of any convex\nbody, then any convex polyhedron P may be tailored to approximate a homothet of\nS as closely as desired. So P can be \"whittled\" to e.g., a sphere S.\n  Another main result achieves the same reshaping, but by excising more\ncomplicated shapes we call \"crests,\" still each enclosing one vertex. Reversing\neither digon-tailoring or crest-tailoring leads to proofs that any Q inside P\ncan be enlarged to P by cutting Q and inserting and sealing surface patches.\n  One surprising corollary of these results is that, for Q a subset of P, we\ncan cut-up Q into pieces and paste them non-overlapping onto an isometric\nsubset of P.
