Each quad-mesh induces a conformal structure of the\nsurface, and a meromorphic differential, where the configuration of singular\nvertices correspond to the configurations the poles and zeros (divisor) of the\nmeroromorphic differential. Due to Riemann surface theory, the configuration of\nsingularities of a quad-mesh satisfies the Abel-Jacobi condition. Inversely, if\na satisfies the Abel-Jacobi condition, then there exists a meromorphic quartic\ndifferential whose equals to the given one. Furthermore, if the meromorphic\nquadric differential is with finite, then it also induces a a quad-mesh, the\npoles and zeros of the meromorphic differential to the singular vertices of the\nquad-mesh. Besides the theoretic proofs, the computational algorithm for\nverification of Abel-Jacobi condition is explained in details.

This thesis aims to first\nillustrate the generation of geofence and then apply the geofence system on UAV\noperation. This application enables UAV to fly in the designated area without\nhuman intervention. The project is built with JAVA using GIS-enabled Database\nManagement System and Open Soured Map data powered by OpenStreetMap and OS map.\nThis method has been tested by simulations which had results of high accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2019 15:30:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.04284", "submitter": "Aruni Choudhary", "authors": "Aruni Choudhary, Wolfgang Mulzer", "title": "No-dimensional Tverberg Theorems and Algorithms", "comments": "A shorter version will appear at SoCG 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Tverberg's theorem is a classic result in discrete geometry.

The argument is constructive, but it does not result in\na polynomial-time algorithm.\n  We present an alternative proof for a no-dimensional Tverberg theorem that\nleads to an efficient algorithm to find the partition.

Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation of\ndistances in a metric space $(X,d)$, where each point $x\\in X$ is assigned a\nsuccinct label, such that the distance between any two points $x,y \\in X$ can\nbe approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is an\nembedding into $\\ell_\\infty$, where each point $x\\in X$ is assigned a vector\n$f(x)$ such that $\\|f(x)-f(y)\\|_\\infty$ is approximately $d(x,y)$. The\nperformance of a distance labeling or an $\\ell_\\infty$-embedding is measured\nvia its distortion and its label-size/dimension.\n  We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of these\ntwo measures. Here, a priority order $\\pi=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)$ of the point set $X$\nis given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, a\ndistance labeling has prioritized label-size $\\alpha(.)$ if every $x_j$ has\nlabel size at most $\\alpha(j)$. Similarly, an embedding $f: X \\to \\ell_\\infty$\nhas prioritized dimension $\\alpha(.)$ if $f(x_j)$ is non-zero only in the first\n$\\alpha(j)$ coordinates. In addition, we compare these their prioritized\nmeasures to their classical (worst-case) versions.\n  We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisingly\ndiverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings have\nvery similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a huge\ndisparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strict\nseparation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,\nwhen comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that the\nworst-case bound for label size often ``translates'' to a prioritized one, but\nalso a surprising exception to this rule.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2019 06:25:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Filtser", "Arnold", ""], ["Gottlieb", "Lee-Ad", ""], ["Krauthgamer", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.06914", "submitter": "Riccardo Mengoni", "authors": "Riccardo Mengoni, Alessandra DI Pierro, Laleh Memarzadeh, Stefano\n  Mancini", "title": "Persistent homology analysis of multiqubit entanglement", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Quantum Information and Computation Vol.20 No.5&6 (2020)\n  pp0375-0399", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a homology-based technique for the analysis of multiqubit state\nvectors.
