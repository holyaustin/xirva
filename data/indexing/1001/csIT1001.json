Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.\nFirst there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose\nof this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the\napplication of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of\nnon-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.\nThese equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The\nprimary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator\nwithin the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is\nthe role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles\nto all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately\nprovides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds\nprivately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a\nmultitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling\nthese sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,\nif these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational\nto construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine\nwould need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player\nand itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input\nor strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme. Here is the\nsynthesis of cryptography into game theory; analyzing the ability of the\nplayers to construct a protocol which can be used successfully in the place of\na mediator.\n", [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 23:59:11 GMT"}], "2010-01-05", [["Meyer", "Thomas Kellam", ""]]], ["1001.0063", "Enrico Nardelli", "Alessandro Epasto and Enrico Nardelli", "On a Model for Integrated Information", null, null, null, null, "cs.AI", "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "  In this paper we give a thorough presentation of a model proposed by Tononi\net al. for modeling \\emph{integrated information}, i.e. how much information is\ngenerated in a system transitioning from one state to the next one by the\ncausal interaction of its parts and \\emph{above and beyond} the information\ngiven by the sum of its parts.
