Direct approaches prove termination\ndirectly on the basis of the logic program. Transformational approaches\ntransform a logic program into a term rewrite system (TRS) and then analyze\ntermination of the resulting TRS instead. Thus, transformational approaches\nmake all methods previously developed for TRSs available for logic programs as\nwell. However, the applicability of most existing transformations is quite\nrestricted, as they can only be used for certain subclasses of logic programs.\n(Most of them are restricted to well-moded programs.) In this paper we improve\nthese transformations such that they become applicable for any definite logic\nprogram. To simulate the behavior of logic programs by TRSs, we slightly modify\nthe notion of rewriting by permitting infinite terms. We show that our\ntransformation results in TRSs which are indeed suitable for automated\ntermination analysis. In contrast to most other methods for termination of\nlogic programs, our technique is also sound for logic programming without occur\ncheck, which is typically used in practice. We implemented our approach in the\ntermination prover AProVE and successfully evaluated it on a large collection\nof examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2008 14:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 09:50:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Schneider-Kamp", "P.", ""], ["Giesl", "J.", ""], ["Serebrenik", "A.", ""], ["Thiemann", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0378", "submitter": "Kees Middelburg", "authors": "J.

The main bottleneck for such\nalgorithms, other than the obvious one of time, is the amount of memory used.\nIn the field of proof complexity, the resources of time and memory correspond\nto the length and space of resolution proofs. There has been a long line of\nresearch trying to understand these proof complexity measures, but while strong\nresults have been proven on length our understanding of space is still quite\npoor. For instance, it remains open whether the fact that a formula is provable\nin short length implies that it is also provable in small space or whether on\nthe contrary these measures are unrelated in the sense that short proofs can be\narbitrarily complex with respect to space.\n  In this paper, we present some evidence that the true answer should be that\nthe latter case holds. We do this by proving a tight bound of Theta(sqrt(n)) on\nthe space needed for so-called pebbling contradictions over pyramid graphs of\nsize n. This yields the first polynomial lower bound on space that is not a\nconsequence of a corresponding lower bound on width, another well-studied\nmeasure in resolution, as well as an improvement of the weak separation in\n(Nordstrom 2006) of space and width from logarithmic to polynomial.\n  Also, continuing the line of research initiated by (Ben-Sasson 2002) into\ntrade-offs between different proof complexity measures, we present a simplified\nproof of the recent length-space trade-off result in (Hertel and Pitassi 2007),\nand show how our ideas can be used to prove a couple of other exponential\ntrade-offs in resolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2008 12:52:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Nordstr\u00f6m", "Jakob", ""], ["H\u00e5stad", "Johan", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.1457", "submitter": "Catherine Recanati", "authors": "Catherine Recanati (LIPN)", "title": "Hybrid Reasoning and the Future of Iconic Representations", "comments": "pp. 299-310", "journal-ref": "Dans Artificial General Intelligence 2008 - The First AGI\n  Conference, Memphis, Tennessee : \\'Etats-Unis d'Am\\'erique (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a brief overview of the main characteristics of diagrammatic\nreasoning, analyze a case of human reasoning in a mastermind game, and explain\nwhy hybrid representation systems (HRS) are particularly attractive and\npromising for Artificial General Intelligence and Computer Science in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:44:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Recanati", "Catherine", "", "LIPN"]]}, {"id": "0803.1575", "submitter": "David Monniaux", "authors": "David Monniaux (VERIMAG - Imag)", "title": "A Quantifier Elimination Algorithm for Linear Real Arithmetic", "comments": "accepted at LPAR '08", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new quantifier elimination algorithm for the theory of linear\nreal arithmetic.
