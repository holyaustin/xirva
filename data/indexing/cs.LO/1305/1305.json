Furthermore, a combinatorial analysis\nof games on a set of arbitrary time points is given; in particular, it is\nproved that the number of distinct games on a set $T$ with cardinality $n$ is\nthe number of partial orders on a set of $n$ elements.

Soon, however, it was realised that three-valued logic had\nsome natural advantages, as it provides distinct values not only for truth and\nfalsehood, but also for \"undefined\". The three-valued semantics proposed by\nFitting and by Kunen are closely related to what is computed by a logic\nprogram, the third truth value being associated with non-termination. A\ndifferent three-valued semantics, proposed by Naish, shared much with those of\nFitting and Kunen but incorporated allowances for programmer intent, the third\ntruth value being associated with underspecification. Naish used an\n(apparently) novel \"arrow\" operator to relate the intended meaning of left and\nright sides of predicate definitions. In this paper we suggest that the\nadditional truth values of Fitting/Kunen and Naish are best viewed as duals. We\nuse Belnap's four-valued logic, also used elsewhere by Fitting, to unify the\ntwo three-valued approaches. The truth values are arranged in a bilattice which\nsupports the classical ordering on truth values as well as the \"information\nordering\". We note that the \"arrow\" operator of Naish (and our four-valued\nextension) is essentially the information ordering, whereas the classical arrow\ndenotes the truth ordering. This allows us to shed new light on many aspects of\nlogic programming, including program analysis, type and mode systems,\ndeclarative debugging and the relationships between specifications and\nprograms, and successive executions states of a program.

We find that the appropriate notion of model is a special kind of\npromonoidal category. Since the theory of promonoidal categories has not been\ndeveloped very thoroughly, at least in the published literature, we need to\ndevelop it here. The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the\n(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories\nas an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.\nAccordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and\npseudomonoid therein.\n  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious\nnotational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative\ndiagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of\nthree-dimensional diagrams. We therefore introduce a novel technical device,\nwhich we dub the calculus of components, that simplifies the business of\nreasoning about a certain class of algebraic structure internal to a monoidal\nbicategory. When viewed through this simplifying lens, the theory of\npseudomonoids turns out to be essentially formally identical to the ordinary\ntheory of monoidal categories. We indicate how the calculus of components may\nbe extended to cover structures that make use of the braiding in a braided\nmonoidal bicategory, and use this to study braided pseudomonoids.\n  A higher-dimensional analogue of Cayley's theorem is proved, and used to\ndeduce a novel characterisation of the unit of a promonoidal category. This,\nand the other preceding work, is then used to give two characterisations of the\ncategories that model the unitless fragment of intuitionistic multiplicative\nlinear logic.

A formalization of such an algorithm should include a\nspecification of its computational behavior, a specification of its\nmathematical meaning, and a mechanism for applying the algorithm to actual\nexpressions. Achieving these goals requires the ability to integrate reasoning\nabout the syntax of the expressions with reasoning about what the expressions\nmean. A syntax framework is a mathematical structure that is an abstract model\nfor a syntax reasoning system. It contains a mapping of expressions to\nsyntactic values that represent the syntactic structures of the expressions; a\nlanguage for reasoning about syntactic values; a quotation mechanism to refer\nto the syntactic value of an expression; and an evaluation mechanism to refer\nto the value of the expression represented by a syntactic value. We present and\ncompare two approaches, based on instances of a syntax framework, to formalize\na syntax-based mathematical algorithm in a formal theory T.
