For 35 years the split-radix\nalgorithm held the record by requiring just 4n log n - 6n + 8 arithmetic\noperations on real numbers for a size-n DFT, and was widely believed to be the\nbest possible. Recent work by Van Buskirk et al. demonstrated improvements to\nthe split-radix operation count by using multiplier coefficients or \"twiddle\nfactors\" that are not n-th roots of unity for a size-n DFT. This paper presents\na Boolean Satisfiability-based proof of the lowest operation count for certain\nclasses of DFT algorithms. First, we present a novel way to choose new yet\nvalid twiddle factors for the nodes in flowgraphs generated by common\npower-of-two fast Fourier transform algorithms, FFTs. With this new technique,\nwe can generate a large family of FFTs realizable by a fixed flowgraph. This\nsolution space of FFTs is cast as a Boolean Satisfiability problem, and a\nmodern Satisfiability Modulo Theory solver is applied to search for FFTs\nrequiring the fewest arithmetic operations. Surprisingly, we find that there\nare FFTs requiring fewer operations than the split-radix even when all twiddle\nfactors are n-th roots of unity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2011 19:46:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 20:04:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Haynal", "Steve", ""], ["Haynal", "Heidi", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5916", "submitter": "Rob van Glabbeek", "authors": "Rob van Glabbeek, Ursula Goltz and Jens-Wolfhard Schicke", "title": "Abstract Processes of Place/Transition Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Information Processing Letters 111(13), 2011, pp. 626-633", "doi": "10.1016/j.ipl.2011.03.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A well-known problem in Petri net theory is to formalise an appropriate\ncausality-based concept of process or run for place/transition systems. The\nso-called individual token interpretation, where tokens are distinguished\naccording to their causal history, giving rise to the processes of Goltz and\nReisig, is often considered too detailed. The problem of defining a fully\nsatisfying more abstract concept of process for general place/transition\nsystems has so-far not been solved. In this paper, we recall the proposal of\ndefining an abstract notion of process, here called BD-process, in terms of\nequivalence classes of Goltz-Reisig processes, using an equivalence proposed by\nBest and Devillers. It yields a fully satisfying solution for at least all\none-safe nets. However, for certain nets which intuitively have different\nconflicting behaviours, it yields only one maximal abstract process. Here we\nidentify a class of place/transition systems, called structural conflict nets,\nwhere conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity are clearly separated.\nWe show that, in the case of structural conflict nets, the equivalence proposed\nby Best and Devillers yields a unique maximal abstract process only for\nconflict-free nets. Thereby BD-processes constitute a simple and fully\nsatisfying solution in the class of structural conflict nets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 13:14:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["van Glabbeek", "Rob", ""], ["Goltz", "Ursula", ""], ["Schicke", "Jens-Wolfhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.6007", "submitter": "Marius Buliga", "authors": "Marius Buliga", "title": "Computing with space: a tangle formalism for chora and difference", "comments": "56 pages, added content and reorganized the paper, title changed,\n  many figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.MG cs.LO q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What is space computing, simulation, or understanding?
