A classical question in formal\nmodelling with clear relevance to biological modelling is the model checking\nproblem. i.e. calculate the probability that a behaviour, expressed for\ninstance in terms of a certain temporal logic formula, may occur in a given\nstochastic process. However, one may not only be interested in the notion of\nsatisfiability, but also in the capacity of a system to mantain a particular\nemergent behaviour unaffected by the perturbations, caused e.g. from extrinsic\nnoise, or by possible small changes in the model parameters. To address this\nissue, researchers from the verification community have recently proposed\nseveral notions of robustness for temporal logic providing suitable definitions\nof distance between a trajectory of a (deterministic) dynamical system and the\nboundaries of the set of trajectories satisfying the property of interest. The\ncontributions of this paper are twofold. First, we extend the notion of\nrobustness to stochastic systems, showing that this naturally leads to a\ndistribution of robustness scores. By discussing two examples, we show how to\napproximate the distribution of the robustness score and its key indicators:\nthe average robustness and the conditional average robustness. Secondly, we\nshow how to combine these indicators with the satisfaction probability to\naddress the system design problem, where the goal is to optimize some control\nparameters of a stochastic model in order to best maximize robustness of the\ndesired specifications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 23:40:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bartocci", "Ezio", "", "TU Wien, Austria"], ["Bortolussi", "Luca", "", "University of\n  Trieste, Italy"], ["Nenzi", "Laura", "", "IMT Lucca, Italy"], ["Sanguinetti", "Guido", "", "University of Edinburgh, UK"]]}, {"id": "1309.0867", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "L.

The third\nand final problem concerns the classical problem of learning a minimal\nautomaton consistent with a given set of strings. For this last problem, we\nshow that the performance of our solution comes very close to that of a\nstate-of-the art solution. For each of these applications, we analyze the\nproblem, illustrate the development of a logic-based model and explore how\nalternatives can affect the performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 13:18:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Mar 2014 10:59:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bruynooghe", "Maurice", ""], ["Blockeel", "Hendrik", ""], ["Bogaerts", "Bart", ""], ["De Cat", "Broes", ""], ["De Pooter", "Stef", ""], ["Jansen", "Joachim", ""], ["Labarre", "Anthony", ""], ["Ramon", "Jan", ""], ["Denecker", "Marc", ""], ["Verwer", "Sicco", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6947", "submitter": "Fr", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Lang (INRIA), Radu Mateescu (INRIA)", "title": "Partial Model Checking using Networks of Labelled Transition Systems and\n  Boole an Equation Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 9, Issue 4 (October 1,\n  2013) lmcs:763", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-9(4:1)2013", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Partial model checking was proposed by Andersen in 1995 to verify a temporal\nlogic formula compositionally on a composition of processes. It consists in\nincrementally incorporating into the formula the behavioural information taken\nfrom one process - an operation called quotienting - to obtain a new formula\nthat can be verified on a smaller composition from which the incorporated\nprocess has been removed. Simplifications of the formula must be applied at\neach step, so as to maintain the formula at a tractable size. In this paper, we\nrevisit partial model checking. First, we extend quotienting to the network of\nlabelled transition systems model, which subsumes most parallel composition\noperators, including m-among-n synchronisation and parallel composition using\nsynchronisation interfaces, available in the ELOTOS standard. Second, we\nreformulate quotienting in terms of a simple synchronous product between a\ngraph representation of the formula (called formula graph) and a process, thus\nenabling quotienting to be implemented efficiently and easily, by reusing\nexisting tools dedicated to graph compositions. Third, we propose\nsimplifications of the formula as a combination of bisimulations and reductions\nusing Boolean equation systems applied directly to the formula graph, thus\nenabling formula simplifications also to be implemented efficiently. Finally,\nwe describe an implementation in the CADP (Construction and Analysis of\nDistributed Processes) toolbox and present some experimental results in which\npartial model checking uses hundreds of times less memory than on-the-fly model\nchecking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 15:55:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 16:01:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lang", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "INRIA"], ["Mateescu", "Radu", "", "INRIA"]]}]
