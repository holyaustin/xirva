The window concept has\nproved its interest in a variety of two-player zero-sum games because it\nenables reasoning about such time bounds in system specifications, but also\nthanks to the increased tractability that it usually yields.\n  In this work, we extend the window framework to stochastic environments by\nconsidering Markov decision processes. A fundamental problem in this context is\nthe threshold probability problem: given an objective it aims to synthesize\nstrategies that guarantee satisfying runs with a given probability. We solve it\nfor the usual variants of window objectives, where either the time frame is set\nas a parameter, or we ask if such a time frame exists. We develop a generic\napproach for window-based objectives and instantiate it for the classical\nmean-payoff and parity objectives, already considered in games. Our work paves\nthe way to a wide use of the window mechanism in stochastic models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 12:20:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jul 2019 16:52:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 09:11:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 13:53:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:59:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Brihaye", "Thomas", ""], ["Delgrange", "Florent", ""], ["Oualhadj", "Youssouf", ""], ["Randour", "Mickael", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03880", "submitter": "Alberto Molinari", "authors": "Alberto Molinari", "title": "Model checking: the interval way", "comments": "PhD thesis, the official version can be found at:\n  http://albertom.altervista.org/Th.pdf", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  [...] The most famous model checking (MC) techniques were developed from the\nlate 80s, bearing in mind the well-known \"point-based\" temporal logics LTL and\nCTL.

While this approach is scalable\nand modular in terms of the I/O APIs available to a program, enables composing\nlow-level I/O actions into high-level ones, and enables a convenient\nverification experience, it does not support high-level I/O actions that\ninvolve memory manipulation as well as low-level I/O (such as buffered I/O), or\nthat are in fact \"virtual I/O\" actions that are implemented purely through\nmemory manipulation. Furthermore, it does not allow rewriting an I/O\nspecification into an equivalent one.\n  In this paper, we propose a refined approach that does have these properties.\nThe essential insight is to fix the set of places of the Petri net to be the\nset of separation logic assertions, thus making available the full power of\nseparation logic for abstractly stating an arbitrary operation's specification\nin Petri net form, for composing operations into an I/O specification, and for\nequivalence reasoning on I/O specifications. Our refinement resolves the issue\nof the justification of the choice of Petri nets over other formalisms such as\ngeneral state transition systems, in that it \"refines them away\" into the more\nessential constructs of separating conjunction and abstract nested triples. To\nenable a convenient treatment of input operations, we propose the use of\nprophecy variables to eliminate their non-determinism.\n  We illustrate the approach through a number of example programs, including\none where subroutines specified and verified using I/O specifications run as\nthreads communicating through shared memory. The theory and examples of the\npaper have been machine-checked using the Iris library for program verification\nin the Coq proof assistant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:53:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Penninckx", "Willem", ""], ["Timany", "Amin", ""], ["Jacobs", "Bart", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10615", "submitter": "Shale Xiong", "authors": "Shale Xiong, Andrea Cerone, Azalea Raad, Philippa Gardner", "title": "Data Consistency in Transactional Storage Systems: a Centralised\n  Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce an interleaving operational semantics for describing the\nclient-observable behaviour of atomic transactions on distributed key-value\nstores.

Unlike\nfor termination, however, there exists no known complexity hierarchy for\nconfluence. In this paper we investigate whether the decreasing diagrams\ntechnique can be used to obtain such a hierarchy. The decreasing diagrams\ntechnique is one of the strongest and most versatile methods for proving\nconfluence of abstract rewrite systems. It is complete for countable systems,\nand it has many well-known confluence criteria as corollaries.\n  So what makes decreasing diagrams so powerful? In contrast to other\nconfluence techniques, decreasing diagrams employ a labelling of the steps with\nlabels from a well-founded order in order to conclude confluence of the\nunderlying unlabelled relation. Hence it is natural to ask how the size of the\nlabel set influences the strength of the technique. In particular, what class\nof abstract rewrite systems can be proven confluent using decreasing diagrams\nrestricted to 1 label, 2 labels, 3 labels, and so on? Surprisingly, we find\nthat two labels suffice for proving confluence for every abstract rewrite\nsystem having the cofinality property, thus in particular for every confluent,\ncountable system.\n  Secondly, we show that this result stands in sharp contrast to the situation\nfor commutation of rewrite relations, where the hierarchy does not collapse.\n  Thirdly, investigating the possibility of a confluence hierarchy, we\ndetermine the first-order (non-)definability of the notion of confluence and\nrelated properties, using techniques from finite model theory. We find that in\nparticular Hanf's theorem is fruitful for elegant proofs of undefinability of\nproperties of abstract rewrite systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2019 11:43:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 21:59:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2019 12:42:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 15:00:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Endrullis", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["Klop", "Jan Willem", ""], ["Overbeek", "Roy", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10820", "submitter": "Mauricio Toro", "authors": "Mauricio Toro", "title": "A General Overview of Formal Languages for Individual-Based Modelling of\n  Ecosystems", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1610.08171 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Various formal languages have been proposed in the literature for the\nindividual-based modelling of ecological systems.
