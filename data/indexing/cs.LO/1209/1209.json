In order\nto keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as\na state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose\nstates have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level.\nThus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level\nstates satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order\ntransition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can\nsatisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its\nbehaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of\nthe multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be\nstatically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model.\nTo this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing\nboth a relational and a logical characterization.

When specifying concurrent data structures, the main challenge\nis to make specifications stable, i.e., to ensure that they cannot be\ninvalidated by other threads. To this end, we propose to use history-based\nspecifications: instead of describing method behaviour in terms of the object's\nstate, we specify it in terms of the object's state history. A history is\ndefined as a list of state updates, which at all points can be related to the\nactual object's state.\n  We illustrate the approach on the BlockingQueue hierarchy from the\njava.util.concurrent library. We show how the behaviour of the interface\nBlockingQueue is specified, leaving a few decisions open to descendant classes.\nThe classes implementing the interface correctly inherit the specifications. As\na specification language, we use a combination of JML and permission-based\nseparation logic, including abstract predicates. This results in an abstract,\nmodular and natural way to specify the behaviour of concurrent queues. The\nspecifications can be used to derive high-level properties about queues, for\nexample to show that the order of elements is preserved.

One\ndifficulty when developing such systems is the lack of a completely\nsatisfactory integration of logic and probability. We address this problem\ndirectly. Expressive languages like higher-order logic are ideally suited for\nrepresenting and reasoning about structured knowledge. Uncertain knowledge can\nbe modeled by using graded probabilities rather than binary truth-values. The\nmain technical problem studied in this paper is the following: Given a set of\nsentences, each having some probability of being true, what probability should\nbe ascribed to other (query) sentences? A natural wish-list, among others, is\nthat the probability distribution (i) is consistent with the knowledge base,\n(ii) allows for a consistent inference procedure and in particular (iii)\nreduces to deductive logic in the limit of probabilities being 0 and 1, (iv)\nallows (Bayesian) inductive reasoning and (v) learning in the limit and in\nparticular (vi) allows confirmation of universally quantified\nhypotheses/sentences. We translate this wish-list into technical requirements\nfor a prior probability and show that probabilities satisfying all our criteria\nexist. We also give explicit constructions and several general\ncharacterizations of probabilities that satisfy some or all of the criteria and\nvarious (counter) examples. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor extending beliefs about finitely many sentences to suitable probabilities\nover all sentences, and in particular least dogmatic or least biased ones.

An example where such a situation arises is\nverification of optimizing program transformations applied by compilers.\n  In this paper, we present a logic called Temporal Transformation Logic (TTL)\nto reason about such formulae. We consider different types of primitive\ntransformations and present TTL inference rules for them. Our definitions of\nprogram transformations and temporal logic operators are novel in their use of\nthe boolean matrix algebra. This results in specifications that are succinct\nand constructive.

We consider a non-Fregean logic\nwhich is a revised and extended version (Lewitzka 2012) of Epsilon-T-Logic\noriginally introduced by (Straeter 1992) as a logic with a total truth\npredicate and propositional quantifiers.

We also define three-valued versions\nrelated to Kleene's logic K_3 and Priest's Logic of Paradox P_3, respectively.\nIn this many-valued setting, models may contain liars and other \"paradoxical\"\npropositions which are ruled out by the more restrictive classical semantics.\nWe introduce these many-valued non-Fregean logics as extensions of abstract\nparameter logics such that parameter logic and extension are of the same\nlogical type. For this purpose, we define and study abstract logics of type\nB_4, K_3 and P_3. Using semantic methods we show compactness of the consequence\nrelation of abstract logics of type B_4, give a representation as minimally\ngenerated logics and establish a connection to the approach of (Font 1997).\nFinally, we present a complete sequent calculus for the Epsilon-T-style\nextension of classical abstract logics simplifying constructions originally\ndeveloped by (Straeter 1992, Zeitz 2000, Lewitzka 1998).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2012 18:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lewitzka", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5571", "submitter": "Vladislav Ryzhikov Dr", "authors": "Alessandro Artale, Roman Kontchakov, Vladislav Ryzhikov, Michael\n  Zakharyaschev", "title": "A Cookbook for Temporal Conceptual Data Modelling with Description\n  Logics", "comments": "Accepted for the ACM Transaction on Computational Logic, (TOCL)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We design temporal description logics suitable for reasoning about temporal\nconceptual data models and investigate their computational complexity.
