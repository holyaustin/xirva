As it\nturns out, the resulting calculus, LBiKt, seems to be more basic than most\nintuitionistic tense or modal logics considered in the literature, in\nparticular, those studied by Ewald and Simpson, as it does not assume any a\npriori relationship between the diamond and the box modal operators.

The calculus LBiKt\nis formulated in a variant of display calculus, using a form of sequents called\nnested sequents. Cut elimination is proved for LBiKt, using a technique similar\nto that used in display calculi. As in display calculi, the inference rules of\nLBiKt are ``shallow'' rules, in the sense that they act on top-level formulae\nin a nested sequent. The calculus LBiKt is ill-suited for backward proof search\ndue to the presence of certain structural rules called ``display postulates''\nand the contraction rules on arbitrary structures.

Both the semantic\ncharacterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global\ntermination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In\nthis paper we consider local termination, of specific sets of terms within a\ngiven TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic\ncharacterisation of global termination to local termination. This is made\npossible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also\nextend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in local\ntermination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably\ninterested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of\ninputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of\ninterest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known\nto be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding\nrecursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the\nwell-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal\nof rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We\nalso describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.\nThe resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases\nalready been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation\nof the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language.

The advantage of these methods\ncompared to traditional approaches is that the analysis of the whole system\ngives more precise results. Only few model-based approaches have been applied\nto answer quantitative questions in safety analysis, often limited to analysis\nof specific failure propagation models, limited types of failure modes or\nwithout system dynamics and behavior, as direct quantitative analysis is uses\nlarge amounts of computing resources. New achievements in the domain of\n(probabilistic) model-checking now allow for overcoming this problem.\n  This paper shows how functional models based on synchronous parallel\nsemantics, which can be used for system design, implementation and qualitative\nsafety analysis, can be directly re-used for (model-based) quantitative safety\nanalysis. Accurate modeling of different types of probabilistic failure\noccurrence is shown as well as accurate interpretation of the results of the\nanalysis. This allows for reliable and expressive assessment of the safety of a\nsystem in early design stages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jun 2010 03:03:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00fcdemann", "Matthias", ""], ["Ortmeier", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5102", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Ukachukwu Ndukwu (Deptartment of Computing, Macquarie University,\n  Australia.), Annabelle McIver (Deptartment of Computing, Macquarie\n  University, Australia.)", "title": "An expectation transformer approach to predicate abstraction and data\n  independence for probabilistic programs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 28, 2010, pp. 129-143", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.28.9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we revisit the well-known technique of predicate abstraction to\ncharacterise performance attributes of system models incorporating probability.\nWe recast the theory using expectation transformers, and identify transformer\nproperties which correspond to abstractions that yield nevertheless exact bound\non the performance of infinite state probabilistic systems.
