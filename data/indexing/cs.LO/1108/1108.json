Reliable\ninteractions are, e.g., those enjoying suitable logical, behavioural, or\nsecurity properties, or adhering to certain QoS standards. Contract-based\ninteractions are, e.g., those where the interacting entities are committed to\ngive certain guarantees whenever certain assumptions are met by their operating\nenvironment.\n  The ICE procedure for paper selection allows for PC members to interact,\nanonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is\npublished on a Wiki and associated with a discussion forum whose access is\nrestricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of\ninterests. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply\nto. Each paper was reviewed by four PC members, and altogether 8 papers (out of\n12) were accepted for publication.\n  We were proud to host three invited talks by Rocco De Nicola (joint with\nPACO), Simon Gay and Prakash Panangaden, whose abstracts are included in this\nvolume together with the regular papers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2011 06:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "Alexandra", ""], ["Bliudze", "Simon", ""], ["Bruni", "Roberto", ""], ["Carbone", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0229", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Ross Horne (University of Southampton), Vladimiro Sassone (University\n  of Southampton)", "title": "A Verified Algebra for Linked Data", "comments": "In Proceedings FOCLASA 2011, arXiv:1107.5847", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 58, 2011, pp. 20-33", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.58.2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.NI cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A foundation is investigated for the application of loosely structured data\non the Web.

A growing\nnumber of programming languages from commercial and academic spheres have been\ngiven usable semantic descriptions by means of structural operational\nsemantics. Because of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural\noperational semantics has found considerable application in the study of the\nsemantics of concurrent processes. It is also a viable alternative to\ndenotational semantics in the static analysis of programs, and in proving\ncompiler correctness. Moreover, it has found application in emerging areas of\ncomputing such as probabilistic systems and systems biology.\n  Structural operational semantics has been successfully applied as a formal\ntool to establish results that hold for classes of process description\nlanguages. This has allowed for the generalization of well-known results in the\nfield of process algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process\ncalculi based on the realization that many of the results in this field only\ndepend upon general semantic properties of language constructs.\n  The workshop is a forum for researchers, students and practitioners\ninterested in new developments and directions for future investigations.

We\nstart by considering the classic linear time-branching time spectrum developed\nby R.J. van Glabbeek. He provided a logical characterization of most of the\nsemantics in his spectrum but, without following a unique pattern. In this\npaper, we present a uniform logical characterization of all the semantics in\nthe enlarged spectrum. The common structure of the formulas that constitute all\nthe corresponding logics gives us a much clearer picture of the spectrum,\nclarifying the relations between the different semantics, and allows us to\ndevelop generic proofs of some general properties of the semantics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2011 00:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Romero-Hern\u00e1ndez", "David", "", "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"], ["de Frutos-Escrig", "David", "", "Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain"]]}, {"id": "1108.3260", "submitter": "Esra Erdem", "authors": "Thomas Eiter and Esra Erdem and Halit Erdogan and Michael Fink", "title": "Finding Similar/Diverse Solutions in Answer Set Programming", "comments": "57 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables.

With\nthis motivation, we studied several decision/optimization versions of this\nproblem in the context of Answer Set Programming (ASP), analyzed their\ncomputational complexity, and introduced offline/online methods to compute\nsimilar/diverse solutions of such computational problems with respect to a\ngiven distance function. All these methods rely on the idea of computing\nsolutions to a problem by means of finding the answer sets for an ASP program\nthat describes the problem. The offline methods compute all solutions in\nadvance using the ASP formulation of the problem with an ASP solver, like\nClasp, and then identify similar/diverse solutions using clustering methods.\nThe online methods compute similar/diverse solutions following one of the three\napproaches: by reformulating the ASP representation of the problem to compute\nsimilar/diverse solutions at once using an ASP solver; by computing\nsimilar/diverse solutions iteratively (one after other) using an ASP solver; by\nmodifying the search algorithm of an ASP solver to compute similar/diverse\nsolutions incrementally. We modified Clasp to implement the last online method\nand called it Clasp-NK. In the first two online methods, the given distance\nfunction is represented in ASP; in the last one it is implemented in C++. We\nshowed the applicability and the effectiveness of these methods on\nreconstruction of similar/diverse phylogenies for Indo-European languages, and\non several planning problems in Blocks World.

The\ntranslation is computable if the consequence relation is decidable. More\ngenerally, we show that one can take instead of CPC a broad class of logics\n(extensions of a certain fragment of full Lambek calculus FL) including most\nnonclassical logics studied in the literature, hence in a sense, (almost) any\ntwo reasonable deductive systems can be conservatively translated into each\nother. We also provide some counterexamples, in particular the paraconsistent\nlogic LP is not universal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 15:26:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 15:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Je\u0159\u00e1bek", "Emil", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.6274", "submitter": "Rainer L\\\"udecke", "authors": "Rainer L\\\"udecke", "title": "Every Formula-Based Logic Program Has a Least Infinite-Valued Model", "comments": "This paper appears in the Proceedings of the 19th International\n  Conference on Applications of Declarative Programming and Knowledge\n  Management (INAP 2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Every definite logic program has as its meaning a least Herbrand model with\nrespect to the program-independent ordering \"set-inclusion\". In the case of\nnormal logic programs there do not exist least models in general. However,\naccording to a recent approach by Rondogiannis and Wadge, who consider\ninfinite-valued models, every normal logic program does have a least model with\nrespect to a program-independent ordering. We show that this approach can be\nextended to formula-based logic programs (i.e., finite sets of rules of the\nform A\\leftarrowF where A is an atom and F an arbitrary first-order formula).\nWe construct for a given program P an interpretation M_P and show that it is\nthe least of all models of P.
