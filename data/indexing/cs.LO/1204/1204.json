Unlike classical counter abstraction\n(used in the analysis of parameterized systems with unordered or unstructured\ntopologies) the new representation is tailored for proving properties of\nlinearly ordered parameterized systems, i.e., systems with arbitrary many\nfinite processes placed in an array. The relative positions in the array\ncapture the relative priorities of the processes. Configurations of such\nsystems are finite words of arbitrary lengths. The processes communicate using\nglobal transitions constrained by their relative priorities. Intuitively, an\nelement of the symbolic representation has a base and a set of counters. It\ndenotes configurations that respect the constraints imposed by the counters and\nthat have the base as a sub word. We use the new representation in a uniform\nand automatic Counter Example Guided Refinement scheme. We introduce a\nrelaxation operator that allows a well quasi ordering argument for the\ntermination of each iteration of the refinement loop. We explain how to refine\nthe relaxation to systematically prune out false positives. We implemented a\ntool to illustrate the approach on a number of parameterized systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2012 20:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rezine", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0347", "submitter": "Robbert Krebbers", "authors": "Herman Geuvers, Robbert Krebbers, James McKinna", "title": "The lambda-mu-T-calculus", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apal.2012.05.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Calculi with control operators have been studied as extensions of simple type\ntheory.

The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings and extends\nthe Magic Set (MS) optimization technique.\n  An important feature of disjunctive Datalog is nonmonotonicity, which calls\nfor nondeterministic implementations, such as backtracking search. A\ndistinguishing characteristic of the new method is that the optimization can be\nexploited also during the nondeterministic phase. In particular, after some\nassumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program may\nbecome irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for dynamic\npruning of the search space. In contrast, the effect of the previously defined\nMS methods for disjunctive Datalog is limited to the deterministic portion of\nthe process. In this way, the potential performance gain by using the proposed\nmethod can be exponential, as could be observed empirically.\n  The correctness of MS is established thanks to a strong relationship between\nMS and unfounded sets that has not been studied in the literature before. This\nknowledge allows for extending the method also to programs with stratified\nnegation in a natural way.\n  The proposed method has been implemented in DLV and various experiments have\nbeen conducted. Experimental results on synthetic data confirm the utility of\nMS for disjunctive Datalog, and they highlight the computational gain that may\nbe obtained by the new method w.r.t. the previously proposed MS methods for\ndisjunctive Datalog programs.

It is\nnatural to consider how to form a hierarchy based on SLUR. Such investigations\nwere started in [Cepek et al, 2012] and [Balyo et al, 2012]. We present what we\nconsider the \"limit hierarchy\" SLUR_k, based on generalising r_1 by r_k, that\nis, using generalised unit-clause-propagation introduced in [Kullmann, 1999,\n2004].\n  The class UC, studied in [Del Val, 1994], is the class of Unit refutation\nComplete clause-sets, that is, those clause-sets for which unsatisfiability is\ndecidable by r_1 under any falsifying assignment. For unsatisfiable clause-sets\nF, the minimum k such that r_k determines unsatisfiability of F is exactly the\n\"hardness\" of F, as introduced in [Ku 99, 04]. For satisfiable F we use now an\nextension mentioned in [Ansotegui et al, 2008]: The hardness is the minimum k\nsuch that after application of any falsifying partial assignments, r_k\ndetermines unsatisfiability. The class UC_k is given by the clause-sets which\nhave hardness <= k. We observe that UC_1 is exactly UC.\n  UC_k has a proof-theoretic character, due to the relations between hardness\nand tree-resolution, while SLUR_k has an algorithmic character. The\ncorrespondence between r_k and k-times nested input resolution (or tree\nresolution using clause-space k+1) means that r_k has a dual nature: both\nalgorithmic and proof theoretic.
