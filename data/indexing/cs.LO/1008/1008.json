To overcome the complexity of verification of real-time\nsystems with dense dynamics, Dutertre and Sorea, proposed timeout and calender\nbased transition systems to model the behavior of real-time systems and\nverified safety properties using k-induction in association with bounded model\nchecking. In this work, we introduce a specification formalism for these models\nin terms of Timeout Transition Diagrams and capture their behavior in terms of\nsemantics of Timed Transition Systems. Further, we discuss a technique, which\nreduces the problem of verification of qualitative temporal properties on\ninfinite state space of (a large fragment of) these timeout and calender based\ntransition systems into that on clockless finite state models through a\ntwo-step process comprising of digitization and canonical finitary reduction.\nThis technique enables us to verify safety invariants for real-time systems\nusing finite state model-checking avoiding the complexity of infinite state\n(bounded) model checking and scale up models without applying techniques from\ninduction based proof methodology. Moreover, we can verify liveness properties\nfor real-time systems, which is not possible by using induction with infinite\nstate model checkers. We present examples of Fischer's Protocol, Train-Gate\nController, and TTA start-up algorithm to illustrate how such an approach can\nbe efficiently used for verifying safety, liveness, and timeliness properties\nspecified in LTL using finite state model checkers like SAL-smc and Spin.

A stream specification\nis a set of equations intended to define a stream. We propose a transformation\nfrom such a stream specification to a term rewriting system (TRS) in such a way\nthat termination of the resulting TRS implies that the stream specification is\nwell-defined, that is, admits a unique solution. As a consequence, proving\nwell-definedness of several interesting stream specifications can be done fully\nautomatically using present powerful tools for proving TRS termination. In\norder to increase the power of this approach, we investigate transformations\nthat preserve semantics and well-definedness. We give examples for which the\nabove mentioned technique applies for the ransformed specification while it\nfails for the original one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Aug 2010 08:14:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Sep 2010 09:31:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zantema", "Hans H", "", "Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, The Netherlands"]]}, {"id": "1008.3585", "submitter": "Fionn Murtagh", "authors": "Fionn Murtagh", "title": "Ultrametric and Generalized Ultrametric in Computational Logic and in\n  Data Analysis", "comments": "19 pp., 5 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Following a review of metric, ultrametric and generalized ultrametric, we\nreview their application in data analysis.

We revise an early proposal,\nnamely van Emden's Quantitative Logic Programming, and we improve it in two\nways. Firstly, we generalize van Emden's QLP to a generic scheme QLP(D)\nparameterized by any given Qualification Domain D, which must be a lattice\nsatisfying certain natural axioms. We present several interesting instances for\nD, one of which corresponds to van Emden's QLP. Secondly, we generalize van\nEmden's results by providing stronger ones, concerning both semantics and goal\nsolving. We present Qualified SLD Resolution over D, a sound and strongly\ncomplete goal solving procedure for QLP(D), which is applicable to open goals\nand can be efficiently implemented using CLP technology over any constraint\ndomain CD able to deal with qualification constraints over D.

This paper presents a mapping semantics from PEPA to ODEs\nbased on a numerical representation scheme, which extends the class of PEPA\nmodels that can be subjected to fluid approximation. Furthermore, we have\nestablished the fundamental characteristics of the derived ODEs, such as the\nexistence, uniqueness, boundedness and nonnegativeness of the solution. The\nconvergence of the solution as time tends to infinity for several classes of\nPEPA models, has been proved under some mild conditions. For general PEPA\nmodels, the convergence is proved under a particular condition, which has been\nrevealed to relate to some famous constants of Markov chains such as the\nspectral gap and the Log-Sobolev constant. This thesis has established the\nconsistency between the fluid approximation and the underlying CTMCs for PEPA,\ni.e. the limit of the solution is consistent with the equilibrium probability\ndistribution corresponding to a family of underlying density dependent CTMCs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Aug 2010 16:09:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Jie", ""], ["Hillston", "Jane", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.5029", "submitter": "Christian Drescher", "authors": "Christian Drescher and Toby Walsh", "title": "Reformulation of Global Constraints in Answer Set Programming", "comments": "Proceedings of AAAI'10 Workshop on Abstraction, Reformulation, and\n  Approximation.

We contribute a reduction of\nsymmetry detection to a graph automorphism problem which allows to extract\nsymmetries of a logic program from the symmetries of the constructed coloured\ngraph. We also propose an encoding of symmetry-breaking constraints in terms of\npermutation cycles and use only generators in this process which implicitly\nrepresent symmetries and always with exponential compression. These ideas are\nformulated as preprocessing and implemented in a completely automated flow that\nfirst detects symmetries from a given answer set program, adds\nsymmetry-breaking constraints, and can be applied to any existing answer set\nsolver. We demonstrate computational impact on benchmarks versus direct\napplication of the solver.\n  Furthermore, we explore symmetry breaking for answer set programming in two\ndomains: first, constraint answer set programming as a novel approach to\nrepresent and solve constraint satisfaction problems, and second, distributed\nnonmonotonic multi-context systems. In particular, we formulate a\ntranslation-based approach to constraint answer set solving which allows for\nthe application of our symmetry detection and symmetry breaking methods. To\ncompare their performance with a-priori symmetry breaking techniques, we also\ncontribute a decomposition of the global value precedence constraint that\nenforces domain consistency on the original constraint via the unit-propagation\nof an answer set solver. We evaluate both options in an empirical analysis.
