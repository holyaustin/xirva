In this model, Turing machines are not autonomous\nentities and find their meanings through the interaction between a computist\nand a universal processor, and thus due to evolution of the universal\nprocessor, the meanings of Turing machines could change. In this manuscript, we\ndiscuss persistently evolutionary intensions. We introduce a new semantics,\ncalled persistently evolutionary semantics, for predicate logic that the\nmeaning of function and predicate symbols are not already predetermined, and\npredicate and function symbols find their meaning through the interaction of\nthe subject with the language. In (classic) model theory, the mathematician who\nstudies a structure is assumed as a god who lives out of the structure, and the\nstudy of the mathematician does not effect the structure. The meaning of\npredicate and function symbols are assumed to be independent of the\nmathematician who does math. The persistently evolutionary semantics could be\nregarded as a start of \"Interactive Model Theory\" as a new paradigm in model\ntheory (similar to the paradigm of interactive computation). In interactive\nmodel theory, we suppose that a mathematical structure should consist of two\nparts: 1) an intelligent agent (a subject), and 2) an environment (language),\nand every things should find its meaning through the interaction of these two\nparts. We introduce persistently evolutionary Kripke structure for\npropositional and predicate logic. Also, we propose a persistently evolutionary\nKripke semantics for the notion of computation, where the intension of a code\nof a Turing machine persistently evolve. We show that in this Kripke model the\nsubject can never know P = NP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 06:20:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ramezanian", "Rasoul", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0158", "submitter": "Dimitri Hendriks", "authors": "Joerg Endrullis, Dimitri Hendriks and Rena Bakhshi", "title": "On the Complexity of Equivalence of Specifications of Infinite Objects", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the complexity of deciding the equality of infinite objects\nspecified by systems of equations, and of infinite objects specified by\nlambda-terms.

Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they\nmake the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a\nwinning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an\nartefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates,\ni.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically\npreferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies.\nThese map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the\nplayer whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional\nstrategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for\nwhich a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still\nwon by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next\nmove. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of\nthe player's positions sparse.\n  Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest\nstrategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse\nstrategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some\nexhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In\nthis paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to\nobtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We\nconsider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT\n(satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear\nprogramming.

We show that the problem is undecidable in general, but\nthat it becomes decidable under a suitable condition on the teacher which comes\nnaturally from the way samples are generated from failed simulation checks. The\nlatter problem is shown to be undecidable if we impose an additional condition\non the learner to always conjecture a \"minimum state\" hypothesis.
