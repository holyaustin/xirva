In contrast to the algorithm by Bjoerklund et al., we present our\nalgorithm directly for parity games which allows us to compare it to the\nalgorithm by Jurdzinski and Voege: We show that the valuations used in both\nalgorithm coincide on parity game arenas in which one player can \"surrender\".\nThus, our algorithm can also be seen as a generalization of the one by\nJurdzinski and Voege to non-deterministic strategies. Finally, using\nnon-deterministic strategies allows us to show that the number of improvement\nsteps is bound from above by O(1.724^n). For strategy-improvement algorithms,\nthis bound was previously only known to be attainable by using randomization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 08:32:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2008 09:37:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2008 08:51:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2012 14:26:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Luttenberger", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2947", "submitter": "Rafee Ebrahim Kamouna Ph.D.", "authors": "Rafee Ebrahim Kamouna", "title": "The Kleene-Rosser Paradox, The Liar's Paradox & A Fuzzy Logic\n  Programming Paradox Imply SAT is (NOT) NP-complete", "comments": "Submitted to the ACM Transactions on Computation Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  After examining the {\\bf P} versus {\\bf NP} problem against the Kleene-Rosser\nparadox of the $\\lambda$-calculus [94], it was found that it represents a\ncounter-example to NP-completeness.
