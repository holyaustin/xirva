The workshop took place in\nSaarbruecken, Germany, on April 2nd, 2011, as part of the fourteenth edition of\nthe European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011).\nResearch in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to\npractical issues. Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common\nsubexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of\ncomputations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research\nareas, for instance : the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting\nby (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical\nabstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming languages. Term\ngraphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic computation\nsystems working on shared structures. The aim of this workshop is to bring\ntogether researchers working in different domains on term and graph\ntransformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for\npresenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn\nabout current activities in term graph rewriting. These proceedings contain six\naccepted papers and the abstracts of three invited talks. All submissions were\nsubject to careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers range over a wide\nspectrum, including theoretical aspects of term graph rewriting, proof methods,\nsemantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Feb 2011 02:27:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Echahed", "Rachid", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2366", "submitter": "Jeroen Keiren", "authors": "Sjoerd Cranen, Jeroen J.

The aim of the SecCo workshop\nseries is to cover the gap between the security and the concurrency\ncommunities. More precisely, the workshop promotes the exchange of ideas,\ntrying to focus on common interests and stimulating discussions on central\nresearch questions. In particular, we called for papers dealing with security\nissues (such as authentication, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, access\ncontrol, denial of service, service availability, safety aspects, fault\ntolerance, trust, language-based security, probabilistic and information\ntheoretic models) in emerging fields like web services, mobile ad-hoc networks,\nagent-based infrastructures, peer-to-peer systems, context-aware computing,\nglobal/ubiquitous/pervasive computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 05:22:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", "", "University of Eindhoven, Netherlands"], ["Cortier", "V\u00e9ronique", "", "LORIA-CNRS, France"]]}, {"id": "1102.5495", "submitter": "David Nowak", "authors": "Sylvain Heraud and David Nowak", "title": "A Formalization of Polytime Functions", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-22863-6_11", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.CR cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a deep embedding of Bellantoni and Cook's syntactic\ncharacterization of polytime functions.

While most\nsecurity analysis techniques need to cope with some notions of information\nlocality and knowledge propagation, usually they do not provide a general\nlanguage for expressing arbitrary properties involving local knowledge and\nknowledge transfer. Building on this observation, we introduce a framework for\nsecurity protocol analysis based on dynamic spatial logic specifications. Our\ncomputational model is a variant of existing pi-calculi, while specifications\nare expressed in a dynamic spatial logic extended with an epistemic operator.\nWe present the syntax and semantics of the model and logic, and discuss the\nexpressiveness of the approach, showing it complete for passive attackers. We\nalso prove that generic Dolev-Yao attackers may be mechanically determined for\nany deterministic finite protocol, and discuss how this result may be used to\nreason about security properties of open systems.

The definitions are adaptations of\nsimilar, well-accepted definitions introduced earlier in the framework of\nlabelled transition systems. The interpretation of intransitive\nnon-interference which we propose for Petri nets is as follows. A Petri net\nrepresents the composition of a controlled and a controller systems, possibly\nsharing places and transitions. Low transitions represent local actions of the\ncontrolled system, high transitions represent local decisions of the\ncontroller, and downgrading transitions represent synchronized actions of both\ncomponents. Intransitive non-interference means the impossibility for the\ncontrolled system to follow any local strategy that would force or dodge\nsynchronized actions depending upon the decisions taken by the controller after\nthe last synchronized action. The fact that both language equivalence and\nbisimulation equivalence are undecidable for unbounded labelled Petri nets\nmight be seen as an indication that non-interference properties based on these\nequivalences cannot be decided. We prove the opposite, providing results of\ndecidability of non-interference over a representative class of infinite state\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 03:38:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Best", "Eike", "", "Oldenburg"], ["Darondeau", "Philippe", "", "Rennes"], ["Gorrieri", "Roberto", "", "Bologna"]]}, {"id": "1102.5638", "submitter": "Paritosh Pandya", "authors": "Paritosh K.
