The presence of function\nsymbols in the program may render the ground instantiation infinite, and\nfiniteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure, in the\ngeneral case, are not guaranteed anymore. Since the program termination problem\nis undecidable in the general case, several decidable criteria (called program\ntermination criteria) have been recently proposed. However, current conditions\nare not able to identify even simple programs, whose bottom-up execution always\nterminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checking\ntermination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation,\nby deeply analyzing the program structure. First, we analyze the propagation of\ncomplex terms among arguments by means of the extended version of the argument\ngraph called propagation graph. The resulting criterion, called\nGamma-acyclicity, generalizes most of the decidable criteria proposed so far.\nNext, we study how rules may activate each other and define a more powerful\ncriterion, called safety. This criterion uses the so-called safety function\nable to analyze how rules may activate each other and how the presence of some\narguments in a rule limits its activation. We also study the application of the\nproposed criteria to bound queries and show that the safety criterion is\nwell-suited to identify relevant classes of programs and bound queries.\nFinally, we propose a hierarchy of classes of terminating programs, called\nk-safety, where the k-safe class strictly includes the (k-1)-safe class.

Both techniques\nprovide finite symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to stochastic\nswitched systems under some stability assumptions on the concrete model. This\nallows formally synthesizing controllers (switching signals) that are valid for\nthe concrete system over the finite symbolic model, by means of mature\nautomata-theoretic techniques in the literature.

The algorithm\nlooks for a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant, made of\nwell-founded relations of height omega, and if it finds it, it deduces the\ntermination for the while-if program using the Termination Theorem.\n  This raises an interesting question: What is the status of reduction\nrelations having a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant where each\nrelation has height omega?

In particular, we focus on a specific form of deadlock\nwhich is useful for the cache coherence protocol domain and consistent with the\ninternal definition of deadlock in the Murphi model checker: we refer to this\ndeadlock as a system- wide deadlock (s-deadlock). In s-deadlock, the entire\nsystem gets blocked and is unable to make any transition. Cache coherence\nprotocols consist of N symmetric cache agents, where N is an unbounded\nparameter; thus the verification of s-deadlock freedom is naturally a\nparameterized verification problem. Parametrized verification techniques work\nby using sound abstractions to reduce the unbounded model to a bounded model.\nEfficient abstractions which work well for industrial scale protocols typically\nbound the model by replacing the state of most of the agents by an abstract\nenvironment, while keeping just one or two agents as is. However, leveraging\nsuch efficient abstractions becomes a challenge for s-deadlock: a violation of\ns-deadlock is a state in which the transitions of all of the unbounded number\nof agents cannot occur and so a simple abstraction like the one above will not\npreserve this violation. In this work we address this challenge by presenting a\ntechnique which leverages high-level information about the protocols, in the\nform of message sequence dia- grams referred to as flows, for constructing\ninvariants that are collectively stronger than s-deadlock.

In this paper we present PTRANS, a domain-specific\nlanguage for formal specification of compiler transformations, and describe its\nexecutable semantics. The fundamental approach of PTRANS is to describe program\ntransformations as rewrites on control flow graphs with temporal logic side\nconditions. The syntax of PTRANS allows cleaner, more comprehensible\nspecification of program optimizations; its executable semantics allows these\nspecifications to act as prototypes for the optimizations themselves, so that\ncandidate optimizations can be tested and refined before going on to include\nthem in a compiler. We demonstrate the use of PTRANS to state, test, and refine\nthe specification of a redundant store elimination optimization on parallel\nprograms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 03:23:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mansky", "William", "", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], ["Griffith", "Dennis", "", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"], ["Gunter", "Elsa L.", "", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"]]}, {"id": "1407.8427", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Ross Duncan (University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kingdom),\n  Prakash Panangaden (McGill University, Montreal, Canada)", "title": "Proceedings 9th Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 158, 2014", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.158", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the ninth workshop on Quantum Physics\nand Logic (QPL2012) which took place in Brussels from the 10th to the 12th of\nOctober 2012.\n  QPL2012 brought together researchers working on mathematical foundations of\nquantum physics, quantum computing, and spatio-temporal causal structures.
