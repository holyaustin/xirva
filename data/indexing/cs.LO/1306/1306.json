In the case of unsatisfiable specifications\nunsatisfiable cores (UCs), i.e., parts of an unsatisfiable formula that are\nthemselves unsatisfiable, are a well established means for debugging. However,\nlittle work has been done to help understanding a UC of an unsatisfiable LTL\nformula. In this paper we suggest to enhance a UC of an unsatisfiable LTL\nformula with additional information about the time points at which the\nsubformulas of the UC are relevant for unsatisfiability. For example, in \"(G p)\nand (X not p)\" the first occurrence of \"p\" is really only \"relevant\" for\nunsatisfiability at time point 1 (time starts at time point 0).

The development of efficient ASP\nsystems is, thus, crucial. Having in mind the task of improving the solving\nmethods for ASP, there are two usual ways to reach this goal: $(i)$ extending\nstate-of-the-art techniques and ASP solvers, or $(ii)$ designing a new ASP\nsolver from scratch. An alternative to these trends is to build on top of\nstate-of-the-art solvers, and to apply machine learning techniques for choosing\nautomatically the \"best\" available solver on a per-instance basis.\n  In this paper we pursue this latter direction. We first define a set of\ncheap-to-compute syntactic features that characterize several aspects of ASP\nprograms. Then, we apply classification methods that, given the features of the\ninstances in a {\\sl training} set and the solvers' performance on these\ninstances, inductively learn algorithm selection strategies to be applied to a\n{\\sl test} set. We report the results of a number of experiments considering\nsolvers and different training and test sets of instances taken from the ones\nsubmitted to the \"System Track\" of the 3rd ASP Competition. Our analysis shows\nthat, by applying machine learning techniques to ASP solving, it is possible to\nobtain very robust performance: our approach can solve more instances compared\nwith any solver that entered the 3rd ASP Competition.
