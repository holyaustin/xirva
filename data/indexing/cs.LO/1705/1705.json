Despite a strong desire to supplant many\naerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely\nremained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical\ncomponents. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive\nprocessing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous\nchallenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships\nthrough precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback\ncontrol. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic\nlayers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material\nspecifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control\nsystem, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently\nevolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic\nspecifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly\ncoupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required\nparameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can\nbe modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications.

The game is played by\nmoving a token throughout a graph to produce an infinite path. There are\nseveral common modes to determine how the players move the token through the\ngraph; e.g., in turn-based games the players alternate turns in moving the\ntoken. We study the {\\em bidding} mode of moving the token, which, to the best\nof our knowledge, has never been studied in infinite-duration games. The\nfollowing bidding rule was previously defined and called Richman bidding. Both\nplayers have separate {\\em budgets}, which sum up to $1$. In each turn, a\nbidding takes place: Both players submit bids simultaneously, where a bid is\nlegal if it does not exceed the available budget, and the higher bidder pays\nhis bid to the other player and moves the token. The central question studied\nin bidding games is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning the\ngame: a {\\em threshold} budget in a vertex is a value $t \\in [0,1]$ such that\nif Player $1$'s budget exceeds $t$, he can win the game, and if Player $2$'s\nbudget exceeds $1-t$, he can win the game. Threshold budgets were previously\nshown to exist in every vertex of a reachability game, which have an\ninteresting connection with {\\em random-turn} games -- a sub-class of simple\nstochastic games in which the player who moves is chosen randomly. We show the\nexistence of threshold budgets for a qualitative class of infinite-duration\ngames, namely parity games, and a quantitative class, namely mean-payoff games.\nThe key component of the proof is a quantitative solution to strongly-connected\nmean-payoff bidding games in which we extend the connection with random-turn\ngames to these games, and construct explicit optimal strategies for both\nplayers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 13:53:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 10:36:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2019 10:02:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Avni", "Guy", ""], ["Henzinger", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Chonev", "Ventsislav", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.01477", "submitter": "Alexey Ignatiev", "authors": "Alexey Ignatiev, Antonio Morgado, and Joao Marques-Silva", "title": "On Tackling the Limits of Resolution in SAT Solving", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The practical success of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers stems from the\nCDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) approach to SAT solving.

We refer to them as the\ninner and the outer type theory. In our case of interest, the inner theory is\nhomotopy type theory (HoTT) which may include univalent universes and higher\ninductive types. The outer theory is a traditional form of type theory\nvalidating uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP). One point of view on it is as\ninternalised meta-theory of the inner type theory.\n  There are two motivations for 2LTT. Firstly, there are certain results about\nHoTT which are of meta-theoretic nature, such as the statement that\nsemisimplicial types up to level $n$ can be constructed in HoTT for any\nexternally fixed natural number $n$. Such results cannot be expressed in HoTT\nitself, but they can be formalised and proved in 2LTT, where $n$ will be a\nvariable in the outer theory. This point of view is inspired by observations\nabout conservativity of presheaf models.\n  Secondly, 2LTT is a framework which is suitable for formulating additional\naxioms that one might want to add to HoTT. This idea is heavily inspired by\nVoevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), which constitutes one specific instance\nof a 2LTT. HTS has an axiom ensuring that the type of natural numbers behaves\nlike the external natural numbers, which allows the construction of a universe\nof semisimplicial types. In 2LTT, this axiom can be stated simply be asking the\ninner and outer natural numbers to be isomorphic.\n  After defining 2LTT, we set up a collection of tools with the goal of making\n2LTT a convenient language for future developments. As a first such\napplication, we develop the theory of Reedy fibrant diagrams in the style of\nShulman. Continuing this line of thought, we suggest a definition of\n(infinity,1)-category and give some examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 May 2017 13:15:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 09:48:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:32:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Annenkov", "Danil", ""], ["Capriotti", "Paolo", ""], ["Kraus", "Nicolai", ""], ["Sattler", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03392", "submitter": "Hans van Ditmarsch", "authors": "Philippe Balbiani, Hans van Ditmarsch, Sa\\'ul Fern\\'andez Gonz\\'alez", "title": "Asynchronous Announcements", "comments": "Originally presented at workshop Strategic Reasoning 2017 Liverpool", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.DC cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a multi-agent epistemic logic of asynchronous announcements, where\ntruthful announcements are publicly sent but individually received by agents,\nand in the order in which they were sent.

Patterns can specify separation requirements at any level\nin any program configuration, not only in the heaps or stores, without any\nspecial logical constructs for that: the very nature of pattern matching is\nthat if two structures are matched as part of a pattern, then they can only be\nspatially separated. Like FOL, matching logic can also be translated into pure\npredicate logic with equality, at the same time admitting its own sound and\ncomplete proof system. A practical aspect of matching logic is that FOL\nreasoning with equality remains sound, so off-the-shelf provers and SMT solvers\ncan be used for matching logic reasoning.

While the approach is inspired from debugging in\nimperative programming, it is conceptually different to stepping in other\nparadigms due to non-determinism and declarativity that are inherent to ASP. In\nparticular, unlike statements in an imperative program that are executed\nfollowing a strict control flow, there is no predetermined order in which to\nconsider rules in ASP during a computation. In our approach, the user is free\nto decide which rule to consider active in the next step following his or her\nintuition. This way, one can focus on interesting parts of the debugging search\nspace. Bugs are detected during stepping by revealing differences between the\nactual semantics of the program and the expectations of the user. As a solid\nformal basis for stepping, we develop a framework of computations for\nanswer-set programs.

However,\nunlike term rewriting, rewriting string diagrams results in shorter equational\nproofs, because the string diagrammatic representation allows us to formally\nestablish equalities modulo any rewrite steps which follow from the monoidal\nstructure.\n  Manipulating string diagrams by hand is a time-consuming and error-prone\nprocess, especially for large string diagrams. This can be ameliorated by using\nsoftware proof assistants, such as Quantomatic.\n  However, reasoning about concrete string diagrams may be limiting and in some\nscenarios it is necessary to reason about entire (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams. When doing so, we face the same problems as for manipulating concrete\nstring diagrams, but in addition, we risk making further mistakes if we are not\nprecise enough about the way we represent (infinite) families of string\ndiagrams.\n  The primary goal of this thesis is to design a mathematical framework for\nequational reasoning about infinite families of string diagrams which is\namenable to computer automation. We will be working with context-free families\nof string diagrams and we will represent them using context-free graph\ngrammars. We will model equations between infinite families of diagrams using\nrewrite rules between context-free grammars. Our framework represents\nequational reasoning about concrete string diagrams and context-free families\nof string diagrams using double-pushout rewriting on graphs and context-free\ngraph grammars respectively.

We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a few\nexamples, including the design of embedded controllers for aircraft power\ndistribution networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 18:24:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 03:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jiwei", ""], ["Nuzzo", "Pierluigi", ""], ["Sangiovanni-Vincentelli", "Alberto", ""], ["Xi", "Yugeng", ""], ["Li", "Dewei", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09349", "submitter": "Pavel Naumov", "authors": "Pavel Naumov and Jia Tao", "title": "Together We Know How to Achieve: An Epistemic Logic of Know-How", "comments": "An extended abstract of this paper will appear in Proceedings of 16th\n  conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK-17),\n  Liverpool, United Kingdom, July 24-26, 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LO cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The existence of a coalition strategy to achieve a goal does not necessarily\nmean that the coalition has enough information to know how to follow the\nstrategy.
