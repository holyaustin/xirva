Roughly speaking, decisiveness\nallows one to lift most good properties from finite Markov chains to\ndenumerable ones, and therefore to adapt existing verification algorithms to\ninfinite-state models. Decisive Markov chains however do not encompass\nstochastic real-time systems, and general stochastic transition systems (STSs\nfor short) are needed. In this article, we provide a framework to perform both\nthe qualitative and the quantitative analysis of STSs. First, we define various\nnotions of decisiveness (inherited from [1]), notions of fairness and of\nattractors for STSs, and make explicit the relationships between them. Then, we\ndefine a notion of abstraction, together with natural concepts of soundness and\ncompleteness, and we give general transfer properties, which will be central to\nseveral verification algorithms on STSs. We further design a generic\nconstruction which will be useful for the analysis of {\\omega}-regular\nproperties, when a finite attractor exists, either in the system (if it is\ndenumerable), or in a sound denumerable abstraction of the system. We next\nprovide algorithms for qualitative model-checking, and generic approximation\nprocedures for quantitative model-checking. Finally, we instantiate our\nframework with stochastic timed automata (STA), generalized semi-Markov\nprocesses (GSMPs) and stochastic time Petri nets (STPNs), three models\ncombining dense-time and probabilities. This allows us to derive decidability\nand approximability results for the verification of these models. Some of these\nresults were known from the literature, but our generic approach permits to\nview them in a unified framework, and to obtain them with less effort.

They have also extended their polynomial soundness algorithm\nto an intermediate class of acyclic, non-deterministic negotiations. However,\nthey did not analyze the runtime of the extended algorithm, and also left open\nthe complexity of the soundness problem for the intermediate class.

This paper compares the\nhandshakes of TCP and SCTP to discuss its shortcomings and strengths. We\npresent an Uppaal model of the TCP three-way handshake and SCTP four-way\nhandshake and show that SCTP is able to cope with the presence of an\nIllegitimate Client, while TCP fails. The results confirm that SCTP is better\nequipped to deal with this type of attack.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 02:46:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Saini", "Shruti", "", "University of the South Pacific"], ["Fehnker", "Ansgar", "", "University of Twente"]]}, {"id": "1703.06569", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Rob van Glabbeek (Data61, CSIRO), Peter H\\\"ofner (Data61, CSIRO)", "title": "Split, Send, Reassemble: A Formal Specification of a CAN Bus Protocol\n  Stack", "comments": "In Proceedings MARS 2017, arXiv:1703.05812", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 244, 2017, pp. 14-52", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.244.2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a formal model for a fragmentation and a reassembly protocol\nrunning on top of the standardised CAN bus, which is widely used in automotive\nand aerospace applications.

In particular, it\nis demonstrated that ATS can readily accommodate a paradigm referred to as\nprogramming with theorem-proving (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are\nconstructed in a syntactically intertwined manner, yielding a practical\napproach to internalizing constraint-solving needed during type-checking. The\nkey salient feature of ATS lies in a complete separation between statics, where\ntypes are formed and reasoned about, and dynamics, where programs are\nconstructed and evaluated. With this separation, it is no longer possible for a\nprogram to occur in a type as is otherwise allowed in PTS.

This motivates a general approach to dialectical rough sets\nbuilding on previous work of the present author and figures of opposition. In\nthis paper dialectical rough logics are invented from a semantic perspective, a\nconcept of dialectical predicates is formalised, connection with dialetheias\nand glutty negation are established, parthood analyzed and studied from the\nviewpoint of classical and dialectical figures of opposition by the present\nauthor. Her methods become more geometrical and encompass parthood as a primary\nrelation (as opposed to roughly equivalent objects) for algebraic semantics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 21:52:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2018 19:56:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mani", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10258", "submitter": "Andrea Aler Tubella", "authors": "Andrea Aler Tubella and Alessio Guglielmi", "title": "Subatomic Proof Systems: Splittable Systems", "comments": "32 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3173544", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents the first in a series of results that allow us to develop\na theory providing finer control over the complexity of normalisation, and in\nparticular of cut elimination. By considering atoms as self-dual\nnon-commutative connectives, we are able to classify a vast class of inference\nrules in a uniform and very simple way. This allows us to define simple\nconditions that are easily verifiable and that ensure normalisation and cut\nelimination by way of a general theorem. In this paper we define and consider\nsplittable systems, which essentially comprise a large class of linear logics,\nincluding MLL and BV, and we prove for them a splitting theorem, guaranteeing\ncut elimination and other admissibility results as corollaries. In papers to\nfollow, we will extend this result to non-linear logics. The final outcome will\nbe a comprehensive theory giving a uniform treatment for most existing logics\nand providing a blueprint for the design of future proof systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 22:47:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 12:22:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Tubella", "Andrea Aler", ""], ["Guglielmi", "Alessio", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10382", "submitter": "Thorsten Wissmann", "authors": "Flavien Breuvart and Giulio Manzonetto and Domenico Ruoppolo", "title": "Relational Graph Models at Work", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 14, Issue 3 (July 20,\n  2018) lmcs:4701", "doi": "10.23638/LMCS-14(3:2)2018", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study the relational graph models that constitute a natural subclass of\nrelational models of lambda-calculus.

We then study\nrelational graph models that are fully abstract, in the sense that they capture\nsome observational equivalence between lambda-terms. We focus on the two main\nobservational equivalences in the lambda-calculus, the theory H+ generated by\ntaking as observables the beta-normal forms, and H* generated by considering as\nobservables the head normal forms. On the one hand we introduce a notion of\nlambda-K\\\"onig model and prove that a relational graph model is fully abstract\nfor H+ if and only if it is extensional and lambda-K\\\"onig.
