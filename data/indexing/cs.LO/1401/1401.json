The advent of cirquent calculus arose from the need for a deductive\nsystem with a more explicit ability to reason about resources.

It is this resource sharing mechanism to\nwhich cirquent calculus owes its novelty (and its virtues). From its inception,\ncirquent calculus has been paired with an abstract resource semantics. This\nsemantics allows for reasoning about the interaction between a resource\nprovider and a resource user, where resources are understood in the their most\ngeneral and intuitive sense. Interpreting resources in a more restricted\ncomputational sense has made cirquent calculus instrumental in axiomatizing\nvarious fundamental fragments of Computability Logic, a formal theory of\n(interactive) computability. The so-called \"classical\" rules of cirquent\ncalculus, in the absence of the particularly troublesome contraction rule,\nproduce a sound and complete system CL5 for Computability Logic.

The qualitative-analysis problem given a\npartial-observation stochastic game and a parity objective asks whether there\nis a strategy to ensure that the objective is satisfied with probability~1\n(resp. positive probability). These qualtitative-analysis problems are known to\nbe undecidable. However in many applications the relevant question is the\nexistence of finite-memory strategies, and the qualitative-analysis problems\nunder finite-memory strategies was recently shown to be decidable in 2EXPTIME.\nWe improve the complexity and show that the qualitative-analysis problems for\npartial-observation stochastic parity games under finite-memory strategies are\nEXPTIME-complete; and also establish optimal (exponential) memory bounds for\nfinite-memory strategies required for qualitative analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 19:14:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Doyen", "Laurent", ""], ["Nain", "Sumit", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3325", "submitter": "Arno Pauly", "authors": "St\\'ephane Le Roux and Arno Pauly", "title": "Equilibria in multi-player multi-outcome infinite sequential games", "comments": "Section 8 of Version 1 is no longer part of the article, and will in\n  time be made available elsewhere; Section 7 of Version 2 has been expanded\n  into http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08912", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.GT math.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the existence of certain types of equilibria (Nash,\n$\\varepsilon$-Nash, subgame perfect, $\\varepsilon$-subgame perfect,\nPareto-optimal) in multi-player multi-outcome infinite sequential games.

In this work, we propose a generalization\nof the notions of unfounded set and well-founded semantics for programs with\nmonotone and antimonotone aggregates (LPAma programs). In particular, we\npresent a new notion of unfounded set for LPAma programs, which is a sound\ngeneralization of the original definition for standard (aggregate-free) LP. On\nthis basis, we define a well-founded operator for LPAma programs, the fixpoint\nof which is called well-founded model (or well-founded semantics) for LPAma\nprograms. The most important properties of unfounded sets and the well-founded\nsemantics for standard LP are retained by this generalization, notably\nexistence and uniqueness of the well-founded model, together with a strong\nrelationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one\nof the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for\na broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the\nwell-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss\nsome complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable\ncomputation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that\nfor general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither\nmonotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with\nrespect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a\nwell-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable\ncomputation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma\nprograms. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports\nthe well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only\nimplemented system that does so. Experiments with this prototype show\nsignificant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent\naggregate-free encodings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Alviano", "Mario", ""], ["Calimeri", "Francesco", ""], ["Faber", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Leone", "Nicola", ""], ["Perri", "Simona", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.4604", "submitter": "Bernardo Cuenca Grau", "authors": "Bernardo Cuenca Grau, Boris Motik, Giorgos Stoilos, Ian Horrocks", "title": "Completeness Guarantees for Incomplete Ontology Reasoners: Theory and\n  Practice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 43, pages\n  419-476, 2012", "doi": "10.1613/jair.3470", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To achieve scalability of query answering, the developers of Semantic Web\napplications are often forced to use incomplete OWL 2 reasoners, which fail to\nderive all answers for at least one query, ontology, and data set.
