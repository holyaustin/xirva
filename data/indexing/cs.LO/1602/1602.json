The\nintegration of imperative and declarative paradigms allows using the paradigm\nthat is most appropriate for expressing each requirement.

Semantic acyclicity has been studied in the constraint-free case,\nand deciding whether a query enjoys this property is NP-complete. However, in\ncase the database is subject to constraints such as tuple-generating\ndependencies (tgds) that can express, e.g., inclusion dependencies, or\nequality-generating dependencies (egds) that capture, e.g., functional\ndependencies, a CQ may turn out to be semantically acyclic under the\nconstraints while not semantically acyclic in general. This opens avenues to\nnew query optimization techniques. In this paper we initiate and develop the\ntheory of semantic acyclicity under constraints. More precisely, we study the\nfollowing natural problem: Given a CQ and a set of constraints, is the query\nsemantically acyclic under the constraints, or, in other words, is the query\nequivalent to an acyclic one over all those databases that satisfy the set of\nconstraints? We show that, contrary to what one might expect, decidability of\nCQ containment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the decidability\nof semantic acyclicity. In particular, we show that semantic acyclicity is\nundecidable in the presence of full tgds (i.e., Datalog rules). In view of this\nfact, we focus on the main classes of tgds for which CQ containment is\ndecidable, and do not capture the class of full tgds, namely guarded,\nnon-recursive and sticky tgds. For these classes we show that semantic\nacyclicity is decidable, and its complexity coincides with the complexity of CQ\ncontainment. In the case of egds, we show that for keys over unary and binary\npredicates semantic acyclicity is decidable (NP-complete).

In this paper, we propose an interval\nmethod that verifies the properties described by a bounded signal temporal\nlogic. We relax the problem so that if the verification process cannot succeed\nat the prescribed precision, it outputs an inconclusive result. The problem is\nsolved by an efficient and rigorous monitoring algorithm. This algorithm\nperforms a forward simulation of a continuous-time dynamical system, detects a\nset of time intervals in which the atomic propositions hold, and validates the\nproperty by propagating the time intervals. In each step, the continuous state\nat a certain time is enclosed by an interval vector that is proven to contain a\nunique solution. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of the proposed\nmethod in formal analysis of nonlinear and complex continuous systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 16:36:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ishii", "Daisuke", ""], ["Yonezaki", "Naoki", ""], ["Goldsztejn", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.02504", "submitter": "Eero Siivola", "authors": "Eero Siivola, Seppo Sierla, Hannu Niemist\\\"o, Tommi Karhela and\n  Valeriy Vyatkin", "title": "Requirement verification in simulation-based automation testing", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures.

We study polynomial-time problems in\ntwo classical models, graphs and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with respect\nto several fundamental $\\omega$-regular objectives, e.g., Rabin and Streett\nobjectives. For many of these problems the best-known upper bounds are\nquadratic or cubic, yet no super-linear lower bounds are known. In this work\nour contributions are two-fold: First, we present several improved algorithms,\nand second, we present the first conditional super-linear lower bounds based on\nwidely believed assumptions about the complexity of CNF-SAT and combinatorial\nBoolean matrix multiplication. A separation result for two models with respect\nto an objective means a conditional lower bound for one model that is strictly\nhigher than the existing upper bound for the other model, and similarly for two\nobjectives with respect to a model. Our results establish the following\nseparation results: (1) A separation of models (graphs and MDPs) for\ndisjunctive queries of reachability and B\\\"uchi objectives. (2) Two kinds of\nseparations of objectives, both for graphs and MDPs, namely, (2a) the\nseparation of dual objectives such as reachability/safety (for disjunctive\nquestions) and Streett/Rabin objectives, and (2b) the separation of conjunction\nand disjunction of multiple objectives of the same type such as safety,\nB\\\"uchi, and coB\\\"uchi.

We propose an extension of the\nCurry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions: to represent\nsolutions by possibly infinite terms of a dedicated lambda-calculus. This new,\ncomprehensive approach to proof search is exemplified with the sequent calculus\nLJT for intuitionistic implication logic. A finitary representation is\nproposed, comprising lambda-terms extended with a formal greatest fixed point,\nand a type system that can be seen as a logic of coinductive proofs. In the\nfinitary system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed form of binding that\nallows the detection of cycles through the type system. Formal sums are used to\nexpress alternatives in the search process. Moreover, formal sums are used in\nthe coinductive syntax to define \"decontraction\" (contraction bottom-up) - an\noperation whose theory we initiate in this paper. As a semantics, we assign a\ncoinductive lambda-term to each finitary term. The main result is the existence\nof an equivalent finitary representation for any full solution space expressed\ncoinductively. This result is the main ingredient in the proof that our logic\nof coinductive proofs is sound and complete with respect to the coinductive\nsemantics.
