Abstractly a clone is\na category with two objects such that one is a countably infinite power of the\nother. Left and right algebras over a clone are covariant and contravariant\nfunctors from the category to that of sets respectively. In this paper we show\nthat first-order logic can be studied effectively using the notions of right\nand left algebras over a clone. It is easy to translate the classical treatment\nof logic into our setting and prove all the fundamental theorems of first-order\ntheory algebraically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 17:36:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Zhaohua", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5074", "submitter": "Marcello M.

In a multi-paradigm approach to modeling, formalisms\nwith different natures are used in combination to describe complementary parts\nand aspects of the system. This can have a beneficial impact on the modeling\nactivity, as different paradigms an be better suited to describe different\naspects of the system. While each paradigm provides a different view on the\nmany facets of the system, it is of paramount importance that a coherent\ncomprehensive model emerges from the combination of the various partial\ndescriptions. In this paper we present a technique to model different aspects\nof the same system with different formalisms, while keeping the various models\ntightly integrated with one another. In addition, our approach leverages the\nflexibility provided by a bounded satisfiability checker to encode the\nverification problem of the integrated model in the propositional\nsatisfiability (SAT) problem; this allows users to carry out formal\nverification activities both on the whole model and on parts thereof. The\neffectiveness of the approach is illustrated through the example of a\nmonitoring system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2009 09:21:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bersani", "Marcello M.", ""], ["Furia", "Carlo A.", ""], ["Pradella", "Matteo", ""], ["Rossi", "Matteo", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5125", "submitter": "Florent Jacquemard", "authors": "Florent Jacquemard (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), Michael Rusinowitch\n  (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA / LIFC)", "title": "Rewrite based Verification of XML Updates", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-7007", "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider problems of access control for update of XML documents.
