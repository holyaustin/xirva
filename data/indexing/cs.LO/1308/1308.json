Some inherent notions to tccp processes are\nnon-determinism, dealing with partial information in states and the monotonic\nevolution of the information. In order to check an LTL property for a process,\nour approach is based on the abstract diagnosis technique. The concluding step\nof this technique needs to check the validity of an LTL formula (with\nconstraints) in an effective way.\n  In this paper, we present a decision method for the validity of temporal\nlogic formulas (with constraints) built by our abstract diagnosis technique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 20:52:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Comini", "Marco", ""], ["Titolo", "Laura", ""], ["Villanueva", "Alicia", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.4516", "submitter": "Zhe Chen", "authors": "Zhe Chen", "title": "On the Generative Power of Omega-Grammars and Omega-Automata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Fundamenta Informaticae 111(2):119-145 (2011)", "doi": "10.3233/FI-2011-557", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An \\omega-grammar is a formal grammar used to generate \\omega-words (i.e.\ninfinite length words), while an \\omega-automaton is an automaton used to\nrecognize \\omega-words.

Due to the\nintrinsic multi-scale nature of these systems in space, in organization levels\nand in time, it is extremely difficult to model them in a uniform way, e.g., by\nmeans of differential equations or discrete stochastic processes. Furthermore,\nsuch models are often not easily amenable to formal analysis, and their\nsimulations at the organ or even at the cell levels are frequently impractical.\nIndeed, an important open problem is finding appropriate computational models\nthat scale well for both simulation and formal analysis of biological\nprocesses. Hybrid modeling techniques, combining discrete and continuous\nprocesses, are gaining more and more attention in such a context, and they have\nbeen successfully applied to capture the behavior of many biological complex\nsystems, ranging from genetic networks, biochemical reactions, signaling\npathways, cardiac tissues electro-physiology, and tumor genesis.

The construction and properties of fixed points have been\ninvestigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of\nprogramming languages, logics, verification, databases. The aim of this\nworkshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results to\nthose members of the computer science and logic communities who study or apply\nthe theory of fixed points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2013 15:25:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Baelde", "David", "", "LSV, ENS Cachan"], ["Carayol", "Arnaud", "", "CNRS, Universit\u00e9\n  Paris-Est, Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e"]]}, {"id": "1308.6810", "submitter": "Michael Tautschnig", "authors": "Jade Alglave and Luc Maranget and Michael Tautschnig", "title": "Herding Cats - Modelling, simulation, testing, and data-mining for weak\n  memory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an axiomatic generic framework for modelling weak memory. We show\nhow to instantiate this framework for SC, TSO, C++ restricted to\nrelease-acquire atomics, and Power. For Power, we compare our model to a\npreceding operational model in which we found a flaw. To do so, we define an\noperational model that we show equivalent to our axiomatic model.\n  We also propose a model for ARM. Our testing on this architecture revealed a\nbehaviour later acknowledged as a bug by ARM, and more recently 33 additional\nanomalies.\n  We offer a new simulation tool, called herd, which allows the user to specify\nthe model of his choice in a concise way. Given a specification of a model, the\ntool becomes a simulator for that model. The tool relies on an axiomatic\ndescription; this choice allows us to outperform all previous simulation tools.\nAdditionally, we confirm that verification time is vastly improved, in the case\nof bounded model-checking.\n  Finally, we put our models in perspective, in the light of empirical data\nobtained by analysing the C and C++ code of a Debian Linux distribution. We\npresent our new analysis tool, called mole, which explores a piece of code to\nfind the weak memory idioms that it uses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:54:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 09:46:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 18:52:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 4 Oct 2013 10:20:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 9 Jan 2014 16:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Alglave", "Jade", ""], ["Maranget", "Luc", ""], ["Tautschnig", "Michael", ""]]}]
