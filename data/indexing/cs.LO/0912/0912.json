The papers are devoted to both membrane computing and\nbiologically inspired process calculi, as well as to other related formalisms.\nThe papers of this volume are selected by the programme committee due to their\nquality and relevance; they have defined an exciting programme highlighting\ninteresting problems and stimulating the search for novel ways of describing\nrelated biological phenomena. In addition, we had an invited talk given by Luca\nCardelli on a spatial process algebra for developmental biology. Membrane\nsystems were introduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices\ninspired by the observation that any biological system is a complex\nhierarchical structure, with a flow of materials and information that underlies\ntheir functioning. The emphasis is on the computational properties of the\nmodel, and it makes use of automata, languages, and complexity theoretic tools.\nOn the other hand, certain calculi such as mobile ambients and brane calculi\nwork with similar notions (compartments, membranes). These calculi are used to\nmodel and analyze the various biological systems. The workshop on Membrane\nComputing and Biologically Inspired Process Calculi brings together researchers\nworking in these fields to present their recent work and discuss new ideas\nconcerning the formalisms, their properties and relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 22:24:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ciobanu", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0228", "submitter": "Charles Sauerbier", "authors": "Charles Sauerbier", "title": "Answering Hilbert's 1st Problem", "comments": "7 pages, 0 figures; full revision of content to address critiques;\n  along with numerous complaints as to \"style\", \"quality\", and other nonsense\n  arising of opinion", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hilbert's first problem is of importance in relation to work being done in\ncomputational systems.

To overcome this limitation we propose several possible\nalternative parameters, namely diamond dimension, box dimension and modal\nwidth. We show fixed-parameter tractability results using these measures where\nthe exponential dependence on the parameters is much milder than in the case of\nmodality depth thus leading to FPT algorithms for modal satisfiability with\nmuch more reasonable running times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2009 05:31:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Achilleos", "Antonis", ""], ["Lampis", "Michael", ""], ["Mitsou", "Valia", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4947", "submitter": "Jakob Grue Simonsen Dr", "authors": "Jeroen Ketema, Jakob Grue Simonsen", "title": "Infinitary Combinatory Reduction Systems: Normalising Reduction\n  Strategies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 6, Issue 1 (February\n  26, 2010) lmcs:841", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-6(1:7)2010", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study normalising reduction strategies for infinitary Combinatory\nReduction Systems (iCRSs).
