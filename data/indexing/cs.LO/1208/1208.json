Already the\nmodelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal\nverification.\n  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring\non a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,\ncalled asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime\nverification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or\nvery complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.\nTherefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property\non the underlying system at runtime.\n  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as\nasynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the\nsame kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.\nA distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we\npropose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows\nthat if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of\ninfinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable\nunions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable.

FOCLASA 2012\nwas held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, on September 8, 2012 as a satellite event\nof CONCUR 2012, the 23rd International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The\nworkshop provides a venue where researchers and practitioners could meet,\nexchange ideas, identify common problems, determine some of the key and\nfundamental issues related to coordination languages and self adaptation, and\nexplore together and disseminate solutions. Indeed, a number of hot research\ntopics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent,\ndistributed, mobile and heterogeneous components, trying to harness the\nintrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. Computation nowadays is becoming\ninherently concurrent, either because of characteristics of the hardware (with\nmulticore processors becoming omnipresent) or due to the ubiquitous presence of\ndistributed systems (incarnated in the Internet). Computational systems are\ntherefore typically distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve\ncomposition of heterogeneous components. To specify and reason about such\nsystems and go beyond the functional correctness proofs, e.g., by supporting\nreusability and improving maintainability, approaches such as coordination\nlanguages and self adaptation are recognised as fundamental.\n  This year, we received 13 submissions involving 35 authors from 10 different\ncountries. Papers underwent a rigorous review process, and all accepted papers\nreceived 3 review reports. After the review process, the international Program\nCommittee of FOCLASA 2012 decided to select 8 papers for presentation during\nthe workshop and inclusion in these proceedings. These papers tackle different\nissues that are currently central to our community, self-adaptation and\ncoordination, processes and coordination, and type systems.

Still, LDiiP itself\nis classical (monotonic, non-constructive), negation-incomplete, and does not\nhave the disjunction property. The price to pay for the negation completeness\nof our interactive proofs is their non-monotonicity and non-communality (for\nsingleton agent communities only). As a normal modal logic, LDiiP enjoys a\nstandard Kripke-semantics, which we justify by invoking the Axiom of Choice on\nLiiP's and then construct in terms of a concrete oracle-computable function.\nLDiiP's agent-centric internalised notion of proof can also be viewed as a\nnegation-complete disjunctive explicit refinement of standard KD45-belief, and\nyields a disjunctive but negation-incomplete explicit refinement of\nS4-provability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 13:41:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 09:35:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 08:55:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kramer", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5915", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "G\\'erard Boudol (INRIA Sophia Antipolis), Gustavo Petri (Purdue\n  University), Bernard Serpette (INRIA Sophia Antipolis)", "title": "Relaxed Operational Semantics of Concurrent Programming Languages", "comments": "In Proceedings EXPRESS/SOS 2012, arXiv:1208.2440", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 89, 2012, pp. 19-33", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.89.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a novel, operational framework to formally describe the semantics\nof concurrent programs running within the context of a relaxed memory model.\nOur framework features a \"temporary store\" where the memory operations issued\nby the threads are recorded, in program order.
