In trust management, the policy\nstatements of a principal can refer to other principals' statements; thus, the\nprocess of evaluating an access request (i.e., a goal) consists of finding a\n\"chain\" of policy statements that allows the access to the requested resource.\nMost existing goal evaluation algorithms for trust management either rely on a\ncentralized evaluation strategy, which consists of collecting all the relevant\npolicy statements in a single location (and therefore they do not guarantee the\nconfidentiality of intensional policies), or do not detect the termination of\nthe computation (i.e., when all the answers of a goal are computed). In this\npaper we present GEM, a distributed goal evaluation algorithm for trust\nmanagement systems that relies on function-free logic programming for the\nspecification of policy statements. GEM detects termination in a completely\ndistributed way without disclosing intensional policies, thereby preserving\ntheir confidentiality. We demonstrate that the algorithm terminates and is\nsound and complete with respect to the standard semantics for logic programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2012 12:24:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Trivellato", "Daniel", ""], ["Zannone", "Nicola", ""], ["Etalle", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.0408", "submitter": "Arpit Sharma", "authors": "Arpit Sharma", "title": "A Two Step Perspective for Kripke Structure Reduction", "comments": "Accepted for Student Research Forum, 39th International Conference on\n  Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science (SOFSEM 2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for the state space\nreduction of Kripke structures.

An attractive feature of this theory is that with the correct\nhomotopical approach - homotopy slices, homotopy pullbacks, homotopy colimits,\netc. - the groupoid case looks exactly like the set case. After some standard\nexamples, I will illustrate the notion of data-types-with-symmetries with\nexamples from quantum field theory, where the symmetries of complicated tree\nstructures of graphs play a crucial role, and can be handled elegantly using\npolynomial functors over groupoids.

In the paper, we give a few examples\nillustrating the use of D-FLAT and describe the main features of the system.\nMoreover, we report experiments which show that ASP-based D-FLAT encodings for\nsome problems outperform monolithic ASP encodings on instances of small\ntreewidth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2012 08:39:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bliem", "Bernhard", ""], ["Morak", "Michael", ""], ["Woltran", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2028", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Marco Faella (Universit\\`a di Napoli \"Federico II\"), Aniello Murano\n  (Universit\\`a di Napoli \"Federico II\")", "title": "Proceedings Third International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics and\n  Formal Verification", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 96, 2012", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.96", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the Third International Symposium on\nGames, Automata, Logic and Formal Verification (GandALF), held in Naples\n(Italy) from September 6th to 8th, 2012.\n  GandALF was founded by a number of Italian computer scientists interested in\nmathematical logic, automata theory, game theory, and their applications to the\nspecification, design, and verification of complex systems.

An important Datalog extension is\nDisjunctive Datalog, which significantly increases the expressivity of the\nbasic language. Disjunctive Datalog is useful in a wide range of applications,\nranging from Databases (e.g., Data Integration) to Artificial Intelligence\n(e.g., diagnosis and planning under incomplete knowledge). However, in recent\nyears an important shortcoming of Datalog-based languages became evident, e.g.\nin the context of data-integration (consistent query-answering, ontology-based\ndata access) and Semantic Web applications: The language does not permit any\ngeneration of and reasoning with unnamed individuals in an obvious way. In\ngeneral, it is weak in supporting many cases of existential quantification. To\novercome this problem, Datalogex has recently been proposed, which extends\ntraditional Datalog by existential quantification in rule heads. In this work,\nwe propose a natural extension of Disjunctive Datalog and Datalogex, called\nDatalogexor, which allows both disjunctions and existential quantification in\nrule heads and is therefore an attractive language for knowledge representation\nand reasoning, especially in domains where ontology-based reasoning is needed.\nWe formally define syntax and semantics of the language Datalogexor, and\nprovide a notion of instantiation, which we prove to be adequate for\nDatalogexor. A main issue of Datalogex and hence also of Datalogexor is that\ndecidability is no longer guaranteed for typical reasoning tasks.

In\nthis paper, we show that there is a reason why we must deal with both kinds of\nsatisfiability separately -- we prove that there is a universal first-order\nformula that defines an elementary modal logic with decidable (global)\nsatisfiability problem, but undecidable finite satisfiability problem, and, the\nother way round, that there is a universal formula that defines an elementary\nmodal logic with decidable finite satisfiability problem, but undecidable\ngeneral satisfiability problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2012 03:49:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Michaliszyn", "Jakub", ""], ["Otop", "Jan", ""], ["Witkowski", "Piotr", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2605", "submitter": "Olivier Bouissou", "authors": "Assal\\'e Adj\\'e and Jean Goubault-Larrecq", "title": "Concrete Semantics of Programs with Non-Deterministic and Random Inputs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This document gives semantics to programs written in a C-like programming\nlanguage, featuring interactions with an external environment with noisy and\nimprecise data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2012 09:09:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Adj\u00e9", "Assal\u00e9", ""], ["Goubault-Larrecq", "Jean", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2610", "submitter": "Pierre Lescanne", "authors": "Katarzyna Grygiel, Pierre Lescanne (LIP)", "title": "Counting and generating lambda terms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lambda calculus is the basis of functional programming and higher order proof\nassistants. However, little is known about combinatorial properties of lambda\nterms, in particular, about their asymptotic distribution and random\ngeneration. This paper tries to answer questions like: How many terms of a\ngiven size are there? What is a \"typical\" structure of a simply typable term?\nDespite their ostensible simplicity, these questions still remain unanswered,\nwhereas solutions to such problems are essential for testing compilers and\noptimizing programs whose expected efficiency depends on the size of terms. Our\napproach toward the afore-mentioned problems may be later extended to any\nlanguage with bound variables, i.e., with scopes and declarations. This paper\npresents two complementary approaches: one, theoretical, uses complex analysis\nand generating functions, the other, experimental, is based on a generator of\nlambda-terms. Thanks to de Bruijn indices, we provide three families of\nformulas for the number of closed lambda terms of a given size and we give four\nrelations between these numbers which have interesting combinatorial\ninterpretations. As a by-product of the counting formulas, we design an\nalgorithm for generating lambda terms. Performed tests provide us with\nexperimental data, like the average depth of bound variables and the average\nnumber of head lambdas. We also create random generators for various sorts of\nterms. Thereafter, we conduct experiments that answer questions like: What is\nthe ratio of simply typable terms among all terms? (Very small!) How are simply\ntypable lambda terms distributed among all lambda terms? (A typable term almost\nalways starts with an abstraction.)

LTL is not expressive\nenough to formalize the correctness of reactive systems with respect to some\nquantitative aspects. This paper extends the qualitative LTL synthesis setting\nto a quantitative setting. The alphabet of actions is extended with a weight\nfunction ranging over the rational numbers. The value of an infinite word is\nthe mean-payoff of the weights of its letters. The synthesis problem then\namounts to automatically construct (if possible) a reactive system whose\nexecutions all satisfy a given LTL formula and have mean-payoff values greater\nthan or equal to some given threshold. The latter problem is called LTLMP\nsynthesis and the LTLMP realizability problem asks to check whether such a\nsystem exists. We first show that LTLMP realizability is not more difficult\nthan LTL realizability: it is 2ExpTime-Complete. This is done by reduction to\ntwo-player mean-payoff parity games. While infinite memory strategies are\nrequired to realize LTLMP specifications in general, we show that\nepsilon-optimality can be obtained with finite memory strategies, for any\nepsilon > 0. To obtain an efficient algorithm in practice, we define a\nSafraless procedure to decide whether there exists a finite-memory strategy\nthat realizes a given specification for some given threshold. This procedure is\nbased on a reduction to two-player energy safety games which are in turn\nreduced to safety games.

Adaptable\nprocesses have a location and are sensible to actions of dynamic update at\nruntime; this allows to express a wide range of evolvability patterns for\nconcurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of adaptable processes and\npropose two verification problems for them: bounded and eventual adaptation.\nWhile the former ensures that the number of consecutive erroneous states that\ncan be traversed during a computation is bound by some given number k, the\nlatter ensures that if the system enters into a state with errors then a state\nwithout errors will be eventually reached. We study the (un)decidability of\nthese two problems in several variants of the calculus, which result from\nconsidering dynamic and static topologies of adaptable processes as well as\ndifferent evolvability patterns.
