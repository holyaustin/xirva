A fundamental question in this was how to represent some\nbasic concepts: since set theory is available inside Isabelle/HOL, when\nintroducing new definitions there is often the issue of balancing the amount of\nset-theoretical objects and of objects expressed using entities which are more\ntypical of higher order logic such as functions or lists.

Such decisions have consequences for the proof\ndevelopment and the usability of the formalization. For instance, sets are\nusually closer to the representation that economists would use and recognize,\nwhile the other objects are closer to the extraction of computational content.\nIn this paper we give examples of the advantages and disadvantages for these\napproaches and their relationships.

As opposed to\ntraditional verification, where one handles the question of whether a system\nsatisfies, or not, a given specification, reasoning about quality addresses the\nquestion of \\emph{how well} the system satisfies the specification. One\ndirection in this effort is to refine the \"eventually\" operators of temporal\nlogic to {\\em discounting operators}: the satisfaction value of a specification\nis a value in $[0,1]$, where the longer it takes to fulfill eventuality\nrequirements, the smaller the satisfaction value is.\n  In this paper we introduce an augmentation by discounting of Linear Temporal\nLogic (LTL), and study it, as well as its combination with propositional\nquality operators. We show that one can augment LTL with an arbitrary set of\ndiscounting functions, while preserving the decidability of the model-checking\nproblem. Further augmenting the logic with unary propositional quality\noperators preserves decidability, whereas adding an average-operator makes some\nproblems undecidable.

Firstly, the semantics of\ndeterminers does not follow the syntactical structure of the sentence. Secondly\nthe standard interpretation of the indefinite article cannot ac- count for\nnominal sentences. Thirdly, the standard view misses the linguis- tic asymmetry\nbetween the two properties of a generalised quantifier. In the sequel, we\npropose a treatment of determiners and quantifiers as Hilbert terms in a richly\ntyped system that we initially developed for lexical semantics, using a many\nsorted logic for semantical representations. We present this semantical\nframework called the Montagovian generative lexicon and show how these terms\nbetter match the syntactical structure and avoid the aforementioned problems of\nthe standard approach. Hilbert terms rather differ from choice functions in\nthat there is one polymorphic operator and not one operator per formula. They\nalso open an intriguing connection between the logic for meaning assembly, the\ntyped lambda calculus handling compositionality and the many-sorted logic for\nsemantical representations. Furthermore epsilon terms naturally introduce\ntype-judgements and confirm the claim that type judgment are a form of\npresupposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 13:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Retor\u00e9", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4782", "submitter": "Jan St\\\"uckrath", "authors": "Barbara K\\\"onig, Jan St\\\"uckrath", "title": "A General Framework for Well-Structured Graph Transformation Systems", "comments": "Extended version (including proofs) of a paper accepted at CONCUR\n  2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Graph transformation systems (GTSs) can be seen as wellstructured transition\nsystems (WSTSs), thus obtaining decidability results for certain classes of\nGTSs.
