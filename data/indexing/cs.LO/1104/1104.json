On a\nstratified CTMC, the probability to satisfy a CSL path formula can be\napproximated by a transient analysis in polynomial time (using uniformization).\nWe present a measure-preserving, linear-time and -space transformation of any\nCTMC into an equivalent, stratified one. This makes the present work the\ncenterpiece of a broadly applicable full CSL model checker. Recently, the\ndecision algorithm by Aziz et al. was shown to work only for stratified CTMCs.\nAs an additional contribution, our measure-preserving transformation can be\nused to ensure the decidability for general CTMCs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 18:06:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 May 2012 19:26:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 14:52:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Lijun", "", "Technical University of Denmark, DTU Informatics,\n  Denmark"], ["Jansen", "David N.", "", "Radboud Universiteit, Model-based system design,\n  Nijmegen, The Netherlands"], ["Nielson", "Flemming", "", "Technical University of\n  Denmark, DTU Informatics, Denmark"], ["Hermanns", "Holger", "", "Saarland University,\n  Computer Science, Saarbr"]]}, {"id": "1104.4993", "submitter": "Berit Gru{\\ss}ien", "authors": "Hubie Chen, Victor Dalmau, Berit Gru{\\ss}ien", "title": "Arc Consistency and Friends", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A natural and established way to restrict the constraint satisfaction problem\nis to fix the relations that can be used to pose constraints; such a family of\nrelations is called a constraint language.

However, contrary to the case of classical ASP where many efficient\nsolvers have been constructed, to date there is no efficient fuzzy answer set\nprogramming solver. A well-known technique for classical ASP consists of\ntranslating an ASP program $P$ to a propositional theory whose models exactly\ncorrespond to the answer sets of $P$. In this paper, we show how this idea can\nbe extended to fuzzy ASP, paving the way to implement efficient fuzzy ASP\nsolvers that can take advantage of existing fuzzy logic reasoners.
