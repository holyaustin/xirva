The focus is on placing computability into\na larger mathematical context, rather than on a complete development of\ncomputability theory. We begin with a treatment of partial functions, using the\nnotion of dominance, which is used in synthetic domain theory to discuss\nclasses of partial maps. We relate this and other ideas from synthetic domain\ntheory to other approaches to partiality in type theory. We show that the\nnotion of dominance is difficult to apply in our setting: the set of\n$\\Sigma_0^1$ propositions investigated by Rosolini form a dominance precisely\nif a weak, but nevertheless unprovable, choice principle holds. To get around\nthis problem, we suggest an alternative notion of partial function we call\ndisciplined maps. In the presence of countable choice, this notion coincides\nwith Rosolini's.\n  Using a general notion of partial function, we take the first steps in\nconstructive computability theory. We do this both with computability as\nstructure, where we have direct access to programs; and with computability as\nproperty, where we must work in a program-invariant way. We demonstrate the\ndifference between these two approaches by showing how these approaches relate\nto facts about computability theory arising from topos-theoretic and\ntype-theoretic concerns. Finally, we tie the two threads together: assuming\ncountable choice and that all total functions $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ are\ncomputable (both of which hold in the effective topos), the Rosolini partial\nfunctions, the disciplined maps, and the computable partial functions all\ncoincide. We observe, however, that the class of all partial functions includes\nnon-computable partial functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2020 13:42:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Knapp", "Cory", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00630", "submitter": "Peter Schrammel", "authors": "Peter Schrammel", "title": "How Testable is Business Software?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most businesses rely on a significant stack of software to perform their\ndaily operations.

This requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential\nbehavior, thread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory\nsynchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated\ncommonsense reasoning. We assume that the data structure description is\nprovided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations.\nThis information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data\nstructure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search\ntrees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP),\nand we employ deduction, induction and abduction---just as humans do---in the\nreasoning involved.

In contrast to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated\nnot for a single assignment of values to the free variables, but on a set of\nsuch assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for a purely\nlogical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence\nof data matters, but based on sets, it does not take into account multiple\noccurrences of data values. It is therefore insufficient in scenarios where\nsuch multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning about probabilities and\nstatistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams\n(i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors.\n  In this paper we aim at a systematic development of logics of dependence and\nindependence based on multiteam semantics.

Their logical model, as an\nalternative to the well-studied topological model, provides an attractive\nframework for refuting the solvability of a given distributed task by means of\nlogical obstruction: One just needs to devise a formula, in the formal language\nof epistemic logic, that describes a discrepancy between the model of\ncomputation and that of the task. However, few instances of logical obstruction\nwere presented in their paper and specifically logical obstruction to the\nwait-free 2-set agreement task was left as an open problem. Soon later, Nishida\naffirmatively answered to the problem by providing inductively defined logical\nobstruction formulas to the wait-free $k$-set agreement tasks.\n  The present paper refines Nishida's work and devises logical obstruction\nformulas to $k$-set agreement tasks for superset-closed adversaries, which\nsupersede the wait-free model. These instances of logical obstruction formulas\nexemplify that the logical framework can provide yet another feasible method\nfor showing impossibility of distributed tasks, though it is currently being\nconfined to one-round distributed protocols. The logical method has an\nadvantage over the topological method that it enjoys a self-contained,\nelementary induction proof.

An important\ninsight of Power and Shkaravska is that comodels of an algebraic theory T --\ni.e., models in the opposite category Set^op -- provide a suitable environment\nfor evaluating the computational effects encoded by T. As already noted by\nPower and Shkaravska, taking comodels yields a functor from accessible monads\nto accessible comonads on Set. In this paper, we show that this functor is part\nof an adjunction -- the \"costructure-cosemantics adjunction\" of the title --\nand undertake a thorough investigation of its properties.\n  We show that, on the one hand, the cosemantics functor takes its image in\nwhat we term the presheaf comonads induced by small categories; and that, on\nthe other, costructure takes its image in the presheaf monads induced by small\ncategories. In particular, the cosemantics comonad of an accessible monad will\nbe induced by an explicitly-described category called its behaviour category\nthat encodes the static and dynamic properties of the comodels. Similarly, the\ncostructure monad of an accessible comonad will be induced by a behaviour\ncategory encoding static and dynamic properties of the comonad coalgebras. We\ntie these results together by showing that the costructure-cosemantics\nadjunction is idempotent, with fixpoints to either side given precisely by the\npresheaf monads and comonads.
