In this paper, we develop a new approach to this problem which is\nprimarily based on applying forward coverability in continuous Petri nets as a\npruning criterion inside a backward coverability framework. A cornerstone of\nour approach is the efficient encoding of a recently developed polynomial-time\nalgorithm for reachability in continuous Petri nets into SMT. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach on standard benchmarks from the literature,\nwhich shows that our approach decides significantly more instances than any\nexisting tool and is in addition often much faster, in particular on large\ninstances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 00:02:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Jan 2016 20:31:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Blondin", "Michael", ""], ["Finkel", "Alain", ""], ["Haase", "Christoph", ""], ["Haddad", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.06020", "submitter": "Viktor Lopatkin", "authors": "Andrey Grinblat and Viktor Lopatkin", "title": "Petri Nets and its Polynomials", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For every finite Petri net, we construct a commutative polynomial in two\nvariables and with coefficients from the semiring of natural numbers.

Automatically identifying symmetries in\nconcurrent systems, however, is computationally expensive. We propose a\nsymbolic framework for capturing symmetry patterns in parameterised systems\n(i.e. an infinite family of finite-state systems): two regular word transducers\nto represent, respectively, parameterised systems and symmetry patterns. The\nframework subsumes various types of symmetry relations ranging from weaker\nnotions (e.g. simulation preorders) to the strongest notion (i.e.\nisomorphisms). Our framework enjoys two algorithmic properties: (1) symmetry\nverification: given a transducer, we can automatically check whether it is a\nsymmetry pattern of a given system, and (2) symmetry synthesis: we can\nautomatically generate a symmetry pattern for a given system in the form of a\ntransducer. Furthermore, our symbolic language allows additional constraints\nthat the symmetry patterns need to satisfy to be easily incorporated in the\nverification/synthesis. We show how these properties can help identify symmetry\npatterns in examples like dining philosopher protocols, self-stabilising\nprotocols, and prioritised resource-allocator protocol.

An important subclass of APP's is LRAPP which is defined as\nthe class of all APP's over which a linear ranking-supermartingale exists.\n  Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we show that the membership\nproblem of LRAPP (i) can be decided in polynomial time for APP's with at most\ndemonic non-determinism, and (ii) is NP-hard and in PSPACE for APP's with\nangelic non-determinism; moreover, the NP-hardness result holds already for\nAPP's without probability and demonic non-determinism. Secondly, we show that\nthe concentration problem over LRAPP can be solved in the same complexity as\nfor the membership problem of LRAPP. Finally, we show that the expectation\nproblem over LRAPP can be solved in 2EXPTIME and is PSPACE-hard even for APP's\nwithout probability and non-determinism (i.e., deterministic programs).
