Girard developed a logical theory, called Ludics. This\ntheory was a step in his program of Geometry of Interaction, the aim of which\nbeing to account for the dynamics of logical proofs. In Ludics, objects called\ndesigns keep only what is relevant for the cut elimination process, hence the\ndynamics of a proof: a design is an abstraction of a formal proof. The notion\nof behaviour is the counterpart in Ludics of the notion of type or the logical\nnotion of formula. Formally a behaviour is a closed set of designs. Our aim is\nto explore the constructions of behaviours and to analyse their properties. In\nthis paper a design is viewed as a set of coherent paths. We recall or give\nvariants of properties concerning visitable paths, where a visitable path is a\npath in a design or a set of designs that may be traversed by interaction with\na design of the orthogonal of the set. We are then able to answer the following\nquestion: which properties should satisfy a set of paths for being exactly the\nset of visitable paths of a behaviour? Such a set and its dual should be\nprefix-closed, daimon-closed and satisfy two saturation properties. This allows\nus to have a means for defining the whole set of visitable paths of a given set\nof designs without closing it explicitly, that is without computing the\northogonal of this set of designs. We finally apply all these results for\nmaking explicit the structure of a behaviour generated by constants and\nmultiplicative/additive connectives.

We show that the infinitary unique normal form\nproperty fails by an example of a weakly orthogonal TRS with two collapsing\nrules. By translating this example, we show that this property also fails for\nthe infinitary lambda-beta-eta-calculus. As positive results we obtain the\nfollowing: Infinitary confluence, and hence the infinitary unique normal forms\nproperty, holds for weakly orthogonal TRSs that do not contain collapsing\nrules. To this end we refine the compression lemma. Furthermore, we establish\nthe triangle and diamond properties for infinitary multi-steps (complete\ndevelopments) in weakly orthogonal TRSs, by refining an earlier\ncluster-analysis for the finite case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 22:25:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 08:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Endrullis", "Joerg", "", "VU University Amsterdam"], ["Grabmayer", "Clemens", "", "Utrecht\n  University"], ["Hendriks", "Dimitri", "", "VU University Amsterdam"], ["Klop", "Jan Willem", "", "VU\n  University Amsterdam"], ["van Oostrom", "Vincent", "", "Utrecht University"]]}, {"id": "1403.6237", "submitter": "Thi Minh Tam Nguyen", "authors": "Thi-Minh-Tam Nguyen, Viet-Trung Vu, The-Vinh Doan and Duc-Khanh Tran", "title": "Resolution in Linguistic First Order Logic based on Linear Symmetrical\n  Hedge Algebra", "comments": "IPMU 2014 Full paper (14 pages)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on resolution in linguistic first order logic with truth\nvalue taken from linear symmetrical hedge algebra.

Since the introduction of prime event structures, many variants of\nevent structures have been proposed with different behavioural relations and,\nhence, with differences in their expressive power. One of the possible benefits\nof using a more expressive event structure is that of having a more compact\nrepresentation for the same behaviour when considering the number of events\nused in a prime event structure. Therefore, this article addresses the problem\nof reducing the size of an event structure while preserving behaviour under a\nwell-known notion of equivalence, namely history preserving bisimulation. In\nparticular, we investigate this problem on two generalisations of the prime\nevent structures. The first one, known as asymmetric event structure, relies on\na asymmetric form of the conflict relation. The second one, known as flow event\nstructure, supports a form of disjunctive causality. More specifically, we\ndescribe the conditions under which a set of events in an event structure can\nbe folded into a single event while preserving the original behaviour. The\nsuccessive application of this folding operation leads to a minimal size event\nstructure. However, the order on which the folding operation is applied may\nlead to different minimal size event structures. The latter has a negative\nimplication on the potential use of a minimal size event structure as a\ncanonical representation for behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Mar 2014 19:27:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 09:30:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Armas-Cervantes", "Abel", ""], ["Baldan", "Paolo", ""], ["Garcia-Ba\u00f1uelos", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7260", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Harsh Beohar (Center for Research on Embedded Systems Halmstad\n  University, Sweden), Mohammad Reza Mousavi (Center for Research on Embedded\n  Systems Halmstad University, Sweden)", "title": "Spinal Test Suites for Software Product Lines", "comments": "In Proceedings MBT 2014, arXiv:1403.7044", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 141, 2014, pp. 44-55", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.141.4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A major challenge in testing software product lines is efficiency.

However, this does not negate the ability for those using them to\nmake mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project (Quantomatic) to build\na proof assistant for string diagrams, at least for those based on categories\nwith a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a\ncombinatorial formalisation of string diagrams, laying the foundations for this\nproject.\n  The prevalence of commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in quantum\ninformation theory, a major application area of these diagrams, has led to the\nuse of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius\nalgebra morphisms, so-called \"spider notation\". This notation greatly eases\nreasoning with CFAs, but string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this\nreasoning.\n  This dissertation extends string graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to\nbe represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation (and structures to\nencode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs,\nwhere the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can\nreason directly about !-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of\nstring graphs. Of particular note is the presentation of a form of graph-based\ninduction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could only be\nrepresented as a mix of string diagrams and explanatory text.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Mar 2014 22:55:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Merry", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7840", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Andrew Noyes (Cornell University), Todd Warszawski (Cornell\n  University), Pavol \\v{C}ern\\'y (University of Colorado Boulder), Nate Foster\n  (Cornell University)", "title": "Toward Synthesis of Network Updates", "comments": "In Proceedings SYNT 2013, arXiv:1403.7264", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 142, 2014, pp. 8-23", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.142.8", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.LO cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Updates to network configurations are notoriously difficult to implement\ncorrectly. Even if the old and new configurations are correct, the update\nprocess can introduce transient errors such as forwarding loops, dropped\npackets, and access control violations. The key factor that makes updates\ndifficult to implement is that networks are distributed systems with hundreds\nor even thousands of nodes, but updates must be rolled out one node at a time.\nIn networks today, the task of determining a correct sequence of updates is\nusually done manually -- a tedious and error-prone process for network\noperators. This paper presents a new tool for synthesizing network updates\nautomatically. The tool generates efficient updates that are guaranteed to\nrespect invariants specified by the operator. It works by navigating through\nthe (restricted) space of possible solutions, learning from counterexamples to\nimprove scalability and optimize performance.
