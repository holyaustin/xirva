Our work expands the role of language from that of\nBEH by using it not only for the conditions that determine which actions are\ntaken, but also the effects.

This presents a problem: how do we interpret the result of do(phi)\nwhen phi is underspecified (i.e., compatible with multiple states)? We answer\nthis using tools familiar from the semantics of counterfactuals: roughly\nspeaking, do(phi) maps each state to the \"closest\" phi-state. This notion of\n\"closest\" is also something we construct as part of the representation theorem;\nin effect, then, we prove that (under appropriate assumptions) the agent is\nacting as if each underspecified action is first made definite and then\nevaluated (i.e., by maximizing expected utility).
