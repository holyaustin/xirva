This paper follows a\ndifferent direction in which double negation does hold. The algebraic notions\nof effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics form the\ncornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of\nthe form X -> 1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as\npredicates. Predicates are identified in many different situations, and capture\nfor instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a probabilistic setting,\nidempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in a\nC*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states\nand effects plays an important role. It appears here in the form of an\nadjunction, where we use maps 1 -> X as states. For such a state s and a\npredicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born\nrule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from\nthe literature. Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically\nin terms of `instruments', using L\\\"uders rule in the quantum case. These\ninstruments are special maps associated with predicates (more generally, with\ntests), which perform the act of measurement and may have a side-effect that\ndisturbs the system under observation. This abstract description of\nside-effects is one of the main achievements of the current approach.

Helper variables are introduced such\nthat a theorem prover can reconstruct the control-flow path of a feasible\nexecution from a satisfying valuation of this formula. Based on this formula,\nwe present one algorithm that computes a feasible path cover and one algorithm\nthat computes a feasible statement cover. We show that the algorithms are\ncomplete for loop-free programs and that they can be implemented efficiently.\nWe further provide a sound algorithm to compute procedure summaries which makes\nthe method scalable to larger programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 01:50:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Christ", "J\u00fcrgen", ""], ["Hoenicke", "Jochen", ""], ["Sch\u00e4f", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.6557", "submitter": "Thomas Seiller", "authors": "Thomas Seiller", "title": "Interaction Graphs: Additives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Geometry of Interaction (GoI) is a kind of semantics of linear logic proofs\nthat aims at accounting for the dynamical aspects of cut-elimination. We\npresent here a parametrized construction of a Geometry of Interaction for\nMultiplicative Additive Linear Logic (MALL) in which proofs are represented by\nfamilies of directed weighted graphs. Contrarily to former constructions\ndealing with additive connectives, we are able to solve the known issue of\nobtaining a denotational semantics for MALL by introducing a notion of\nobservational equivalence. Moreover, our setting has the advantage of being the\nfirst construction dealing with additives where proofs of MALL are interpreted\nby finite objects. The fact that we obtain a denotational model of MALL relies\non a single geometric property, which we call the trefoil property, from which\nwe obtain, for each value of the parameter, adjunctions. We then proceed to\nshow how this setting is related to Girard's various constructions: particular\nchoices of the parameter respectively give a combinatorial version of his\nlatest GoI, a refined version of older Geometries of Interaction based on\nnilpotency. This shows the importance of the trefoil property underlying our\nconstructions since all known GoI construction to this day rely on particular\ncases of it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 07:05:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2013 18:24:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 16:58:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 15:06:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 08:26:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Seiller", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.6558", "submitter": "Thomas Seiller", "authors": "Thomas Seiller", "title": "Interaction Graphs: Multiplicatives", "comments": "To appear in Annals of Pure and Applied Logic", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a graph-theoretical representation of proofs of multiplicative\nlinear logic which yields both a denotational semantics and a notion of truth.\nFor this, we use a locative approach (in the sense of ludics) related to game\nsemantics and the Danos-Regnier interpretation of GoI operators as paths in\nproof nets.

In this\npaper, we investigate the decidability and the complexity of this problem under\nthe assumption of bounded context-switching defined by Qadeer and Rehof, and of\nphase-boundedness proposed by La Torre et al. On the model checking of such\nsystems against temporal logics and in particular branching time logics such as\nthe modal $\\mu$-calculus or CTL has received little attention. It is known that\nparity games, which are closely related to the modal $\\mu$-calculus, are\ndecidable for the class of bounded-phase systems (and hence for bounded-context\nswitching as well), but with non-elementary complexity (Seth). A natural\nquestion is whether this high complexity is inevitable and what are the ways to\nget around it. This paper addresses these questions and unfortunately, and\nsomewhat surprisingly, it shows that branching model checking for MPDSs is\ninherently an hard problem with no easy solution. We show that parity games on\nMPDS under phase-bounding restriction is non-elementary.
