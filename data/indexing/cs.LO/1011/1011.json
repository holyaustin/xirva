Using a\nlimit-robust winning strategy, the controller cannot choose an exact\nreal-valued time delay but must allow for some nonzero jitter in each of its\nactions. If there is a given lower bound on the jitter, then the strategy is\nbounded-robust winning.

The\ndistinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to\nvertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the\ninputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction\nfor string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph.\nWhile the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the\nnotion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the\ncategory of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs.\nUsing this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits \"enough adhesivity\"\nfrom the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph\nrewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems\nare \"type-safe\" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs.\nThis formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a\ncomputational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit\nrewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious\ndetails. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our\nconstruction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for\ncomposition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by\ngraphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street,\nwhich define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on\nhow they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free\nsymmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories.
