In this article we investigate\nthis precise problem as follows. Firstly, we define a general schema of\n$\\exists$TO formulas which consists of existentially quantifying a third-order\nlinear digraph of polynomial length, that is, a sequence of structures that\nrepresents a computation, by explicitly stating which operations are the ones\nwhich can be involved in the construction of a given structure in the sequence,\nwhen applied to the previous one. Then we give a constructive proof of the fact\nthat all $\\exists$TO sub formulas of that schema can be translated into an\nequivalent SO formula. Secondly, aiming to formally characterize the fragment\nof TO which can be translated to SO, we define a restriction of TO, which we\ndenote TO$^{P}$, for polynomial TO, and we give a constructive proof on the\nfact that it collapses to SO. We define TO$^{P}$ as the fragment of TO where\nvaluations can assign to TO relation variables only TO relations whose\ncardinalities are bounded by a polynomial that depends on the quantifier.\nMoreover, we define a similar restriction for every higher order logic of order\n$i \\geq 4$, which we denote $\\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$, and give a constructive proof\nof the fact that for all $i \\geq 4$, $\\mathrm{HO}^{i,P}$ collapses to SO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 20:32:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrarotti", "Flavio", ""], ["Tec", "Loredana", ""], ["Turull-Torres", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.03191", "submitter": "Hern\\'an Melgratti", "authors": "Rocco de Nicola and Hern\\'an Melgratti", "title": "Multiparty testing preorders", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Variants of the must testing approach have been successfully applied in\nService Oriented Computing for analysing the compliance between (contracts\nexposed by) clients and servers or, more generally, between two peers.
