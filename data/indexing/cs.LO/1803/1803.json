From a theoretical point of view, this allows us to reason on bag\nsemantics by making use of the well-established theoretical foundations of set\nsemantics. From a practical point of view, this allows us to handle the bag\nsemantics of Datalog by powerful, existing query engines for the required\nextension of Datalog. This use of Datalog$^\\pm$ is extended to give a set\nsemantics to duplicates in Datalog$^\\pm$ itself. We investigate the properties\nof the resulting Datalog$^\\pm$ programs, the problem of deciding\nmultiplicities, and expressibility of some bag operations. Moreover, the\nproposed translation has the potential for interesting applications such as to\nMultiset Relational Algebra and the semantic web query language SPARQL with bag\nsemantics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Mar 2018 02:00:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 18:30:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2019 16:16:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bertossi", "Leopoldo", ""], ["Gottlob", "Georg", ""], ["Pichler", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06488", "submitter": "Matthias Weber", "authors": "Matthias Weber", "title": "An extended type system with lambda-typed lambda-expressions (extended\n  version)", "comments": "150 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the type system $\\mathtt{d}$, an extended type system with\nlambda-typed lambda-expressions.

The defender, on the other hand,\ntypically tries to decrease leakage by introducing some controlled noise. This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nattacker. In this work, we consider operators for modeling visible and hidden\nchoice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic properties. We\nthen formalize the interplay between defender and attacker in a game-theoretic\nframework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the payoff is\ninformation leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games, depending on\nwhether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the\nchoices of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential\ngames, the choice of the second player is generally a function of the choice of\nthe first player, and his/her probabilistic choice can be either over the\npossible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function\n(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a\nsequential game with a hidden choice, then behavioral strategies are more\nadvantageous for the defender than mixed strategies. This contrasts with the\nstandard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.\nFinally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information\nleakage and provide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of\nequilibrium) for both attacker and defender in the various cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:36:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2018 04:24:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", ""], ["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Kawamoto", "Yusuke", ""], ["Palamidessi", "Catuscia", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.10080", "submitter": "Thorsten Wissmann", "authors": "Noam Zeilberger", "title": "A sequent calculus for a semi-associative law", "comments": "This article is an extended version of a paper presented at FSCD\n  2017.

In the context of a technology\ntransfer study, we designed an algorithm for deadlock avoidance in train\nscheduling. In this paper, we present a case study in which the algorithm has\nbeen applied. The case study has been encoded using ten different formal\nverification environments, namely UMC, SPIN, NuSMV/nuXmv, mCRL2, CPN Tools,\nFDR4, CADP, TLA+, UPPAAL and ProB. Based on our experience, we observe\ncommonalities and differences among the modelling languages considered, and we\nhighlight the impact of the specific characteristics of each language on the\npresented models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 20:59:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Mazzanti", "Franco", "", "ISTI-CNR"], ["Ferrari", "Alessio", "", "ISTI-CNR"]]}, {"id": "1803.10327", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Robert Gl\\\"uck (DIKU, Dept. of Computer Science, University of\n  Copenhagen)", "title": "An Experiment in Ping-Pong Protocol Verification by Nondeterministic\n  Pushdown Automata", "comments": "In Proceedings MARS/VPT 2018, arXiv:1803.08668", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 268, 2018, pp. 169-184", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.268.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An experiment is described that confirms the security of a well-studied class\nof cryptographic protocols (Dolev-Yao intruder model) can be verified by\ntwo-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA).

In this paper, we study\nfragments that bundle quantifiers and modalities together, inspired by earlier\nwork on epistemic logics of know-how/why/what.

In particular, we show that the bundle $\\forall \\Box$ is\nundecidable over constant domain interpretations, even with only monadic\npredicates, whereas $\\exists \\Box$ bundle is decidable. On the other hand, over\nincreasing domain interpretations, we get decidability with both $\\forall \\Box$\nand $\\exists \\Box$ bundles with unrestricted predicates. In these cases, we\nalso obtain tableau based procedures that run in \\PSPACE.

We now consider classes of\ngraphs with excluded induced subgraphs. For such graph classes, an effective\ngraph decomposition, called modular decomposition, was introduced by Gallai in\n1976. The graphs that are non-decomposable with respect to modular\ndecomposition are called prime. We present a tool, the Modular Decomposition\nTheorem, that reduces (definable) canonization of a graph class C to\n(definable) canonization of the class of prime graphs of C that are colored\nwith binary relations on a linearly ordered set. By an application of the\nModular Decomposition Theorem, we show that fixed point logic with counting\ncaptures polynomial time on the class of permutation graphs. Within the proof\nof the Modular Decomposition Theorem, we show that the modular decomposition of\na graph is definable in symmetric transitive closure logic with counting. We\nobtain that the modular decomposition tree is computable in logarithmic space.\nIt follows that cograph recognition and cograph canonization is computable in\nlogarithmic space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 16:19:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Jan 2019 17:49:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 14:11:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gru\u00dfien", "Berit", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.11229", "submitter": "Bas van den Heuvel", "authors": "Bas van den Heuvel", "title": "The process of purely event-driven programs", "comments": "Supervisors: Dr. A.
