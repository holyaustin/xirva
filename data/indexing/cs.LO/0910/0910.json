Specifically, this framework provides a\nspecification language which supports the concise and direct description of\nformal systems, a mechanism for animating the specification language thereby\nproducing prototypes of encoded systems, and a logic for proving properties of\nspecifications and therefore of the systems they encode. A defining\ncharacteristic of the proposed framework is that it is based on two separate\nbut closely intertwined logics: a specification logic that facilitates the\ndescription of computational structure and another logic that exploits the\nspecial characteristics of the specification logic to support reasoning about\nthe computational behavior of systems that are described using it. Both logics\nembody a natural treatment of binding structure by using the lambda-calculus as\na means for representing objects and by incorporating special mechanisms for\nworking with such structure. By using this technique, they lift the treatment\nof binding from the object language into the domain of the relevant meta logic,\nthereby allowing the specification or analysis components to focus on the more\nessential logical aspects of the systems that are encoded. The primary\ncontributions of these thesis are the development of a rich meta-logic called G\nwith capabilities for sophisticated reasoning that includes induction and\nco-induction over high-level specifications of computations and with an\nassociated cut-elimination result; an interactive reasoning system called\nAbella based on G; and several reasoning examples which demonstrate the\nexpressiveness and naturalness of both G and Abella.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 12:36:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 20:06:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gacek", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0868", "submitter": "Harsh Beohar", "authors": "Harsh Beohar, Pieter Cuijpers, and Jos Baeten", "title": "Design of asynchronous supervisors", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  One of the main drawbacks while implementing the interaction between a plant\nand a supervisor, synthesised by the supervisory control theory of\n\\citeauthor{RW:1987}, is the inexact synchronisation. \\citeauthor{balemiphdt}\nwas the first to consider this problem, and the solutions given in his PhD\nthesis were in the domain of automata theory.
