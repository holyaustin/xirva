Contextuality--the denial of a notion of classical\nphysical reality--has emerged as a promising hypothesis.\n  Magic states are quantum resources critical for practically achieving\nuniversal quantum computation. They exhibit the standard form of contextuality\nthat is known to enable probabilistic advantages in a variety of computational\nand communicational tasks. Strong contextuality is an extremal form of\ncontextuality describing systems that exhibit logically paradoxical behaviour.\n  Here, we consider special magic states that deterministically enable quantum\ncomputation. After introducing number-theoretic techniques for constructing\nexotic quantum paradoxes, we present large classes of strongly contextual magic\nstates that enable deterministic implementation of gates from the Clifford\nhierarchy. These surprising discoveries bolster a refinement of the resource\ntheory of contextuality that emphasises the computational power of logical\nparadoxes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:00:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jun 2018 18:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["de Silva", "Nadish", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00049", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Kirstin Peters, Simone Tini", "title": "Proceedings Combined 24th International Workshop on Expressiveness in\n  Concurrency and 14th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 255, 2017", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.255", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 24th International\nWorkshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 14th Workshop on Structural\nOperational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2017) which was held on 04 September 2017 in\nBerlin, Germany, as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2017, the 28th\nInternational Conference on Concurrency Theory.

As an\nillustration we solve an open problem by providing the first algorithm with the\nbest published time complexity, O(|Psim |.|$\\rightarrow$|), and a bit space\ncomplexity in O(|Psim |^2. log(|Psim |) + |Q|. log(|Q|)), with Psim the\npartition induced by Rsim.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 13:58:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["C\u00e9c\u00e9", "G\u00e9rard", "", "FEMTO-ST"]]}, {"id": "1709.01849", "submitter": "Alberto Molinari", "authors": "Alberto Molinari, Angelo Montanari, Adriano Peron", "title": "Model Checking for Fragments of Halpern and Shoham's Interval Temporal\n  Logic Based on Track Representatives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Information and Computation 259 (2018) 412-443", "doi": "10.1016/j.ic.2017.08.011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Model checking allows one to automatically verify a specification of the\nexpected properties of a system against a formal model of its behaviour\n(generally, a Kripke structure).

Existing techniques build the strategies from the states of\ninterest, such as the initial states, through a forward traversal of the\nsystem. On the other hand, the proposed approach builds the winning strategies\nfrom the target states through a backward traversal, making sure that only\nuniform strategies are explored. Nevertheless, building the strategies from the\nground up limits its applicability to constrained reachability objectives only.\nThis paper describes the approach in details and compares it experimentally\nwith existing approaches implemented into a BDD-based framework. These\nexperiments show that the technique is competitive on the cases it can handle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 06:59:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Busard", "Simon", "", "UCLouvain, Belgium"], ["Pecheur", "Charles", "", "UCLouvain,\n  Belgium"]]}, {"id": "1709.02107", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Laura Bozzelli, Aniello Murano", "title": "On the Complexity of ATL and ATL* Module Checking", "comments": "In Proceedings GandALF 2017, arXiv:1709.01761", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 256, 2017, pp. 268-282", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.256.19", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Module checking has been introduced in late 1990s to verify open systems,\ni.e., systems whose behavior depends on the continuous interaction with the\nenvironment.

In\norder to deploy an AV there are significant steps that must be completed in\nterms of hardware and software. As expected, software components play a key\nrole in the complex AV system and so, at least for safety, we should assess the\ncorrectness of these components.\n  In this paper, we are concerned with the high-level software component(s)\nresponsible for the decisions in an AV. We intend to model an AV capable of\nnavigation; obstacle avoidance; obstacle selection (when a crash is\nunavoidable) and vehicle recovery, etc, using a rational agent. To achieve\nthis, we have established the following stages. First, the agent plans and\nactions have been implemented within the Gwendolen agent programming language.\nSecond, we have built a simulated automotive environment in the Java language.\nThird, we have formally specified some of the required agent properties through\nLTL formulae, which are then formally verified with the AJPF verification tool.\nFinally, within the MCAPL framework (which comprises all the tools used in\nprevious stages) we have obtained formal verification of our AV agent in terms\nof its specific behaviours. For example, the agent plans responsible for\nselecting an obstacle with low potential damage, instead of a higher damage\nobstacle (when possible) can be formally verified within MCAPL. We must\nemphasise that the major goal (of our present approach) lies in the formal\nverification of agent plans, rather than evaluating real-world applications.\nFor this reason we utilised a simple matrix representation concerning the\nenvironment used by our agent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 06:35:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Fernandes", "Lucas E.

A\npopular language for providing such a specification is Linear Temporal Logic,\nor LTL. LTL synthesis in the general case has remained, however, a hard problem\nto solve in practice. Because of this, many works have focused on developing\nsynthesis procedures for specific fragments of LTL, with an easier synthesis\nproblem. In this work, we focus on Safety LTL, defined here to be the\nUntil-free fragment of LTL in Negation Normal Form~(NNF), and shown to express\na fragment of safe LTL formulas.

We show\nhere that Safety LTL synthesis is significantly simpler algorithmically than\nLTL synthesis. We exploit this simplicity in two ways, first by describing an\nexplicit approach based on a reduction to Horn-SAT, which can be solved in\nlinear time in the size of the game graph, and then through an efficient\nsymbolic construction, allowing a BDD-based symbolic approach which\nsignificantly outperforms extant LTL-synthesis tools.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Sep 2017 19:02:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2020 03:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Shufang", ""], ["Tabajara", "Lucas M.", ""], ["Li", "Jianwen", ""], ["Pu", "Geguang", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.07695", "submitter": "Makoto Kanazawa", "authors": "Makoto Kanazawa", "title": "On the Recognizing Power of the Lambek Calculus with Brackets", "comments": "minor revisions", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.LO cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Every language recognized by the Lambek calculus with brackets is\ncontext-free.

Such information is valuable in optimizing\ncompilers, worst-case execution time analysis, and side-channel attack\nquantification and mitigation.Cache analysis is usually performed as a\ncombination of `must' and `may' abstract interpretations, classifying\ninstructions as either `always hit', `always miss', or `unknown'. Instructions\nclassified as `unknown' might result in a hit or a miss depending on program\ninputs or the initial cache state. It is equally possible that they do in fact\nalways hit or always miss, but the cache analysis is too coarse to see it.Our\napproach to eliminate this uncertainty consists in (i) a novel abstract\ninterpretation able to ascertain that a particular instruction may definitely\ncause a hit and a miss on different paths, and (ii) an exact analysis, removing\nall remaining uncertainty, based on model checking, using\nabstract-interpretation results to prune down the model for scalability.We\nevaluated our approach on a variety of examples; it notably improves precision\nupon classical abstract interpretation at reasonable cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:05:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:38:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Maiza", "Claire", "", "VERIMAG - IMAG"], ["Touzeau", "Valentin", "", "VERIMAG - IMAG"], ["Ma\u00a8\u0131za", "Claire", "", "VERIMAG - IMAG"], ["Monniaux", "David", "", "VERIMAG - IMAG"], ["Reineke", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10039", "submitter": "Christoph Berkholz", "authors": "Christoph Berkholz, Jens Keppeler, Nicole Schweikardt", "title": "Answering UCQs under updates and in the presence of integrity\n  constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the query evaluation problem for fixed queries over fully\ndynamic databases where tuples can be inserted or deleted. The task is to\ndesign a dynamic data structure that can immediately report the new result of a\nfixed query after every database update. We consider unions of conjunctive\nqueries (UCQs) and focus on the query evaluation tasks testing (decide whether\nan input tuple belongs to the query result), enumeration (enumerate, without\nrepetition, all tuples in the query result), and counting (output the number of\ntuples in the query result).\n  We identify three increasingly restrictive classes of UCQs which we call\nt-hierarchical, q-hierarchical, and exhaustively q-hierarchical UCQs. Our main\nresults provide the following dichotomies: If the query's homomorphic core is\nt-hierarchical (q-hierarchical, exhaustively q-hierarchical), then the testing\n(enumeration, counting) problem can be solved with constant update time and\nconstant testing time (delay, counting time). Otherwise, it cannot be solved\nwith sublinear update time and sublinear testing time (delay, counting time),\nunless the OV-conjecture and/or the OMv-conjecture fails.\n  We also study the complexity of query evaluation in the dynamic setting in\nthe presence of integrity constraints, and we obtain according dichotomy\nresults for the special case of small domain constraints (i.e., constraints\nwhich state that all values in a particular column of a relation belong to a\nfixed domain of constant size).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 16:15:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Berkholz", "Christoph", ""], ["Keppeler", "Jens", ""], ["Schweikardt", "Nicole", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10484", "submitter": "Paul-Andr\\'e Melli\\`es", "authors": "Pierre Cagne and Paul-Andr\\'e Melli\\`es", "title": "On bifibrations of model categories", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CT cs.LO math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, we develop a notion of Quillen bifibration which combines\nthe two notions of Grothendieck bifibration and of Quillen model structure.
