Two ways to eliminate the using of such names in certain\ncases are indicated in the paper. The first one is intended for the case of\ntopological spaces with selected indexed denumerable bases. Suppose a partial\nfunction is given from one such space into another one whose selected base has\na recursively enumerable index set, and suppose that the intersection of base\nopen sets in the first space is computable in the sense of Weihrauch-Grubba.\nThen the ordinary TTE computability of the function is characterized by the\nexistence of an appropriate recursively enumerable relation between indices of\nbase sets containing the argument value and indices of base sets containing the\ncorresponding function value.This result can be regarded as an improvement of a\nresult of Korovina and Kudinov. The second way is applicable to metric spaces\nwith selected indexed denumerable dense subsets. If a partial function is given\nfrom one such space into another one, then, under a semi-computability\nassumption concerning these spaces, the ordinary TTE computability of the\nfunction is characterized by the existence of an appropriate recursively\nenumerable set of quadruples. Any of them consists of an index of element from\nthe selected dense subset in the first space, a natural number encoding a\nrational bound for the distance between this element and the argument value, an\nindex of element from the selected dense subset in the second space and a\nnatural number encoding a rational bound for the distance between this element\nand the function value.

In this scenario, IC3\noperates only at the Boolean level of the abstract state space, discovering\ninductive clauses over the abstraction predicates. Theory reasoning is confined\nwithin the underlying SMT solver, and applied transparently when performing\nsatisfiability checks. When the current abstraction allows for a spurious\ncounterexample, it is refined by discov- ering and adding a sufficient set of\nnew predicates.

First, unlike current SMT gener-\nalizations of IC3, it allows to handle a wide range of background theories\nwithout relying on ad-hoc extensions, such as quantifier elimination or\ntheory-specific clause generalization procedures, which might not always be\navailable, and can moreover be inefficient.

This paper provides new results along this\nresearch line and presents new algorithms for performing minimal model finding\nand checking over positive propositional CNFs and model minimization over\npropositional CNFs. An algorithmic schema, called the Generalized Elimination\nAlgorithm (GEA) is presented, that computes a minimal model of any positive\nCNF. The schema generalizes the Elimination Algorithm (EA) [BP97], which\ncomputes a minimal model of positive head-cycle-free (HCF) CNF theories. While\nthe EA always runs in polynomial time in the size of the input HCF CNF, the\ncomplexity of the GEA depends on the complexity of the specific eliminating\noperator invoked therein, which may in general turn out to be exponential.\nTherefore, a specific eliminating operator is defined by which the GEA\ncomputes, in polynomial time, a minimal model for a class of CNF that strictly\nincludes head-elementary-set-free (HEF) CNF theories [GLL06], which form, in\ntheir turn, a strict superset of HCF theories. Furthermore, in order to deal\nwith the high complexity associated with recognizing HEF theories, an\n\"incomplete\" variant of the GEA (called IGEA) is proposed: the resulting\nschema, once instantiated with an appropriate elimination operator, always\nconstructs a model of the input CNF, which is guaranteed to be minimal if the\ninput theory is HEF. In the light of the above results, the main contribution\nof this work is the enlargement of the tractability frontier for the minimal\nmodel finding and checking and the model minimization problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 12:37:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Angiulli", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Ben-Eliyahu-Zohary", "Rachel", ""], ["Fassetti", "Fabio", ""], ["Palopoli", "Luigi", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8148", "submitter": "Achim Blumensath", "authors": "Achim Blumensath (Universit\\'e Paris Diderot), Bruno Courcelle\n  (Universit\\'e Bordeaux 1)", "title": "Monadic second-order definable graph orderings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 10, Issue 1 (January\n  21, 2014) lmcs:793", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-10(1:2)2014", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the question of whether, for a given class of finite graphs, one can\ndefine, for each graph of the class, a linear ordering in monadic second-order\nlogic, possibly with the help of monadic parameters.

To allow this translation to be used to execute LF specifications,\nwe describe an inverse transformation from hohh terms to LF expressions; thus\ncomputations can be carried out using the translated form and the results can\nthen be exported back into LF.
