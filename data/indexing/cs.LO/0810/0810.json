One of the primary\npurposes of a knowledge network is to reason; that is, to alter the topology of\nthe network according to an algorithm that uses the existing topological\nstructure as its input. There exist many such reasoning algorithms. With\nrespect to the Semantic Web, the bivalent, monotonic reasoners of the RDF\nSchema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) are the most prevalent.\nHowever, nothing prevents other forms of reasoning from existing in the\nSemantic Web. This article presents a non-bivalent, non-monotonic, evidential\nlogic and reasoner that is an algebraic ring over a multi-relational network\nequipped with two binary operations that can be composed to execute various\nforms of inference. Given its multi-relational grounding, it is possible to use\nthe presented evidential framework as another method for structuring knowledge\nand reasoning in the Semantic Web. The benefits of this framework are that it\nworks with arbitrary, partial, and contradictory knowledge while, at the same\ntime, it supports a tractable approximate reasoning process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2008 17:49:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 18:17:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Geldart", "Joe", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.2061", "submitter": "Daniel Hirschkoff", "authors": "Daniel Hirschkoff (LIP), Damien Pous (INRIA Rh\\^one-Alpes / LIG\n  Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble)", "title": "On characterising strong bisimilarity in a fragment of CCS with\n  replication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a characterisation of strong bisimilarity in a fragment of CCS\nthat contains only prefix, parallel composition, synchronisation and a limited\nform of replication.

Viewing this as a multi-objective optimization problem,\nwe want information about the \"trade-off curve\" or Pareto curve for maximizing\nthe probabilities of different properties. We show that one can compute an\napproximate Pareto curve with respect to a set of \\omega -regular properties in\ntime polynomial in the size of the MDP.\n  Our quantitative upper bounds use LP methods. We also study qualitative\nmulti-objective model checking problems, and we show that these can be analysed\nby purely graph-theoretic methods, even though the strategies may still require\nboth randomization and memory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2008 16:18:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2008 23:50:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Etessami", "Kousha", ""], ["Kwiatkowska", "Marta", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""], ["Yannakakis", "Mihalis", ""]]}]
