The second step\nconsists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic\nProgramming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best\npaths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on\nthem (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.\nMoreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics.

Since there\nare fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with\nrespect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold\nexponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,\nprovided m exceeds 3.
