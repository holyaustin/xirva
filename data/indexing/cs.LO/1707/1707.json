We develop an efficient partition-refinement\nalgorithm which computes the largest SMB of a CRN in polynomial time in the\nnumber of species and reactions. We also provide an algorithm for obtaining a\nquotient network from an SMB that induces the lumped CTMC directly, thus\navoiding the generation of the state space of the original CRN altogether. In\npractice, we show that SMB allows significant reductions in a number of models\nfrom the literature. Finally, we study SMB with respect to the deterministic\nsemantics of CRNs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where each\nequation gives the time-course evolution of the concentration of a species. SMB\nimplies forward CRN bisimulation, a recently developed behavioral notion of\nequivalence for the ODE semantics, in an analogous sense: it yields a smaller\nODE system that keeps track of the sums of the solutions for equivalent\nspecies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 11:56:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cardelli", "Luca", ""], ["Tribastone", "Mirco", ""], ["Tschaikowski", "Max", ""], ["Vandin", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.02279", "submitter": "Ruggero Lanotte Dr", "authors": "Ruggero Lanotte and Massimo Merro and Simone Tini", "title": "A Probabilistic Calculus of Cyber-Physical Systems", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1612.00484", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.SY eess.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a hybrid probabilistic process calculus for modelling and\nreasoning on cyber-physical systems (CPSs).

Such\nhierarchies are built using a generic construction process: one starts from an\ninitial class called the basis and builds new levels by applying generic\noperations. The most famous one, the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and\nCohen, classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. Moreover, it\nwas shown by Thomas that it corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy\nof first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages\nthat can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. Finding\nseparation algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy is among the most famous\nopen problems in automata theory.\n  Our main theorem is generic: we show that separation is decidable for the\nlevel 3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite. Furthermore, in\nthe special case of the dot-depth, we push this result to the level 5/2. In\nlogical terms, this solves separation for $\\Sigma_3$: first-order sentences\nhaving at most three quantifier blocks starting with an existential one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:25:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Jul 2017 23:29:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Feb 2018 16:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 12 Aug 2018 15:27:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 10:49:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Place", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.03370", "submitter": "Thorsten Wissmann", "authors": "Thomas Place and Marc Zeitoun", "title": "The Covering Problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 14, Issue 3 (July 20,\n  2018) lmcs:4698", "doi": "10.23638/LMCS-14(3:1)2018", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  An important endeavor in computer science is to understand the expressive\npower of logical formalisms over discrete structures, such as words. Naturally,\n\"understanding\" is not a mathematical notion. This investigation requires\ntherefore a concrete objective to capture this understanding. In the\nliterature, the standard choice for this objective is the membership problem,\nwhose aim is to find a procedure deciding whether an input regular language can\nbe defined in the logic under investigation. This approach was cemented as the\nright one by the seminal work of Sch\\\"utzenberger, McNaughton and Papert on\nfirst-order logic and has been in use since then. However, membership questions\nare hard: for several important fragments, researchers have failed in this\nendeavor despite decades of investigation. In view of recent results on one of\nthe most famous open questions, namely the quantifier alternation hierarchy of\nfirst-order logic, an explanation may be that membership is too restrictive as\na setting. These new results were indeed obtained by considering more general\nproblems than membership, taking advantage of the increased flexibility of the\nenriched mathematical setting. This opens a promising research avenue and\nefforts have been devoted at identifying and solving such problems for natural\nfragments. Until now however, these problems have been ad hoc, most fragments\nrelying on a specific one. A unique new problem replacing membership as the\nright one is still missing. The main contribution of this paper is a suitable\ncandidate to play this role: the Covering Problem. We motivate this problem\nwith 3 arguments. First, it admits an elementary set theoretic formulation,\nsimilar to membership. Second, we are able to reexplain or generalize all known\nresults with this problem.

In this paper\nwe study the multiplicative theories of the complex, real and (positive)\nrational numbers. These theories (and also the multiplicative theories of\nnatural and integer numbers) are known to be decidable (i.e., there exists an\nalgorithm that decides whether a given sentence is derivable form the theory);\nhere we present explicit axiomatizations for them and show that they are not\nfinitely axiomatizable. For each of these sets (of complex, real and [positive]\nrational numbers) a language, including the multiplication operation, is\nintroduced in a way that it allows quantifier elimination (for the theory of\nthat set).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Jul 2017 12:41:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 09:57:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Nov 2017 06:23:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 10 Feb 2018 05:09:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 14 Feb 2018 05:52:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Salehi", "Saeed", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.04734", "submitter": "Michael Maher", "authors": "Guido Governatori and Michael J.

In the present paper, we first show that the\nfixed-parameter tractability of FOC(P) cannot even be generalised to very\nsimple classes of structures of unbounded degree such as unranked trees or\nstrings with a linear order relation.\n  Then we identify a fragment FOC1(P) of FOC(P) which is still sufficiently\nstrong to express standard applications of SQL's COUNT operator. Our main\nresult shows that query evaluation for FOC1(P) is fixed-parameter tractable\nwith almost linear running time on nowhere dense classes of structures. As a\ncorollary, we also obtain a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for counting\nthe number of tuples satisfying a query over nowhere dense classes of\nstructures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 06:12:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Grohe", "Martin", ""], ["Schweikardt", "Nicole", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.05968", "submitter": "Quentin Hautem", "authors": "V\\'eronique Bruy\\`ere, Quentin Hautem, Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Raskin", "title": "Parameterized complexity of games with monotonically ordered\n  {\\omega}-regular objectives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, two-player zero-sum games with multiple objectives have\nreceived a lot of interest as a model for the synthesis of complex reactive\nsystems.

Therefore, the resulting\ncomputations are trees of models, rather than the typical sequences. A\nconsequence of our semantics is that modally bisimilar states may be\ndistinguished in our logic. Then, we provide a stronger notion of bisimilarity\nand we show that it preserves modal equivalence in GLAL. Additionally, we show\nthat GLAL is strictly more expressive than public announcement logic with\ncommon knowledge.
