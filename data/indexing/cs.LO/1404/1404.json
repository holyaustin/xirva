Many interesting\nsemantics have been proposed. Brewka and Eiter's Principle I expresses the\nbasic intuition behind the preferences. All the approaches that satisfy\nPrinciple I introduce a rather imperative feature into otherwise declarative\nlanguage. They understand preferences as the order, in which the rules of a\nprogram have to be applied. In this paper we present two purely declarative\napproaches for preference handling that satisfy Principle I, and work for\ngeneral conflicts, including direct and indirect conflicts between rules. The\nfirst approach is based on the idea that a rule cannot be defeated by a less\npreferred conflicting rule. This approach is able to ignore preferences between\nnon-conflicting rules, and, for instance, is equivalent with the answer set\nsemantics for the subclass of stratified programs. It is suitable for the\nscenarios, when developers do not have full control over preferences. The\nsecond approach relaxes the requirement for ignoring conflicting rules, which\nensures that it stays in the NP complexity class. It is based on the idea that\na rule cannot be defeated by a rule that is less preferred or depends on a less\npreferred rule. The second approach can be also characterized by a\ntransformation to logic programs without preferences. It turns out that the\napproaches form a hierarchy, a branch in the hierarchy of the approaches by\nDelgrande et. al., Wang et. al., and Brewka and Eiter.
