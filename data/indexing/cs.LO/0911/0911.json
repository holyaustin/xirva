In order to\ndelineate and adapt to dynamic changes in the pervasive computing environment,\ncontext-aware applications often need to specify and check behavioral\nconsistency constraints over the contexts. This problem is challenging mainly\ndue to the distributed and asynchronous nature of pervasive computing\nenvironments. Specifically, the critical issue in checking behavioral\nconstraints is the temporal ordering of contextual activities. The contextual\nactivities usually involve multiple context collecting devices, which are\nfully-decentralized and interact in an asynchronous manner. However, existing\ncontext consistency checking schemes do not work in asynchronous environments,\nsince they implicitly assume the availability of a global clock or relay on\nsynchronized interactions.\n  To this end, we propose the Ordering Global Activity (OGA) algorithm, which\ndetects the ordering of the global activities based on predicate detection in\nasynchronous environments. The essence of our approach is the message causality\nand its on-the-fly coding as logic vector clocks in asynchronous environments.\nWe implement the Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in\nAsynchronous environments (MIPA), over which the OGA algorithm is implemented\nand evaluated. The evaluation results show the impact of asynchrony on the\nchecking of behavioral consistency constraints, which justifies the primary\nmotivation of our work.

We therefore propose a (restricted) logical\ntheory over relations as a language for specifying such notions. Our\nspecification logic is further characterized by an ability to explicitly treat\nbinding in object languages. Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next\nquestion is how we might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We\npropose to use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A\nsatisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the\nspecification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various\nnotions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables within\nsequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural treatment of\nthese aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding structures as well as\ntheir associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and\ncapture-avoiding substitution. Further, to support arguments about provability,\nthe reasoning logic should possess strong mechanisms for constructing proofs by\ninduction and co-induction. We provide these capabilities here by using a logic\ncalled G which represents relations over lambda-terms via definitions of atomic\njudgments, contains inference rules for induction and co-induction, and\nincludes a special generic quantifier. We show how provability in the\nspecification logic can be transparently encoded in G.
