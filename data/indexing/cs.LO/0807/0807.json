This problem has not been stated earlier, at least in\na way that allows speaking about algorithms for verification of informational\nequivalence, because the informal definition of knowledge bases makes formal\nsolution of this problem impossible. In this paper we provide an implementable\nformal algorithm for knowledge base equivalence verification based on the\nformal definition of knowledge base proposed by Plotkin B. and Plotkin T., and\nstudy some important properties of automorphic equivalence of models. We also\ndescribe the concept of equivalence and formulate the criterion for the\nequivalence of knowledge bases defined over finite models. Further we define\nmulti-models and automorphic equivalence of models and multi-models, that is\ngeneralization of automorphic equivalence of algebras.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2008 09:16:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Marina", "Knyazhansky", ""], ["Tatjana", "Plotkin", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1016", "submitter": "Paulo Oliva", "authors": "Rob Arthan, Ursula Martin, Erik A.

The games are concurrent in that at each turn,\nboth players independently propose a time delay and an action, and the action\nwith the shorter delay is chosen. To prevent a player from winning by blocking\ntime, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot\nbe responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction\nof these games to turn-based (i.e., nonconcurrent) finite-state (i.e., untimed)\nparity games. The states of the resulting game are pairs of clock regions of\nthe original game. Our reduction improves the best known complexity for solving\ntimed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical parity\ngames can now be applied to timed parity games.\n  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that\nrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,\nlimit-robust and bounded-robust strategies. Using a limit-robust strategy, the\ncontroller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow for\nsome nonzero jitter in each of its actions. If there is a given lower bound on\nthe jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust. We show that exact strategies\nare more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than\nbounded-robust strategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies,\nwe present efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These\nreductions provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time\ncontrollers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 06:37:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Henzinger", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Prabhu", "Vinayak", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1173", "submitter": "Rohit Chadha", "authors": "Rohit Chadha and Mahesh Viswanthan", "title": "A Counterexample Guided Abstraction-Refinement Framework for Markov\n  Decision Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main challenge in using abstractions effectively, is to construct a\nsuitable abstraction for the system being verified.
