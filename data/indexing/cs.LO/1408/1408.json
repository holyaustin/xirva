After adding\ncheckpoints to the syntax of session behaviours, we formalise the operational\nsemantics via a LTS, and define a natural notion of checkpoint compliance. We\nthen obtain a co-inductive characterisation of such compliance relation, and an\naxiomatic presentation that is proved to be sound and complete. As a byproduct\nwe get a decision procedure for the new compliance, being the axiomatic system\nalgorithmic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 02:16:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Barbanera", "Franco", "", "Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, University\n  of Catania"], ["Dezani-Ciancaglini", "Mariangiola", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica,\n  University of Torino"], ["Liguoro", "Ugo de'", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica,\n  University of Torino"]]}, {"id": "1408.6367", "submitter": "Andrew Craig", "authors": "Willem Conradie and Andrew Craig", "title": "Canonicity results for mu-calculi: an algorithmic approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.LO cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the canonicity of inequalities of the intuitionistic\nmu-calculus. The notion of canonicity in the presence of fixed point operators\nis not entirely straightforward. In the algebraic setting of canonical\nextensions we examine both the usual notion of canonicity and what we will call\ntame canonicity. This latter concept has previously been investigated for the\nclassical mu-calculus by Bezhanishvili and Hodkinson. Our approach is in the\nspirit of Sahlqvist theory. That is, we identify syntactically-defined classes\nof inequalities, namely the restricted inductive and tame inductive\ninequalities, which are, respectively, canonical or tame canonical. Our\napproach is to use an algorithm which processes inequalities with the aim of\neliminating propositional variables. The algorithm we introduce is closely\nrelated to the algorithms ALBA and mu-ALBA studied by Conradie, Palmigiano, et\nal. It is based on a calculus of rewrite rules, the soundness of which rests\nupon the way in which algebras embed into their canonical extensions and the\norder-theoretic properties of the latter. We show that the algorithm succeeds\non every restricted inductive inequality by means of a so-called proper run,\nand that this is sufficient to guarantee their canonicity. Likewise, we are\nable to show that the algorithm succeeds on every tame inductive inequality by\nmeans of a so-called tame run. In turn, this guarantees their tame canonicity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 09:58:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Conradie", "Willem", ""], ["Craig", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6474", "submitter": "Thomas Hales", "authors": "Thomas C.
