There has\nbeen many efforts to extend stable model semantics so that answer set programs\ncan use a more extensive syntax. To such endeavor, the community of\nnon-monotonic reasoning has introduced extensions such as equilibrium models\nand FLP semantics. However, both of these extensions suffer from two problems:\nintended models according to such extensions (1) are not guaranteed to be\nminimal, and (2) more importantly, may have self-justifications (i.e., the\njustification for pertinence of an atom in an intended model may be its own\npertinence). Both of these properties directly violate the spirit of stable\nmodel semantics. Therefore, we believe that we need a new extension of stable\nmodel semantics that guarantees both minimality and being strongly grounded.\n  This paper introduces one such extension using two different approaches:\nfirstly, by extending the goal-reachability interpretation of logic programs to\nthe full propositional language and, secondly, using derivability in\nintuitionistic propositional logic. We show that both these approaches give the\nsame semantics, that we call the supported semantics. Moreover, using the first\napproach, we also extend well-founded semantics to full propositional language.\nFurthermore, we discuss how our supported models relate to other existing\nsemantics for non-monotonic reasoning including the equilibrium models. Last,\nbut not the least, we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported\nmodels and show that all interesting reasoning tasks (such as brave/cautious\nreasoning) are PSPACE-complete.

It is shown that 39% of the\n14185 theorems could be proved in a push-button mode (without any high-level\nadvice and user interaction) in 30 seconds of real time on a fourteen-CPU\nworkstation. The necessary work involves: (i) an implementation of sound\ntranslations of the HOL Light logic to ATP formalisms: untyped first-order,\npolymorphic typed first-order, and typed higher-order, (ii) export of the\ndependency information from HOL Light and ATP proofs for the machine learners,\nand (iii) choice of suitable representations and methods for learning from\nprevious proofs, and their integration as advisors with HOL Light. This work is\ndescribed and discussed here, and an initial analysis of the body of proofs\nthat were found fully automatically is provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2012 18:15:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2013 09:20:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Oct 2014 15:02:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kaliszyk", "Cezary", ""], ["Urban", "Josef", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7152", "submitter": "Robert Cowen", "authors": "Robert Cowen", "title": "A Method for Constructing Minimally Unsatisfiable CNFs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We generalize a method of Ivor Spence (J. of Experimental Algorithms 15(March\n2010)) that produces unsatisfiable cnfs and show experimentally that, for the\nmost part, the resulting cnfs are minimally unsatisfiable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 03:50:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cowen", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7308", "submitter": "Saeed Salehi", "authors": "Saeed Salehi", "title": "Godel's Incompleteness Phenomenon - Computationally", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Philosophia Scienti{\\ae} 18:3 (2014) 23--37", "doi": "10.4000/philosophiascientiae.968", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.LO cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We argue that Godel's completeness theorem is equivalent to completability of\nconsistent theories, and Godel's incompleteness theorem is equivalent to the\nfact that this completion is not constructive, in the sense that there are some\nconsistent and recursively enumerable theories which cannot be extended to any\ncomplete and consistent and recursively enumerable theory.
