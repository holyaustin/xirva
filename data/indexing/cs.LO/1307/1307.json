This semantics extends, in a way, the more\ntraditional meanings given by Heyting categories, the topos-theoretic\ninterpretation, and Kripke models. The feature which justifies the introduction\nof this novel semantics is the fact that it is 'point-free', i.e., there is no\nuniverse whose elements are used to interpret the logical terms. In other\nwords, terms do not denote individuals of some collection but, instead, they\ndenote the 'glue' which keeps together the interpretations of statements,\nsimilarly to what happens in formal topology. Since the proposed semantics can\nbe trivially extended to all the first-order logical theories based on the\nintuitionistic system (and, with some care, to minimal systems as well), the\nsemantics covers also all the predicative theories, even if some peculiar\naspects of these theories should be remarked.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 14:13:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Benini", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0150", "submitter": "Dan Willard", "authors": "Dan E.

Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally\nproofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties.

The\ncomputation of incarnation is important also as it gives a minimal denotation\nfor a formula, and more generally for a behaviour. We give here a constructive\nway to capture the incarnation of the behaviour of a set of designs, without\ncomputing the behaviour itself.

The\noperational nature of these constructions complicates understanding,\nimplementing, and reasoning about them, and should be contrasted with\ncomplementation, where a solid theory in terms of automata run DAGs underlies\nmodern constructions.\n  In 2010, we described a profile-based approach to Buchi complementation,\nwhere a profile is simply the history of visits to accepting states. We\ndeveloped a structural theory of profiles and used it to describe a\ncomplementation construction that is deterministic in the limit.

In this paper we provide a formal\nmodel for the semantics of single instruction, multiple data programs using\nPGAS APIs. Our model reflects the main features of popular real-world APIs such\nas SHMEM, ARMCI, GASNet, GPI, and GASPI.\n  A key feature of PGAS is the support for one-sided communication: a node may\ndirectly read and write the memory located at a remote node, without explicit\nsynchronization with the processes running on the remote side. One-sided\ncommunication increases performance by decoupling process synchronization from\ndata transfer, but requires the programmer to reason about appropriate\nsynchronizations between reads and writes. As a second contribution, we propose\nand investigate robustness, a criterion for correct synchronization of PGAS\nprograms. Robustness corresponds to acyclicity of a suitable happens-before\nrelation defined on PGAS computations. The requirement is finer than the\nclassical data race freedom and rules out most false error reports.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for checking robustness of PGAS programs. The\nalgorithm makes use of two insights. Using combinatorial arguments we first\nshow that, if a PGAS program is not robust, then there are computations in a\ncertain normal form that violate happens-before acyclicity. Intuitively,\nnormal-form computations delay remote accesses in an ordered way. We then\ndevise an algorithm that checks for cyclic normal-form computations.\nEssentially, the algorithm is an emptiness check for a novel automaton model\nthat accepts normal-form computations in streaming fashion.

In this paper, we present the definition of a proof\nprocedure for the Description Logic ALC, based on a semantic tableau method. We\nensure validity of our prover by proving its soundness, completeness and\ntermination properties using Isabelle proof assistant. The proof proceeds in\ntwo phases, first by establishing these properties on an abstract level, and\nthen by instantiating them for an implementation based on lists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 03:28:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chaabani", "Mohamed", "", "LIMOSE, University of Boumerdes, Boumerdes,\n  Algeria"], ["Mezghiche", "Mohamed", "", "LIMOSE, University of Boumerdes, Boumerdes,\n  Algeria"], ["Strecker", "Martin", "", "IRIT"]]}, {"id": "1307.8212", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Razika Lounas (University of Boumerdes, Algeria), Mohamed Mezghiche\n  (University of Boumerdes, Algeria), Jean-Louis Lanet (Universityof Limoges,\n  France)", "title": "Towards a General Framework for Formal Reasoning about Java Bytecode\n  Transformation", "comments": "In Proceedings SCSS 2012, arXiv:1307.8029", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 122, 2013, pp. 63-73", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.122.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Program transformation has gained a wide interest since it is used for\nseveral purposes: altering semantics of a program, adding features to a program\nor performing optimizations.
