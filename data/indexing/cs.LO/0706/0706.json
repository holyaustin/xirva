That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational\nresource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural\nsort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such\nreusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of\nreduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more\nthan just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization.\nThe first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three\nnatural versions. While those three versions are very different from each\nother, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable,\nwith that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative\nintuitionistic logic. Among the other contributions of the present article is\nan informal introduction of a series of new -- finite and bounded -- versions\nof recurrence operations and the associated reduction operations.
