This\nhas renewed interest in partial order semantics as a theoretical foundation for\nformal verification techniques. Among these, symbolic techniques have been\nshown to be particularly effective at finding concurrency-related bugs because\nthey can leverage highly optimized decision procedures such as SAT/SMT solvers.\nThis paper gives new fundamental results on partial order semantics for\nSAT/SMT-based symbolic encodings of weak memory concurrency. In particular, we\ngive the theoretical basis for a decision procedure that can handle a fragment\nof concurrent programs endowed with least fixed point operators. In addition,\nwe show that a certain partial order semantics of relaxed sequential\nconsistency is equivalent to the conjunction of three extensively studied weak\nmemory axioms by Alglave et al. An important consequence of this equivalence is\nan asymptotically smaller symbolic encoding for bounded model checking which\nhas only a quadratic number of partial order constraints compared to the\nstate-of-the-art cubic-size encoding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 21:03:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Horn", "Alex", ""], ["Kroening", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.00039", "submitter": "Sadegh Esmaeil Zadeh Soudjani", "authors": "Sadegh Esmaeil Zadeh Soudjani (University of Oxford), Alessandro Abate\n  (University of Oxford)", "title": "Quantitative Approximation of the Probability Distribution of a Markov\n  Process by Formal Abstractions", "comments": "29 pages, Journal of Logical Methods in Computer Science", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 11, Issue 3 (September\n  4, 2015) lmcs:1584", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-11(3:8)2015", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The goal of this work is to formally abstract a Markov process evolving in\ndiscrete time over a general state space as a finite-state Markov chain, with\nthe objective of precisely approximating its state probability distribution in\ntime, which allows for its approximate, faster computation by that of the\nMarkov chain. The approach is based on formal abstractions and employs an\narbitrary finite partition of the state space of the Markov process, and the\ncomputation of average transition probabilities between partition sets. The\nabstraction technique is formal, in that it comes with guarantees on the\nintroduced approximation that depend on the diameters of the partitions: as\nsuch, they can be tuned at will.

However, for coalition logics with unbounded resource\nproduction and consumption, only some undecidability results are known. In this\npaper, we show that the model-checking problem for RB-ATL with unbounded\nproduction and con- sumption of resources is decidable but EXPSPACE-hard. We\nalso investigate some tractable cases and provide a detailed comparison to a\nvariant of the resource logic RAL, together with new complexity results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Apr 2015 22:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Alechina", "Natasha", ""], ["Logan", "Brian", ""], ["Nguyen", "Hoang Nga", ""], ["Raimondi", "Franco", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.06986", "submitter": "Sven Linker", "authors": "Sven Linker (Carl von Ossietzky Universit\\\"at Oldenburg), Martin\n  Hilscher (Carl von Ossietzky Universit\\\"at Oldenburg)", "title": "Proof Theory of a Multi-Lane Spatial Logic", "comments": "This paper is the extended and slightly revised version of our\n  publication in the 10th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of\n  Computing (ICTAC) in 2013", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 11, Issue 3 (August\n  18, 2015) lmcs:1580", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-11(3:4)2015", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend the Multi-lane Spatial Logic MLSL, introduced in previous work for\nproving the safety (collision freedom) of traffic maneuvers on a multi-lane\nhighway, by length measurement and dynamic modalities.

More recently categorical approaches to linguistics have also\nexploited the idea of mixed states to describe ambiguity and hyponym / hypernym\nrelationships. In both these application areas the category Rel of sets and\nbinary relations is often used as an alternative model. Selinger's CPM\nconstruction provides the setting for mixed states in Hilbert space based\ncategorical quantum mechanics. By analogy, applying the CPM construction to Rel\nis seen as introducing mixing into a relational setting. We investigate the\ncategory CPM(Rel) of completely positive maps in Rel. We show that the states\nof an object in CPM(Rel) are in bijective correspondence with certain families\nof graphs. Via map-state duality this then allows us provide a graph theoretic\ncharacterization of the morphisms in CPM(Rel). By identifying an appropriate\ncomposition operation on graphs, we then show that CPM(Rel) is isomorphic to a\ncategory of sets and graphs between them. This isomorphism then leads to a\ngraph based description of the complete join semilattice enriched dagger\ncompact structure of CPM(Rel). These results allow us to reason about CPM(Rel)\nentirely in terms of graphs. We exploit these techniques in several examples.\nWe give a closed form expression for the number of states of a finite set in\nCPM(Rel). The pure states are characterized in graph theoretic terms. We also\ndemonstrate the possibly surprising phenomenon of a pure state that can be\ngiven as a mixture of two mixed states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 09:44:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 02:52:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Marsden", "Daniel", "", "University of Oxford"]]}, {"id": "1504.07702", "submitter": "Ayca Balkan", "authors": "Ayca Balkan, Moshe Vardi and Paulo Tabuada", "title": "Mode-Target Games: Reactive Synthesis for Control Applications", "comments": "This version is an extension of the conference version of the\n  original paper titled \"Controller Synthesis for Mode-Target Games\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.GT cs.LO cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a class of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)\nspecifications for which the problem of synthesizing controllers can be solved\nin polynomial time.
