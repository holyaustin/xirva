As network protocols have become\nincreasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has\nbecome increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific\nlanguage, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing\nconstraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates\nstubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to\nuse, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu\nis also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and\nmessage fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,\nZebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks\nspecification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation\nof the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and\nRTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Apr 2007 08:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Laurent", "Burgy", "", "INRIA Futurs"], ["R\u00e9veill\u00e8re", "Laurent", "", "INRIA Futurs"], ["Lawall", "Julia", "", "DIKU"], ["Muller", "Gilles", "", "INRIA Rennes"]]}, {"id": "0704.2448", "submitter": "Ugo Dal Lago", "authors": "Patrick Baillot, Paolo Coppola and Ugo Dal Lago", "title": "Light Logics and Optimal Reduction: Completeness and Complexity", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PL", "license": null, "abstract": "  Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.)\nhas been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of\ntyped terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial\n(elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated\nby optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm.
