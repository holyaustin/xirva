The model is then applied to\ngive a notion of validity to the judgements made by concurrent separation logic\nthat emphasizes the process-environment duality inherent in such rely-guarantee\nreasoning. Soundness of the rules of concurrent separation logic with respect\nto this definition of validity is shown. The independence information retained\nby the Petri net model is then exploited to characterize the independence of\nparallel processes enforced by the logic. This is shown to permit a refinement\noperation capable of changing the granularity of atomic actions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Feb 2008 15:39:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2008 15:26:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hayman", "Jonathan", ""], ["Winskel", "Glynn", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1578", "submitter": "Kees Middelburg", "authors": "J.

This effect appears to be independent of application or type\nrelationship. A simple generative model is proposed to explore the proposition\nthat the difference arises because the programmer is aware of the out-degree of\na type but not of its in-degree.
