In this article we add the\nmodeling of unobservable, mechanistic processing, in particular processing due\nto jump instructions. We model mechanistic processing preceding some further\nbehavior as a delay of that behavior; we borrow a unary delay operator from\ndiscrete time process algebra. We define a mechanistic improvement ordering on\nthreads and observe that some threads do not have an optimal implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 13:57:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "Jan A.", ""], ["van der Zwaag", "Mark B.", ""]]}]
