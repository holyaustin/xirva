The ML module system, object systems and mixins are\ngood examples of language constructs promoting modular programming. Among the\nthree, mixins can be thought of as a generalization of the two others in the\nsense that mixins can incorporate features of ML modules and objects with a set\nof primitive operators with clean semantics. Much work has been devoted to\nbuild mixin-based module systems for practical programming languages. In\nrespect of the operational semantics, previous work notably investigated mixin\ncalculi in call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation settings. In this paper we\nexamine a mixin calculus in a call-by-need, or lazy, evaluation setting. We\ndemonstrate how lazy mixins can be interesting in practice with a series of\nexamples, and formalize the operational semantics by adapting Ancona and\nZucca's concise formalization of call-by-name mixins. We then extend the\nsemantics with constraints to control the evaluation order of components of\nmixins in several ways. The main motivation for considering the constraints is\nto produce side effects in a more explicit order than in a purely lazy,\ndemand-driven setting. We explore the design space of possibly interesting\nconstraints and consider two examples in detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2009 17:20:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nakata", "Keiko", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4005", "submitter": "Emmanuel Nataf", "authors": "Emmanuel Nataf (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Olivier Festor (INRIA\n  Lorraine - LORIA)", "title": "jYang : A YANG parser in java", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The NETCONF configuration protocol of the IETF Network Work- ing Group\nprovides mechanisms to manipulate the configuration of network devices.
