By exploiting the intrinsic shifting and\nsymmetry properties of the check matrices, significant reduction of memory size\nand routing complexity can be achieved. Two different efficient network\narchitectures for Class-I and Class-II non-binary QC-LDPC decoders have been\nproposed, respectively. Comparison results have shown that for the code of the\n64-ary (1260, 630) rate-0.5 Class-I code, the proposed scheme can save more\nthan 70.6% hardware required by shuffle network than the state-of-the-art\ndesigns. The proposed decoder example for the 32-ary (992, 496) rate-0.5\nClass-II code can achieve a 93.8% shuffle network reduction compared with the\nconventional ones. Meanwhile, based on the similarity of Class-I and Class-II\ncodes, similar shuffle network is further developed to incorporate both classes\nof codes at a very low cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2011 01:10:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Chuan", ""], ["Parhi", "Keshab K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.0704", "submitter": "Chuan Zhang", "authors": "Chuan Zhang, Bo Yuan, and Keshab K.

This is especially true\nin power-constrained environments, such as embedded and mobile computing. While\nlowering the operational voltage can reduce power consumption, there are limits\nimposed at design time, beyond which hardware components experience faulty\noperation. Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher\nsusceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and\nlowering yield. However, not all computations and all data in a workload need\nto maintain 100% fidelity. In this paper, we explore the idea of employing\nfunctional or storage units that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on\nthe design to guarantee reliable execution. Rather, these units exhibit Elastic\nFidelity, by judiciously lowering the voltage to trade-off reliable execution\nfor power consumption based on the error guarantees required by the executing\ncode. By estimating the accuracy required by each computational segment of a\nworkload, and steering each computation to different functional and storage\nunits, Elastic Fidelity Computing obtains power and energy savings while\nreaching the reliability targets required by each computational segment. Our\npreliminary results indicate that even with conservative estimates, Elastic\nFidelity can reduce the power and energy consumption of a processor by 11-13%\nwhen executing applications involving human perception that are typically\nincluded in modern mobile platforms, such as audio, image, and video decoding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2011 04:12:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Sourya", ""], ["Clemons", "Tyler", ""], ["Faisal", "S M", ""], ["Liu", "Ke", ""], ["Hardavellas", "Nikos", ""], ["Parthasarathy", "Srinivasan", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4287", "submitter": "Dmitry Zinoviev", "authors": "Dmitry Zinoviev", "title": "Parametric Estimation of the Ultimate Size of Hypercomputers", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures, published in Proc. 6th World Multiconference on\n  Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, 2002", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The performance of the emerging petaflops-scale supercomputers of the nearest\nfuture (hypercomputers) will be governed not only by the clock frequency of the\nprocessing nodes or by the width of the system bus, but also by such factors as\nthe overall power consumption and the geometric size.
