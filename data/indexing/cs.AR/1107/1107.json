The sophisticated design of a\nreversible arithmetic logic unit (reversible ALU) for quantum arithmetic has\nbeen investigated in this letter. We provide explicit construction of\nreversible ALU effecting basic arithmetic operations. By provided the\ncorresponding control unit, the proposed reversible ALU can combine the\nclassical arithmetic and logic operation in a reversible integrated system.\nThis letter provides actual evidence to prove the possibility of the\nrealization of reversible Programmable Logic Device (RPLD) using reversible\nALU.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 09:20:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["zhou", "Rigui", ""], ["shi", "Yang", ""], ["Zhang", "Manqun", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4851", "submitter": "Debabala Swain", "authors": "Debabala Swain, Bijay Paikaray, Debabrata Swain", "title": "AWRP: Adaptive Weight Ranking Policy for Improving Cache Performance", "comments": "6 pages; Journal of Computing, Volume 3, Issue 2, February 2011, ISSN\n  2151-9617; http://www.journalofcomputing.org", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the huge difference in performance between the computer memory and\nprocessor, the virtual memory management plays a vital role in system\nperformance. A Cache memory is the fast memory which is used to compensate the\nspeed difference between the memory and processor.
