Those types of radios are realized using highly\nconfigurable hardware platforms. Convolutional codes are used in every robust\ndigital communication system and Viterbi algorithm is employed in wireless\ncommunications to decode the convolutional codes. Such decoders are complex and\ndissipate large amount of power. In this paper, a low power-reconfigurable\nViterbi decoder for WiMAX receiver is described using a VHDL code for FPGA\nimplementation. The proposed design is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro,\nXC2vpx30 FPGA using the FPGA Advantage Pro package provided by Mentor Graphics\nand ISE 10.1 by Xilinx.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 14:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Shaker", "Sherif Welsen", ""], ["Elramly", "Salwa Hussien", ""], ["Shehata", "Khaled Ali", ""]]}]
