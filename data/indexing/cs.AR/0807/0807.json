The Archer infrastructure\nintegrates virtualization and batch scheduling middleware to deliver\nhigh-throughput computing resources aggregated from resources distributed\nacross wide-area networks and owned by different participating entities in a\nseamless manner. The paper discusses the motivations leading to the design of\nArcher, describes its core middleware components, and presents an analysis of\nthe functionality and performance of a prototype wide-area deployment running a\nrepresentative computer architecture simulation workload.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jul 2008 02:47:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Figueiredo", "Renato", ""], ["Boykin", "P.

The PIV tech-niques compute and display all the motion vectors of the\nfield in a resulting image. Speeds more than thou-sand vectors per second can\nbe required, each speed being environment-dependent. Essence of this work is to\npropose an adaptive FPGA-based system for real-time PIV algorithms. The\nproposed structure is ge-neric so that this unique structure can be re-used for\nany PIV applications that uses the cross-correlation technique. The major\nstructure remains unchanged, adaptations only concern the number of processing\noperations. The required speed (corresponding to the number of vector per\nsecond) is obtained thanks to a parallel processing strategy. The image\nprocessing designer duplicates the processing modules to distrib-ute the\noperations. The result is a FPGA-based archi-tecture, which is easily adapted\nto algorithm specifica-tions without any hardware requirement. The design flow\nis fast and reliable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jul 2008 19:22:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Aubert", "Alain", "", "LAHC"], ["Bochard", "Nathalie", "", "LAHC"], ["Fresse", "Virginie", "", "LAHC"]]}]
