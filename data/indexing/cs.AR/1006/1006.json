It is generally accepted\nthat during logic synthesis power tracks well with area. This means that a\nlarger design will generally consume more power. The multiplier is an important\nkernel of digital signal processors. Because of the circuit complexity, the\npower consumption and area are the two important design considerations of the\nmultiplier. In this paper a low power low area architecture for the shift and\nadd multiplier is proposed. For getting the low power low area architecture,\nthe modifications made to the conventional architecture consist of the\nreduction in switching activities of the major blocks of the multiplier, which\nincludes the reduction in switching activity of the adder and counter. This\narchitecture avoids the shifting of the multiplier register. The simulation\nresult for 8 bit multipliers shows that the proposed low power architecture\nlowers the total power consumption by 35.25% and area by 52.72 % when compared\nto the conventional architecture. Also the reduction in power consumption\nincreases with the increase in bit width.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 06:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Marimuthu", "C.
