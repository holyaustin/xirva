More precisely, it is all\nabout resource virtualization as the term hardware virtualization is\nemphasized. In this paper, the aim is to find out the advantages and\nlimitations of current virtualization techniques, analyze their cost and\nperformance and also depict which forthcoming hardware virtualization\ntechniques will able to provide efficient solutions for multiprocessor\noperating systems. This is done by making a methodical literature survey and\nstatistical analysis of the benchmark reports provided by SPEC (Standard\nPerformance Evaluation Corporation) and TPC (Transaction processing Performance\nCouncil). Finally, this paper presents the current aspects of hardware\nvirtualization which will help the IT managers of the large organizations to\ntake effective decision while choosing server with virtualization support.\nAgain, the future works described in section 4 of this paper focuses on some\nreal world challenges such as abstraction of multiple servers, language level\nvirtualization, pre-virtualization etc. which may be point of great interest\nfor the researchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 06:15:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Biswas", "Kamanashis", ""], ["Islam", "Md.

The input in such systems typically consists of a stream of\nXML documents and a set of user subscriptions expressed as XML queries. The\npub-sub system then filters the published documents and passes them to the\nsubscribers. Pub-sub systems are characterized by very high input ratios,\ntherefore the processing time is critical. In this paper we propose a \"pure\nhardware\" based solution, which utilizes XPath query blocks on FPGA to solve\nthe filtering problem. By utilizing the high throughput that an FPGA provides\nfor parallel processing, our approach achieves drastically better throughput\nthan the existing software or mixed (hardware/software) architectures. The\nXPath queries (subscriptions) are translated to regular expressions which are\nthen mapped to FPGA devices. By introducing stacks within the FPGA we are able\nto express and process a wide range of path queries very efficiently, on a\nscalable environment. Moreover, the fact that the parser and the filter\nprocessing are performed on the same FPGA chip, eliminates expensive\ncommunication costs (that a multi-core system would need) thus enabling very\nfast and efficient pipelining. Our experimental evaluation reveals more than\none order of magnitude improvement compared to traditional pub/sub systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:10:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mitra", "Abhishek", "", "UC Riverside"], ["Vieira", "Marcos", "", "UCR"], ["Bakalov", "Petko", "", "ESRI"], ["Najjar", "Walid", "", "UCR"], ["Tsotras", "Vassilis", "", "UCR"]]}, {"id": "0909.1876", "submitter": "Maurizio Martina", "authors": "Maurizio Martina, Guido Masera", "title": "Turbo NOC: a framework for the design of Network On Chip based turbo\n  decoder architectures", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems I (submission date\n  27 may 2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSI.2010.2046257", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work proposes a general framework for the design and simulation of\nnetwork on chip based turbo decoder architectures.
