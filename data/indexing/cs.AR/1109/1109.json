The utilization of 3D is limited by the\nproblem of temperature crisis. It is important to develop an accurate power\nprofile extraction methodology to design 3D structure. In this paper, design of\n3D integration of memory is considered and hence the static power dissipation\nof the memory cell is analysed in transistor level and is used to accurately\nmodel the inter-layer thermal effects for 3D memory stack. Subsequently,\npackaging of the chip is considered and modelled using an architecture level\nsimulator. This modelling is intended to analyse the thermal effects of 3D\nmemory, its reliability and lifetime of the chip, with greater accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Sep 2011 12:28:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Cherian", "Annmol", ""], ["Augustine", "Ajay", ""], ["Jose", "Jemy", ""], ["Pangracious", "Vinod", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0752", "submitter": "Huaxi Gu", "authors": "Jing Zhang, Huaxi Gu, Yintang Yang", "title": "An improved distributed routing algorithm for Benes based optical NoC", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Integrated optical interconnect is believed to be one of the main\ntechnologies to replace electrical wires.

Routing algorithm plays an important role in determining the\nperformance of ONoC. But traditional routing algorithms for Benes network are\nnot suitable for ONoC communication, we developed a new distributed routing\nalgorithm for Benes ONoC in this paper.
