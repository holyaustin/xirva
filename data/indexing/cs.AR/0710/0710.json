On the other hand, a\npair comprising a Serial to Parallel Converter (SPC) and a Parallel to Serial\nConverter (PSC) is utilized to replace the bi-directional serial interface, to\navoid the problems of serial fault masking and defect rate dependent diagnosis.\nResults from our evaluations show that the proposed diagnosis scheme achieves\nan increased diagnosis coverage and reduces diagnosis time compared to those\nobtained in [A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory\nbuffers, A parallel built-in self-diagnostic method for embedded memory\narrays], with neglectable extra area cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2007 08:34:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Baosheng", ""], ["Wu", "Yuejian", ""], ["Ivanov", "Andre", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4656", "submitter": "EDA Publishing Association", "authors": "Minas Dasygenis, Erik Brockmeyer, Bart Durinck, Francky Catthoor,\n  Dimitrios Soudris, Antonios Thanailakis", "title": "A Memory Hierarchical Layer Assigning and Prefetching Technique to\n  Overcome the Memory Performance/Energy Bottleneck", "comments": "Submitted on behalf of EDAA (http://www.edaa.com/)", "journal-ref": "Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe - DATE'05, Munich :\n  Allemagne (2005)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The memory subsystem has always been a bottleneck in performance as well as\nsignificant power contributor in memory intensive applications.

In this paper we analyze the performance bottlenecks of various\ndata memory managers integrated in typical Network Processing Units (NPUs). We\nexpose the performance limitations of software implementations utilizing the\nRISC processing cores typically found in most NPU architectures and we identify\nthe requirements for hardware assisted memory management in order to achieve\nwire-speed operation at gigabit per second rates. Furthermore, we describe the\narchitecture and performance of a hardware memory manager that fulfills those\nrequirements. This memory manager, although it is implemented in a\nreconfigurable technology, it can provide up to 6.2Gbps of aggregate\nthroughput, while handling 32K independent queues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2007 12:00:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Papaefstathiou", "I.", ""], ["Orphanoudakis", "T.", ""], ["Kornaros", "G.", ""], ["Kachris", "C.", ""], ["Mavroidis", "I.", ""], ["Nikologiannis", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4814", "submitter": "EDA Publishing Association", "authors": "Andrew Duller, Daniel Towner, Gajinder Panesar, Alan Gray, Will\n  Robbins", "title": "picoArray Technology: The Tool's Story", "comments": "Submitted on behalf of EDAA (http://www.edaa.com/)", "journal-ref": "Dans Design, Automation and Test in Europe | Designers'Forum -\n  DATE'05, Munich : Allemagne (2005)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper briefly describes the picoArray? architecture, and in particular\nthe deterministic internal communication fabric.
