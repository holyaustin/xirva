In this paper, we introduce\n4 different logical assignations to implement sequential logic in the memristor\nand introduce the physical rules, summation, `bounce-back', directionality and\n`diminishing returns', elucidated from our investigations. We then demonstrate\nhow memristor sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate\nand a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the\nmemristor's memory to add three binary values together and outputs the value,\nthe carry digit and even the order they were input in.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 15:40:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Gale", "Ella", ""], ["Costello", "Ben de Lacy", ""], ["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.4046", "submitter": "Ella Gale", "authors": "Ella Gale, Ben de Lacy Costello and Andrew Adamatzky", "title": "Boolean Logic Gates From A Single Memristor Via Low-Level Sequential\n  Logic", "comments": "Conference paper, published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer\n  Science http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39074-6_9", "journal-ref": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 7956 2013 Unconventional\n  Computation and Natural Computation 12th International Conference, UCNC 2013,\n  Milan, Italy, July 1-5, 2013.

The computational principles and\nstructures needed to narrow this gap are unknown.

We find that by\nconnecting stochastic digital components according to simple mathematical\nrules, one can build massively parallel, low precision circuits that solve\nBayesian inference problems and are compatible with the Poisson firing\nstatistics of cortical neurons. We evaluate circuits for depth and motion\nperception, perceptual learning and causal reasoning, each performing inference\nover 10,000+ latent variables in real time - a 1,000x speed advantage over\ncommodity microprocessors.
