Stemming from previous publications, this work\nconcentrates first on improving the throughput by exploiting adaptive-bandwidth\nreduction techniques. This technique shows in the best case an improvement of\nmore than 60 Mb/s. Moreover, it is known that double-binary turbo decoders\nrequire higher area than binary ones. This characteristic has the negative\neffect of increasing the data width of the network nodes. Thus, the second\ncontribution of this work is to reduce the network complexity to support\ndoublebinary codes, by exploiting bit-level and pseudo-floating-point\nrepresentation of the extrinsic information. These two techniques allow for an\narea reduction of up to more than the 40% with a performance degradation of\nabout 0.2 dB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 May 2011 08:41:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Martina", "Maurizio", ""], ["Masera", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1967", "submitter": "Wajeb Gharibi", "authors": "Vladimir Hahanov, Eugenia Litvinova, Wajeb Gharibi, Olesya Guz", "title": "Algebra-Logical Repair Method for FPGA Logic Blocks", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Radioelectronics and Informatics, No.2, Vol. 45, pp.\n  49-56, April -- June 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An algebra-logical repair method for FPGA functional logic blocks on the\nbasis of solving the coverage problem is proposed.

The iterative decoding algorithms\nrequired for these codes involve high computational complexity and high\nprocessing throughput is achieved by allocating a sufficient number of\nprocessing elements (PEs). Supporting multiple heterogeneous LDPC codes on a\nparallel decoder poses serious problems in the design of the interconnect\nstructure for such PEs. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of\nNoC (Network on Chip) based decoders, where full flexibility in terms of\nsupported LDPC codes is obtained resorting to an NoC to connect PEs. NoC based\nLDPC decoders have been previously considered unfeasible because of the cost\noverhead associated to packet management and routing. On the contrary, the\ndesigned NoC adopts a low complexity routing, which introduces a very limited\ncost overhead with respect to architectures dedicated to specific classes of\ncodes. Moreover the paper proposes an efficient configuration technique, which\nallows for fast on--the--fly switching among different codes. The decoder\narchitecture is scalable and VLSI synthesis results are presented for several\ncases of study, including the whole set of WiMAX LDPC codes, WiFi codes and\nDVB-S2 standard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 May 2011 07:17:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Condo", "Carlo", ""], ["Masera", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2960", "submitter": "Tsahee Zidenberg", "authors": "Tsahee Zidenberg, Isaac Keslassy, and Uri Weiser", "title": "Multi-Amdahl: Optimal Resource Sharing with Multiple Program Execution\n  Segments", "comments": "Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "TR11-03", "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents Multi-Amdahl, a resource allocation analytical tool for\nheterogeneous systems.
