However,\nself-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,\ne.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,\nrequiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks\nis arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could\neliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is\nto overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with\ninstant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.\nHowever, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the\norganizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that\ndescribe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this\npaper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks\nto form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this\napproach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the\nsame way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or\nservice providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of\nnetworks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation.\nThis paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the\nInjection Communication paradigm as principal concept.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jun 2007 08:23:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Brust", "Matthias R.", ""], ["Rothkugel", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1692", "submitter": "Cyrille Chavet", "authors": "Cyrille Chavet (LESTER, STM), Philippe Coussy (LESTER), Pascal Urard\n  (STM), Eric Martin (LESTER)", "title": "A Methodology for Efficient Space-Time Adapter Design Space Exploration:\n  A Case Study of an Ultra Wide Band Interleaver", "comments": "ISBN:1-4244-0921-7", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and\n  Systems (ISCAS) (28/05/2007) 2946", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper presents a solution to efficiently explore the design space of\ncommunication adapters.

This technique has been applied to System-on-Chip (SoC) design\nwhose complexity and heterogeneity are growing. The re-use is made thanks to\nhigh level components, called virtual components (IP), available in more or\nless flexible forms. These components are dedicated blocks: digital signal\nprocessing (DCT, FFT), telecommunications (Viterbi, TurboCodes),... These\nblocks rest on a model of fixed architecture with very few degrees of\npersonalization. This rigidity is particularly true for the communication\ninterface whose orders of acquisition and production of data, the temporal\nbehavior and protocols of exchanges are fixed. The successful integration of\nsuch an IP requires that the designer (1) synchronizes the components (2)\nconverts the protocols between \"incompatible\" blocks (3) temporizes the data to\nguarantee the temporal constraints and the order of the data. This phase\nremains however very manual and source of errors. Our approach proposes a\nformal modeling, based on an original Ressource Compatibility Graph.
