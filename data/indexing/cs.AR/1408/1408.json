One way to manage the growing complexity of these systems is\nto increase the level of abstraction and to address the system-level design. In\nthis paper, we focus on the implementation in SystemC language with TLM\n(Transaction Level Model) to model an MPSOC platform. Our main contribution is\nto define a comprehensive, fast and accurate method for designing and\nevaluating performance for MPSoC systems. The studied MPSoC is composed of\nMicroBlaze microprocessors, memory, a timer, a VGA and an interrupt handler\nwith two examples of software. This paper has two novel contributions: the\nfirst is to develop this MPSOC at CABA and TLM for ISS (Instruction Set\nSimulator), Native simulations and timed Programmer s View (PV+T); the second\nis to show that with PV+T simulations we can achieve timing fidelity with\nhigher speeds than CABA simulations and have almost the same precision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 14:19:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Alali", "Abdelhakim", ""], ["Assayad", "Ismail", ""], ["Sadik", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4423", "submitter": "Frank Hannig", "authors": "Frank Hannig, Dirk Koch, Daniel Ziener", "title": "Proceedings of the First International Workshop on FPGAs for Software\n  Programmers (FSP 2014)", "comments": "Website of the workshop: https://www12.cs.fau.de/ws/fsp2014/", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR cs.DC cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the papers accepted at the First International Workshop\non FPGAs for Software Programmers (FSP 2014), held in Munich, Germany,\nSeptember 1st, 2014.
