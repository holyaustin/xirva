This newly found element can easily be\ncombined with crossbar interconnect technology which this new structure has\nopened a new field in designing configurable or programmable electronic\nsystems. These systems in return can have applications in signal processing and\nartificial intelligence. In this paper, based on the simple memristor crossbar\nstructure, we propose new and simple circuits for hardware implementation of\nfuzzy membership functions. In our proposed circuits, these fuzzy membership\nfunctions can have any shapes and resolutions. In addition, these circuits can\nbe used as a basis in the construction of evolutionary systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Sep 2010 07:46:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Merrikh-Bayat", "Farnood", ""], ["Shouraki", "Saeed Bagheri", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1305", "submitter": "Moshe Mishali", "authors": "Moshe Mishali and Yonina C.

The advantages\nof our system with respect to current architectures are threefold. First, our\nanalog front-end is fixed and does not involve scanning hardware. Second, both\nthe analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and the digital signal processing (DSP)\nrates are substantially below Nyquist. Finally, the sensing resources are\nshared with the reception path of the CR, so that the lowrate streaming samples\ncan be used for communication purposes of the device, besides the sensing\nfunctionality they provide. Combining these advantages leads to a real time map\nof the spectrum with minimal use of mobile resources. Our approach is based on\nthe modulated wideband converter (MWC) system, which samples sparse wideband\ninputs at sub-Nyquist rates. We report on results of hardware experiments,\nconducted on an MWC prototype circuit, which affirm fast and accurate spectrum\nsensing in parallel to CR communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Sep 2010 14:26:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mishali", "Moshe", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1796", "submitter": "Maddu Kamaraju", "authors": "M.Kamaraju, K.Lal Kishore, A.V.N.Tilak", "title": "Power optimized programmable embedded controller", "comments": "11 pages,11 figures,International Journal Publication", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications\n  (IJCNC),Vol.2, No.4, July 2010", "doi": "10.5121/ijcnc.2010.2409", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Now a days, power has become a primary consideration in hardware design, and\nis critical in computer systems especially for portable devices with high\nperformance and more functionality.
