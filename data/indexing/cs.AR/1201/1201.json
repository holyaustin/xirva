To enable the\ntransmission data signal modulated on a carrier signal is superimposed on the\nelectrical wires. Typical power lines are designed to handle 50/60 Hz of AC\npower signal; however they can carry the signals up to 500 KHz frequency. This\nwork aims to aid transmission/reception of an audio signal in the spectrum from\n300 Hz to 4000 Hz using PLCC on a tunable carrier frequency in the spectrum\nfrom 200 KHz to 500 KHz. For digital amplitude modulation the sampling rate of\nthe carrier and the audio signal has to be matched. Tunable carrier generation\ncan be achieved with Direct Digital Synthesizers at a desired sampling rate.\nDSP Sample rate conversion techniques are very useful to make the sampling\ncircuits to work on their own sampling rates which are fine for the\ndata/modulated-carrier signal's bandwidth. This also simplifies the complexity\nof the sampling circuits. Digital Up Conversion (DUC) and Digital Down\nConversion (DDC) are DSP sample rate conversion techniques which refer to\nincreasing and decreasing the sampling rate of a signal respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 16:46:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bhat", "Naagesh S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2542", "submitter": "Allin Christe", "authors": "S.

The temperature generated in an IC may vary\nwith floor plan of the chip. This paper proposes an integration and thermal\nanalysis methodology to extract the peak temperature and temperature\ndistribution of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional multiprocessor system-on-chip.\nAs we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures\ncompared to 2-dimensional ones due to the reduced space in intra-layer and\ninter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable\nto analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature\ndistribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation\nICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the\nother parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in\nexponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot\ntemperature value due to increase in leakage power. In this paper, we have\nanalysed the temperature developed in an IC with four identical processors at\n2.4 GHz in different floorplans. The analysis has been done for both 2D and 3D\narrangements. In the 3D arrangement, a three layered structure has been\nconsidered with two Silicon layers and a thermal interface material (TIM) in\nbetween them.
