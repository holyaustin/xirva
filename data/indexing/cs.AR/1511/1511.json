Security attacks targeting\nembedded systems illegally gain access to the information in these devices or\ndestroy information. The two most common types of attacks embedded systems\nencounter are code-injection and power analysis attacks. In the past, a number\nof countermeasures, both hardware- and software-based, were proposed\nindividually against these two types of attacks. However, no single system\nexists to counter both of these two prominent attacks in a processor based\nembedded system. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, proposes a\nhardware/software based countermeasure against both code-injection attacks and\npower analysis based side-channel attacks in a dual core embedded system. The\nproposed processor, named SecureD, has an area overhead of just 3.80% and an\naverage runtime increase of 20.0% when compared to a standard dual processing\nsystem. The overhead were measured using a set of industry standard application\nbenchmarks, with two encryption and five other programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 23:00:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ragel", "Roshan G.", ""], ["Ambrose", "Jude A.", ""], ["Parameswaran", "Sri", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.03639", "submitter": "Johannes Hofmann", "authors": "Johannes Hofmann, Dietmar Fey, Jan Eitzinger, Georg Hager, Gerhard\n  Wellein", "title": "Analysis of Intel's Haswell Microarchitecture Using The ECM Model and\n  Microbenchmarks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1509.03118", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an in-depth analysis of Intel's Haswell microarchitecture\nfor streaming loop kernels.

A capacitively coupled transmitter\nwith a weak driver is used as the transmitter. The receiver samples the low\nswing input data at the center of the data eye and converts it to rail to rail\nlevels and also synchronizes the data to the receiver's clock domain. The\nsystem is a mixed signal circuit and the digital components are all scan\ntestable. For the analog section, just a DC test has a fault coverage of 50% of\nthe structural faults. Simple techniques allow integration of the analog\ncomponents into the digital scan chain increasing the coverage to 74%.

Digital LDOs (DLDO) can\noffer low voltage operation, faster transient response, and higher current\nefficiency. Response time as well as output voltage ripple can be reduced by\nincreasing the speed of the dynamic comparators. However, the comparator offset\nsteeply increases for high clock frequencies, thereby leading to enhanced\nvariations in output voltage. In this work we explore the design of digital\nLDOs with multiple dynamic comparators that can overcome this bottleneck. In\nthe proposed topology, we apply time-interleaved comparators with the same\nvoltage threshold and uniform current step in order to accomplish the\naforementioned features. Simulation based analysis shows that the DLDO with\ntime-interleaved comparators can achieve better overall performance in terms of\ncurrent efficiency, ripple and settling time. For a load step of 50mA, a DLDO\nwith 8 time-interleaved comparators could achieve an output ripple of less than\n5mV, while achieving a settling time of less than 0.5us.
