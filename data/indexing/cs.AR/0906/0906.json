The trojan is produced not\nvia additional logic circuitry but by controlled scenarios that maximize and\naccelerate the HCI effect in transistors. These scenarios range from\nmanipulating the manufacturing process to varying the internal voltage\ndistribution. This new type of trojan is difficult to test due to its gradual\nhardware degradation mechanism. This paper describes the HCI effect, detection\ntechniques and discusses the possibility for maliciously induced HCI trojans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2009 22:56:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Shiyanovskii", "Y.", ""], ["Wolff", "F.", ""], ["Papachristou", "C.", ""], ["Weyer", "D.", ""], ["Clay", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3834", "submitter": "Yuriy Shiyanovskii", "authors": "Y.

These hidden defects or hardware Trojans can be created by\ndeviation from foundry design rules and processing parameters. The Trojans are\nproduced by exploiting time-based wearing mechanisms (HCI, NBTI, TDDB and EM)\nand/or condition-based triggers (ESD, Latchup and Softerror). This class of\nlatent damage is difficult to test due to its gradual degradation nature. The\npaper describes life-time expectancy results for various Trojan induced\nscenarios.
