The presented processor\nclass is a highly parameterizable template, which can be tailored before\nruntime to fulfill costumers' requirements such as performance, area cost, and\nenergy efficiency. These programmable accelerators are well suited for\ndomain-specific computing from the areas of signal, image, and video processing\nas well as other streaming processing applications. To overcome future scaling\nissues (e.g., power consumption, reliability, resource management, as well as\napplication parallelization and mapping), TCPAs are inherently designed in a\nway to support self-adaptivity and resource awareness at hardware level. Here,\nwe follow a recently introduced resource-aware parallel computing paradigm\ncalled invasive computing where an application can dynamically claim, execute,\nand release resources. Furthermore, we show how invasive computing can be used\nas an enabler for power management. Finally, we will introduce ideas on how to\nrealize fault-tolerant loop execution on such massively parallel architectures\nthrough employing on-demand spatial redundancies at the processor array level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 May 2014 16:39:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lari", "Vahid", ""], ["Tanase", "Alexandru", ""], ["Hannig", "Frank", ""], ["Teich", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2909", "submitter": "Elisabeth Glocker", "authors": "Elisabeth Glocker, Qingqing Chen, Asheque M.

More complicated memory modules would be accessed\nthrough a memory controller, which are also designed for one system. For\nmultiple systems to access a single memory module there must be some\nfacilitation that allows them to access the memory without overriding or\ncorrupting the access from the others. This was done with the use of a memory\narbiter, which controls the flow of traffic into the memory controller. The\narbiter has a set of rules to abide to in order to choose which system gets\nthrough to the memory controller. In this project, a regular RAM module is\ndesigned for use with one system. Furthermore, a memory arbiter is also\ndesigned in Verilog that allows for more than one system to use a single RAM\nmodule in a controlled and synchronized manner. The arbiter uses a fixed\npriority scheme to avoid starvation of the system. In addition one of the major\nproblems associated with such systems i.e. The Address Clash Problem has been\nnicely tackled and solved. The design is verified in simulation and validated\non a Xilinx ML605 evaluation board with a Virtex 6 FPGA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2014 16:31:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 09:02:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Banerji", "Sourangsu", ""]]}]
