Other than that, there is little consensus on what\ntype of technology and computing architecture holds most promises to go far\nbeyond today's top-down engineered silicon devices. Cellular automata (CA) have\nbeen proposed in the past as a possible class of architectures to the von\nNeumann computing architecture, which is not generally well suited for future\nparallel and fine-grained nanoscale electronics. While the top-down engineered\nsemi-conducting technology favors regular and locally interconnected\nstructures, future bottom-up self-assembled devices tend to have irregular\nstructures because of the current lack precise control over these processes. In\nthis paper, we will assess random dynamical networks, namely Random Boolean\nNetworks (RBNs) and Random Threshold Networks (RTNs), as alternative computing\narchitectures and models for future information processing devices. We will\nillustrate that--from a theoretical perspective--they offer superior properties\nover classical CA-based architectures, such as inherent robustness as the\nsystem scales up, more efficient information processing capabilities, and\nmanufacturing benefits for bottom-up designed devices, which motivates this\ninvestigation. We will present recent results on the dynamic behavior and\nrobustness of such random dynamical networks while also including manufacturing\nissues in the assessment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 May 2008 16:22:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Teuscher", "Christof", ""], ["Gulbahce", "Natali", ""], ["Rohlf", "Thimo", ""]]}]
