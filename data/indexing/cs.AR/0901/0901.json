It has a wide application in digital signal processing, fault\ntolerant systems, etc. In this work, we introduce the 3-moduli set {2^n,\n2^{2n}-1, 2^{2n}+1} and propose its residue to binary converter using the\nChinese Remainder Theorem. We present its simple hardware implementation that\nmainly includes one Carry Save Adder (CSA) and a Modular Adder (MA). We compare\nthe performance and area utilization of our reverse converter to the reverse\nconverters of the moduli sets {2^n-1, 2^n, 2^n+1, 2^{2n}+1} and {2^n-1, 2^n,\n2^n+1, 2^n-2^{(n+1)/2}+1, 2^n+2^{(n+1)/2}+1} that have the same dynamic range\nand we demonstrate that our architecture is better in terms of performance and\narea utilization. Also, we show that our reverse converter is faster than the\nreverse converter of {2^n-1, 2^n, 2^n+1} for dynamic ranges like 8-bit, 16-bit,\n32-bit and 64-bit however it requires more area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2009 20:14:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hariri", "Arash", ""], ["Navi", "K.", ""], ["Rastegar", "Reza", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4081", "submitter": "Linlin Zhang", "authors": "Linlin Zhang (LAHC), Anne Claire Legrand (LAHC), Virginie Fresse\n  (LAHC), Viktor Fischer (LAHC)", "title": "Adaptive FPGA NoC-based Architecture for Multispectral Image Correlation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An adaptive FPGA architecture based on the NoC (Network-on-Chip) approach is\nused for the multispectral image correlation.

In the\nnanowire crossbar architecture, nanowires are addressed by controlling voltages\non the mesowires. For area efficiency, we are interested in the maximum number\nof nanowires $N(m,e)$ that can be addressed by $m$ mesowires, in the face of up\nto $e$ fabrication errors. Asymptotically tight bounds on $N(m,e)$ are\nestablished in this paper. In particular, it is shown that $N(m,e) = \\Theta(2^m\n/ m^{e+1/2})$.
