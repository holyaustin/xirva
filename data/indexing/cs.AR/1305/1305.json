Specifically, the LDPCCC is derived from a\nquasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block code. By making use of the quasi-cyclic structure,\nthe proposed LDPCCC decoder adopts a dynamic message storage in the memory and\nuses a simple address controller. The decoder efficiently combines the memories\nin the pipelining processors into a large memory block so as to take advantage\nof the data-width of the embedded memory in a modern field-programmable gate\narray (FPGA). A rate-5/6 QC-LDPCCC has been implemented on an Altera Stratix\nFPGA. It achieves up to 2.0 Gb/s throughput with a clock frequency of 100 MHz.\nMoreover, the decoder displays an excellent error performance of lower than\n$10^{-13}$ at a bit-energy-to-noise-power-spectral-density ratio ($E_b/N_0$) of\n3.55 dB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 14:40:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sham", "Chiu-Wing", ""], ["Chen", "Xu", ""], ["Lau", "Francis C.

EURETILE investigates and implements brain-inspired and\nfault-tolerant foundational innovations to the system architecture of massively\nparallel tiled computer architectures and the corresponding programming\nparadigm. The execution targets are a many-tile HW platform, and a many-tile\nsimulator. A set of SW process - HW tile mapping candidates is generated by the\nholistic SW tool-chain using a combination of analytic and bio-inspired\nmethods. The Hardware dependent Software is then generated, providing OS\nservices with maximum efficiency/minimal overhead. The many-tile simulator\ncollects profiling data, closing the loop of the SW tool chain. Fine-grain\nparallelism inside processes is exploited by optimized intra-tile compilation\ntechniques, but the project focus is above the level of the elementary tile.\nThe elementary HW tile is a multi-processor, which includes a fault tolerant\nDistributed Network Processor (for inter-tile communication) and ASIP\naccelerators. Furthermore, EURETILE investigates and implements the innovations\nfor equipping the elementary HW tile with high-bandwidth, low-latency\nbrain-like inter-tile communication emulating 3 levels of connection hierarchy,\nnamely neural columns, cortical areas and cortex, and develops a dedicated\ncortical simulation benchmark: DPSNN-STDP (Distributed Polychronous Spiking\nNeural Net with synaptic Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity). EURETILE leverages\non the multi-tile HW paradigm and SW tool-chain developed by the FET-ACA SHAPES\nIntegrated Project (2006-2009).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2013 10:22:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paolucci", "Pier Stanislao", ""], ["Bacivarov", "Iuliana", ""], ["Goossens", "Gert", ""], ["Leupers", "Rainer", ""], ["Rousseau", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""], ["Schumacher", "Christoph", ""], ["Thiele", "Lothar", ""], ["Vicini", "Piero", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3038", "submitter": "Li Gongming", "authors": "Gongming Li, Hong An", "title": "Phase-Priority based Directory Coherence for Multicore Processor", "comments": "15 pages.

In\nthis paper, we propose PPB (Phase-Priority Based) cache coherence protocol, an\noptimization of modern directory coherence protocol. We take advantage of the\nobservation that transient states occur in directory coherence protocol,\nresulting in some unnecessary transient states and stalling. PPB cache\ncoherence protocol decouples a coherence transaction and introduces the idea of\nphase message. This phase is considered as the priority of the message.\nAdditionally, we also add new priority-based arbitrators in on-chip network to\nsupport PPB cache coherence protocol. This mechanism in on-chip network can\nsupport effective cache access, which makes the on-chip network more efficient.\nOur analysis on an execution-driven full system simulator using SPLASH-2\nbenchmark shows that PPB cache coherence outperforms a MESI based directory,\nand the number of unnecessary transient states and stalling reduces up to 24%.\nAlso it reported the speedup of 7.4%. Other advantages of this strategy are\nreduced delay of flits and significantly less energy consumption in on-chip\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2013 06:56:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Gongming", ""], ["An", "Hong", ""]]}]
