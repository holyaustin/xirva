This domain of\ncomputational physics is a recognized grand challenge of high-performance\ncomputing: the resources necessary to study in detail theoretical models that\ncan make contact with experimental data are by far beyond those available using\ncommodity computer systems. On the other hand, several specific features of the\nassociated algorithms suggest that unconventional computer architectures, which\ncan be implemented with available electronics technologies, may lead to order\nof magnitude increases in performance, reducing to acceptable values on human\nscales the time needed to carry out simulation campaigns that would take\ncenturies on commercially available machines. Janus II is one such machine,\nrecently developed and commissioned, that builds upon and improves on the\nsuccessful JANUS machine, which has been used for physics since 2008 and is\nstill in operation today.

Further, with each CMOS\ntechnology generation, leakage energy has been dramatically increasing and\nhence, leakage energy is expected to become a major source of energy\ndissipation, especially in last-level caches (LLCs). The conventional schemes\nof cache energy saving either aim at saving dynamic energy or are based on\nproperties specific to first-level caches, and thus these schemes have limited\nutility for last-level caches. Further, several other techniques require\noffline profiling or per-application tuning and hence are not suitable for\nproduct systems. In this research, we propose novel cache leakage energy saving\nschemes for single-core and multicore systems; desktop, QoS, real-time and\nserver systems. We propose software-controlled, hardware-assisted techniques\nwhich use dynamic cache reconfiguration to configure the cache to the most\nenergy efficient configuration while keeping the performance loss bounded. To\nprofile and test a large number of potential configurations, we utilize\nlow-overhead, micro-architecture components, which can be easily integrated\ninto modern processor chips. We adopt a system-wide approach to save energy to\nensure that cache reconfiguration does not increase energy consumption of other\ncomponents of the processor. We have compared our techniques with the\nstate-of-art techniques and have found that our techniques outperform them in\ntheir energy efficiency.
