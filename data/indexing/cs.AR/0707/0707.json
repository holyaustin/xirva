A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of\npotential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot\ncomputational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon\nnanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus\nderived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a\nnormalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic\ninduction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained\nin any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement.\nBriefly, Gaussian curvature of k<0 is debated in aim of specifying the 2D\nelectron gas characteristics in scenarios where data is stored in short\nintervals versus long ones e.g. when k'>(k<0) for greater CCNT diameters,\nspace-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from\nMaxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal\noscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e.g., time\nvarying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application\ncould also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best\nsupercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in\nminimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel\nmetallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the\ncircuit's staircase pyramidal construction, is discussed accordingly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2007 19:26:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2007 20:48:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2007 18:36:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2007 20:06:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 18 Jul 2007 11:22:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2007 16:31:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Alipour", "P.
