CSR generates C copies of a design by reusing the given\nlogic resources in a time sliced fashion. When all C design copies are\nstimulated with the same input values, then all C design copies should behave\nthe same way and will therefore create a redundant system. The paper shows that\nthis special method of using CSR offers great benefits when used in safety\ncritical and low power applications. Additional optimization techniques towards\nreducing register count are shown and an on-the-fly recovery mechanism is\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 15:43:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Strauch", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02239", "submitter": "Sungroh Yoon", "authors": "Eui-Young Chung, Chang-Il Son, Kwanhu Bang, Dong Kim, Soong-Mann Shin,\n  and Sungroh Yoon", "title": "A High-Performance Solid-State Disk with Double-Data-Rate NAND Flash\n  Memory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a novel solid-state disk (SSD) architecture that utilizes a\ndouble-data-rate synchronous NAND flash interface for improving read and write\nperformance. Unlike the conventional design, the data transfer rate in the\nproposed design is doubled in harmony with synchronous signaling. The new\narchitecture does not require any extra pins with respect to the conventional\narchitecture, thereby guaranteeing backward compatibility. For performance\nevaluation, we simulated various SSD designs that adopt the proposed\narchitecture and measured their performance in terms of read/write bandwidths\nand energy consumption. Both NAND flash cell types, namely single-level cells\n(SLCs) and multi-level cells (MLCs), were considered. In the experiments using\nSLC-type NAND flash chips, the read and write speeds of the proposed\narchitecture were 1.65-2.76 times and 1.09-2.45 times faster than those of the\nconventional architecture, respectively. Similar improvements were observed for\nthe MLC-based architectures tested. It was particularly effective to combine\nthe proposed architecture with the way-interleaving technique that multiplexes\nthe data channel between the controller and each flash chip. For a reasonably\nhigh degree of way interleaving, the read/write performance and the energy\nconsumption of our approach were notably better than those of the conventional\ndesign.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Feb 2015 11:07:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "Eui-Young", ""], ["Son", "Chang-Il", ""], ["Bang", "Kwanhu", ""], ["Kim", "Dong", ""], ["Shin", "Soong-Mann", ""], ["Yoon", "Sungroh", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.03057", "submitter": "Mostafa Darvishi", "authors": "Mostafa Darvishi, Yves Audet, Yves Blaqui\\`ere, and Claude Thibeault", "title": "Circuit Level Modeling of Extra Combinational Delays in SRAM FPGAs Due\n  to Transient Ionizing Radiation", "comments": "2014 IEEE Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects Conference (NSREC),\n  July 14-18, Paris, France", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TNS.2014.2369424", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.space-ph cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a novel circuit level model that explains and confirms\nthe extra combinational delays in a SRAM-FPGA (Virtex-5) due to radiation,\nwhich matches the experimental results by proton irradiation at TRIUMF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 01:53:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Darvishi", "Mostafa", ""], ["Audet", "Yves", ""], ["Blaqui\u00e8re", "Yves", ""], ["Thibeault", "Claude", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04221", "submitter": "Renato J Cintra", "authors": "A.

The\narchitecture directly realizes an error-free 2-D DCT without using FRSs between\nrow-column transforms, leading to an 8$\\times$8 2-D DCT which is entirely free\nof quantization errors in AI basis. As a result, the user-selectable accuracy\nfor each of the coefficients in the FRS facilitates each of the 64 coefficients\nto have its precision set independently of others, avoiding the leakage of\nquantization noise between channels as is the case for published DCT designs.\nThe proposed FRS uses two approaches based on (i) optimized Dempster-Macleod\nmultipliers and (ii) expansion factor scaling. This architecture enables\nlow-noise high-dynamic range applications in digital video processing that\nrequires full control of the finite-precision computation of the 2-D DCT. The\nproposed architectures and FRS techniques are experimentally verified and\nvalidated using hardware implementations that are physically realized and\nverified on FPGA chip. Six designs, for 4- and 8-bit input word sizes, using\nthe two proposed FRS schemes, have been designed, simulated, physically\nimplemented and measured. The maximum clock rate and block-rate achieved among\n8-bit input designs are 307.787 MHz and 38.47 MHz, respectively, implying a\npixel rate of 8$\\times$307.787$\\approx$2.462 GHz if eventually embedded in a\nreal-time video-processing system.
