For this\nstudy, we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis. We study a\nlogical mapping of qubits and gates of any $\\Omega(\\log n)$-depth quantum adder\ncircuit for two $n$-qubit registers onto a practical architecture, which limits\ninteraction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one- and\ntwo-qubit logical gates. Unfortunately, on the chosen $k$-dimensional practical\narchitecture, we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantum addition\ncircuits is no longer $\\Omega(\\log {n})$, but $\\Omega(\\sqrt[k]{n})$. This\nresult, the first application of graph embedding to quantum circuits and\ndevices, provides a new tool for compiler development, emphasizes the impact of\nquantum computer architecture on performance, and acts as a cautionary note\nwhen evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Sep 2008 03:59:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2009 06:32:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 May 2010 22:15:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 23 Dec 2010 14:43:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 24 Dec 2010 02:55:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Byung-Soo", ""], ["Van Meter", "Rodney", ""]]}]
