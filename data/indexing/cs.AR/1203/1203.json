Besides\noff-chip communications between processors, recent multi-tile (i.e. multi-core)\narchitectures face the challenge for an efficient on-chip interconnection\nnetwork between processor's tiles. In this paper, we present a configurable and\nscalable architecture, based on our Distributed Network Processor (DNP) IP\nLibrary, targeting systems ranging from single MPSoCs to massive HPC platforms.\nThe DNP provides inter-tile services for both on-chip and off-chip\ncommunications with a uniform RDMA style API, over a multi-dimensional direct\nnetwork with a (possibly) hybrid topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 16:46:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Biagioni", "Andrea", ""], ["Cicero", "Francesca Lo", ""], ["Lonardo", "Alessandro", ""], ["Paolucci", "Pier Stanislao", ""], ["Perra", "Mersia", ""], ["Rossetti", "Davide", ""], ["Sidore", "Carlo", ""], ["Simula", "Francesco", ""], ["Tosoratto", "Laura", ""], ["Vicini", "Piero", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.4150", "submitter": "Ahmed H M Soliman M.Sc.", "authors": "Ahmed H.

Although,\nFPGA devices are synchronous in nature, it has been shown that they can be used\nto prototype a Global Asynchronous Local Synchronous (GALS) systems, comprising\nan Asynchronous NoC connecting IP cores operating in different clock domains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2012 16:18:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Soliman", "Ahmed H.
