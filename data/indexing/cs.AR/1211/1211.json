This property of RNS is very\nhelpful to reduce the complexity of calculation in many applications. A residue\nnumber system represents a large integer using a set of smaller integers,\ncalled residues. But the area overhead, cost and speed not only depend on this\nword length, but also the selection of moduli, which is a very crucial step for\nresidue system. This parameter determines bit efficiency, area, frequency etc.\nIn this paper a new moduli set selection technique is proposed to improve bit\nefficiency which can be used to construct a residue system for digital signal\nprocessing environment. Subsequently, it is theoretically proved and\nillustrated using examples, that the proposed solution gives better results\nthan the schemes reported in the literature. The novelty of the architecture is\nshown by comparison the different schemes reported in the literature. Using the\nnovel moduli set, a guideline for a Reconfigurable Processor is presented here\nthat can process some predefined functions. As RNS minimizes the carry\npropagation, the scheme can be implemented in Real Time Signal Processing &\nother fields where high speed computations are required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2012 10:46:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Dutta", "Chaitali Biswas", ""], ["Garai", "Partha", ""], ["Sinha", "Amitabha", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.6192", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Eva Beckschulze (Embedded Software Laboratory RWTH Aachen University,\n  Germany), Sebastian Biallas (Embedded Software Laboratory RWTH Aachen\n  University, Germany), Stefan Kowalewski (Embedded Software Laboratory RWTH\n  Aachen University, Germany)", "title": "Static Analysis of Lockless Microcontroller C Programs", "comments": "In Proceedings SSV 2012, arXiv:1211.5873", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 102, 2012, pp. 103-114", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.102.10", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Concurrently accessing shared data without locking is usually a subject to\nrace conditions resulting in inconsistent or corrupted data.
