This project presents a conception of mobile robots using\nrapid prototyping, distributing the several control actions in growing levels\nof complexity and computing proposal oriented to embed systems implementation.\nThis kind of controller can be tested on different platform representing the\nmobile robots using reprogrammable logic components (FPGA). This mobile robot\nwill detect obstacle and also be able to control the speed. Different modules\nwill be Actuators, Sensors, wireless transmission. All this modules will be\ninterfaced using FPGA controller. I would like to construct a mechanically\nsimple robot model, which can measure the distance from obstacle with the aid\nof sensor and accordingly should able to control the speed of motor.
