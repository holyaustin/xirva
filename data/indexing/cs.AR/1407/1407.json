However, existing multiplication techniques introduce errors\nin the output with consumption of more time, hence error free high speed\nmultipliers has to be designed. In this paper we propose FPGA based Recursive\nError Free Mitchell Log Multiplier (REFMLM) for image Filters. The 2x2 error\nfree Mitchell log multiplier is designed with zero error by introducing error\ncorrection term is used in higher order Karastuba-Ofman Multiplier (KOM)\nArchitectures. The higher order KOM multipliers is decomposed into number of\nlower order multipliers using radix 2 till basic multiplier block of order 2x2\nwhich is designed by error free Mitchell log multiplier. The 8x8 REFMLM is\ntested for Gaussian filter to remove noise in fingerprint image. The Multiplier\nis synthesized using Spartan 3 FPGA family device XC3S1500-5fg320.

In particular, two important technological\nevolutions are happening at the ends of the computing spectrum: at the \"small\"\nscale, processors now include an increasing number of independent execution\nunits (cores), at the point that a mere CPU can be considered a parallel\nshared-memory computer; at the \"large\" scale, the Cloud Computing paradigm\nallows applications to scale by offering resources from a large pool on a\npay-as-you-go model. Multi-core processors and Clouds both require applications\nto be suitably modified to take advantage of the features they provide. In this\npaper, we analyze the state of the art of parallel and distributed simulation\ntechniques, and assess their applicability to multi-core architectures or\nClouds. It turns out that most of the current approaches exhibit limitations in\nterms of usability and adaptivity which may hinder their application to these\nnew computing architectures. We propose an adaptive simulation mechanism, based\non the multi-agent system paradigm, to partially address some of those\nlimitations. While it is unlikely that a single approach will work well on both\nsettings above, we argue that the proposed adaptive mechanism has useful\nfeatures which make it attractive both in a multi-core processor and in a Cloud\nsystem. These features include the ability to reduce communication costs by\nmigrating simulation components, and the support for adding (or removing) nodes\nto the execution architecture at runtime. We will also show that, with the help\nof an additional support layer, parallel and distributed simulations can be\nexecuted on top of unreliable resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Jul 2014 07:05:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 14:12:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angelo", "Gabriele", ""], ["Marzolla", "Moreno", ""]]}]
