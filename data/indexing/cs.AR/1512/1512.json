Field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) are a good platform for making improvements\nbecause of their specialised internal structure. However, current FPGA edge\ndetectors do not exploit this structure well. A new edge detection architecture\nis proposed that is better optimised for FPGAs. The basis of the architecture\nis the Sobel edge kernels that are shown to be the most suitable because of\ntheir separability and absence of multiplications. Edge intensities are\ncalculated with a new 4:2 compressor that consists of two custom-designed 3:2\ncompressors. Addition speed is increased by breaking carry propagation chains\nwith look-ahead logic. Testing of the design showed it gives a 28% increase in\nspeed and 4.4% reduction in area over previous equivalent designs, which\ndemonstrated that it will lower the cost of edge detection systems, dissipate\nless power and still maintain high-speed control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 22:32:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schiel", "Jamie", ""], ["Bainbridge-Smith", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01581", "submitter": "Swaroop Ghosh", "authors": "Anirudh Iyengar and Swaroop Ghosh", "title": "Threshold Voltage-Defined Switches for Programmable Gates", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Semiconductor supply chain is increasingly getting exposed to variety of\nsecurity attacks such as Trojan insertion, cloning, counterfeiting, reverse\nengineering (RE), piracy of Intellectual Property (IP) or Integrated Circuit\n(IC) and side-channel analysis due to involvement of untrusted parties.

In this paper, a partitioned SCL algorithm is proposed to reduce the\nlarge memory requirements of the conventional SCL algorithm.
