Traditionally lock-based synchronization is\nprovided to support concurrency; as managing locks can be very difficult and\nerror prone. Transactional memories and lock based systems have been\nextensively used to provide synchronization between multiple processors [1] in\ngeneral-purpose systems. It has been shown that locks have numerous\nshortcomings over transactional memory in terms of power consumption, ease of\nprogramming and performance. In this paper, we propose a new semaphore scheme\nfor synchronization in shared cache memory in an MPSoC. Moreover, we have\nevaluated and compared our scheme with locks and transactions in terms of\nenergy consumption and cache miss rate using SimpleScalar functional simulator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 06:47:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mittal", "Shaily", ""], ["Nitin", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1782", "submitter": "Weisheng Zhao", "authors": "Weisheng Zhao, Sumanta Chaudhuri, Celso Accoto, Jacques-Olivier Klein,\n  Claude Chappert and Pascale Mazoyer", "title": "Cross-point architecture for spin transfer torque magnetic random access\n  memory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TNANO.2012.2206051", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.AR physics.class-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is considered\nas one of the most promising candidates to build up a true universal memory\nthanks to its fast write/read speed, infinite endurance and non-volatility.\nHowever the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory\ncell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large\nenough to ensure the write current higher than the critical current for the STT\noperation. This paper describes a design of cross-point architecture for\nSTT-MRAM. The mean area per word corresponds to only two transistors, which are\nshared by a number of bits (e.g. 64). This leads to significant improvement of\ndata density (e.g. 1.75 F2/bit). Special techniques are also presented to\naddress the sneak currents and low speed issues of conventional cross-point\narchitecture, which are difficult to surmount and few efficient design\nsolutions have been reported in the literature. By using a STT-MRAM SPICE model\nincluding precise experimental parameters and STMicroelectronics 65 nm\ntechnology, some chip characteristic results such as cell area, data access\nspeed and power have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected\nperformances of this new memory architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 17:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Weisheng", ""], ["Chaudhuri", "Sumanta", ""], ["Accoto", "Celso", ""], ["Klein", "Jacques-Olivier", ""], ["Chappert", "Claude", ""], ["Mazoyer", "Pascale", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1925", "submitter": "Matthias F\\\"ugger", "authors": "Danny Dolev, Matthias F\\\"ugger, Christoph Lenzen, Markus Posch, Ulrich\n  Schmid, Andreas Steininger", "title": "FATAL+: A Self-Stabilizing Byzantine Fault-tolerant Clocking Scheme for\n  SoCs", "comments": "arXiv admin note: significant text overlap with arXiv:1105.4780", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present concept and implementation of a self-stabilizing Byzantine\nfault-tolerant distributed clock generation scheme for multi-synchronous GALS\narchitectures in critical applications.

We provide thorough correctness\nproofs and a performance analysis, which use methods from fault-tolerant\ndistributed computing research but also addresses hardware-related issues like\nmetastability. The algorithm, which consists of several concurrent\ncommunicating asynchronous state machines, has been implemented in VHDL using\nPetrify in conjunction with some extensions, and synthetisized for an Altera\nCyclone FPGA. An experimental validation of this prototype has been carried out\nto confirm the skew and clock frequency bounds predicted by the theoretical\nanalysis, as well as the very short stabilization times (required for\nrecovering after excessively many transient failures) achievable in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 09:30:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dolev", "Danny", ""], ["F\u00fcgger", "Matthias", ""], ["Lenzen", "Christoph", ""], ["Posch", "Markus", ""], ["Schmid", "Ulrich", ""], ["Steininger", "Andreas", ""]]}]
