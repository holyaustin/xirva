The cochlea senses and separates sound\nin a nonlinear active fashion, exhibiting remarkable sensitivity and frequency\ndiscrimination. Although several electronic models of the cochlea have been\nproposed and implemented, none of these are able to reproduce all the\ncharacteristics of the cochlea, including large dynamic range, large gain and\nsharp tuning at low sound levels, and low gain and broad tuning at intense\nsound levels. Here, we implement the Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators (CAR)\nmodel of the cochlea on an FPGA. CAR represents the basilar membrane filter in\nthe Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression (CAR-FAC)\ncochlear model. CAR-FAC is a neuromorphic model of hearing based on a pole-zero\nfilter cascade model of auditory filtering. It uses simple nonlinear extensions\nof conventional digital filter stages that are well suited to FPGA\nimplementations, so that we are able to implement up to 1224 cochlear sections\non Virtex-6 FPGA to process sound data in real time. The FPGA implementation of\nthe electronic cochlea described here may be used as a front-end sound analyser\nfor various machine-hearing applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 12:55:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Thakur", "Chetan Singh", ""], ["Hamilton", "Tara Julia", ""], ["Tapson", "Jonathan", ""], ["Lyon", "Richard F.", ""], ["van Schaik", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.01416", "submitter": "Bulent Abali", "authors": "Bulent Abali, Richard J.

Modularity, higher\npackaging and cooling efficiencies, and higher resource utilization are among\nthe suggested benefits. With the emergence of very large datacenters, \"clouds\"\ncontaining tens of thousands of servers, datacenter efficiency has become an\nimportant topic. Few computer chip and systems vendors are working on and\nmaking frequent announcements on silicon photonics and disaggregated memory\nsystems.\n  In this paper we study the trade-off between cost and performance of building\na disaggregated memory system where DRAM modules in the datacenter are pooled,\nfor example in memory-only chassis and racks. The compute pool and the memory\npool are interconnected by an optical interconnect to overcome the distance and\nbandwidth issues of electrical fabrics. We construct a simple cost model that\nincludes the cost of latency, cost of bandwidth and the savings expected from a\ndisaggregated memory system. We then identify the level at which a\ndisaggregated memory system becomes cost competitive with a traditional direct\nattached memory system.\n  Our analysis shows that a rack-scale disaggregated memory system will have a\nnon-trivial performance penalty, and at the datacenter scale the penalty is\nimpractically high, and the optical interconnect costs are at least a factor of\n10 more expensive than where they should be when compared to the traditional\ndirect attached memory systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 18:38:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Abali", "Bulent", ""], ["Eickemeyer", "Richard J.", ""], ["Franke", "Hubertus", ""], ["Li", "Chung-Sheng", ""], ["Taubenblatt", "Marc A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02304", "submitter": "Kirat Pal Er", "authors": "Kirat Pal Singh, Dilip Kumar", "title": "Efficient Hardware Design and Implementation of Encrypted MIPS Processor", "comments": "1st International Conference on Innovations and Advancements in\n  Information and Communication Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper describes the design and hardware implementation of 32-bit\nencrypted MIPS processor based on MIPS pipeline architecture.
