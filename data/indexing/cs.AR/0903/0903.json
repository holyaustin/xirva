QCLA\nwas originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting\nlong-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain\ncommunication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a\nquantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have\nlinear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit\ntime to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition\ncircuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures : compared to the $\\Theta(n)$\nlimit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach\n$\\Theta(log n)$ depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a\nripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a\ncluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources\ncan be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form,\n$\\approx$ 88 % of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization\nof horizontal communication costs results in a $\\approx$ 12% reduction in\nspatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph\nstate quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only $\\approx$ 9 % of the\nspatial resources of the MBQCLA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 12:32:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 04:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Trisetyarso", "Agung", ""], ["Van Meter", "Rodney", ""]]}]
