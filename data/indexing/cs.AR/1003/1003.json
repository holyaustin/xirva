Meaningful efficiency metrics are key for design space exploration\nto quantify the algorithmic and the implementation complexity of a receiver.\nMost of the current established efficiency metrics are based on counting\noperations, thus neglecting important issues like data and storage complexity.\nIn this paper we introduce suitable energy and area efficiency metrics which\nresolve the afore-mentioned disadvantages. These are decoded information bit\nper energy and throughput per area unit. Efficiency metrics are assessed by\nvarious implementations of turbo decoders, LDPC decoders and convolutional\ndecoders. New exploration methodologies are presented, which permit an\nappropriate benchmarking of implementation efficiency, communications\nperformance, and flexibility trade-offs. These exploration methodologies are\nbased on efficiency trajectories rather than a single snapshot metric as done\nin state-of-the-art approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 13:41:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kienle", "Frank", ""], ["Wehn", "Norbert", ""], ["Meyr", "Heinrich", ""]]}]
