Being a non-trivial candidate for timing analysis,\nSDRAM has been chosen as a showcase, but the approach is valid for any shared\nresource arbitration.\n  Due to its significant cost, data rate and physical size advantages, SDRAM is\na potential candidate for cost sensitive, safety critical and space conserving\nsystems. The variable access latency is a major drawback of SDRAM that induces\nlargely over estimated Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) bounds of applications.\nIn this report we present the DPQ together with an algorithm to predict the\nshared SDRAM's worst case latencies. We use the approach to calculate WCET\nbounds of six hardware tasks executing on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA with\nshared DDR2 memory. The results show that the DPQ is a fair arbitration scheme\nand produces low WCET bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 08:20:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shah", "Hardik", ""], ["Raabe", "Andreas", ""], ["Knoll", "Alois", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1683", "submitter": "Nungleppam Monoranjan Singh", "authors": "Nungleppam Monoranjan Singh, Kanak Chandra Sarma, Nungleppam Gopil\n  Singh", "title": "Design and Development of Low Cost Multi-Channel USB Data", "comments": "5 pages,8 figures, published in International Journal of Computer\n  Applications (IJCA)", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Applications 48(18):47-51, June\n  2012", "doi": "10.5120/7452-0633", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes the design and development of low cost USB Data\nAcquisition System (DAS) for the measurement of physical parameters.

Performance comparison with\nvarious Hybrid Adder is been presented. In this paper, we propose two new\ndesigns based on GDI & PTL techniques, which is found to be much more power\nefficient in comparison with existing design technique. Only 10 transistors are\nused to implement the SUM & CARRY function for both the designs. The SUM and\nCARRY cell are implemented in a cascaded way i.e. firstly the XOR cell is\nimplemented and then using XOR as input SUM as well as CARRY cell is\nimplemented. For Proposed GDI adder the SUM as well as CARRY cell is designed\nusing GDI technique. On the other hand in Proposed PTL-GDI adder the SUM cell\nis constructed using PTL technique and the CARRY cell is designed using GDI\ntechnique. The advantages of both the designs are discussed. The significance\nof these designs is substantiated by the simulation results obtained from\nCadence Virtuoso 180nm environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 03:57:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sarma", "Rajkumar", ""], ["Raju", "Veerati", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5138", "submitter": "Raja Jitendra Nayaka Mr.", "authors": "Raja Jitendra Nayaka, R.
