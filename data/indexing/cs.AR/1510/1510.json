The cyclic redundancy check\n(CRC) aided successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding algorithm has better\nerror performance than the SC algorithm. However, current CRC aided SCL\n(CA-SCL) decoders still suffer from long decoding latency and limited\nthroughput. In this paper, a reduced latency list decoding (RLLD) algorithm for\npolar codes is proposed. Our RLLD algorithm performs the list decoding on a\nbinary tree, whose leaves correspond to the bits of a polar code. In existing\nSCL decoding algorithms, all the nodes in the tree are traversed and all\npossibilities of the information bits are considered. Instead, our RLLD\nalgorithm visits much fewer nodes in the tree and considers fewer possibilities\nof the information bits. When configured properly, our RLLD algorithm\nsignificantly reduces the decoding latency and hence improves throughput, while\nintroducing little performance degradation. Based on our RLLD algorithm, we\nalso propose a high throughput list decoder architecture, which is suitable for\nlarger block lengths due to its scalable partial sum computation unit. Our\ndecoder architecture has been implemented for different block lengths and list\nsizes using the TSMC 90nm CMOS technology. The implementation results\ndemonstrate that our decoders achieve significant latency reduction and area\nefficiency improvement compared with other list polar decoders in the\nliterature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 06:11:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Jun", ""], ["Xiong", "Chenrong", ""], ["Yan", "Zhiyuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.04241", "submitter": "Naveen Kadayinti", "authors": "Naveen Kadayinti and Maryam Shojaei Baghini and Dinesh K.

The circuit uses a delay locked loop (DLL) to generate\nmultiple phases of the clock, of which the one closest to the center of the eye\nis picked by a phase detector loop. The picked phase is then further fine tuned\nby an analog voltage controlled delay to position the sampling clock at the\ncenter of the eye. A clock domain transfer circuit then transfers the sampled\ndata to the receiver clock domain with a maximum latency of three clock cycles.\nThe proposed synchronizer has been designed and fabricated in 130 nm UMC MM\nCMOS technology. The circuit consumes 1.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply at a data rate\nof 1.3 Gbps. Further, the proposed synchronizer has been designed and simulated\nin TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology.

The NoC is based\non a technique that allows the interleaving of flits from diferente flows in\nthe same communication channel, and keep the load balancing without a\ncentralized control in the network. For this purpose, all flits in the network\nreceived extra bits, such that every flit carries routing information.
