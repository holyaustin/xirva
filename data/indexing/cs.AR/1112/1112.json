This paper presents a novel quantum cost efficient\nreversible BCD adder for nanotechnology based systems using PFAG gate. It has\nbeen demonstrated that the proposed design offers less hardware complexity and\nrequires minimum number of garbage outputs than the existing counterparts. The\nremarkable property of the proposed designs is that its quantum realization is\ngiven in NMR technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Dec 2011 06:48:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Islam", "Md.

Autocorrelation (ACFs) and cross-correlation functions\n(CCFs) are typically acquired with fast hardware correlators. Here we introduce\na new multiple-{\\tau} hardware correlator design for computing ACFs and CCFs in\nreal time. A scheduling algorithm minimizes the use of hardware resources by\ncalculating the different segments of the correlation function on a single\ncorrelator block. The program was written in LabVIEW, enabling computation of\ntwo multiple-{\\tau} ACFs and two CCFs on a National Instruments FPGA card (NI\n7833R) in real time with a minimal sampling time of 400 ns. Raw data are also\nstored with a time resolution of 50 ns for later analysis. The design can be\nadapted to other FPGA cards with only minor changes and extended to evaluate\nmore inputs and correlation functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 16:34:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mocs\u00e1r", "G\u00e1bor", ""], ["Kreith", "Bal\u00e1zs", ""], ["Buchholz", "Jan", ""], ["Krieger", "Jan Wolfgang", ""], ["Langowski", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["V\u00e1mosi", "Gy\u00f6rgy", ""]]}]
