While a machine with only many cores (fewer than 50)\nmight not have any issues replicating the instructions for each core, as we\napproach the era where thousands of cores can be placed on one chip, the\noverhead of instruction replication may become unacceptably large. We believe\nthat a large amount of sharing should be possible when the ma- chine is\nconfigured for all of the threads to issue from the same set of instructions.\nWe propose a technique that allows sharing an instruction cache among a number\nof independent processor cores to allow for inter-thread sharing and reuse of\ninstruction memory. While we do not have test cases to demonstrate the\npotential magnitude of performance gains that could be achieved, the potential\nfor sharing reduces the die area required for instruction storage on chip.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 00:16:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Dong-hyeon", ""], ["Bagaria", "Akhil", ""], ["Hannan", "Fabiha", ""], ["Storm", "Eric", ""], ["Spjut", "Josef", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.2950", "submitter": "Farshad Safaei", "authors": "Salman Onsori and Farshad Safaei", "title": "Performance Enhancement of Routers in Networks-on-Chip Using Dynamic\n  Virtual Channels Allocation", "comments": "14 pages, 18 figures, Computer Applications: An International Journal\n  (CAIJ), Vol.1, No.2, November 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study proposes a new router architecture to improve the performance of\ndynamic allocation of virtual channels.
