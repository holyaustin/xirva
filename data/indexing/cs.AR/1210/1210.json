Within the next decade, systems will contain large numbers\nof processors with potentially thousands of processors per chip. Despite this,\nmany computational problems exhibit little or no parallelism and many existing\nformulations are sequential. It is therefore essential that highly-parallel\narchitectures can support sequential computation by emulating large memories\nwith collections of smaller ones, thus supporting efficient execution of\nsequential programs or sequential components of parallel programs.\n  This paper demonstrates that a realistic parallel architecture with scalable\nlow-latency communications can execute large-memory sequential programs with a\nfactor of only 2 to 3 slowdown, when compared to a conventional sequential\narchitecture. This overhead seems an acceptable price to pay to be able to\nswitch between executing highly-parallel programs and sequential programs with\nlarge memory requirements. Efficient emulation of large memories could\ntherefore facilitate a transition from sequential machines by allowing existing\nprograms to be compiled directly to a highly-parallel architecture and then for\ntheir performance to be improved by exploiting parallelism in memory accesses\nand computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 15:57:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 14:51:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 15:02:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hanlon", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2907", "submitter": "Dmitry Osiov", "authors": "Yuri Bocharov, Vladimir Butuzov, Dmitry Osipov", "title": "A Low-Power 9-bit Pipelined CMOS ADC with Amplifier and Comparator\n  Sharing Technique", "comments": "Fringe Poster session, 37th European Solid-State Circuits Conference\n  (ESSCIRC-2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ins-det cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) employing\na power and area efficient architecture.
