Previous theoretical and experimental\nworks [1][2] on JNFETs have considered polysilicon gates and silicon-dioxide\ndielectric. However, with further scaling, JNFETs will suffer from deleterious\neffects of doped polysilicon such as high resistance, additional capacitance\ndue to gate-oxide interface depletion, and incompatibility with high-k\ndielectrics[3][4]. In this paper, novel metal- gated high-k JNFETs are\ninvestigated through detailed process and device simulations. These MJNFETs are\nalso ideally suited for new types of nano-architectures such as N3ASICs [5]\nwhich utilize regular nanowire arrays with limited customization. In such nano-\nsystems, the simplified device geometry in conjunction with a single-type FET\ncircuit style [6] would imply that logic arrays could be patterned out of\npre-doped SOI wafers without the need for any additional ion implantation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 16:12:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rahman", "Mostafizur", ""], ["Narayanan", "Pritish", ""], ["Moritz", "Csaba Andras", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0607", "submitter": "Mostafizur Rahman", "authors": "Mostafizur Rahman, Santosh Khasanvis, Jiajun Shi, Mingyu Li, and Csaba\n  Andras Moritz", "title": "Skybridge: 3-D Integrated Circuit Technology Alternative to CMOS", "comments": "53 Pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Continuous scaling of CMOS has been the major catalyst in miniaturization of\nintegrated circuits (ICs) and crucial for global socio-economic progress.\nHowever, scaling to sub-20nm technologies is proving to be challenging as\nMOSFETs are reaching their fundamental limits and interconnection bottleneck is\ndominating IC operational power and performance. Migrating to 3-D, as a way to\nadvance scaling, has eluded us due to inherent customization and manufacturing\nrequirements in CMOS that are incompatible with 3-D organization. Partial\nattempts with die-die and layer-layer stacking have their own limitations. We\npropose a 3-D IC fabric technology, Skybridge[TM], which offers paradigm shift\nin technology scaling as well as design. We co-architect Skybridge's core\naspects, from device to circuit style, connectivity, thermal management, and\nmanufacturing pathway in a 3-D fabric-centric manner, building on a uniform 3-D\ntemplate. Our extensive bottom-up simulations, accounting for detailed material\nsystem structures, manufacturing process, device, and circuit parasitics,\ncarried through for several designs including a designed microprocessor, reveal\na 30-60x density, 3.5x performance per watt benefits, and 10X reduction in\ninterconnect lengths vs. scaled 16-nm CMOS.
