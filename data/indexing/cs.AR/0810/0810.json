We give an interval\ninterpretation for the signed zeros and infinities, so that the undefined\noperations 0*inf, inf - inf, inf/inf, and 0/0 become defined.\n  In this way no operation remains that gives rise to an error condition.\nMathematically questionable features of the floating-point standard become\nwell-defined sets of reals. Interval semantics provides a basis for the\nverification of numerical algorithms. We derive the results of the newly\ndefined operations and consider the implications for hardware implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2008 03:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Edmonson", "W.
