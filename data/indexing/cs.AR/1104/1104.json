In this paper, we propose a new high speed\nmultiple-valued logic FA module. The proposed FA is constructed by 14\ntransistors and 3 capacitors, using carbon nano-tube field effect transistor\n(CNFET) technology. Furthermore, our proposed technique has been examined in\ndifferent voltages (i.e., 0.65v and 0.9v). The observed results reveal power\nconsumption and power delay product (PDP) improvements compared to existing FA\ncounterparts\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Apr 2011 07:14:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Khatir", "Ashkan", ""], ["Abdolahzadegan", "Shaghayegh", ""], ["Mahmoudi", "Iman", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0924", "submitter": "Alexander Yu.
