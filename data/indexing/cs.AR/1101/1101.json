Since the benefits from MIMO result\nin a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity\nsub-optimum receivers is currently an active area of research.\nLattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) has been shown to be an effective\nlow-complexity method with near-ML performance. In this paper we advocate the\nuse of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we\nexhibit one of them based on LRAD. The \"LLL lattice reduction algorithm\" and\nthe ensuing linear detections or successive spatial-interference cancellations\ncan be located in the same array, which is con- siderably hardware-efficient.\nSince the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable\nfor parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for\nthe systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction (FSR-LLL) is one of\nthe versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the\nall-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which\nprocesses all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our\nnovel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic\ncontrols. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the\nLov\\'asz condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser\nSiegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR- aided linear detections,\nthe bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation.\nComparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance,\nand average FPGA processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows\nthat ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for\nsystems with a large number of antennas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 18:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Ni-Chun", ""], ["Biglieri", "Ezio", ""], ["Yao", "Kung", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4222", "submitter": "Himanshu Thapliyal", "authors": "Himanshu Thapliyal and Nagarajan Ranganathan", "title": "Reversible Logic Based Concurrent Error Detection Methodology For\n  Emerging Nanocircuits", "comments": "H.

In this work, we propose a\nmethodology for the concurrent error detection in reversible logic circuits to\ndetect faults that can result in multi-bit error at the outputs. The\nmethodology is based on the inverse property of reversible logic and is termed\nas 'inverse and compare' method. By using the inverse property of reversible\nlogic, all the inputs can be regenerated at the outputs. Thus, by comparing the\noriginal inputs with the regenerated inputs, the faults in reversible circuits\ncan be detected. Minimizing the garbage outputs is one of the main goals in\nreversible logic design and synthesis. We show that the proposed methodology\nresults in 'garbageless' reversible circuits. A design of reversible full adder\nthat can be concurrently tested for multi-bit error at the outputs is\nillustrated as the application of the proposed scheme. Finally, we showed the\napplication of the proposed scheme of concurrent error detection towards fault\ndetection in quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) emerging nanotechnology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 20:06:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Thapliyal", "Himanshu", ""], ["Ranganathan", "Nagarajan", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5364", "submitter": "Farhat  Masood", "authors": "Farhat Masood", "title": "RISC and CISC", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computing Research Repository - CORR, vol. abs/1101.5, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Comparison of RISC & CISC in details, encompassing the addressing modes,\nevolution, definitions and characteristics.
