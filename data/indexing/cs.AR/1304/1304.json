To cope\nwith this problem, accurate delay models of coupled interconnects are needed.\nIn particular, delay models based on analytical approaches are desirable,\nbecause they not only are largely transparent to technology, but also\nexplicitly establish the connections between delays of coupled interconnects\nand transition patterns, thereby enabling crosstalk alleviating techniques such\nas crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs). Unfortunately, existing analytical delay\nmodels, such as the widely cited model in [1], have limited accuracy and do not\naccount for loading capacitance. In this paper, we propose analytical delay\nmodels for coupled interconnects that address these disadvantages. By\naccounting for more wires and eschewing the Elmore delay, our delay models\nachieve better accuracy than the model in [1].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 03:52:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Feng", ""], ["Wu", "Xuebin", ""], ["Yan", "Zhiyuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.2110", "submitter": "M.M.A. Hashem", "authors": "Md.
