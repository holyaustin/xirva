A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation\nof the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to\nthe antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain. Assuming such a model leads to a large\nform-factor for the analog and RF circuits and increased complexity in the\ndigital domain.\n  In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the\nself-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modelled\nas $H(f)=C_0 + C_1f$ in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective\nself-interference channel can be represented by two parameters $C_0$ and $C_1$,\nirrespective of the multipath environment. We also provide experimental\nevidence to verify the above channel model and propose novel low-complexity\ndesigns for self-interference cancellation. Linearization not only aids in the\npracticality of analog cancellation by reducing the form factor, but also\nresults in a simpler SI filter model in the digital domain due to\ndimensionality reduction of the channel parameters. Therefore this method can\nenable the widespread adoption of full-duplex techniques to portable devices in\naddition to infrastructure base-stations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 17:04:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Nadh", "Arjun", ""], ["Samuel", "Joseph", ""], ["Sharma", "Ankit", ""], ["Aniruddhan", "S.", ""], ["Ganti", "Radha Krishna", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.03229", "submitter": "Daniel Llamocca", "authors": "Nia Simmonds, Joshua Mack, Sam Bellestri, Daniel Llamocca", "title": "CORDIC-based Architecture for Powering Computation in Fixed-Point\n  Arithmetic", "comments": "6 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a fixed point architecture (source VHDL code is provided) for\npowering computation.

The TMR scheme involves\ntwo-times duplication of the simplex system hardware, with a majority voter\nensuring correctness provided at least two out of three copies of the system\nremain operational. Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring\nthe correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the\nTMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not\nhold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions\nof the order of just tens of nanometers. To overcome the drawbacks of the\nclassical majority voter some new voter designs were put forward in the\nliterature with the aim of enhancing the fault tolerance. However, these voter\ndesigns generally ensure the correct system operation in the presence of either\na faulty function module or the faulty voter, considered only in isolation.\nSince multiple faults may no longer be excluded in the nanoelectronics regime,\nsimultaneous fault occurrences on both the function module and the voter should\nbe considered, and the fault tolerance of the voters have to be analyzed under\nsuch a scenario. In this context, this article proposes a new fault-tolerant\nmajority voter which is found to be more robust to faults than the existing\nvoters in the presence of faults occurring internally and/or externally to the\nvoter. Moreover, the proposed voter features less power dissipation, delay, and\narea metrics based on the simulation results obtained by using a 32/28nm CMOS\nprocess.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2016 11:54:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Nov 2017 06:51:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Balasubramanian", "P", ""], ["Prasad", "K", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.04582", "submitter": "Oren Segal", "authors": "Oren Segal, Nasibeh Nasiri, Martin Margala", "title": "A Foray into Efficient Mapping of Algorithms to Hardware Platforms on\n  Heterogeneous Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Heterogeneous computing can potentially offer significant performance and\nperformance per watt improvements over homogeneous computing, but the question\n\"what is the ideal mapping of algorithms to architectures?\" remains an open\none.

We observe that such\nmulti-granularity management results in significant inefficiency in the memory\nsubsystem. Specifically, we observe that 1) page-granularity virtual memory\nunnecessarily triggers large memory operations, and 2) existing cache-line\ngranularity memory interface is inefficient for performing bulk data operations\nand operations that exhibit poor spatial locality. To address these problems,\nwe present a series of techniques in this thesis.\n  First, we propose page overlays, a framework augments the existing virtual\nmemory framework with the ability to track a new version of a subset of cache\nlines within each virtual page. We show that this extension is powerful by\ndemonstrating its benefits on a number of applications.\n  Second, we show that DRAM can be used to perform more complex operations than\njust store data. We propose RowClone, a mechanism to perform bulk data copy and\ninitialization completely inside DRAM, and Buddy RAM, a mechanism to perform\nbulk bitwise operations using DRAM. Both these techniques achieve an\norder-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the respective operations.\n  Third, we propose Gather-Scatter DRAM, a technique that exploits DRAM\norganization to effectively gather/scatter values with a power-of-2 strided\naccess patterns. For these access patterns, GS-DRAM achieves near-ideal\nbandwidth and cache utilization, without increasing the latency of fetching\ndata from memory.\n  Finally, we propose the Dirty-Block Index, a new way of tracking dirty\nblocks. In addition to improving the efficiency of bulk data coherence, DBI has\nseveral applications including high-performance memory scheduling, efficient\ncache lookup bypassing, and enabling heterogeneous ECC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 May 2016 19:38:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Seshadri", "Vivek", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.08149", "submitter": "Hayden Kwok-Hay So", "authors": "Hayden Kwok-Hay So and John Wawrzynek", "title": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Overlay Architectures\n  for FPGAs (OLAF 2016)", "comments": "2nd International Workshop on Overlay Architectures for FPGAs (OLAF\n  2016) website: see http://olaf.eecs.berkeley.edu", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The 2nd International Workshop on Overlay Architectures for FPGAs (OLAF 2016)\nwas held on 21 Mar, 2016 as a co-located workshop at the 24th ACM/SIGDA\nInternational Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA 2016).
