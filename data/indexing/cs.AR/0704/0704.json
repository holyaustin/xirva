In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each\nnode sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian\nvector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper\ncoding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector\nbroadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental\nresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill\nthis gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in\nthe link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh\nnetworks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging\nnon-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original\nproblem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the\ntransformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates\nLagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method\nbased on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient\nmethod. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network\nperformance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Apr 2007 03:18:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Jia", ""], ["Hou", "Y.

In recent years, the\nNetworks-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm emerged as a promising solution to interconnect\nchallenges in silicon-based electronics. Current NoC architectures are either\nhighly regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausible\nassumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics that\nare generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection.\nHere, we pragmatically and experimentally investigate important design\ntrade-offs and properties of an irregular, abstract, yet physically plausible\n3D small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip\nparadigms. We vary the framework's key parameters, such as the connectivity,\nthe number of switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-range\nconnections, and measure the network's relevant communication characteristics.\nWe further explore the robustness against link failures and the ability and\nefficiency to solve a simple toy problem, the synchronization task. The results\nconfirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and\ndisruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2)\nthat 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distribution\nof shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages over\nlocal 2D and 3D regular topologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Apr 2007 21:26:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Teuscher", "Christof", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3573", "submitter": "Andrea Maiorano", "authors": "F.
