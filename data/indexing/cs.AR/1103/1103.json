We discuss the\nsuitability of asynchronous reconfigurable architectures for such applications\nbefore proceeding to model the side channel and defining our objectives. The\nlogic block architecture is presented in detail. We discuss several solutions\nfor the interconnect architecture, and how these solutions can be ported to\nother flavours of interconnect (i.e. single driver). Next We discuss in detail\na high speed asynchronous configuration chain architecture used to configure\nour asynchronous FPGA with simulation results, and we present a 3 X 3 prototype\nFPGA fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. Lastly we present experiments to test the high\nspeed asynchronous configuration chain and evaluate how far our objectives have\nbeen achieved with proposed solutions, and we conclude with emphasis on\ncomplementary FPGA CAD algorithms, and the effect of CMOS variation on\nSide-Channel Vulnerability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Mar 2011 20:04:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 12:13:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhuri", "Sumanta", ""], ["Guilley", "Sylvain", ""], ["Hoogvorst", "Philippe", ""], ["Danger", "Jean-Luc", ""], ["Beyrouthy", "Taha", ""], ["Razafindraibe", "Alin", ""], ["Fesquet", "Laurent", ""], ["Renaudin", "Marc", ""]]}]
