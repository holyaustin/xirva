These codes achieve the capacity of many important channels\nunder successive cancellation decoding. Motivated by the rapid progress in the\ntheory of polar codes, we propose a family of architectures for efficient\nhardware implementation of successive cancellation decoders. We show that such\ndecoders can be implemented with O(n) processing elements and O(n) memory\nelements, while providing constant throughput. We also propose a technique for\noverlapping the decoding of several consecutive codewords, thereby achieving a\nsignificant speed-up factor. We furthermore show that successive cancellation\ndecoding can be implemented in the logarithmic domain, thereby eliminating the\nmultiplication and division operations and greatly reducing the complexity of\neach processing element.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Nov 2010 14:38:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Leroux", "Camille", ""], ["Tal", "Ido", ""], ["Vardy", "Alexander", ""], ["Gross", "Warren J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3382", "submitter": "Md Tanvir Amin", "authors": "Md.

Since then, sustaining development and advancement in\nelectronics and fabrication techniques has caused the devices to shrink in size\nand become smaller, paving the quest for increasing density and clock speed.\nThat quest has suddenly come to a halt due to fundamental bounds applied by\nphysical laws. But, demand for more and more computational power is still\nprevalent in the computing world. As a result, the microprocessor industry has\nstarted exploring the technology along a different dimension. Speed of a single\nwork unit (CPU) is no longer the concern, rather increasing the number of\nindependent processor cores packed in a single package has become the new\nconcern. Such processors are commonly known as multi-core processors. Scaling\nthe performance by using multiple cores has gained so much attention from the\nacademia and the industry, that not only desktops, but also laptops, PDAs, cell\nphones and even embedded devices today contain these processors. In this paper,\nwe explore state of the art technologies for multi-core processors and existing\nsoftware tools to support parallelism. We also discuss present and future trend\nof research in this field. From our survey, we conclude that next few decades\nare going to be marked by the success of this \"Ubiquitous parallel processing\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Nov 2010 13:48:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Amin", "Md.
