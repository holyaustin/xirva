We develop several SystemC/C++\nmodeling techniques that allow us to quickly model, simulate, and evaluate\npipelines. We employ a small domain specific language (DSL) based on resource\nusage patterns that automates the drudgery of boilerplate code needed to\nconfigure connectivity in simulation models. The DSL is embedded directly in\nthe host modeling language SystemC/C++. Additionally we develop several\ntechniques for parameterizing a pipeline's behavior based on policies of\nfunction, communication, and timing (performance modeling).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 15:44:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Harcourt", "Ed", ""]]}]
