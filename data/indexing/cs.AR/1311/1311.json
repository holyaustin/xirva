Recently researchers have used non-volatile memory devices to\ndesign caches, since they provide high density, comparable read latency and low\nleakage power dissipation. However, their high write latency may increase the\nexecution time and hence, leakage energy consumption. Also, since their write\nendurance is small, a conventional energy saving technique may further\naggravate the problem of write-variations, thus reducing their lifetime. In\nthis paper, we present a cache energy saving technique for non-volatile caches,\nwhich also attempts to improve their lifetime by making writes equally\ndistributed to the cache. Our technique uses dynamic cache reconfiguration to\nadjust the cache size to meet program requirement and turns off the remaining\ncache to save energy. Microarchitectural simulations performed using an x86-64\nsimulator, SPEC2006 benchmarks and a resistive-RAM LLC (last level cache) show\nthat over an 8MB baseline cache, our technique saves 17.55% memory subsystem\n(last level cache + main memory) energy and improves the lifetime by 1.33X.\nOver the same resistive-RAM baseline, an SRAM of similar area with no cache\nreconfiguration leads to an energy loss of 186.13%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 21:41:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 10:35:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mittal", "Sparsh", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0170", "submitter": "Sparsh Mittal", "authors": "Sparsh Mittal", "title": "A Technique for Efficiently Managing SRAM-NVM Hybrid Cache", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a SRAM-PCM hybrid cache design, along with a cache\nreplacement policy, named dead fast block (DFB) to manage the hybrid cache.\nThis design aims to leverage the best features of both SRAM and PCM devices.\nCompared to a PCM-only cache, the hybrid cache with DFB policy provides\nsuperior results on all relevant evaluation metrics, viz. cache lifetime,\nperformance and energy efficiency.

In this paper a new\nfault-tolerant design strategy has been presented. This strategy exploits the\nrelation between changes in inputs and the expected change in output.\nEssentially, it predicts whether or not a change in the output is expected and\nthereby calculates the error. As a result this strategy reduces hardware and\ntime redundancy required by existing strategies like Duplication with\nComparison (DWC) and Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). The design arising from\nthis strategy has been simulated and its robustness to fault-injection has been\nverified.
