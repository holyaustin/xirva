While analog linear-regulators have traditionally been used in\ndigital ICs, the need for digitally implementable designs that can be\nsynthesized and embedded in digital functional units for ultra fine- grained\npower management has emerged. This paper presents the circuit design and\ncontrol models of an all-digital, discrete-time linear regulator and explores\nthe parametric design space for transient response time and loop stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jan 2015 16:55:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nasir", "Saad Bin", ""], ["Raychowdhury", "Arijit", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.04192", "submitter": "Shahriar Shahabuddin", "authors": "Shahriar Shahabuddin, Janne Janhunen and Markku Juntti", "title": "Design of a Transport Triggered Architecture Processor for Flexible\n  Iterative Turbo Decoder", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures, conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In order to meet the requirement of high data rates for the next generation\nwireless systems, the efficient implementation of receiver algorithms is\nessential. On the other hand, the rapid development of technology motivates the\ninvestigation of programmable implementations. This paper summarizes the design\nof a programmable turbo decoder as an applicationspecific instruction-set\nprocessor (ASIP) using Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA). The processor\narchitecture is designed in such manner that it can be programmed to support\nother receiver algorithms, for example, decoding based on the Viterbi\nalgorithm. Different suboptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms are used\nand compared to one another for the softinput soft-output (SISO) component\ndecoders in a single TTA processor. The max-log-MAP algorithm outperforms the\nother suboptimal algorithms in terms of latency. The design enables the\ndesigner to change the suboptimal algorithms according to the bit error rate\n(BER) performance requirement. Unlike many other programmable turbo decoder\nimplementations, quadratic polynomial permutation (QPP) interleaver is used in\nthis work for contention-free memory access and to make the processor 3GPP LTE\ncompliant. Several optimization techniques to enable real time processing on\nprogrammable platforms are introduced. Using our method, with a single\niteration 31.32 Mbps throughput is achieved for the max-log-MAP algorithm for a\nclock frequency of 200 MHz.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Jan 2015 11:52:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shahabuddin", "Shahriar", ""], ["Janhunen", "Janne", ""], ["Juntti", "Markku", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.07420", "submitter": "Smruti Ranjan Sarangi", "authors": "Smruti R.
