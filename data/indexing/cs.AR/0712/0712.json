This\nwork presents an alternative memory ordering mechanism for this architecture,\nthe Transaction WaveCache. Our mechanism maintains the execution order of\nmemory operations within blocks of code, called Waves, but adds the ability to\nspeculatively execute, out-of-order, operations from different waves. This\nordering mechanism is inspired by progress in supporting Transactional\nMemories. Waves are considered as atomic regions and executed as nested\ntransactions. If a wave has finished the execution of all its memory\noperations, as soon as the previous waves are committed, it can be committed.\nIf a hazard is detected in a speculative Wave, all the following Waves\n(children) are aborted and re-executed. We evaluate the WaveCache on a set\nartificial benchmarks. If the benchmark does not access memory often, we could\nachieve speedups of around 90%. Speedups of 33.1% and 24% were observed on more\nmemory intensive applications, and slowdowns up to 16% arise if memory\nbandwidth is a bottleneck. For an application full of WAW, WAR and RAW hazards,\na speedup of 139.7% was verified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2007 15:59:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Marzulo", "Leandro A.
