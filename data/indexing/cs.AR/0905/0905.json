This model\nallows an accurate performance prediction and evaluation for existing\ninstruction codes. It provides an in-depth understanding of how performance for\ndifferent memory hierarchy levels is made up. The performance of raw memory\nload, store and copy operations and a stream vector triad are analyzed and\nbenchmarked on three modern x86-type quad-core architectures in order to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2009 10:55:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Treibig", "Jan", ""], ["Hager", "Georg", ""]]}]
