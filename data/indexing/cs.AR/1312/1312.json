But, due to the weak driving current, these circuits generally suffer\nfrom huge performance degradation. Therefore, in this paper, we primarily\ntargeted to analyze the performance of a Near-Threshold Circuit (NTC), which\nretains the excellent energy efficiency of the subthreshold design, while\nimproving the performance to a certain extent. A modified row-based dual Vdd\n4-operand CSA (Carry Save Adder) design has been reported in the present work\nusing 45 nm technology. Moreover, to find out the effectiveness of the\nnear-threshold operation of the 4-operand CSA design; it has been compared with\nthe other design styles. From the simulation results, obtained for the\nfrequency of 20 MHz, we found that the proposed scheme of CSA design consumes\n3.009*10-7 Watt of Average Power (Pavg), which is almost 90.9 % lesser than\nthat of the conventional CSA design. Whereas, looking at the perspective of\nmaximum delay at output, the proposed scheme of CSA design provides a fair\n44.37 % improvement, compared to that of the subthreshold CSA design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 09:48:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 06:43:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Aug 2014 14:33:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 5 Oct 2014 11:01:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Dipankar", ""], ["Chatterjee", "Aanan", ""], ["Chatterjee", "Sayan", ""], ["Sarkar", "C.

Due to\nhigh leakage consumption of SRAM device, caches designed with SRAM consume\nlarge amount of energy. To address this, use of emerging technologies such as\nspin torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM) has been investigated which have lower\nleakage power dissipation. However, the high write latency and power of it may\nlead to large energy consumption which present challenges in its use. In this\nreport, we propose a cache reconfiguration based technique for improving the\nenergy efficiency of STT-RAM based LLCs. Our technique dynamically adjusts the\nactive cache size to reduce the cache leakage energy consumption with minimum\nperformance loss. We choose a suitable value of STT-RAM retention time for\navoiding refresh overhead and gaining performance. Single-core simulations have\nbeen performed using SPEC2006 benchmarks and Sniper x86-64 simulator. The\nresults show that while, compared to an STT-RAM LLC of similar area, an SRAM\nLLC incurs nearly 100% loss in energy and 7.3% loss in performance; our\ntechnique using STT-RAM cache saves 21.8% energy and incurs only 1.7% loss in\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Dec 2013 13:03:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Aug 2014 20:03:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mittal", "Sparsh", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2306", "submitter": "Rajendra Patel", "authors": "Rajendra Patel, Arvind Rajawat", "title": "Dominant block guided optimal cache size estimation to maximize IPC of\n  embedded software", "comments": "10 Pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables, International Journal of Embedded\n  Systems and Applications (IJESA).\n  http://airccse.org/journal/ijesa/current2013.html", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5121/ijesa.2013.3303", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Embedded system software is highly constrained from performance, memory\nfootprint, energy consumption and implementing cost view point. It is always\ndesirable to obtain better Instructions per Cycle. Instruction cache has major\ncontribution in improving IPC. Cache memories are realized on the same chip\nwhere the processor is running. This considerably increases the system cost as\nwell. Hence, it is required to maintain a trade off between cache sizes and\nperformance improvement offered. Determining the number of cache lines and size\nof cache line are important parameters for cache designing. The design space\nfor cache is quite large. It is time taking to execute the given application\nwith different cache sizes on an instruction set simulator to figure out the\noptimal cache size. In this paper, a technique is proposed to identify a number\nof cache lines and cache line size for the L1 instruction cache that will offer\nbest or nearly best IPC. Cache size is derived, at a higher abstraction level,\nfrom basic block analysis in the Low Level Virtual Machine environment. The\ncache size estimated is cross validated by simulating the set of benchmark\napplications with different cache sizes in simple scalar simulator. The\nproposed method seems to be superior in terms of estimation accuracy and\nestimation time as compared to the existing methods for estimation of optimal\ncache size parameters like cache line size, number of cache lines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Dec 2013 05:17:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Patel", "Rajendra", ""], ["Rajawat", "Arvind", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2976", "submitter": "Ahmed Ben Achballah", "authors": "Ahmed Ben Achballah and Slim Ben Saoud", "title": "A Survey of Network-On-Chip Tools", "comments": "7 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and\n  Applications(IJACSA), 4(9), 2013", "doi": "10.14569/IJACSA.2013.040910", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nowadays System-On-Chips (SoCs) have evolved considerably in term of\nperformances, reliability and integration capacity.
