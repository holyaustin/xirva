There is\nonly a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small\namount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth\nprocess. The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of\nconsonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than\nit is across the families. The implications of this result are twofold -- (a)\nthere is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain\nlinguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger\npreferential connection between the languages within a family than across them.\nFurthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a\ncorrelation with the period of existence of the language families under\ninvestigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2009 08:57:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Choudhury", "Monojit", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Animesh", ""], ["Basu", "Anupam", ""], ["Ganguly", "Niloy", ""], ["Garg", "Ashish", ""], ["Jalan", "Vaibhav", ""]]}]
