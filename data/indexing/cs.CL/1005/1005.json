The\ngiven description needs to be non ambiguous and accurate enough to allow other\nusers to guess the described shape correctly.\n  To build these semantic models the descriptions need to be analyzed to\nextract the syntax and words' classes used. We have modeled the meaning of\nthese descriptions using soft constraints as a way for grounding the meaning.\n  The descriptions generated by the system took into account the context of the\nobject to avoid ambiguous descriptions, and allowed users to guess the\ndescribed object correctly 72% of the times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2010 09:41:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Guadarrama", "Sergio", ""], ["Pancho", "David P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5466", "submitter": "Solomija Buk N", "authors": "Solomiya Buk", "title": "Quantitative parametrization of texts written by Ivan Franko: An attempt\n  of the project", "comments": "20 pages, in Ukrainian", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the article, the project of quantitative parametrization of all texts by\nIvan Franko is manifested.
