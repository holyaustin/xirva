In this paper\nwe focus on the importance of creating speech database at syllable units and\nidentifying minimum text to be considered while training any speech recognition\nsystem. There are systems developed for continuous speech recognition in\nEnglish and in few Indian languages like Hindi and Tamil. This paper gives the\nstatistical details of syllables in Telugu and its use in minimizing the search\nspace during recognition of speech. The minimum words that cover maximum\nsyllables are identified. This words list can be used for preparing a small\ntext which can be used for collecting speech sample while training the\ndictation system. The results are plotted for frequency of syllables and the\nnumber of syllables in each word. This approach is applied on the CIIL Mysore\ntext corpus which is of 3 million words.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 18:51:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kalyani", "N.", ""], ["Sunitha", "Dr K.

After years of research and development the accuracy of\nautomatic speech recognition remains one of the important research challenges\n(e.g., variations of the context, speakers, and environment).The design of\nSpeech Recognition system requires careful attentions to the following issues:\nDefinition of various types of speech classes, speech representation, feature\nextraction techniques, speech classifiers, database and performance evaluation.\nThe problems that are existing in ASR and the various techniques to solve these\nproblems constructed by various research workers have been presented in a\nchronological order. Hence authors hope that this work shall be a contribution\nin the area of speech recognition.

We propose a text simplification\nprocess, bioSimplify, that seeks to reduce the complexity of sentences in\nbiomedical abstracts in order to improve the performance of syntactic parsers\non the processed sentences. Syntactic parsing is typically one of the first\nsteps in a text mining pipeline. Thus, any improvement in performance would\nhave a ripple effect over all processing steps. We evaluated our method using a\ncorpus of biomedical sentences annotated with syntactic links.
