The proposed concept can be\nused for generating topic-specific representations of text, aiming to match in\na simple way the perception of a user with a pre-established idea of what the\nusage of terms in the text should be.

We believe that anaphora\nresolution requires numerous sources of information in order to find the\ncorrect antecedent of the anaphor. These sources can be of different kinds,\ne.g., linguistic information, discourse/dialogue structure information, or\ntopic information. For this reason, our algorithm uses various different kinds\nof information (hybrid information). The algorithm is based on linguistic\nconstraints and preferences and uses an anaphoric accessibility space within\nwhich the algorithm finds the noun phrase. We present some experiments related\nto this algorithm and this space using a corpus of 204 dialogues. The algorithm\nis implemented in Prolog. According to this study, 95.9% of antecedents were\nlocated in the proposed space, a precision of 81.3% was obtained for pronominal\nanaphora resolution, and 81.5% for adjectival anaphora.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Martinez-Barco", "P.", ""], ["Palomar", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.3077", "submitter": "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil", "authors": "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee", "title": "Chameleons in imagined conversations: A new approach to understanding\n  coordination of linguistic style in dialogs", "comments": "data available at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/movies", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the ACL workshop on Cognitive Modeling and\n  Computational Linguistics, pp 76-87, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to\neach other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles\nand other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in\ntheir partner's immediately preceding utterance.

Experimental results are presented demonstrating WOLFIE's ability to\nlearn useful lexicons for a database interface in four different natural\nlanguages. The usefulness of the lexicons learned by WOLFIE are compared to\nthose acquired by a similar system, with results favorable to WOLFIE. A second\nset of experiments demonstrates WOLFIE's ability to scale to larger and more\ndifficult, albeit artificially generated, corpora. In natural language\nacquisition, it is difficult to gather the annotated data needed for supervised\nlearning; however, unannotated data is fairly plentiful. Active learning\nmethods attempt to select for annotation and training only the most informative\nexamples, and therefore are potentially very useful in natural language\napplications. However, most results to date for active learning have only\nconsidered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation effort while\nmaintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to semantic lexicons. We show\nthat active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples\nrequired to achieve a given level of performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jun 2011 20:57:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Thompson", "C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4862", "submitter": "A.

NLG systems, like most AI systems, need substantial amounts of\nknowledge. However, our experience in two NLG projects suggests that it is\ndifficult to acquire correct knowledge for NLG systems; indeed, every knowledge\nacquisition (KA) technique we tried had significant problems. In general terms,\nthese problems were due to the complexity, novelty, and poorly understood\nnature of the tasks our systems attempted, and were worsened by the fact that\npeople write so differently. This meant in particular that corpus-based KA\napproaches suffered because it was impossible to assemble a sizable corpus of\nhigh-quality consistent manually written texts in our domains; and structured\nexpert-oriented KA techniques suffered because experts disagreed and because we\ncould not get enough information about special and unusual cases to build\nrobust systems. We believe that such problems are likely to affect many other\nNLG systems as well. In the long term, we hope that new KA techniques may\nemerge to help NLG system builders. In the shorter term, we believe that\nunderstanding how individual KA techniques can fail, and using a mixture of\ndifferent KA techniques with different strengths and weaknesses, can help\ndevelopers acquire NLG knowledge that is mostly correct.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jun 2011 21:05:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Reiter", "E.", ""], ["Robertson", "R.", ""], ["Sripada", "S.
