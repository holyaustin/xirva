This is of higher importance as the text per se\nrepresents a flow of words and expressions that once it is read it is lost. In\nthis respect, the understanding of a text and moreover on how the actor exactly\nbehaves is not only a major concern: as human beings try to store a given input\non short-term memory while associating diverse aspects and actors with\nincidents, the following approach represents a virtual architecture, where\ncollocations are concerned and taken as the associative completion of the\nactors' acting. Once that collocations are discovered, they become managed in\nseparated memory blocks broken down by the actors. As for human beings, the\nmemory blocks refer to associative mind-maps. We then present several priority\nfunctions to represent the actual temporal situation inside a mind-map to\nenable the user to reconstruct the recent events from the discovered temporal\nresults.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2008 18:00:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Rothenberger", "T.", ""], ["Oez", "S.", ""], ["Tahirovic", "E.", ""], ["Schommer", "C.", ""]]}]
