Recently, we proposed a\nnew method which uses normalized Levenshtein distances among words with same\nmeaning and averages on all the items of a given list. Decisions about the\nnumber of items in the input lists for language comparison have been debated\nsince the beginning of glottochronology. The point is that words associated to\nsome of the meanings have a rapid lexical evolution. Therefore, a large\nvocabulary comparison is only apparently more accurate then a smaller one since\nmany of the words do not carry any useful information. In principle, one should\nfind the optimal length of the input lists studying the stability of the\ndifferent items. In this paper we tackle the problem with an automated\nmethodology only based on our normalized Levenshtein distance. With this\napproach, the program of an automated reconstruction of languages relationships\nis completed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2009 11:33:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2009 07:54:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Petroni", "Filippo", ""], ["Serva", "Maurizio", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0884", "submitter": "Filippo Petroni", "authors": "Filippo Petroni and Maurizio Serva", "title": "Measures of lexical distance between languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2010.02.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The idea of measuring distance between languages seems to have its roots in\nthe work of the French explorer Dumont D'Urville \\cite{Urv}. He collected\ncomparative words lists of various languages during his voyages aboard the\nAstrolabe from 1826 to 1829 and, in his work about the geographical division of\nthe Pacific, he proposed a method to measure the degree of relation among\nlanguages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris\nSwadesh in the 1950s, measures distances from the percentage of shared\ncognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we\nproposed a new automated method which uses normalized Levenshtein distance\namong words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a\nlist. Recently another group of scholars \\cite{Bak, Hol} proposed a refined of\nour definition including a second normalization. In this paper we compare the\ninformation content of our definition with the refined version in order to\ndecide which of the two can be applied with greater success to resolve\nrelationships among languages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2009 15:53:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2009 07:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2009 11:27:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Petroni", "Filippo", ""], ["Serva", "Maurizio", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.1820", "submitter": "Vishal Goyal", "authors": "Mirzanur Rahman, Sufal Das and Utpal Sharma", "title": "Parsing of part-of-speech tagged Assamese Texts", "comments": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, IJCSI Volume 6,\n  Issue 1, pp28-34, November 2009", "journal-ref": "M.
