The proposed methods are mostly combinations of simple operators on\na generic character n-gram graph representation of texts. This work defines the\nset of used operators upon n-gram graphs and proposes using these operators\nwithin the multi-document summarization process in such subtasks as document\nanalysis, salient sentence selection, query expansion and redundancy control.\nFurthermore, a novel chunking methodology is used, together with a novel way to\nassign concepts to sentences for query expansion. The experimental results of\nthe summarization system, performed upon widely used corpora from the Document\nUnderstanding and the Text Analysis Conferences, are promising and provide\nevidence for the potential of the generic methods introduced. This work aims to\ndesignate core methods exploiting the n-gram graph representation, providing\nthe basis for more advanced summarization systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Dec 2010 16:15:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Giannakopoulos", "George", ""], ["Vouros", "George", ""], ["Karkaletsis", "Vangelis", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2661", "submitter": "Christian Retore", "authors": "Maxime Amblard (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Alain Lecomte (INRIA Bordeaux\n  - Sud-Ouest, SFLTAMP), Christian Retor\\'e (INRIA Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest, LaBRI)", "title": "Categorial Minimalist Grammar", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Linguistic Analysis 36, 1--4 (2010) 273--308", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We first recall some basic notions on minimalist grammars and on categorial\ngrammars.

The\nannotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English\ntext is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading\nand learning of the English language with and without annotations. The\nannotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of\nannotations not dramatically high. This makes the reader easily associate\nannotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and\nconsolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by\nthe enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of\nthis annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without\na significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version\nof any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no\nletter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not\nknow the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The\nannotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and\nrecognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the\nrules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after\nreading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that\nknowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:40:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10:21:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hernandez-Orallo", "Jose", ""]]}]
