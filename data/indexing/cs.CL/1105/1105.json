In its\nalmost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported\nexclusively through small-scale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we\naddress this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly,\nthis setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus,\nchallenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also\nfrom the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length\nrestriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design\nthat was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such\nconstraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to\noccur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we\ndevelop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its\neffects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset specifically\ndeveloped for this task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic\nstyle accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale, real\nworld setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such as stylistic\ninfluence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover a complexity of the\nphenomenon which was never observed before. We also explore the potential\nrelation between stylistic influence and network features commonly associated\nwith social status.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2011 20:00:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil", "Cristian", ""], ["Gamon", "Michael", ""], ["Dumais", "Susan", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1072", "submitter": "Gintaras Barisevicius", "authors": "G.

Moreover, the power-law growth of\ninformation holds if texts describe a complicated infinite (algorithmically)\nrandom object in a highly repetitive way, according to an analogous power-law\ndistribution. The described object may be immutable (like a mathematical or\nphysical constant) or may evolve slowly in time (like cultural heritage).

This paper describes a computer algorithm that is designed\nto solve the problem of locating word boundaries in blocks of English text from\nwhich the spaces have been removed. This problem avoids the complexities of\nspeech processing but requires similar capabilities for detecting recurring\nsequences. The algorithm relies entirely on statistical relationships between\nletters in the input stream to infer the locations of word boundaries. A\nViterbi trellis is used to simultaneously evaluate a set of hypothetical\nsegmentations of a block of adjacent words. This technique improves accuracy\nbut incurs a small latency between the arrival of letters in the input stream\nand the sending of words to the output stream.
