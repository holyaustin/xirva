Our approach\npresents three main characteristics: 1. The usage of multiple retrieval models\n(KL, Okapi) and term index definitions (lemma, phrase, concept) for the three\nlanguages considered in the present track (English, French, German) producing\nten different sets of ranked results. 2. The merging of the different results\nbased on multiple regression models using an additional validation set created\nfrom the patent collection. 3. The exploitation of patent metadata and of the\ncitation structures for creating restricted initial working sets of patents and\nfor producing a final re-ranking regression model. As we exploit specific\nmetadata of the patent documents and the citation relations only at the\ncreation of initial working sets and during the final post ranking step, our\narchitecture remains generic and easy to extend.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 18:50:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lopez", "Patrice", "", "IDSL"], ["Romary", "Laurent", "", "IDSL, INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France"]]}, {"id": "0908.4431", "submitter": "Prabhulla Chandran Pillai", "authors": "B Prabhulla Chandran Pillai", "title": "An OLAC Extension for Dravidian Languages", "comments": "4 Pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  OLAC was founded in 2000 for creating online databases of language resources.\nThis paper intends to review the bottom-up distributed character of the project\nand proposes an extension of the architecture for Dravidian languages.
