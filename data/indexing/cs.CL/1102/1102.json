The language most closely related to Malagasy is Maanyan\n(Greater Barito East group of the Austronesian family), but related languages\nare also in Sulawesi, Malaysia and Sumatra. For this reason, and because\nMaanyan is spoken by a population which lives along the Barito river in\nKalimantan and which does not possess the necessary skill for long maritime\nnavigation, the ethnic composition of the Indonesian colonizers is still\nunclear.\n  There is a general consensus that Indonesian sailors reached Madagascar by a\nmaritime trek, but the time, the path and the landing area of the first\ncolonization are all disputed. In this research we try to answer these problems\ntogether with other ones, such as the historical configuration of Malagasy\ndialects, by types of analysis related to lexicostatistics and glottochronology\nwhich draw upon the automated method recently proposed by the authors\n\\cite{Serva:2008, Holman:2008, Petroni:2008, Bakker:2009}. The data were\ncollected by the first author at the beginning of 2010 with the invaluable help\nof Joselin\\`a Soafara N\\'er\\'e and consist of Swadesh lists of 200 items for 23\ndialects covering all areas of the Island.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 17:16:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Feb 2011 16:12:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Serva", "M.", ""], ["Petroni", "F.", ""], ["Volchenkov", "D.", ""], ["Wichmann", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2831", "submitter": "Ahmed Hassan", "authors": "Madhav Krishna and Ahmed Hassan and Yang Liu and Dragomir Radev", "title": "The effect of linguistic constraints on the large scale organization of\n  language", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the effect of linguistic constraints on the large scale\norganization of language. It describes the properties of linguistic networks\nbuilt using texts of written language with the words randomized. These\nproperties are compared to those obtained for a network built over the text in\nnatural order. It is observed that the \"random\" networks too exhibit\nsmall-world and scale-free characteristics. They also show a high degree of\nclustering. This is indeed a surprising result - one that has not been\naddressed adequately in the literature.

This class is proven to precisely coincide with the class of\nlogically closed languages that may be thought of as functions from expressions\nto sets of logically equivalent Ty_n terms. For a specific sub-class of\nlogically closed languages that are described by finite sets of rules or rule\nschemata, we find effective procedures for building a compact Ty_n\nrepresentation, involving a finite number of axioms or axiom schemata. The\nproposed formalism is characterized by some useful features unavailable in a\ntwo-component architecture of a language model. A further specialization and\nextension of the formalism with a context type enable effective account of\nintensional and dynamic semantics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 08:13:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gluzberg", "Victor", ""]]}]
