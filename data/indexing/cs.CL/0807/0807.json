The\nalgorithm is based on the use of \"key words\" in text documents, and on the\nmeans of their automated translation. Key words were singled out by means of\nusing Russian and Ukrainian morphological dictionaries, as well as dictionaries\nof the translation of nouns for the Russian and Ukrainianlanguages. Besides, to\ncalculate the weights of the terms in the documents, empiric-statistic rules\nwere used. The algorithm under consideration was realized in the form of a\nprogram complex, integrated into the content-monitoring InfoStream system. As a\nresult, a parallel bilingual corpora of web-publications containing about 30\nthousand documents, was created\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jul 2008 09:49:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lande", "D.
