The translation of the first text into esperanto is also\nconsidered as a test for the role of punctuation in defining a style, and for\ncontrasting natural and artificial, but written, languages. Several log-log\nplots of the sentence length-rank relationship are presented for the major\npunctuation marks. Different power laws are observed with characteristic\nexponents. The exponent can take a value much less than unity ($ca.$ 0.50 or\n0.30) depending on how a sentence is defined. The texts are also mapped into\ntime series based on the word frequencies. The quantitative differences between\nthe original and translated texts are very minutes, at the exponent level. It\nis argued that sentences seem to be more reliable than word distributions in\ndiscussing an author style.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Apr 2010 16:13:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "M.", ""]]}]
