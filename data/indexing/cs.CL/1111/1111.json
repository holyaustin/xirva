This\nchallenge arises from the need for the generator to adapt to many features of\nthe dialogue domain, user population, and dialogue context. A promising\napproach is trainable generation, which uses general-purpose linguistic\nknowledge that is automatically adapted to the features of interest, such as\nthe application domain, individual user, or user group. In this paper we\npresent and evaluate a trainable sentence planner for providing restaurant\ninformation in the MATCH dialogue system. We show that trainable sentence\nplanning can produce complex information presentations whose quality is\ncomparable to the output of a template-based generator tuned to this domain. We\nalso show that our method easily supports adapting the sentence planner to\nindividuals, and that the individualized sentence planners generally perform\nbetter than models trained and tested on a population of individuals. Previous\nwork has documented and utilized individual preferences for content selection,\nbut to our knowledge, these results provide the first demonstration of\nindividual preferences for sentence planning operations, affecting the content\norder, discourse structure and sentence structure of system responses. Finally,\nwe evaluate the contribution of different feature sets, and show that, in our\napplication, n-gram features often do as well as features based on higher-level\nlinguistic representations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 21:53:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mairesse", "F.", ""], ["Prasad", "R.", ""], ["Stent", "A.", ""], ["Walker", "M.

Beginning with a review of\nresearch, I list several heterogeneous arguments against disembodied language,\nin an attempt to draw conclusions for developing embodied multisensory agents\nwhich communicate verbally and non-verbally with their environment. Without\ntaking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment,\nit is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during\nlanguage acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic\nactions. While robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit\nfrom strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their\nprocesses and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in\nsituated human-machine interaction.
