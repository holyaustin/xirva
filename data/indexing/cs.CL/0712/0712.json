In such systems, where there is hardly\nany link with our common-sense view of the world, and it is quite difficult to\nenvision how one can formally account for the considerable amount of content\nthat is often implicit, but almost never explicitly stated in our everyday\ndiscourse. The solution, in our opinion, is a compositional semantics grounded\nin an ontology that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we\ntalk about it in ordinary language. In the compositional logic we envision\nthere are ontological (or first-intension) concepts, and logical (or\nsecond-intension) concepts, and where the ontological concepts include not only\nDavidsonian events, but other abstract objects as well (e.g., states,\nprocesses, properties, activities, attributes, etc.) It will be demonstrated\nhere that in such a framework, a number of challenges in the semantics of\nnatural language (e.g., metonymy, intensionality, metaphor, etc.) can be\nproperly and uniformly addressed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2007 14:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2007 20:25:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Saba", "Walid S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3298", "submitter": "Bryan Gibson", "authors": "Dragomir Radev, Mark Hodges, Anthony Fader, Mark Joseph, Joshua\n  Gerrish, Mark Schaller, Jonathan dePeri, Bryan Gibson", "title": "CLAIRLIB Documentation v1.03", "comments": "for download and additional information, please see\n  http://www.clairlib.org", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "CSE-TR-536-07", "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL", "license": null, "abstract": "  The Clair library is intended to simplify a number of generic tasks in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Network\nAnalysis.

All these factors create a need for methods and resources that\ncan be used to evaluate and compare parsing systems.
