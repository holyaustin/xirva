We will begin by looking at the traditional workflow of journal\nediting and publication, and how these practices have made the transition into\nthe online domain. We will examine the range of different file formats in which\nelectronic articles are currently stored and published. We will argue strongly\nthat, despite the prevalence of binary and proprietary formats such as PDF and\nMS Word, XML is a far superior encoding choice for journal articles. Next, we\nlook at the range of XML document structures (DTDs, Schemas) which are in\ncommon use for encoding journal articles, and consider some of their strengths\nand weaknesses. We will suggest that, despite the existence of specialized\nschemas intended specifically for journal articles (such as NLM), and more\nbroadly-used publication-oriented schemas such as DocBook, there are strong\narguments in favour of developing a subset or customization of the Text\nEncoding Initiative (TEI) schema for the purpose of journal-article encoding;\nTEI is already in use in a number of journal publication projects, and the\nscale and precision of the TEI tagset makes it particularly appropriate for\nencoding scholarly articles. We will outline the document structure of a\nTEI-encoded journal article, and look in detail at suggested markup patterns\nfor specific features of journal articles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2009 09:53:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Holmes", "Martin", "", "HCMC"], ["Romary", "Laurent", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France,\n  IDSL"]]}, {"id": "0906.0716", "submitter": "Sebastian Bernhardsson", "authors": "Sebastian Bernhardsson, Luis Enrique Correa da Rocha and Petter\n  Minnhagen", "title": "Size dependent word frequencies and translational invariance of books", "comments": "10 pages, 2 appendices (6 pages), 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 389:2, pp. 330-341 (2010)", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2009.09.022", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is shown that a real novel shares many characteristic features with a null\nmodel in which the words are randomly distributed throughout the text. Such a\ncommon feature is a certain translational invariance of the text. Another is\nthat the functional form of the word-frequency distribution of a novel depends\non the length of the text in the same way as the null model. This means that an\napproximate power-law tail ascribed to the data will have an exponent which\nchanges with the size of the text-section which is analyzed. A further\nconsequence is that a novel cannot be described by text-evolution models like\nthe Simon model. The size-transformation of a novel is found to be well\ndescribed by a specific Random Book Transformation. This size transformation in\naddition enables a more precise determination of the functional form of the\nword-frequency distribution. The implications of the results are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2009 13:52:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bernhardsson", "Sebastian", ""], ["da Rocha", "Luis Enrique Correa", ""], ["Minnhagen", "Petter", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1467", "submitter": "Animesh Mukherjee", "authors": "Chris Biemann, Monojit Choudhury and Animesh Mukherjee", "title": "Syntax is from Mars while Semantics from Venus!

A\nnumber of these offer mechanisms for other users to evaluate these opinions; a\ncanonical example is Amazon.com, where reviews come with annotations like \"26\nof 32 people found the following review helpful.\" Opinion evaluation appears in\nmany off-line settings as well, including market research and political\ncampaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally\ndifferent from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, \"What\ndid Y think of X?\", we are asking, \"What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?\" Here\nwe develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a\nlarge-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the\nperceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but\nalso in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other\nevaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel\nmethods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review \"plagiarism\" to control\nfor the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and\nnatural mathematical model consistent with our findings.
