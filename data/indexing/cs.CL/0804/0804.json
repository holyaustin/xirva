Semantic similarity is here\nviewed as association. It turns out that the similarity between two words W1\nand W2 strongly increases with a co-occurrence, decreases with the occurrence\nof W1 without W2 or W2 without W1, and slightly increases with high-order\nco-occurrences. Therefore, operationalizing similarity as a frequency of\nco-occurrence probably introduces a bias: first, there are cases in which there\nis similarity without co-occurrence and, second, the frequency of co-occurrence\noverestimates similarity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2008 11:33:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lemaire", "Beno\u00eet", "", "TIMC"], ["Denhi\u00e8re", "Guy", "", "LPC"]]}, {"id": "0804.0317", "submitter": "Maurice H.

This\nresult was unexpected since potential errors from a series of text analysis\nprocesses is likely to adversely affect the outcome of the entire process. Most\nbiomedical entity relationship extraction tools have used biomedical-specific\nparts-of-speech (POS) tagger as errors in POS tagging and are likely to affect\nsubsequent semantic analysis of the text, such as shallow parsing. This study\naims to evaluate the parts-of-speech (POS) tagging accuracy and attempts to\nexplore whether a comparable performance is obtained when a generic POS tagger,\nMontyTagger, was used in place of MedPost, a tagger trained in biomedical text.\nOur results demonstrated that MontyTagger, Muscorian's POS tagger, has a POS\ntagging accuracy of 83.1% when tested on biomedical text. Replacing MontyTagger\nwith MedPost did not result in a significant improvement in entity relationship\nextraction from text; precision of 55.6% from MontyTagger versus 56.8% from\nMedPost on directional relationships and 86.1% from MontyTagger compared to\n81.8% from MedPost on nondirectional relationships. This is unexpected as the\npotential for poor POS tagging by MontyTagger is likely to affect the outcome\nof the information extraction. An analysis of POS tagging errors demonstrated\nthat 78.5% of tagging errors are being compensated by shallow parsing. Thus,\ndespite 83.1% tagging accuracy, MontyTagger has a functional tagging accuracy\nof 94.6%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2008 09:34:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Maurice HT", ""], ["Lefevre", "Christophe", ""], ["Nicholas", "Kevin R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1033", "submitter": "Christoph Schommer", "authors": "Sviatlana Danilava, Christoph Schommer", "title": "A Semi-Automatic Framework to Discover Epistemic Modalities in\n  Scientific Articles", "comments": "18 pages, 5 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Documents in scientific newspapers are often marked by attitudes and opinions\nof the author and/or other persons, who contribute with objective and\nsubjective statements and arguments as well.
