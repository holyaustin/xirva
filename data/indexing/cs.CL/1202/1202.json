Such inference is necessary for\nlogical questions when the direct comparison of objects from a question and\ndatabase can not give a result. The following classes of problems are\nconsidered: a check of hypotheses for persons and non-typical actions, the\ndetermination of persons and circumstances for non-typical actions, planning\nactions, the determination of event cause and state of persons. To form an\nanswer both deduction and plausible reasoning are used. As a knowledge domain\nunder consideration is social behavior of persons, plausible reasoning is based\non laws of social psychology. Proposed algorithms of inference and plausible\nreasoning can be realized in computer systems closely connected with text\nprocessing (criminology, operation of business, medicine, document systems).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 08:36:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ostapov", "Yuriy", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.0617", "submitter": "Dr. Nitin", "authors": "Nitin, Ankush Bansal, Siddhartha Mahadev Sharma, Kapil Kumar, Anuj\n  Aggarwal, Sheenu Goyal, Kanika Choudhary, Kunal Chawla, Kunal Jain and Manav\n  Bhasin", "title": "Classification of Flames in Computer Mediated Communications", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Applications (0975-8887), Volume\n  14 - No.6, February 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": "pxc3872505", "categories": "cs.SI cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) has brought about a revolution in the\nway the world communicates with each other.

In many cases, from one bag of\nwords to the next, the words disappear and new ones appear as if the theme\nslowly and smoothly shifted across documents (providing that the documents are\nsomehow ordered). Examples of latent structure that describe such ordering are\neasily imagined. For example, the advancement of the date of the news stories\nis reflected in a smooth change over the theme of the day as certain evolving\nnews stories fall out of favor and new events create new stories. Overlaps\namong the stories of consecutive days can be modeled by using windows over\nlinearly arranged tight distributions over words. We show here that such\nstrategy can be extended to multiple dimensions and cases where the ordering of\ndata is not readily obvious.
