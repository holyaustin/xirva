In this model communicating\nagents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an\nevolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and\nlinguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of\nthe model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically\nunskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with\nlarge learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds\nvia Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language\nand that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the\nincrease of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity\nincreases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several\ntransition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets\nan additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting\nthe evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and\nbiological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect\ncertainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2008 19:45:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2008 23:45:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 21 Aug 2010 21:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lipowski", "Adam", ""], ["Lipowska", "Dorota", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.2510", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "J.
