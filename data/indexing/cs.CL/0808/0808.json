In this paper, we investigate the\nprospects for providing a relational syllogistic. We identify several fragments\nbased on (a) whether negation is permitted on all nouns, including those in the\nsubject of a sentence; and (b) whether the subject noun phrase may contain a\nrelative clause. The logics we present are extensions of the classical\nsyllogistic, and we pay special attention to the question of whether reductio\nad absurdum is needed. Thus our main goal is to derive results on the existence\n(or non-existence) of syllogistic proof systems for relational fragments. We\nalso determine the computational complexity of all our fragments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2008 22:26:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pratt-Hartmann", "Ian", ""], ["Moss", "Lawrence S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1211", "submitter": "W Saba", "authors": "Walid S.
