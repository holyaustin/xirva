Based on psychological\nstudies, we propose a multistage categorization strategy which allows\nestablishing an automatic categorization model flexibly for a given emotional\nspeech categorization task. We apply the strategy to the Serbian Emotional\nSpeech Corpus (GEES) and the Danish Emotional Speech Corpus (DES), where human\nperformance was reported in previous psychological studies. Our work is the\nfirst attempt to apply machine learning to the GEES corpus where the human\nrecognition rates were only available prior to our study. Unlike the previous\nwork on the DES corpus, our work focuses on a comparison to human performance\nunder the same experimental settings. Our studies suggest that\npsychology-inspired systems yield behaviours that, to a great extent, resemble\nwhat humans perceived and their performance is close to that of humans under\nthe same experimental setup. Furthermore, our work also uncovers some\ndifferences between machine and humans in terms of emotional state recognition\nfrom speech.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Sep 2010 07:51:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Shaukat", "Arslan", ""], ["Chen", "Ke", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1117", "submitter": "Elsa Tolone", "authors": "Elsa Tolone (LIGM), Stavroula Voyatzi (LIGM), Christian Lecl\\`ere\n  (LIGM)", "title": "Constructions d\\'efinitoires des tables du Lexique-Grammaire", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "29\\`eme Colloque international sur le Lexique et la Grammaire\n  (LGC'10), Belgrade : Serbie (2010)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lexicon-Grammar tables are a very rich syntactic lexicon for the French\nlanguage.

The functioning of various\ncomputational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register\nmachines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS\nare computationally complete; however, a direct translation leads to quite a\nbig number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete\ndevices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest\nnumber of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization\nstrategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We\napply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine\n(Korec, 1996) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules.\nSince MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport\nrules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number\nof rules for those systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Sep 2010 16:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Alhazov", "Artiom", ""], ["Verlan", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3238", "submitter": "Arno Bastenhof", "authors": "Arno Bastenhof", "title": "Tableaux for the Lambek-Grishin calculus", "comments": "Appeared in: Marija Slavkovik, editor, \"Proceedings of the 15th\n  student session of the European Summer School of Logic, Language and\n  Information\", Copenhagen, 2010.

Like other entities that are reproduced and evolve, words\nrise or decline depending upon a complex interplay between {their intrinsic\nproperties and the environments in which they function}. Using Internet\ndiscussion communities as model systems, we define the concept of a word niche\nas the relationship between the word and the characteristic features of the\nenvironments in which it is used. We develop a method to quantify two important\naspects of the size of the word niche: the range of individuals using the word\nand the range of topics it is used to discuss. Controlling for word frequency,\nwe show that these aspects of the word niche are strong determinants of changes\nin word frequency. Previous studies have already indicated that word frequency\nitself is a correlate of word success at historical time scales. Our analysis\nof changes in word frequencies over time reveals that the relative sizes of\nword niches are far more important than word frequencies in the dynamics of the\nentire vocabulary at shorter time scales, as the language adapts to new\nconcepts and social groupings. We also distinguish endogenous versus exogenous\nfactors as additional contributors to the fates of words, and demonstrate the\nforce of this distinction in the rise of novel words. Our results indicate that\nshort-term nonstationarity in word statistics is strongly driven by individual\nproclivities, including inclinations to provide novel information and to\nproject a distinctive social identity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 02:46:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2011 16:05:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Altmann", "Eduardo G.", ""], ["Pierrehumbert", "Janet B.", ""], ["Motter", "Adilson E.", ""]]}]
