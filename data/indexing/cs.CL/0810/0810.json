Based on the same statistical data, it is possible to build matrices\nof syntagmatic similarity (bigram transition matrices) or paradigmatic\nsimilarity (probability for any pair of words to share common contexts). When\nclustered with respect to their syntagmatic similarity, words tend to group\ninto sublanguage vocabularies, and when clustered with respect to their\nparadigmatic similarity, into syntactic or semantic classes. Experiments have\nexplored the first of these two possibilities. Their results are interpreted in\nthe frame of a Markov chain modelling of the corpus' generative processe(s): we\nshow that the results of a spectral analysis of the transition matrix can be\ninterpreted as probability distributions of words within clusters. This method\nyields a soft clustering of the vocabulary into sublanguages which contribute\nto the generation of heterogeneous corpora.
