Such parsers have already been well-implemented and studied in the\ncase of Context-Free Grammars, which are already top-down, but these are\ndifficult to adapt to Minimalist Grammars, which generate sentences bottom-up.\nI propose here a way of rewriting Minimalist Grammars as Linear Context-Free\nRewriting Systems, allowing to easily create a top-down parser. This rewriting\nallows also to put a probabilistic field on these grammars, which can be used\nto accelerate the parser. Finally, I propose a method of refining the\nprobabilistic field by using algorithms used in data compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Oct 2010 10:09:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mainguy", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2384", "submitter": "Doina Tatar", "authors": "Mihaiela Lupea, Doina Tatar and Zsuzsana Marian", "title": "Learning Taxonomy for Text Segmentation by Formal Concept Analysis", "comments": "Presented at Synasc 2010, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the problems of deriving a taxonomy from a text and\nconcept-oriented text segmentation are approached.

The\nproposed segmentation method offers a conceptual view for text segmentation,\nusing a context-driven clustering of sentences. The Concept-oriented Clustering\nSegmentation algorithm (COCS) is based on k-means linear clustering of the\nsentences.

Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e.,\ncan societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision\nmaking? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of\neconomic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective\nmood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value\nof the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text\ncontent of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder\nthat measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States\n(GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital,\nKind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing\ntheir ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and\nThanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing\nFuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public\nmood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are\npredictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the\naccuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of\nspecific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 87.6% in\npredicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and\na reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error by more than 6%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Oct 2010 18:55:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bollen", "Johan", ""], ["Mao", "Huina", ""], ["Zeng", "Xiao-Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6091", "submitter": "Damian H.
