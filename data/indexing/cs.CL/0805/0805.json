For such problems, we propose a hybrid approach of these\ntechniques in the presence of global constraints. In particular, we solve the\nsubgraph isomorphism problem. Further we design specific heuristics for this\nhard problem, exploiting its special structure to achieve decomposition. The\nunderlying idea is to precompute a static heuristic on a subset of its\nconstraint network, to follow this static ordering until a first problem\ndecomposition is available, and to switch afterwards to a fully propagated,\ndynamically decomposing search. Experimental results show that, for sparse\ngraphs, our decomposition method solves more instances than dedicated,\nstate-of-the-art matching algorithms or standard constraint programming\napproaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 May 2008 17:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zampelli", "Stephane", ""], ["Mann", "Martin", ""], ["Deville", "Yves", ""], ["Backofen", "Rolf", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2303", "submitter": "Richard Moot", "authors": "Richard Moot (LaBRI, Inria Futurs)", "title": "Graph Algorithms for Improving Type-Logical Proof Search", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Dans Categorial grammars - an efficient tool for natural language\n  processing - June 2004 - Categorial grammars - an efficient tool for natural\n  language processing, Montpellier : France (2004)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Proof nets are a graph theoretical representation of proofs in various\nfragments of type-logical grammar.
