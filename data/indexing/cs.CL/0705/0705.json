We advocate\ninstead the contrary: that game semantics is conceptually more primitive than\nlinear logic. Starting from this revised point of view, we design a categorical\nmodel of resources in game semantics, and construct an arena game model where\nthe usual notion of bracketing is extended to multi- bracketing in order to\ncapture various resource policies: linear, af&#64257;ne and exponential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 May 2007 13:44:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Melli\u00e8s", "Paul-Andr\u00e9", "", "PPS"], ["Tabareau", "Nicolas", "", "PPS"]]}, {"id": "0705.1161", "submitter": "Lillian Lee", "authors": "Lillian Lee", "title": "IDF revisited: A simple new derivation within the Robertson-Sp\\\"arck\n  Jones probabilistic model", "comments": "To appear, Proceedings of SIGIR 2007, poster paper (2 pages)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL", "license": null, "abstract": "  There have been a number of prior attempts to theoretically justify the\neffectiveness of the inverse document frequency (IDF).
