At the theoretical\nlevel, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be\ninterpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the\nintrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known)\nnetwork properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use\nand, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying\ngrammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to\nbuild a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed\nto adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of\nstructure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria\nassuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic\nrelations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that\nenables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build\na network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard\nmeasures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2007 17:13:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2007 10:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Corominas-Murtra", "Bernat", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3886", "submitter": "W Saba", "authors": "Walid S.
