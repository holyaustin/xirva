We then use our partition function to\ncompute thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy and the specific heat.\nIn this approach, the parameters of the word frequency model vary from word to\nword so that each word has a different corresponding thermodynamics and we\nsuggest that differences in the specific heat reflect differences in how the\nwords are used in language, differentiating keywords from common and function\nwords. Finally, we apply our thermodynamic picture to the problem of retrieval\nof texts based on keywords and suggest some advantages over traditional\ninformation retrieval methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2009 16:16:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 01:07:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 27 Feb 2011 10:36:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Koroutchev", "Kostadin", ""], ["Shen", "Jian", ""], ["Koroutcheva", "Elka", ""], ["Cebrian", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.5168", "submitter": "Rakesh Pandey", "authors": "Rakesh Pandey, H.S.

Motivated by a survey of models for context and word meaning, syntactic\ncategories, phrase structure rules and trees, an attempt is being made in the\npresent paper to present a mathematical model for structuring of sentences from\nactive voice to passive voice, which is is the form of a transitive verb whose\ngrammatical subject serves as the patient, receiving the action of the verb.\n  For this purpose we have parsed all sentences of a corpus and have generated\nBoolean groups for each of them. It has been observed that when we take\nconstituents of the sentences as subgroups, the sequences of phrases form\npermutation roups. Application of isomorphism property yields permutation\nmapping between the important subgroups. It has resulted in a model for\ntransformation of sentences from active voice to passive voice. A computer\nprogram has been written to enable the software developers to evolve grammar\nsoftware for sentence transformations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2009 09:45:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Pandey", "Rakesh", ""], ["Dhami", "H.
