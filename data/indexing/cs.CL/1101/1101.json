Abstractly\nspeaking, this function is the morphism corresponding to the grammatical\nstructure of the sentence in the category of finite dimensional vector spaces.\nIn this paper, we provide a concrete method for implementing this linear\nmeaning map, by constructing a corpus-based vector space for the type of\nsentence. Our construction method is based on structured vector spaces whereby\nmeaning vectors of all sentences, regardless of their grammatical structure,\nlive in the same vector space. Our proposed sentence space is the tensor\nproduct of two noun spaces, in which the basis vectors are pairs of words each\naugmented with a grammatical role. This enables us to compare meanings of\nsentences by simply taking the inner product of their vectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 23:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Grefenstette", "Edward", ""], ["Sadrzadeh", "Mehrnoosh", ""], ["Clark", "Stephen", ""], ["Coecke", "Bob", ""], ["Pulman", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0510", "submitter": "Finn {\\AA}rup Nielsen", "authors": "Lars Kai Hansen, Adam Arvidsson, Finn {\\AA}rup Nielsen, Elanor\n  Colleoni, Michael Etter", "title": "Good Friends, Bad News - Affect and Virality in Twitter", "comments": "14 pages, 1 table.

A quantitative study of emailing of articles from the NY Times finds\na strong link between positive affect and virality, and, based on psychological\ntheories it is concluded that this relation is universally valid. The\nconclusion appears to be in contrast with classic theory of diffusion in news\nmedia emphasizing negative affect as promoting propagation. In this paper we\nexplore the apparent paradox in a quantitative analysis of information\ndiffusion on Twitter. Twitter is interesting in this context as it has been\nshown to present both the characteristics social and news media. The basic\nmeasure of virality in Twitter is the probability of retweet. Twitter is\ndifferent from email in that retweeting does not depend on pre-existing social\nrelations, but often occur among strangers, thus in this respect Twitter may be\nmore similar to traditional news media. We therefore hypothesize that negative\nnews content is more likely to be retweeted, while for non-news tweets positive\nsentiments support virality. To test the hypothesis we analyze three corpora: A\ncomplete sample of tweets about the COP15 climate summit, a random sample of\ntweets, and a general text corpus including news. The latter allows us to train\na classifier that can distinguish tweets that carry news and non-news\ninformation. We present evidence that negative sentiment enhances virality in\nthe news segment, but not in the non-news segment. We conclude that the\nrelation between affect and virality is more complex than expected based on the\nfindings of Berger and Milkman (2010), in short 'if you want to be cited: Sweet\ntalk your friends or serve bad news to the public'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jan 2011 12:54:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hansen", "Lars Kai", ""], ["Arvidsson", "Adam", ""], ["Nielsen", "Finn \u00c5rup", ""], ["Colleoni", "Elanor", ""], ["Etter", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2804", "submitter": "Animesh Mukherjee", "authors": "Animesh Mukherjee, Francesca Tria, Andrea Baronchelli, Andrea Puglisi\n  and Vittorio Loreto", "title": "Aging in language dynamics", "comments": "15 pages, 6 figures.

The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be\na vector representing the contexts in which it occurs in the corpus model.\nBased on this assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words\ncan be considered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in\napplications of vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an\nunderlying lattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice\nas describing entailment between meanings.
