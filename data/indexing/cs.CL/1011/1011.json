They are often seen as not really reflecting the state of the art\nin a given domain and a hindrance to scientific creativity. Still, scientists\nshould theoretically be at the best place to bring their expertise into\nstandard developments, being even more neutral on issues that may typically be\nrelated to competing industrial interests. Even if it could be thought of as\neven more complex to think about developping standards in the humanities, we\nwill show how this can be made feasible through the experience gained both\nwithin the Text Encoding Initiative consortium and the International\nOrganisation for Standardisation.

However, the properties of the sequencing rules in\nbirdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the\nstatistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura\nstriata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first\nshow that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese\nfinch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one\nprevious syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential\nbehaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that\nhigher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden\nstate transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds\nto hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large\nrange of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these\nmodels with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual\nannotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and\nsurpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does\nnot use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical\nrepresentation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural\nimplementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 06:46:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Katahira", "Kentaro", ""], ["Suzuki", "Kenta", ""], ["Okanoya", "Kazuo", ""], ["Okada", "Masato", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.2922", "submitter": "Gillian  Long", "authors": "Carl Vogel and Jerom Janssen", "title": "Emoticonsciousness", "comments": "COST Action 2102 and euCognition International School Vietri sul\n  Mare, Italy, April 21-26, 2008 Revised Selected and Invited Papers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-12397-9_2", "report-no": "TCD-CS-2010-09", "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A temporal analysis of emoticon use in Swedish, Italian, German and English\nasynchronous electronic communication is reported.
