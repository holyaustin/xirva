But the question on how to appropriately\nrepresent a text is still one of the fundamental tasks, and the problem of\nwhich attribute should be used to fingerprint the author's style is still not\nexactly defined. In this work, we focus on linguistic selection of attributes\nto fingerprint the style of the authors Parkin, Bassewitz and Leander. We use\ntexts of the genre Fairy Tale as it has a clear style and texts of a shorter\nsize with a straightforward story-line and a simple language.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2008 16:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Schommer", "Christoph", ""], ["Uhde", "Conny", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4112", "submitter": "Hanna E.

Our statistical analysis of the network of synonyms in Polish\nlanguage showed it is scale-free; similar to what is known for English. The\nstatistical properties of the networks are also similar. Thus, the statistical\naspects of the networks are good candidates for culture independent elements of\nhuman language. We hypothesize that optimization for robustness and efficiency\nis responsible for this universality. Despite the statistical similarity, there\nis no one-to-one mapping between networks of these two languages. Although many\nhubs in Polish are translated into similarly highly connected hubs in English,\nthere are also hubs specific to one of these languages only: a single word in\none language is equivalent to many different and disconnected words in the\nother, in accordance with the Whorf hypothesis about language relativity.\nIdentifying language-specific hubs is vitally important for automatic\ntranslation, and for understanding contextual, culturally related messages that\nare frequently missed or twisted in a naive, literary translation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 00:15:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Makaruk", "Hanna E.", ""], ["Owczarek", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4198", "submitter": "Andrij Rovenchak", "authors": "Solomija Buk, J\\'an Ma\\v{c}utek, Andrij Rovenchak", "title": "Some properties of the Ukrainian writing system", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": "Glottometrics 16, 63-79 (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the grapheme-phoneme relation in Ukrainian and some properties\nof the Ukrainian version of the Cyrillic alphabet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 12:58:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Buk", "Solomija", ""], ["Ma\u010dutek", "J\u00e1n", ""], ["Rovenchak", "Andrij", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4215", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "M.

One dimensional time series\nlike signals are constructed using only word frequencies (FTS) or word lengths\n(LTS). The data is studied through (i) a Zipf method for sorting out\ncorrelations in the FTS and (ii) a Grassberger-Procaccia (GP) technique based\nmethod for finding correlations in LTS. Features are compared : different power\nlaws are observed with characteristic exponents for the ranking properties, and\nthe {\\it phase space attractor dimensionality}. The Zipf exponent can take\nvalues much less than unity ($ca.$ 0.50 or 0.30) depending on how a sentence is\ndefined. This non-universality is conjectured to be a measure of the author\n$style$. Moreover the attractor dimension $r$ is a simple function of the so\ncalled phase space dimension $n$, i.e., $r = n^{\\lambda}$, with $\\lambda =\n0.79$. Such an exponent should also conjecture to be a measure of the author\n$creativity$. However, even though there are quantitative differences between\nthe original english text and its esperanto translation, the qualitative\ndifferences are very minutes, indicating in this case a translation relatively\nwell respecting, along our analysis lines, the content of the author writing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 11:49:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4326", "submitter": "Jiyou Jia Dr.", "authors": "Jiyou Jia", "title": "The Generation of Textual Entailment with NLML in an Intelligent\n  Dialogue system for Language Learning CSIEC", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY", "license": null, "abstract": "  This research report introduces the generation of textual entailment within\nthe project CSIEC (Computer Simulation in Educational Communication), an\ninteractive web-based human-computer dialogue system with natural language for\nEnglish instruction.
