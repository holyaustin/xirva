A related problem is the computability\nof an object. We present practical examples of a new way to address this\nproblem. By giving an appropriate representation to our objects, based on a\nhierarchical coding of information, we exemplify how it is remarkably easy to\ncompute complex objects. Our algorithmic complexity is related to the length of\nthe class of objects, rather than to the length of the object.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2007 17:00:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2007 11:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Murtagh", "Fionn", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.2401", "submitter": "Timothy Baldwin", "authors": "Timothy Baldwin", "title": "Bootstrapping Deep Lexical Resources: Resources for Courses", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "In Proceedings of the ACL-SIGLEX 2005 Workshop on Deep Lexical\n  Acquisition, Ann Arbor, USA, pp. 67-76", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL", "license": null, "abstract": "  We propose a range of deep lexical acquisition methods which make use of\nmorphological, syntactic and ontological language resources to model word\nsimilarity and bootstrap from a seed lexicon.
