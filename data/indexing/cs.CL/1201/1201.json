Now Researchers have growing interest in text mining\nmethods for discovering knowledge. Text mining researchers come from variety of\nareas like: Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistic, Machine\nLearning, and Statistics. A typical text mining application involves\npreprocessing of text, stemming and lemmatization, tagging and annotation,\nderiving knowledge patterns, evaluating and interpreting the results. There are\nnumerous approaches for performing text mining tasks, like: clustering,\ncategorization, sentimental analysis, and summarization. There is a growing\nneed to standardize the evaluation of these tasks. One major component of\nestablishing standardization is to provide standard datasets for these tasks.\nAlthough there are various standard datasets available for traditional text\nmining tasks, but there are very few and expensive datasets for blog-mining\ntask. Blogs, a new genre in web 2.0 is a digital diary of web user, which has\nchronological entries and contains a lot of useful knowledge, thus offers a lot\nof challenges and opportunities for text mining. In this paper, we report a new\nindigenous dataset for Pakistani Political Blogosphere. The paper describes the\nprocess of data collection, organization, and standardization. We have used\nthis dataset for carrying out various text mining tasks for blogosphere, like:\nblog-search, political sentiments analysis and tracking, identification of\ninfluential blogger, and clustering of the blog-posts.

We also show that the initial set of comments given\nto a story has a substantial impact on the further \"life\" of the discussion:\nhigh negative average emotions in the first 10 comments lead to longer threads\nwhile the opposite situation results in shorter discussions.
