Genetic imprinting of the learning\nabilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents\nlearn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary\npressure for the increase of learning ability.Our model suggests that when\nlinguistic (or cultural) processes became intensive enough, a transition took\nplace where both linguistic performance and biological endowment of our species\nexperienced an abrupt change that perhaps triggered the rapid expansion of\nhuman civilization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2007 09:39:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Oct 2007 13:20:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lipowski", "Adam", ""], ["Lipowska", "Dorota", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.0105", "submitter": "Dmitrii Manin", "authors": "Dmitrii Manin", "title": "Zipf's Law and Avoidance of Excessive Synonymy", "comments": "47 pages; fixed reference list missing in v.1", "journal-ref": "Main text in Cognitive Science, 32 (7) 2008, pp. 1075 - 1098;\n  Appendix A TBP separately in J.
