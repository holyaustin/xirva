We show that for the lemmatized (basic) word forms the\nscale-invariant regime breaks after about two decades, while it might be\nconsistent for the whole range of ranks for the inflected word forms. We also\nfind that for a corpus consisting of texts written by different authors the\nbasic scale-invariant regime is broken more strongly than in the case of\ncomparable corpus consisting of texts written by the same author. Similarly,\nfor a corpus consisting of texts translated into Polish from other languages\nthe scale-invariant regime is broken more strongly than for a comparable corpus\nof native Polish texts. Moreover, we find that if the words are tagged with\ntheir proper part of speech, only verbs show rank-frequency distribution that\nis almost scale-invariant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2010 16:09:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kwapien", "Jaroslaw", ""], ["Drozdz", "Stanislaw", ""], ["Orczyk", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1025", "submitter": "Henryk Fuks", "authors": "Henryk Fuk\\'s", "title": "Inflection system of a language as a complex network", "comments": "6 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of 2009 IEEE Toronto International Conference -\n  Science and Technology for Humanity, IEEE, Toronto 2009, pp. 491-496", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL nlin.AO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate inflection structure of a synthetic language using Latin as an\nexample.

The literature samples were found to be most effectively\nrepresented by their corresponding power laws over degree distribution $P(k)$\nand clustering coefficient $C(k)$; we also studied the mean geodesic distance,\nand found all our texts were small-world networks.
