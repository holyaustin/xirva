Interaction is\nexpressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn\nover a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of\nattributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken\ninto account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as\nrelational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between\nboth graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The\nsegmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that\nminimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with\ninput information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation\nmethods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the\nproblem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results\non both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing\nthe reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 May 2008 13:39:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2008 13:45:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Noma", "Alexandre", ""], ["Graciano", "Ana B.
