To this end, we propose a new and quite fast method for\nautomatic video segmentation with the help of 1) efficient optimization of\nMarkov random fields with polynomial time of number of pixels by introducing\ngraph cuts, 2) automatic, computationally efficient but stable derivation of\nsegmentation priors using visual saliency and sequential update mechanism, and\n3) an implementation strategy in the principle of stream processing with\ngraphics processor units (GPUs).
