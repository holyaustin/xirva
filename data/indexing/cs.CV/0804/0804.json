Most contour-based shape analysis methods can not be used to\ncharacterize such cells because of overlaps between neuronal processes. The\nproposed framework is specifically aimed at the problem of contour following\neven in presence of multiple overlaps. First, the input image is preprocessed\nin order to obtain an 8-connected skeleton with one-pixel-wide branches, as\nwell as a set of critical regions (i.e., bifurcations and crossings). Next, for\neach subtree, the tracking stage iteratively labels all valid pixel of\nbranches, up to a critical region, where it determines the suitable direction\nto proceed. Finally, the labeled skeleton segments are followed in order to\nyield the parametric contour of the neuronal shape under analysis. The reported\nsystem was successfully tested with respect to several images and the results\nfrom a set of three neuron images are presented here, each pertaining to a\ndifferent class, i.e. alpha, delta and epsilon ganglion cells, containing a\ntotal of 34 crossings. The algorithms successfully got across all these\noverlaps. The method has also been found to exhibit robustness even for images\nwith close parallel segments. The proposed method is robust and may be\nimplemented in an efficient manner. The introduction of this approach should\npave the way for more systematic application of contour-based shape analysis\nmethods in neuronal morphology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 04:03:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 16:02:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Leandro", "J.

Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual\nscreening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence\nof seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the\nneurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by\nautomatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for\nepilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.\nTherefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal\nEEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not\naware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately\ndistinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The\nresearch presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated\ndiagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the\nperson is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for\nfurther investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop\nsuch a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build\na Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out\ncross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects\nan impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's\nEEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in\npatient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with\n96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 17:07:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Jul 2008 01:45:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bao", "Forrest Sheng", ""], ["Lie", "Donald Yu-Chun", ""], ["Zhang", "Yuanlin", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3500", "submitter": "Claudia Landi", "authors": "M. d'Amico, P.

The natural pseudo-distance is a dissimilarity measure between\nshapes, where a shape is viewed as a topological space endowed with a\nreal-valued continuous function. Measuring dissimilarity amounts to minimizing\nthe change in the functions due to the application of homeomorphisms between\ntopological spaces, with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm. In order to obtain the\nlower bound, a suitable metric between size functions, called matching\ndistance, is introduced. It compares size functions by solving an optimal\nmatching problem between countable point sets. The matching distance is shown\nto be resistant to perturbations, implying that it is always smaller than the\nnatural pseudo-distance. We also prove that the lower bound so obtained is\nsharp and cannot be improved by any other distance between size functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2008 11:25:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["d'Amico", "M.", ""], ["Frosini", "P.", ""], ["Landi", "C.", ""]]}]
