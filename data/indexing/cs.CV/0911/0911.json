Fingerprint\nrecognition has been recognized as one of the most mature and established\ntechnique among all the biometrics systems. In recent times, with fingerprint\nrecognition receiving increasingly more attention the amount of fingerprints\ncollected has been constantly creating enormous problems in storage and\ntransmission. Henceforth, the compression of fingerprints has emerged as an\nindispensable step in automated fingerprint recognition systems. Several\nresearchers have presented approaches for fingerprint image compression. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme for fingerprint image\ncompression. The presented scheme utilizes the Bezier curve representations for\neffective compression of fingerprint images. Initially, the ridges present in\nthe fingerprint image are extracted along with their coordinate values using\nthe approach presented. Subsequently, the control points are determined for all\nthe ridges by visualizing each ridge as a Bezier curve. The control points of\nall the ridges determined are stored and are used to represent the fingerprint\nimage. When needed, the fingerprint image is reconstructed from the stored\ncontrol points using Bezier curves. The quality of the reconstructed\nfingerprint is determined by a formal evaluation. The proposed scheme achieves\nconsiderable memory reduction in storing the fingerprint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2009 05:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Perumal", "Vani", ""], ["Ramaswamy", "Jagannathan", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0787", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Shailendra Singh, Sanjay Silakari", "title": "Generalized Discriminant Analysis algorithm for feature reduction in\n  Cyber Attack Detection System", "comments": "8 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 173-180, October 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.CR cs.CV cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) has provided an extremely\npowerful approach to extracting non linear features.
