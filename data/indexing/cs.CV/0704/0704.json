Although\nautomatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term\nobjective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication\nand extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a\nmajor step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality\nand the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to\naging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open\nresearch field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing\nmethods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of\nhistorical interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2007 16:26:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Likforman-Sulem", "Laurence", ""], ["Zahour", "Abderrazak", ""], ["Taconet", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3635", "submitter": "Fulufhelo Vincent Nelwamondo", "authors": "Fulufhelo Vincent Nelwamondo and Tshilidzi Marwala", "title": "Rough Sets Computations to Impute Missing Data", "comments": "19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the\nliterature.

Empirical results obtained using real data are given\nand they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing\ndata.
