If a video sequence or some training set other than the given\nlow-resolution image is available, this kind of extra information can greatly\naid in the reconstruction of the high-resolution image. The problem is\nsubstantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand.\nThe image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is\ninsufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to\noversmooth images with essentially no noise. We propose a new adaptive linear\ninterpolation method based on variational method and inspired by local linear\nembedding (LLE). The experimental result shows that our method avoids the\nproblem of oversmoothing and preserves image structures well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2007 08:41:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lian", "Heng", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1920", "submitter": "Aurelie Bugeau", "authors": "Aurelie Bugeau (IRISA), Patrick P\\'erez (IRISA)", "title": "Bandwidth selection for kernel estimation in mixed multi-dimensional\n  spaces", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV", "license": null, "abstract": "  Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major\ndrawback: the kernel bandwidth selection.

This paper\npresents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \\cite{Comaniciu03a}\nwhich was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding\nthe bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively\nfor each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth\nestimates across a predefined range of bandwidths. A pseudo balloon mean shift\nfiltering and partitioning are introduced.

Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu,\n2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph\nrepresentation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this\npaper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics\nassociated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences.\nIt enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events.\nIndeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal\nprocesses, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene.\nTherefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between\ngraph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to\nspatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental\ndefinition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern\nexamples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples,\nprobabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This\nenables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph\npatterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior\nprobabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar\nspatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image\nsequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence\nillustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2007 13:18:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Sep 2007 07:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["H\u00e9as", "Patrick", "", "IRISA"], ["Datcu", "Mihai", "", "DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen"]]}]
