However, scholarly articles frequently report important findings in\nfigures for visual impact and the contents of these figures are not indexed.\nThese contents are often invaluable to the researcher in various fields, for\nthe purposes of direct comparison with their own work. Therefore, searching for\nfigures and extracting figure data are important problems. To the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no tool to automatically extract data from figures in\ndigital documents. If we can extract data from these images automatically and\nstore them in a database, an end-user can query and combine data from multiple\ndigital documents simultaneously and efficiently. We propose a framework based\non image analysis and machine learning to extract information from 2-D plot\nimages and store them in a database. The proposed algorithm identifies a 2-D\nplot and extracts the axis labels, legend and the data points from the 2-D\nplot. We also segregate overlapping shapes that correspond to different data\npoints. We demonstrate performance of individual algorithms, using a\ncombination of generated and real-life images.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Sep 2008 14:43:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Brouwer", "William", ""], ["Kataria", "Saurabh", ""], ["Das", "Sujatha", ""], ["Mitra", "Prasenjit", ""], ["Giles", "C.
