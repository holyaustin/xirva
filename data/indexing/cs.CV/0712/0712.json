This paper describes an alternative framework for learning in visual\nobject recognition, that of learning the view-generalization function. Using\nthe view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D\nobject recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the\nneed for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view\ngeneralization functions can be computationally practical by restating two\nwidely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches,\nin a view generalization framework. The paper relates the approach to recent\nmethods for object recognition based on non-uniform blurring.
