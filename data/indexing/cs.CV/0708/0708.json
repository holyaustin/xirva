The success of the Internet made huge amounts\nof it easily available and accessible to everyone. To keep the flow of this\ninformation manageable, means for its faultless circulation and effective\nhandling have become urgently required. Considerable research efforts are\ndedicated today to address this necessity, but they are seriously hampered by\nthe lack of a common agreement about \"What is information?\" In particular, what\nis \"visual information\" - human's primary input from the surrounding world. The\nproblem is further aggravated by a long-lasting stance borrowed from the\nbiological vision research that assumes human-like information processing as an\nenigmatic mix of perceptual and cognitive vision faculties. I am trying to find\na remedy for this bizarre situation. Relying on a new definition of\n\"information\", which can be derived from Kolmogorov's compexity theory and\nChaitin's notion of algorithmic information, I propose a unifying framework for\nvisual information processing, which explicitly accounts for the perceptual and\ncognitive image processing peculiarities. I believe that this framework will be\nuseful to overcome the difficulties that are impeding our attempts to develop\nthe right model of human-like intelligent image processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2007 11:16:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Diamant", "Emanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.2432", "submitter": "Oliver Knill", "authors": "Oliver Knill and Jose Ramirez-Herran", "title": "A structure from motion inequality", "comments": "15 pages, 22 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.AI", "license": null, "abstract": "  We state an elementary inequality for the structure from motion problem for m\ncameras and n points.
