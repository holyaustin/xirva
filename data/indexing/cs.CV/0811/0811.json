This problem has been considered within\nseveral different contexts in computer science, including computer vision,\nartificial intelligence, and pseudo-Boolean optimisation. Using a connection\nbetween the expressive power of valued constraints and certain algebraic\nproperties of functions, we answer this question negatively.\n  Our results have several corollaries. First, we characterise precisely which\nsubmodular functions of arity 4 can be expressed by binary submodular\nfunctions. Next, we identify a novel class of submodular functions of arbitrary\narities which can be expressed by binary submodular functions, and therefore\nminimised efficiently using a so-called expressibility reduction to the Min-Cut\nproblem. More importantly, our results imply limitations on this kind of\nreduction and establish for the first time that it cannot be used in general to\nminimise arbitrary submodular functions. Finally, we refute a conjecture of\nPromislow and Young on the structure of the extreme rays of the cone of Boolean\nsubmodular functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Nov 2008 17:21:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zivny", "Stanislav", ""], ["Cohen", "David A.", ""], ["Jeavons", "Peter G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3301", "submitter": "Daniel Lemire", "authors": "Daniel Lemire", "title": "Faster Retrieval with a Two-Pass Dynamic-Time-Warping Lower Bound", "comments": "Accepted in Pattern Recognition on November 20th, 2008", "journal-ref": "Daniel Lemire, Faster Retrieval with a Two-Pass\n  Dynamic-Time-Warping Lower Bound, Pattern Recognition 42(9): 2169-2180 (2009)", "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2008.11.030", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a popular similarity measure between time\nseries.

The\ngeneration of the axial lines has been a key aspect of space syntax research,\nconventionally relying on hand-drawn axial lines of an urban environment, often\ncalled axial map, for urban morphological analysis. Although various attempts\nhave been made towards an automatic solution, few of them can produce the axial\nmap that consists of the least number of longest visibility lines, and none of\nthem really works for different urban environments. Our algorithms provide a\nbetter solution than existing ones.
