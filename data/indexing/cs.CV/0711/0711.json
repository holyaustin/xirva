The phenomenon on the basis of `biovielectroluminescence', satisfies\nman/microbio/megabio/computer vision (MMMCV), as a robust candidate for\nphysical and visual sciences. The general aim of this addendum is to present a\nrefined text of Sections 1-3 of that proposal and highlighting the contents of\nits Appendix in form of a `Mechanisms' Section. We then briefly remind in an\narticle aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section\n3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the\nphenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant\nrole in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis\n3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410]. It also expresses the time\nconcept in terms of causing quantized energy f(|E|) of time |t|, emit in regard\nto shortening the probability of particle loci as predictable patterns of\nparticle's un-occurred motion, a solution to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\n(HUP) into a simplistic manner. We conclude that, practical frames via a time\nalgorithm to this model, fixates such predictable patterns of motion of scenery\nbodies onto recordable observation points of a MMMCV system. It even\nsuppresses/predicts superposition phenomena coming from a human subject and/or\nother bio-subjects for any decision making event, e.g., brainwave quantum\npatterns based on vision. Maintaining the existential probability of Riemann\nsurfaces of II-time scenarios in the context of biovielectroluminescence, makes\nmotion-prediction a possibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2007 19:41:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Alipour", "Philip B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2104", "submitter": "Arthur Cunha", "authors": "Arthur Cunha, Minh Do, and Martin Vetterli", "title": "On the Information Rates of the Plenoptic Function", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Transactions in Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CV math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The {\\it plenoptic function} (Adelson and Bergen, 91) describes the visual\ninformation available to an observer at any point in space and time. Samples of\nthe plenoptic function (POF) are seen in video and in general visual content,\nand represent large amounts of information. In this paper we propose a\nstochastic model to study the compression limits of the plenoptic function. In\nthe proposed framework, we isolate the two fundamental sources of information\nin the POF: the one representing the camera motion and the other representing\nthe information complexity of the \"reality\" being acquired and transmitted. The\nsources of information are combined, generating a stochastic process that we\nstudy in detail. We first propose a model for ensembles of realities that do\nnot change over time. The proposed model is simple in that it enables us to\nderive precise coding bounds in the information-theoretic sense that are sharp\nin a number of cases of practical interest. For this simple case of static\nrealities and camera motion, our results indicate that coding practice is in\naccordance with optimal coding from an information-theoretic standpoint. The\nmodel is further extended to account for visual realities that change over\ntime. We derive bounds on the lossless and lossy information rates for this\ndynamic reality model, stating conditions under which the bounds are tight.\nExamples with synthetic sources suggest that in the presence of scene dynamics,\nsimple hybrid coding using motion/displacement estimation with DPCM performs\nconsiderably suboptimally relative to the true rate-distortion bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2007 02:54:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2007 02:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Aug 2009 18:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cunha", "Arthur", ""], ["Do", "Minh", ""], ["Vetterli", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2914", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Gidudu Anthony, Hulley Gregg and Marwala Tshilidzi", "title": "Image Classification Using SVMs: One-against-One Vs One-against-All", "comments": "Proccedings of the 28th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "license": null, "abstract": "  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a relatively new supervised classification\ntechnique to the land cover mapping community.

By their\nnature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers, however, they can be adopted to\nhandle the multiple classification tasks common in remote sensing studies. The\ntwo approaches commonly used are the One-Against-One (1A1) and One-Against-All\n(1AA) techniques. In this paper, these approaches are evaluated in as far as\ntheir impact and implication for land cover mapping. The main finding from this\nresearch is that whereas the 1AA technique is more predisposed to yielding\nunclassified and mixed pixels, the resulting classification accuracy is not\nsignificantly different from 1A1 approach.

It allows a representation of a\ngeneral class of objects including geometric patterns and images in a sparse,\nmodular, hierarchical, and recursive manner. The representation can exploit any\ncomputable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being\ncapable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly\ndictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes\nit possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows\nsimple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we\nmeasure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,\nleaving only the information in the structure.\n  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general\nobjects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that\nthe common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not\nspecified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the\nmeasure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects\nreside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that\ncharacterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to\nKolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing\nthe structure of natural numbers. Thus, the formulation gives the larger class\nof objects a meaningful measure of information that generalizes Kolmogorov\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 18:41:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Jun 2008 03:37:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ishikawa", "Hiroshi", ""]]}]
