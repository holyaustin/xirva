In this paper, we show that the LHE problem has many solutions due\nto the ambiguity in ranking pixels with the same intensity. The LHE solution\nspace can be searched for the images having the maximum PSNR or structural\nsimilarity (SSIM) with the input image. As compared to the results of the prior\nart, these solutions are more similar to the input image while offering the\nsame local contrast.\n  Index Terms: histogram modification or specification, contrast enhancement\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 10:41:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2009 10:14:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Avanaki", "Alireza", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2187", "submitter": "Joao Lima", "authors": "Joao Paulo Lima, Veronica Teichrieb, Judith Kelner", "title": "A Standalone Markerless 3D Tracker for Handheld Augmented Reality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an implementation of a markerless tracking technique\ntargeted to the Windows Mobile Pocket PC platform. The primary aim of this work\nis to allow the development of standalone augmented reality applications for\nhandheld devices based on natural feature tracking. In order to achieve this\ngoal, a subset of two computer vision libraries was ported to the Pocket PC\nplatform. They were also adapted to use fixed point math, with the purpose of\nimproving the overall performance of the routines. The port of these libraries\nopens up the possibility of having other computer vision tasks being executed\non mobile platforms. A model based tracking approach that relies on edge\ninformation was adopted. Since it does not require a high processing power, it\nis suitable for constrained devices such as handhelds. The OpenGL ES graphics\nlibrary was used to perform computer vision tasks, taking advantage of existing\ngraphics hardware acceleration. An augmented reality application was created\nusing the implemented technique and evaluations were done regarding tracking\nperformance and accuracy\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2009 18:25:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lima", "Joao Paulo", ""], ["Teichrieb", "Veronica", ""], ["Kelner", "Judith", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2788", "submitter": "Ali Pourmohammad", "authors": "Ali Pourmohammad, Seyed Mohammad Ahadi", "title": "Using SLP Neural Network to Persian Handwritten Digits Recognition", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author ali pourmohammad.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2009 21:13:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Jan 2010 10:23:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Pourmohammad", "Ali", ""], ["Ahadi", "Seyed Mohammad", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4073", "submitter": "Amelia Sparavigna", "authors": "Amelia Sparavigna", "title": "Dipole and Quadrupole Moments in Image Processing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes an algorithm for image processing, obtained by adapting\nto image maps the definitions of two well-known physical quantities.
