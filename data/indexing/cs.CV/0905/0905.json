The\ngoal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of\npoints and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other.\nMultiple factors, including an unknown non-rigid spatial transformation, large\ndimensionality of point set, noise and outliers, make the point set\nregistration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called\nthe Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and non-rigid point\nset registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability\ndensity estimation problem. We fit the GMM centroids (representing the first\npoint set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We\nforce the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the\ntopological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the\ncoherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid\nparameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM\nalgorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the\ncoherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the\nvariational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a\nfast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We\ntest the CPD algorithm for both rigid and non-rigid transformations in the\npresence of noise, outliers and missing points, where CPD shows accurate\nresults and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 22:28:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Myronenko", "Andriy", ""], ["Song", "Xubo", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2924", "submitter": "Nassir Mohammad", "authors": "Nassir Mohammad, Alexander Balinsky", "title": "Colorization of Natural Images via L1 Optimization", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "0905.2921", "categories": "cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Natural images in the colour space YUV have been observed to have a\nnon-Gaussian, heavy tailed distribution (called 'sparse') when the filter\nG(U)(r) = U(r) - sum_{s \\in N(r)} w{(Y)_{rs}} U(s), is applied to the\nchromacity channel U (and equivalently to V), where w is a weighting function\nconstructed from the intensity component Y [1].
