They have recently been applied to numerous\nproblems in machine learning and shape analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide the first algorithmic analysis of these distance\nmetrics. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) We present fast\napproximation algorithms for computing the kernel distance between two point\nsets P and Q that runs in near-linear time in the size of (P cup Q) (note that\nan explicit calculation would take quadratic time). (ii) We present\npolynomial-time algorithms for approximately minimizing the kernel distance\nunder rigid transformation; they run in time O(n + poly(1/epsilon, log n)).\n(iii) We provide several general techniques for reducing complex objects to\nconvenient sparse representations (specifically to point sets or sets of points\nsets) which approximately preserve the kernel distance. In particular, this\nallows us to reduce problems of computing the kernel distance between various\ntypes of objects such as curves, surfaces, and distributions to computing the\nkernel distance between point sets.

We redefine the voting\nrule as a strong classifier that linearly combines predictions from the k\nclosest prototypes. Weak classifiers are learned by UNN so as to minimize a\nsurrogate risk. A major feature of UNN is the ability to learn which prototypes\nare the most relevant for a given class, thus allowing one for effective data\nreduction. Experimental results on the synthetic two-class dataset of Ripley\nshow that such a filtering strategy is able to reject \"noisy\" prototypes.

A main drawback of manifold\nlearning methods is, however, that there is no explicit mappings from the input\ndata manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of\nmanifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and\ntarget detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for\nmanifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an\napproximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there\nexists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their\nlow-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too\nrestrictive.

This approach does not leads to over segmentation or under\nsegmentation. For the comparison purpose we displayed results of watershed\nsegmentation and Entropy using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix along with this\nmethod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Jan 2010 19:00:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kekre", "H.

The additional\ncapability of tracking in realtime - with minimal latency - opens up the\nexperimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing\ndetailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behavior. Here we\ndescribe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of\nanimals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec\nlatency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these\nresults, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended\nKalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association\nalgorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of\ntracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit\nnetwork of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This\nmanuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and\nshows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using\nthe tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight\nspeed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and\nfaster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful\ntool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals. If\ncombined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer\ngraphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful\nnew way to investigate the biology of flying animals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2010 01:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Straw", "Andrew D.", ""], ["Branson", "Kristin", ""], ["Neumann", "Titus R.", ""], ["Dickinson", "Michael H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5352", "submitter": "Csn  InterJRI", "authors": "K.
