Associating three color charges to each pixel, color\ndipole moments can be easily defined and used for edge detection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2009 16:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sparavigna", "Amelia", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1613", "submitter": "Andriy Myronenko", "authors": "Andriy Myronenko, Xubo Song", "title": "On the closed-form solution of the rotation matrix arising in computer\n  vision problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show the closed-form solution to the maximization of trace(A'R), where A\nis given and R is unknown rotation matrix.

The\nsuccess of boosting algorithms may be interpreted in terms of the margin\ntheory. Recently it has been shown that generalization error of classifiers can\nbe obtained by explicitly taking the margin distribution of the training data\ninto account. Most of the current boosting algorithms in practice usually\noptimizes a convex loss function and do not make use of the margin\ndistribution. In this work we design a new boosting algorithm, termed\nmargin-distribution boosting (MDBoost), which directly maximizes the average\nmargin and minimizes the margin variance simultaneously. This way the margin\ndistribution is optimized. A totally-corrective optimization algorithm based on\ncolumn generation is proposed to implement MDBoost.

Nowadays, there are many automatic systems that can\nrecognize seizure-related EEG signals to help the diagnosis. However, it is\nvery costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure\nactivities, especially in areas short of medical resources. We demonstrate in\nthis paper that we can use the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier\nto collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whether a person is\nepileptic. In our automated EEG recognition system, we extract three classes of\nfeatures from the EEG data and build Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fed\nwith these features. We optimize the feature extraction parameters and combine\nthese PNNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves an\nimpressive 94.07% accuracy, which is very close to reported human recognition\naccuracy by experienced medical professionals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 07:15:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 20:27:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bao", "Forrest Sheng", ""], ["Gao", "Jue-Ming", ""], ["Hu", "Jing", ""], ["Lie", "Donald Y. -C.", ""], ["Zhang", "Yuanlin", ""], ["Oommen", "K.
