Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of\nvirtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,\nOptical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints\nand wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were\nperformed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected\nvalues. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network\nPLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a\ncapability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired\nsetpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and\nRemaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,\nOES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production\nsetting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at\nall, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)\nwould provide important information to the operator that the process is or is\nnot producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality. Production\nyield is increased, and correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by providing\nthe operator with the opportunity to adjust the process or machine before\netching more wafers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2007 15:55:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sofge", "D.
