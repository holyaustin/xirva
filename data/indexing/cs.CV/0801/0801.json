The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained\nby rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on\nthe set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization\nproblems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on\nthe set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same\nglobal minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its\nglobal minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We therefore construct an\napproximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a\nconvex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and\nconcave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows\nto easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the\noptimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching.\nThe algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching\nmethods on four datasets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images and\nhandwritten chinese characters. In all cases, the results are competitive with\nthe state-of-the-art.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2008 20:20:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Oct 2008 14:16:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zaslavskiy", "Mikhail", ""], ["Bach", "Francis", ""], ["Vert", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.4807", "submitter": "Syed Ali Jafri", "authors": "Syed Ali Raza Jafri, Mireille Boutin, and Edward J.

But no assumption is made regarding the language or\ncharacter set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain\nsimple graphics or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first\nconcentrate on finding the background of the text, before testing whether there\nis actually text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in\nnatural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain \"holes\"\n(where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing \"holes\"\nand label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then\nfurther tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our\nmethod on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method\ncorrectly segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of\nthese were areas that do not contain text also segmented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2008 01:46:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jafri", "Syed Ali Raza", ""], ["Boutin", "Mireille", ""], ["Delp", "Edward J.", ""]]}]
