Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of\nfunctionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating\nclassical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible\n[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate\nschemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have\nnumerous applications.\n  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via\nquantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which\nencompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe\nclassical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description\nor a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of\nobfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,\nindistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three\nvariants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many\napplications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum\nfully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.\n  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of\nfoundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove\nthat quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries\ncan possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic\ntransformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits\nis impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation\nis impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse.

In this work we show two (perhaps)\nsurprising phenomena. Firstly, we demonstrate via a novel code construction\nthat if Calvin is delayed by even a single bit, i.e. Calvin's decision of\nwhether or not to erase bit $x_i$ depends only on $(x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1})$ (and\nis independent of the \"current bit\" $x_i$) then the capacity increases to $1-p$\nwhen the encoder is allowed to be stochastic. Secondly, we show via a novel\njamming strategy for Calvin that, in the single-bit-delay setting, if the\nencoding is deterministic (i.e. the transmitted codeword is a deterministic\nfunction of the message $m$) then no rate asymptotically larger than $1-2p$ is\npossible with vanishing probability of error, hence stochastic encoding (using\nprivate randomness at the encoder) is essential to achieve the capacity of\n$1-p$ against a one-bit-delayed Calvin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 15:34:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Bikash Kumar", ""], ["Jaggi", "Sidharth", ""], ["Langberg", "Michael", ""], ["Sarwate", "Anand D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.02396", "submitter": "Wouter Bokslag", "authors": "Wouter Bokslag", "title": "The problem of popular primes: Logjam", "comments": "9 pages, 1 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  This paper will discuss the Logjam attack on TLS.

This motivated the cryptographic community to search for\nquantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on\nsecret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider\nattacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic\nprimitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a\nlot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless\npossible to build secure cryptosystems in it.\n  We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the\nsimplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric\ncryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we\nshow that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be\ndramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires\n$\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen\nwith some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the\nquantum model.\n  We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most\nwidely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption\ne.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security\nmodel. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ,\nCOPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the\nsituation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are\nsecure with a quantum-secure PRF.\n  Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks,\nleading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis\ntechnique in the quantum model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 21:13:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:14:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 08:18:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kaplan", "Marc", ""], ["Leurent", "Ga\u00ebtan", ""], ["Leverrier", "Anthony", ""], ["Naya-Plasencia", "Mar\u00eda", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06006", "submitter": "Minglong Qi", "authors": "Minglong Qi, Shengwu Xiong, Jingling Yuan, Wenbi Rao, Luo Zhong", "title": "On a Class of Almost Difference Sets Constructed by Using the\n  Ding-Helleseth-Martinsens Constructions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pseudorandom binary sequences with optimal balance and autocorrelation have\nmany applications in stream cipher, communication, coding theory, etc. It is\nknown that binary sequences with three-level autocorrelation should have an\nalmost difference set as their characteristic sets.

To this end, there has\nbeen much cryptographic research proposing the use of (hierarchical)\nidentity-based encryption, attribute-based encryption, predicate encryption,\nfunctional encryption, and related technologies to perform robust and private\naccess control on untrusted cloud providers. However, the vast majority of this\nwork studies static models in which the access control policies being enforced\ndo not change over time. This is contrary to the needs of most practical\napplications, which leverage dynamic data and/or policies. In this paper, we\nshow that the cryptographic enforcement of dynamic access controls on untrusted\nplatforms incurs computational costs that are likely prohibitive in practice.\nSpecifically, we develop lightweight constructions for enforcing role-based\naccess controls (i.e., $\\mathsf{RBAC}_0$) over cloud-hosted files using\nidentity-based and traditional public-key cryptography. This is done under a\nthreat model as close as possible to the one assumed in the cryptographic\nliterature. We prove the correctness of these constructions, and leverage\nreal-world $\\mathsf{RBAC}$ datasets and recent techniques developed by the\naccess control community to experimentally analyze, via simulation, their\nassociated computational costs. This analysis shows that supporting revocation,\nfile updates, and other state change functionality is likely to incur\nprohibitive overheads in even minimally-dynamic, realistic scenarios.
