This paper unravels the pros and cons of byte-granularity\nheap randomization by conducting comprehensive analysis in three folds: (i)\nsecurity effectiveness, (ii) performance impact, and (iii) compatibility\nanalysis to measure deployment cost. Security discussion based on 20 CVE case\nstudies suggests that byte-granularity heap randomization raises the bar\nagainst heap exploits more than we initially expected; as pointer spraying\napproach is becoming prevalent in modern heap exploits. Afterward, to demystify\nthe skeptical concerns regarding misalignment, we conduct cycle-level\nmicrobenchmarks and report that the performance cost is highly concentrated to\nedge cases depending on L1-cache line. Based on such observations, we design\nand implement an allocator suited to optimize the performance cost of\nbyte-granularity heap randomization; then evaluate the performance with the\nmemory-intensive benchmark (SPEC2006). Finally, we discuss compatibility issues\nusing Coreutils, Nginx, and ChakraCore.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2018 08:34:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2018 13:18:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 07:09:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Jang", "Daehee", ""], ["Kim", "Jonghwan", ""], ["Park", "Minjoon", ""], ["Jung", "Yunjong", ""], ["Lee", "Hojoon", ""], ["Kang", "Brent Byunghoon", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.01095", "submitter": "Kai Mindermann M.Sc.", "authors": "Kai Mindermann, Stefan Wagner", "title": "Usability and Security Effects of Code Examples on Crypto APIs -\n  CryptoExamples: A platform for free, minimal, complete and secure crypto\n  examples", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context: Cryptographic APIs are said to be not usable and researchers suggest\nto add example code to the documentation.

To\naddress this need, we present a private multi-agent LQ control framework. We\nconsider problems in which each agent has linear dynamics and the agents are\ncoupled by a quadratic cost. Generating optimal control values for agents is a\ncentralized operation, and we therefore introduce a cloud computer into the\nnetwork for this purpose. The cloud is tasked with aggregating agents' outputs,\ncomputing control inputs, and transmitting these inputs to the agents, which\napply them in their state updates. Agents' state trajectories can be sensitive\nand we therefore protect them using differential privacy. Differential privacy\nis a statistical notion of privacy enforced by adding noise to sensitive data\n(or functions thereof) before sharing it, and agents add noise to all data\nbefore sending it to the cloud. The result is a private multi-agent LQG\nframework in which agents' states are protected from both the cloud and other\nagents. We quantify the impact of privacy along three dimensions: the amount of\ninformation shared under privacy, the control-theoretic cost of privacy, and\nthe tradeoffs between privacy and performance. These analyses are done in\nconventional control-theoretic terms, which we use to develop guidelines for\ncalibrating privacy as a function of system parameters.

However, even state-of-the-art fuzzers are not very efficient\nat finding hard-to-trigger software bugs. Most popular fuzzers use evolutionary\nguidance to generate inputs that can trigger different bugs. Such evolutionary\nalgorithms, while fast and simple to implement, often get stuck in fruitless\nsequences of random mutations. Gradient-guided optimization presents a\npromising alternative to evolutionary guidance. Gradient-guided techniques have\nbeen shown to significantly outperform evolutionary algorithms at solving\nhigh-dimensional structured optimization problems in domains like machine\nlearning by efficiently utilizing gradients or higher-order derivatives of the\nunderlying function. However, gradient-guided approaches are not directly\napplicable to fuzzing as real-world program behaviors contain many\ndiscontinuities, plateaus, and ridges where the gradient-based methods often\nget stuck. We observe that this problem can be addressed by creating a smooth\nsurrogate function approximating the discrete branching behavior of target\nprogram. In this paper, we propose a novel program smoothing technique using\nsurrogate neural network models that can incrementally learn smooth\napproximations of a complex, real-world program's branching behaviors. We\nfurther demonstrate that such neural network models can be used together with\ngradient-guided input generation schemes to significantly improve the fuzzing\nefficiency.

Online marketplaces and exchanges allow users across the world to\nconvert between dozens of different cryptocurrencies and regular currencies\nsuch as euros or dollars. Due to the novelty of this concept, the volatility of\nthese markets and the differences in maturity and usage of particular\nmarketplaces, currency pairs may appear at multiple marketplaces but at\ndifferent trading prices. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to\ntake advantage of these mispricings and capitalize upon the pricing differences\nthat exist between exchanges and currency pairs. To do so, we model each\ncombination of a currency and a market as one node in a graph. A directed link\nbetween two nodes indicates that a conversion between these two currency/market\npairs is possible. The weight of the link relates to the exchange rate of\nexecuting this particular currency exchange. To leverage the mispricings, we\nseek for cycles in the graph such that upon multiplying the weights of the\nlinks in the cycle, a value greater than 1 is found and thus a profit can be\nmade. Our goal is to do this efficiently, without exhaustively enumerating all\npossible cycles in the graph. Therefore, we convert our data and address the\nproblem in terms of finding minimum weight triangles in graphs with integer\nweights, for which efficient algorithms can be utilized. We experiment with\nparameter settings (heuristics) related to the conversion of exchange rate data\ninto integer weight values. We show that our approach improves upon a\nreasonable baseline algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, using\na real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the obtained minimal weight cycles\nindeed unveil a number of currency exchange cycles that result in a net profit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2018 08:07:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bortolussi", "Francesco", ""], ["Hoogeboom", "Zeger", ""], ["Takes", "Frank W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.05720", "submitter": "Araz Taeihagh", "authors": "Araz Taeihagh, Hazel Si Min Lim", "title": "Governing autonomous vehicles: emerging responses for safety, liability,\n  privacy, cybersecurity, and industry risks", "comments": "Transport Reviews, 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/01441647.2018.1494640", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.CR cs.HC cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely acknowledged, but there\nare concerns about the extent of these benefits and AV risks and unintended\nconsequences.

An adversary can build an algorithm to trace the individual members of\na model's training dataset. As a fundamental inference attack, he aims to\ndistinguish between data points that were part of the model's training set and\nany other data points from the same distribution. This is known as the tracing\n(and also membership inference) attack. In this paper, we focus on such attacks\nagainst black-box models, where the adversary can only observe the output of\nthe model, but not its parameters. This is the current setting of machine\nlearning as a service in the Internet.\n  We introduce a privacy mechanism to train machine learning models that\nprovably achieve membership privacy: the model's predictions on its training\ndata are indistinguishable from its predictions on other data points from the\nsame distribution. We design a strategic mechanism where the privacy mechanism\nanticipates the membership inference attacks. The objective is to train a model\nsuch that not only does it have the minimum prediction error (high utility),\nbut also it is the most robust model against its corresponding strongest\ninference attack (high privacy). We formalize this as a min-max game\noptimization problem, and design an adversarial training algorithm that\nminimizes the classification loss of the model as well as the maximum gain of\nthe membership inference attack against it. This strategy, which guarantees\nmembership privacy (as prediction indistinguishability), acts also as a strong\nregularizer and significantly generalizes the model.\n  We evaluate our privacy mechanism on deep neural networks using different\nbenchmark datasets.

In\nthis model, the answer strings are not returned through noiseless bit pipes,\nbut rather through \\emph{noisy} memoryless channels. We aim at characterizing\nthe PIR capacity for this model as a function of the statistical information\nmeasures of the noisy channels such as entropy and mutual information. We\nderive a general upper bound for the retrieval rate in the form of a max-min\noptimization. We use the achievable schemes for the PIR problem under\nasymmetric traffic constraints and random coding arguments to derive a general\nlower bound for the retrieval rate. The upper and lower bounds match for $M=2$\nand $M=3$, for any $N$, and any noisy channel. The results imply that\nseparation between channel coding and retrieval is optimal except for adapting\nthe traffic ratio from the databases. We refer to this as \\emph{almost\nseparation}. Next, we consider the private information retrieval problem from\nmultiple access channels (MAC-PIR). In MAC-PIR, the database responses reach\nthe user through a multiple access channel (MAC) that mixes the responses\ntogether in a stochastic way. We show that for the additive MAC and the\nconjunction/disjunction MAC, channel coding and retrieval scheme are\n\\emph{inseparable} unlike in NPIR. We show that the retrieval scheme depends on\nthe properties of the MAC, in particular on the linearity aspect. For both\ncases, we provide schemes that achieve the full capacity without any loss due\nto the privacy constraint, which implies that the user can exploit the nature\nof the channel to improve privacy. Finally, we show that the full unconstrained\ncapacity is not always attainable by determining the capacity of the selection\nchannel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2018 17:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Banawan", "Karim", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.06005", "submitter": "Mohamed Grissa", "authors": "Mohamed Grissa, Attila Yavuz, and Bechir Hamdaoui", "title": "An Efficient Technique for Protecting Location Privacy of Cooperative\n  Spectrum Sensing Users", "comments": "Published in: 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications\n  Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS), 7 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1806.00916", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562209", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cooperative spectrum sensing, despite its effectiveness in enabling dynamic\nspectrum access, suffers from location privacy threats, merely because\nsecondary users (SUs)' sensing reports that need to be shared with a fusion\ncenter to make spectrum availability decisions are highly correlated to the\nusers' locations.

Eventually, an adversary can possibly gain access to the vehicle by\nrelaying wireless signals and without any effort to generate or decode the\nsecret credentials. Hence, the vehicle to keyfob authentication scheme must\ncontain an additional attribute verification such as physical movement of a\nkeyfob holder.\n  Our solution is a two-party and three-way handshake scheme with proactive and\nreactive commitment verification.
