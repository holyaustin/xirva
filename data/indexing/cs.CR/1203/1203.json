Passive traffic analysis can link flows but requires long periods\nof observation to reduce errors. Active traffic analysis, also known as flow\nwatermarking, allows for better precision and is more scalable. Previous flow\nwatermarks introduce significant delays to the traffic flow as a side effect of\nusing a blind detection scheme; this enables attacks that detect and remove the\nwatermark, while at the same time slowing down legitimate traffic. We propose\nthe first non-blind approach for flow watermarking, called RAINBOW, that\nimproves watermark invisibility by inserting delays hundreds of times smaller\nthan previous blind watermarks, hence reduces the watermark interference on\nnetwork flows. We derive and analyze the optimum detectors for RAINBOW as well\nas the passive traffic analysis under different traffic models by using\nhypothesis testing. Comparing the detection performance of RAINBOW and the\npassive approach we observe that both RAINBOW and passive traffic analysis\nperform similarly good in the case of uncorrelated traffic, however, the\nRAINBOW detector drastically outperforms the optimum passive detector in the\ncase of correlated network flows. This justifies the use of non-blind\nwatermarks over passive traffic analysis even though both approaches have\nsimilar scalability constraints.

Our work is the first formal analysis to consider\nmessages that are sent in the core network, where we take into account details\nof the carrying protocol (i.e., MAP or Diameter) and of the mechanism for\nsecure transport (i.e., MAPsec/TCAPsec or IPsec ESP). Moreover, we report on a\ndeficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the\nspecifications of the core network security (called network domain security),\nwhich may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker\nnot only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the\nprotocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA\nrun over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward\napplication of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and\nLTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently\nlong session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication\nproperties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used\nprimitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Mar 2012 14:33:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 11:25:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tsay", "Joe-Kai", ""], ["Mj\u00f8lsnes", "Stig", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.3870", "submitter": "Maurizio Naldi", "authors": "Giuseppe D'Acquisto and Maurizio Naldi and Giuseppe F.

In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop\ncommunication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at\nthe link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of\nbeing at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an\nenergy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated.

In this paper, we analyze, propose and\nexperiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security\narchitecture for WSNs.

An effective\nanalysis of what has been traced out seems to require an additional property of\ntraces, called *normality*. We describe a modest model of network computation,\nbased on partially ordered multisets (pomsets), where basic network\ninteractions arise from the monoidal trace structure, and a normal trace\nstructure arises from an iterative, i.e. coalgebraic structure over terms and\nmessages used in computation and communication. The correspondence is\nestablished using a convenient monadic description of normally traced monoidal\ncategories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Mar 2012 17:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6622", "submitter": "Heru Susanto", "authors": "Heru Susanto, Mohammad Nabil Almunawar, Yong Chee Tuan", "title": "A Novel Method on ISO 27001 Reviews: ISMS Compliance Readiness Level\n  Measurement", "comments": "Computer Science Journal (ISSN: 2221-5905) Volume 2, Issue 1, April\n  2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Security is a hot issue to be discussed, ranging from business activities,\ncorrespondence, banking and financial activities; it requires prudence and high\nprecision.

The underlying public code is a modified\nReed-Solomon code obtained from inserting a zero submatrix in the Vandermonde\ngenerating matrix defining it. The columns that define this submatrix are kept\nsecret and form a set $L$. We give here a distinguisher that detects if one or\nseveral columns belong to $L$ or not. This distinguisher is obtained by\nconsidering the code generated by component-wise products of codewords of the\npublic code (the so called \"square code\"). This operation is applied to\npunctured versions of this square code obtained by picking a subset\n  $I$ of the whole set of columns. It turns out that the dimension of the\npunctured square code is directly related to the cardinality of the\nintersection of $I$ with $L$. This allows an attack which recovers the full set\n$L$ and which can then decrypt any ciphertext.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 23:31:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gauthier", "Val\u00e9rie", ""], ["Otmani", "Ayoub", ""], ["Tillich", "Jean-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6866", "submitter": "David Arroyo", "authors": "David Arroyo, Jesus Diaz, F.
