This allows for anonymous data to authenticate\nusers and avoids holding personal data. Utilizing a couple K-fold\ncross-validation techniques, Spy Hunter is assessed based on how often the\nsystem falsely accepts an intruder, how often the system falsely rejects a\ngenuine user, and the time it takes to validate a users identity.

Ideally, the memory access pattern of an\nORAM should be independent of the data being processed. Since the work of\nGoldreich and Ostrovsky, it was believed that there is an inherent $\n\\Omega(\\log n) $ bandwidth overhead in any ORAM working with memory of size $ n\n$. Larsen and Nielsen [CRYPTO'18] were the first to give a general $\n\\Omega(\\log n) $ lower bound for any online ORAM, i.e., an ORAM that must\nprocess its inputs in an online manner.\n  In this work, we revisit the lower bound of Larsen and Nielsen, which was\nproved under the assumption that the adversarial server knows exactly which\nserver accesses correspond to which input operation. We give an $\\Omega(\\log n)\n$ lower bound for the bandwidth overhead of any online ORAM even when the\nadversary has no access to this information. For many known constructions of\nORAM this information is provided implicitly as each input operation induces an\naccess sequence of roughly the same length. Thus, they are subject to the lower\nbound of Larsen and Nielsen. Our results rule out a broader class of\nconstructions and specifically, they imply that obfuscating the boundaries\nbetween the input operations does not help in building a more efficient ORAM.\n  As our main technical contribution and to handle the lack of structure, we\nstudy the properties of access graphs induced naturally by the memory access\npattern of an ORAM computation.

Unless carefully\ndefined, however, such rules can easily become points of security failure as\nthe number of devices and complexity of rules increase. Device owners may end\nup unintentionally providing access or revealing private information to\nunauthorized entities due to complex chain reactions among devices. Prior work\non trigger-action programming either focuses on conflict resolution or\nusability issues, or fails to accurately and efficiently detect such attack\nchains. This paper explores security vulnerabilities when users have the\nfreedom to customize automation rules using trigger-action programming. We\ndefine two broad classes of attack--privilege escalation and privacy\nleakage--and present a practical model-checking-based system called SAFECHAIN\nthat detects hidden attack chains exploiting the combination of rules. Built\nupon existing model-checking techniques, SAFECHAIN identifies attack chains by\nmodeling the IoT ecosystem as a Finite State Machine. To improve\npracticability, SAFECHAIN avoids the need to accurately model an environment by\nfrequently re-checking the automation rules given the current states, and\nemploys rule-aware optimizations to further reduce overhead. Our comparative\nanalysis shows that SAFECHAIN can efficiently and accurately identify attack\nchains, and our prototype implementation of SAFECHAIN can verify 100 rules in\nless than one second with no false positives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Mar 2019 08:18:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hsu", "Kai-Hsiang", ""], ["Chiang", "Yu-Hsi", ""], ["Hsiao", "Hsu-Chun", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.03802", "submitter": "Bao Trung Chu", "authors": "Bao Trung Chu, Kenji Hashimoto and Hiroyuki Seki", "title": "Quantifying Dynamic Leakage: Complexity Analysis and Model\n  Counting-based Calculation", "comments": "will be revised to submit to IEICE Transaction on Information and\n  Systems in near future", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1587/transinf.2019EDP7132", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A program is non-interferent if it leaks no secret information to an\nobservable output.

In this paper, we propose new simple notions of dynamic\nleakage based on entropy which are compatible with existing QIF definitions for\ndeterministic programs, and yet reasonable for probabilistic programs in the\nsense of [5]. We also investigated the complexity of computing the proposed\ndynamic leakage for three classes of Boolean programs.

To evaluate the FRS feature selection in developing a generalizable\nphishing detection, the classifiers are trained by a separate out-of-sample\ndata set of 14,000 website samples. The maximum F-measure gained by FRS feature\nselection is 95% using Random Forest classification. Also, there are 9\nuniversal features selected by FRS over all the three data sets. The F-measure\nvalue using this universal feature set is approximately 93% which is a\ncomparable result in contrast to the FRS performance. Since the universal\nfeature set contains no features from third-part services, this finding implies\nthat with no inquiry from external sources, we can gain a faster phishing\ndetection which is also robust toward zero-day attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2019 18:48:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zabihimayvan", "Mahdieh", ""], ["Doran", "Derek", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05700", "submitter": "Ethan Rudd", "authors": "Ethan M.

On the other hand, the operation model for existing\nDDoS-prevention service providers (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) is privacy\ninvasive for large organizations (e.g., government). In this paper, we present\nUmbrella, a new DDoS defense mechanism enabling Internet Service Providers\n(ISPs) to offer readily deployable and privacy-preserving DDoS prevention\nservices to their customers. At its core, Umbrella develops a multi-layered\ndefense architecture to defend against a wide spectrum of DDoS attacks. In\nparticular, the flood throttling layer stops amplification-based DDoS attacks;\nthe congestion resolving layer, aiming to prevent sophisticated attacks that\ncannot be easily filtered, enforces congestion accountability to ensure that\nlegitimate flows are guaranteed to receive their fair shares regardless of\nattackers' strategies; and finally the userspecific layer allows DDoS victims\nto enforce self-desired traffic control policies that best satisfy their\nbusiness requirements. Based on Linux implementation, we demonstrate that\nUmbrella is capable to deal with large scale attacks involving millions of\nattack flows, meanwhile imposing negligible packet processing overhead.\nFurther, our physical testbed experiments and large scale simulations prove\nthat Umbrella is effective to mitigate various DDoS attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 02:24:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2019 10:08:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 6 Apr 2019 08:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Zhuotao", ""], ["Cao", "Yuan", ""], ["Zhu", "Min", ""], ["Ge", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.07889", "submitter": "Yijie Li", "authors": "Li Yijie, Zhai Shang, Chen Mingrui", "title": "DDoS attack detection method based on feature extraction of deep belief\n  network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is one of the most common network\nattacks.

Finally, simulation and experimentation on an experimental software\ndefined network (SDN) indicate that our approach imposes an acceptable\nshuffling overload and is effective in mitigating DDoS attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2019 02:12:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2019 18:38:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 18 Sep 2019 01:47:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Yuyang", ""], ["Cheng", "Guang", ""], ["Jiang", "Shanqing", ""], ["Hu", "Ying", ""], ["Zhao", "Yuyu", ""], ["Chen", "Zihan", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.10209", "submitter": "Seunghoan Song", "authors": "Seunghoan Song and Masahito Hayashi", "title": "Capacity of Quantum Private Information Retrieval with Multiple Servers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 67, no. 1, pp.\n  452-463, Jan. 2021", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2020.3022515.", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the capacity of quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) with\nmultiple servers.

This complexity can be mitigated\nusing optimization-based methods that relax the original state estimation\nproblem, although at the cost of optimality as these methods often identify\nattack-free sensors as attacked.

In this\npaper we propose to address the most critical issue of backdoors: mathematical\nbackdoors or by-design backdoors, which are put directly at the mathematical\ndesign of the encryption algorithm. Considering a particular family (among all\nthe possible ones) of backdoors, we present BSEA-1, a stream cipher algorithm\nwhich contains a design backdoor enabling an effective cryptanalysis. The\nBSEA-1 algorithm uses a 120-bit key. The exploitation of the backdoor enables\nto break the cipher with around 2 Kbits of knowplaintext in a few seconds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:43:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Filiol", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.11092", "submitter": "Sibylle Schupp", "authors": "Sibylle Schupp", "title": "Tool Support of Formal Methods for Privacy by Design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Formal methods are, in principle, suited for supporting the recent paradigm\nof privacy by design, but no overview is available that summarizes which\nparticular approaches have been investigated, for which application domains\nthey are suited, and whether they are implemented and available as tools.
