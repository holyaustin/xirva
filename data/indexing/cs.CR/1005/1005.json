The framework costs six communication rounds and costs at most\n$40n$ public-key operations in computational overhead. Compared with the known\nprotocols for fully-simulatable oblivious transfer that works in the plain mode\n(where there is no trusted common reference string available) and proven to be\nsecure under standard model (where there is no random oracle available), the\ninstantiation based on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption of the\nframework is the most efficient one, no matter seen from communication rounds\nor computational overhead.\n  Our framework uses three abstract tools, i.e., perfectly binding commitment,\nperfectly hiding commitment and our new smooth projective hash. This allows a\nsimple and intuitive understanding of its security.\n  We instantiate the new smooth projective hash under the lattice assumption,\nthe decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, the decisional $N$-th residuosity\nassumption, the decisional quadratic residuosity assumption. This indeed shows\nthat the folklore that it is technically difficult to instantiate the\nprojective hash framework under the lattice assumption is not true. What's\nmore, by using this lattice-based hash and lattice-based commitment scheme, we\ngain a concrete protocol for $OT^{n}_{h}$ which is secure against quantum\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 May 2010 03:45:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Jan 2011 15:10:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 00:44:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zeng", "Bing", ""], ["Tang", "Xueming", ""], ["Hsu", "Chingfang", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0053", "submitter": "Pino Caballero-Gil", "authors": "A.

The\nscale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate\nthe use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves.

The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are\nusually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability\nrequires significant effort in showing that the rules are \"local\" in some\nsense.

However, for practical purposes, it is\nuseful to have explicit bounds for the complexity of enforcement schemes.\n  In this paper, we consider interval-based access control policies, of which\ntemporal and geo-spatial access control policies are special cases. We define\nenforcement schemes for interval-based access control policies for which it is\npossible, in almost all cases, to obtain exact values for the schemes'\ncomplexity, thereby subsuming a substantial body of work in the literature.\nMoreover, our enforcement schemes are more practical than existing schemes, in\nthe sense that they operate in the same way as standard cryptographic\nenforcement schemes, unlike other efficient schemes in the literature. The main\ndifference between our approach and earlier work is that we develop techniques\nthat are specific to the cryptographic enforcement of interval-based access\ncontrol policies, rather than applying generic techniques that give rise to\ncomplex constructions and asymptotic bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2010 06:30:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2011 09:50:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Crampton", "Jason", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5020", "submitter": "Shailesh Vaya", "authors": "Shailesh Vaya", "title": "(Unconditional) Secure Multiparty Computation with Man-in-the-middle\n  Attacks", "comments": "19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In secure multi-party computation $n$ parties jointly evaluate an $n$-variate\nfunction $f$ in the presence of an adversary which can corrupt up till $t$\nparties. Almost all the works that have appeared in the literature so far\nassume the presence of authenticated channels between the parties. This\nassumption is far from realistic. Two directions of research have been borne\nfrom relaxing this (strong) assumption: (a) The adversary is virtually\nomnipotent and can control all the communication channels in the network, (b)\nOnly a partially connected topology of authenticated channels is guaranteed and\nadversary controls a subset of the communication channels in the network.\n  This work introduces a new setting for (unconditional) secure multiparty\ncomputation problem which is an interesting intermediate model with respect to\nthe above well studied models from the literature (by sharing a salient feature\nfrom both the above models). We consider the problem of (unconditional) secure\nmulti-party computation when 'some' of the communication channels connecting\nthe parties can be corrupted passively as well as actively. For this setting,\nsome honest parties may be connected to several other honest parties via\ncorrupted channels and may not be able to authentically communicate with them.\nSuch parties may not be assured the canonical guarantees of correctness or\nprivacy. We present refined definitions of security for this new intermediate\nmodel of unconditional multiparty computation. We show how to adapt protocols\nfor (Unconditional) secure multiparty computation to realize the definitions\nand also argue the tightness of the results achieved by us.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2010 10:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Vaya", "Shailesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5028", "submitter": "Secretary Aircc Journal", "authors": "Rajesh P Singh, Anupam Saikia, B.

We first characterize the underlying\ninformation theoretic limits, under different assumptions on the channel\nspatial and temporal correlation function. Our analysis reveals a novel role of\n\"dumb antennas\" in overcoming the negative impact of spatial correlation on the\nachievable secrecy rates. We further develop an adaptive rate allocation\npolicy, which achieves higher secrecy rates in temporally correlated channels,\nand explicit constructions for ARQ secrecy coding that enjoy low implementation\ncomplexity. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a unified\nframework for ARQ-based secrecy in Wi-Fi networks. By exploiting the existing\nARQ mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard, we develop security overlays that\noffer strong security guarantees at the expense of only minor modifications in\nthe medium access layer. Our numerical results establish the achievability of\nnon-zero secrecy rates even when the eavesdropper channel is less noisy, on the\naverage, than the legitimate channel, while our linux-based prototype\ndemonstrates the efficiency of our ARQ overlays in mitigating all known,\npassive and active, Wi-Fi attacks at the expense of a minimal increase in the\nlink setup time and a small loss in throughput.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2010 13:18:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2010 14:11:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Abdallah", "Yara", ""], ["Latif", "Mohamed Abdel", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""], ["Sultan", "Ahmed", ""], ["Gamal", "Hesham El", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5553", "submitter": "Yevhen (Eugene) Vasiliu", "authors": "Oleksandr Korchenko, Yevhen Vasiliu, Sergiy Gnatyuk", "title": "Modern Quantum Technologies of Information Security", "comments": "11 pages, 3 figures, 80 references, text is corrected", "journal-ref": "Aviation.
