The\nability to reason about and assess the potential risks in carrying out such\ntransactions is essential for providing a safe and reliable environment. A\ntraditional approach to reason about the trustworthiness of a transaction is to\ndetermine the trustworthiness of the specific agent involved, derived from the\nhistory of its behavior. As a departure from such traditional trust models, we\npropose a generic, machine learning approach based trust framework where an\nagent uses its own previous transactions (with other agents) to build a\nknowledge base, and utilize this to assess the trustworthiness of a transaction\nbased on associated features, which are capable of distinguishing successful\ntransactions from unsuccessful ones. These features are harnessed using\nappropriate machine learning algorithms to extract relationships between the\npotential transaction and previous transactions. The trace driven experiments\nusing real auction dataset show that this approach provides good accuracy and\nis highly efficient compared to other trust mechanisms, especially when\nhistorical information of the specific agent is rare, incomplete or inaccurate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2011 06:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Xin", ""], ["Tredan", "Gilles", ""], ["Datta", "Anwitaman", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0220", "submitter": "Tigran Avanesov", "authors": "Tigran Avanesov, Yannick Chevalier, Micha\\\"el Rusinowitch and Mathieu\n  Turuani", "title": "Satisfiability of General Intruder Constraints with and without a Set\n  Constructor", "comments": "Submitted to the Special issue of Information and Computation on\n  Security and Rewriting Techniques (SecReT), 2011. 59 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many decision problems on security protocols can be reduced to solving\nso-called intruder constraints in Dolev Yao model.

Moreover, sub-optimal beamforming weights\nare obtained by completely eliminating the co-channel interference and nulling\nthe eavesdroppers' signal simultaneously.

Then, we consider\nthe utility of the randomization mechanism, which represents how close the\nrandomized answers are, in average, to the real ones. We show that the notion\nof differential privacy implies a bound on utility, also tight, and we propose\na method that under certain conditions builds an optimal randomization\nmechanism, i.e. a mechanism which provides the best utility while guaranteeing\ndifferential privacy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Mar 2011 06:41:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 00:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2011 04:12:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", ""], ["Andr\u00e9s", "Miguel E.", ""], ["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Degano", "Pierpaolo", ""], ["Palamidessi", "Catuscia", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5197", "submitter": "Parisa Babaheidarian", "authors": "Parisa Babaheidarian and Somayeh Salimi and Mohammad Reza Aref", "title": "A New Secret key Agreement Scheme in a Four-Terminal Network", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new scenario for generating a secret key and two private keys among three\nTerminals in the presence of an external eavesdropper is considered.

In this paper, a new information entropy-based\nrandomness measurement for image encryption is introduced which, for the first\ntime, answers the question of whether a given ciphertext image is sufficiently\nrandom-like. It measures the randomness over the ciphertext in a fairer way by\ncalculating the averaged entropy of a series of small image blocks within the\nentire test image. In order to fulfill both quantitative and qualitative\nmeasurement, the expectation and the variance of this averaged block entropy\nfor a true-random image are strictly derived and corresponding numerical\nreference tables are also provided. Moreover, a hypothesis test at\nsignificance-level is given to help accept or reject the hypothesis that the\ntest image is ideally encrypted/random-like. Simulation results show that the\nproposed test is able to give both effectively quantitative and qualitative\nresults for image encryption. The same idea can also be applied to measure\nother digital data, like audio and video.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2011 00:55:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Yue", ""], ["Noonan", "Joseph P.", ""], ["Agaian", "Sos", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5589", "submitter": "Hossein Jadidoleslamy", "authors": "Shahriar Mohammadi and Hossein Jadidoleslamy", "title": "A Comparison of Link Layer Attacks on Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "22 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, International journal on applications\n  of graph theory in wireless ad hoc networks and sensor networks(GRAPH-HOC)\n  Vol.3, No.1, March 2011", "journal-ref": "International journal on applications of graph theory in wireless\n  ad hoc networks and sensor networks (GRAPH-HOC) Vol.3, No.1, March 2011", "doi": "10.5121/jgraphhoc.2011.3103", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have many potential applications [1, 5] and\nunique challenges. They usually consist of hundreds or thousands small sensor\nnodes such as MICA2, which operate autonomously; conditions such as cost,\ninvisible deployment and many application domains, lead to small size and\nlimited resources sensors [2]. WSNs are susceptible to many types of link layer\nattacks [1] and most of traditional networks security techniques are unusable\non WSNs [2]; due to wireless and shared nature of communication channel,\nuntrusted transmissions, deployment in open environments, unattended nature and\nlimited resources [1]. So, security is a vital requirement for these networks;\nbut we have to design a proper security mechanism that attends to WSN's\nconstraints and requirements. In this paper, we focus on security of WSNs,\ndivide it (the WSNs security) into four categories and will consider them,\ninclude: an overview of WSNs, security in WSNs, the threat model on WSNs, a\nwide variety of WSNs' link layer attacks and a comparison of them. This work\nenables us to identify the purpose and capabilities of the attackers; also, the\ngoal and effects of the link layer attacks on WSNs are introduced. Also, this\npaper discusses known approaches of security detection and defensive mechanisms\nagainst the link layer attacks; this would enable it security managers to\nmanage the link layer attacks of WSNs more effectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2011 10:22:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mohammadi", "Shahriar", ""], ["Jadidoleslamy", "Hossein", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5712", "submitter": "Rohith Reddy Singi Reddy", "authors": "Rohith Singi Reddy", "title": "Key Management in Wireless Sensor Networks Using a Modified Blom Scheme", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Key establishment between any pair of nodes is an essential requirement for\nproviding secure services in wireless sensor networks.

To\nthis end, a secret key is shared between both encryption and decryption sides.\nFirstly two dimensional (2-D) keyed discrete Fourier transform is carried out\non the original image to be encrypted. Secondly crossover is performed between\ntwo components of the encrypted image, which are selected based on Linear\nFeedback Shift Register (LFSR) index generator. Similarly, keyed mutation is\nperformed on the real parts of a certain components selected based on LFSR\nindex generator. The LFSR index generator initializes it seed with the shared\nsecret key to ensure the security of the resulting indices. The process\nshuffles the positions of image pixels. A new image encryption scheme based on\nthe DE approach is developed which is composed with a simple diffusion\nmechanism. The deciphering process is an invertible process using the same key.\nThe resulting encrypted image is found to be fully distorted, resulting in\nincreasing the robustness of the proposed work.
