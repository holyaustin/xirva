We propose several candidate\nauthentication protocols for a setting in which the human user can only receive\nassistance from a semi-trusted computer --- a computer that stores information\nand performs computations correctly but does not provide confidentiality. Our\nschemes use a semi-trusted computer to store and display public challenges\n$C_i\\in[n]^k$. The human user memorizes a random secret mapping\n$\\sigma:[n]\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_d$ and authenticates by computing responses\n$f(\\sigma(C_i))$ to a sequence of public challenges where\n$f:\\mathbb{Z}_d^k\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a function that is easy for the\nhuman to evaluate. We prove that any statistical adversary needs to sample\n$m=\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{s(f)})$ challenge-response pairs to recover $\\sigma$, for\na security parameter $s(f)$ that depends on two key properties of $f$. To\nobtain our results, we apply the general hypercontractivity theorem to lower\nbound the statistical dimension of the distribution over challenge-response\npairs induced by $f$ and $\\sigma$. Our lower bounds apply to arbitrary\nfunctions $f $ (not just to functions that are easy for a human to evaluate),\nand generalize recent results of Feldman et al. As an application, we propose a\nfamily of human computable password functions $f_{k_1,k_2}$ in which the user\nneeds to perform $2k_1+2k_2+1$ primitive operations (e.g., adding two digits or\nremembering $\\sigma(i)$), and we show that $s(f) = \\min\\{k_1+1, (k_2+1)/2\\}$.\nFor these schemes, we prove that forging passwords is equivalent to recovering\nthe secret mapping. Thus, our human computable password schemes can maintain\nstrong security guarantees even after an adversary has observed the user login\nto many different accounts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 20:11:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 20:06:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 20:08:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 21:29:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Blocki", "Jeremiah", ""], ["Blum", "Manuel", ""], ["Datta", "Anupam", ""], ["Vempala", "Santosh", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0390", "submitter": "Sebastiano Vigna", "authors": "Sebastiano Vigna", "title": "Further scramblings of Marsaglia's xorshift generators", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1402.6246", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CR cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  xorshift* generators are a variant of Marsaglia's xorshift generators that\neliminate linear artifacts typical of generators based on $\\mathbf Z/2\\mathbf\nZ$-linear operations using multiplication by a suitable constant.

This is particularly true for very\nlarge projects running over many years. This paper addresses the issues raised\nby those risk assessment studies performed early in the system's development\nlife-cycle. Based on industrial experience, it asserts that attack trees can\nhelp solve the human cognitive scalability issue related to securing those\nlarge, continuously-changing system-designs. However, big attack trees are\ndifficult to build, and even more difficult to maintain. This paper therefore\nproposes a systematic approach to automate the construction and maintenance of\nsuch big attack trees, based on the system's operational and logical\narchitectures, the system's traditional risk assessment study and a security\nknowledge database.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Apr 2014 01:46:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Paul", "St\u00e9phane", "", "Thales Research & Technology"]]}, {"id": "1404.1987", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Thomas Bauereiss, Dieter Hutter", "title": "Possibilistic Information Flow Control for Workflow Management Systems", "comments": "In Proceedings GraMSec 2014, arXiv:1404.1634", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 148, 2014, pp. 47-62", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.148.4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In workflows and business processes, there are often security requirements on\nboth the data, i.e. confidentiality and integrity, and the process, e.g.\nseparation of duty.

In\ncurrent services, users however have to give up their location privacy in order\nto acquire the service. The literature features a large number of contributions\nwhich aim at enhancing user privacy in location-based services. Most of these\ncontributions obfuscate the locations of users using spatial and/or temporal\ncloaking in order to provide k-anonymity. Although such schemes can indeed\nstrengthen the location privacy of users, they often decrease the service\nquality and do not necessarily prevent the possible tracking of user movements\n(i.e., direction, trajectory, velocity). With the rise of Geofencing\napplications, tracking of movements becomes more evident since, in these\nsettings, the service provider is not only requesting a single location of the\nuser, but requires the movement vectors of users to determine whether the user\nhas entered/exited a Geofence of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsolution, PrivLoc, which enables the privacy-preserving outsourcing of\nGeofencing and location-based services to the cloud without leaking any\nmeaningful information about the location, trajectory, and velocity of the\nusers. Notably, PrivLoc enables an efficient and privacy-preserving\nintersection of movement vectors with any polygon of interest, leveraging\nfunctionality from existing Geofencing services or spatial databases.

The recently identified\ncoordinated data injection attacks to meter measurements can bypass the current\nsecurity system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional\nwisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing meter measurements to evade\nmalicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend\nagainst false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological\ninformation. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from\nattackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set\nof state variables.

Based on the arguments, we\ncharacterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables\nwith minimum cost, as a well-studied Steiner tree problem in a graph. Besides,\nwe also propose a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of\ncovert topological information and secure meter measurements when either method\nalone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective. A mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed\ndefending strategy. To tackle the NP-hardness of the problem, a tree\npruning-based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution\nin polynomial time.

In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these\ntwo channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the\nconverse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to\nsecrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region\nclose to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to\nsecrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper\nbounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,\nin order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the\nIC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not\nillustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,\nwe use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,\nwe develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope\nregion given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC\nregion are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,\nby setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure\n(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are\nachieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N\nexternal eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in\nthis paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of\nthe s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC\nand IC channel models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:45:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Jianwei", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7516", "submitter": "Felipe Lacerda", "authors": "Felipe G.
