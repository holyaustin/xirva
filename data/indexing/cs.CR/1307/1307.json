The results show that even for high values of noise variance\nsigma=1 the clustering quality given by normalized mutual information gain is\nas low as 0.74. For influential node discovery, the propose approach is able to\ncorrectly recover 80 of the most influential nodes.

Once a privacy model has been selected, the goal is to enforce it\nwhile preserving as much data utility as possible. The main objective of this\nthesis is to improve the data utility in k-anonymous and differentially private\ndata releases. k-Anonymity has several drawbacks. On the disclosure limitation\nside, there is a lack of protection against attribute disclosure and against\ninformed intruders. On the data utility side, dealing with a large number of\nquasi-identifier attributes is problematic. We propose a relaxation of\nk-anonymity that deals with these issues.\n  Differential privacy limits disclosure risk through noise addition. The\nLaplace distribution is commonly used for the random noise. We show that the\nLaplace distribution is not optimal: the same disclosure limitation guarantee\ncan be attained by adding less noise. Optimal univariate and multivariate\nnoises are characterized and constructed.\n  Common mechanisms to attain differential privacy do not take into account the\nusers prior knowledge; they implicitly assume zero initial knowledge about the\nquery response. We propose a mechanism that focuses on limiting the knowledge\ngain over the prior knowledge.\n  Microaggregation-based k-anonymity and differential privacy can be combined\nto produce microdata releases with the strong privacy guarantees of\ndifferential privacy and improved data accuracy.\n  The last contribution delves into the relation between t-closeness and\ndifferential privacy.

With the recent popularity of cloud\ncomputing, users now have the opportunity to outsource their data as well as\nthe data management tasks to the cloud. However, due to the rise of various\nprivacy issues, sensitive data (e.g., medical records) need to be encrypted\nbefore outsourcing to the cloud. In addition, query processing tasks should be\nhandled by the cloud; otherwise, there would be no point to outsource the data\nat the first place. To process queries over encrypted data without the cloud\never decrypting the data is a very challenging task. In this paper, we focus on\nsolving the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) query problem over encrypted database\noutsourced to a cloud: a user issues an encrypted query record to the cloud,\nand the cloud returns the k closest records to the user. We first present a\nbasic scheme and demonstrate that such a naive solution is not secure. To\nprovide better security, we propose a secure kNN protocol that protects the\nconfidentiality of the data, user's input query, and data access patterns.\nAlso, we empirically analyze the efficiency of our protocols through various\nexperiments. These results indicate that our secure protocol is very efficient\non the user end, and this lightweight scheme allows a user to use any mobile\ndevice to perform the kNN query.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jul 2013 03:36:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Elmehdwi", "Yousef", ""], ["Samanthula", "Bharath K.", ""], ["Jiang", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.4974", "submitter": "Jeremy Berthomieu", "authors": "J\\'er\\'emy Berthomieu (LIP6, Syst\\`emes Polynomiaux / Inria - LIP6),\n  Jean-Charles Faug\\`ere (Syst\\`emes Polynomiaux / Inria - LIP6, LIP6), Ludovic\n  Perret (LIP6, Syst\\`emes Polynomiaux / Inria - LIP6)", "title": "Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Quadratic Isomorphism of Polynomials: The\n  Regular Case", "comments": "Published in Journal of Complexity, Elsevier, 2015, pp.39", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jco.2015.04.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SC cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $\\mathbf{f}=(f\\_1,\\ldots,f\\_m)$ and $\\mathbf{g}=(g\\_1,\\ldots,g\\_m)$ be\ntwo sets of $m\\geq 1$ nonlinear polynomials over $\\mathbb{K}[x\\_1,\\ldots,x\\_n]$\n($\\mathbb{K}$ being a field).

We also develop a method to estimate the\ndirection of movement of a person from the sequence of link lines crossed\nduring a short time interval. Additionally, we describe how an attacker may\nestimate any artificial changes in transmit power (used as a countermeasure),\ncompensate for these power changes using measurements from sufficient number of\nlinks, and still detect line crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi\nand ZigBee nodes and experimentally evaluate the ERW attack by monitoring\npeople movements through walls in two real-world settings. We find that our\nmethods achieve very high accuracy in detecting line crossings and determining\ndirection of motion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 08:08:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Arijit", ""], ["Maas", "Dustin", ""], ["Bocca", "Maurizio", ""], ["Patwari", "Neal", ""], ["Kasera", "Sneha", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7286", "submitter": "Harjinder Kaur Miss", "authors": "Harjinder Kaur, Gurpreet Singh, Jaspreet Minhas", "title": "A Review of Machine Learning based Anomaly Detection Techniques", "comments": "3 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1204.6416 by other\n  authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Intrusion detection is so much popular since the last two decades where\nintrusion is attempted to break into or misuse the system.

A natural way to address this issue is as an attack\nplanning problem. In this thesis, we are concerned with the specific context of\nregular automated pentesting, and use the term \"attack planning\" in that sense.\nThe following three research directions are investigated.\n  First, we introduce a conceptual model of computer network attacks, based on\nan analysis of the penetration testing practices. We study how this attack\nmodel can be represented in the PDDL language. Then we describe an\nimplementation that integrates a classical planner with a penetration testing\ntool. This allows us to automatically generate attack paths for real world\npentesting scenarios, and to validate these attacks by executing them.\n  Secondly, we present efficient probabilistic planning algorithms,\nspecifically designed for this problem, that achieve industrial-scale runtime\nperformance (able to solve scenarios with several hundred hosts and exploits).\nThese algorithms take into account the probability of success of the actions\nand their expected cost (for example in terms of execution time, or network\ntraffic generated).\n  Finally, we take a different direction: instead of trying to improve the\nefficiency of the solutions developed, we focus on improving the model of the\nattacker. We model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable\nMarkov decision processes (POMDP). This grounds penetration testing in a\nwell-researched formalism.

Specifically, the source may\nselect several relays to help forward the signal to the corresponding\ndestination to achieve the best security performance.

As a proof of concept we have experimented our\nproposed architecture to detect a renegotiation vulnerability on some\nimplementations of SSL/TLS, a protocol widely used for securing electronic\ntransactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 03:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ghabri", "Hatem", "", "Sup Com, Tunis"], ["Maatoug", "Ghazi", "", "Sup Com, Tunis"], ["Rusinowitch", "Michael", "", "INRIA Nancy Grand Est"]]}, {"id": "1307.8322", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Ryma Abassi (University of Carthage, sup'com), Sihem Guemara El Fatmi\n  (University of Carthage, sup'com)", "title": "Delegation Management Modeling in a Security Policy based Environment", "comments": "In Proceedings SCSS 2012, arXiv:1307.8029", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 122, 2013, pp. 85-95", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.122.8", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Security Policies (SP) constitute the core of communication networks\nprotection infrastructures. It offers a set of rules allowing differentiating\nbetween legitimate actions and prohibited ones and consequently, associates\neach entity in the network with a set of permissions and privileges. Moreover,\nin today's technological society and to allow applications perpetuity,\ncommunication networks must support the collaboration between entities to face\nup any unavailability or flinching. This collaboration must be governed by\nsecurity mechanisms according to the established permissions and privileges.\nDelegation is a common practice that is used to simplify the sharing of\nresponsibilities and privileges. The delegation process in a SP environment can\nbe implanted through the use of adequate formalisms and modeling. The main\ncontribution of this paper is then, the proposition of a generic and formal\nmodeling of delegation process. This modeling is based on three steps composing\nthe delegation life cycle: negotiation used for delegation initiation,\nverification of the SP respect while delegating and revocation of an\nestablished delegation. Hence, we propose to deal with each step according to\nthe main delegation characteristics and extend them by some new specificities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 13:54:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Abassi", "Ryma", "", "University of Carthage, sup'com"], ["Fatmi", "Sihem Guemara El", "", "University of Carthage, sup'com"]]}]
