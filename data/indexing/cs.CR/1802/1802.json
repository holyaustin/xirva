We argue\nthat such attacks would require cyber-physical botnets. A cyber-physical botnet\nneeds coordinated and heterogeneous bots, capable of performing adversarial\ncontrol strategies while subject to the constraints of the target CPS. In this\nwork, we present CPSBot, a framework to build cyber-physical botnets.

From simulation results, we find the\nfollowing facts: in the medium and high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions,\ncompared with three typical PA parameters such $\\beta=0.1, 0.5$, and $0.9$, the\noptimal PA shows a substantial SR performance gain with maximum gain percent up\nto more than $60\\%$. Additionally, as the PA factor increases from 0 to 1, the\nachievable SR increases accordingly in the low SNR region whereas it first\nincreases and then decreases in the medium and high SNR regions, where the SR\ncan be approximately viewed as a convex function of the PA factor. Finally, as\nthe number of antennas increases, the optimal PA factor becomes large and tends\nto one in the medium and high SNR region.

A server offering Recommendation as a Service to a\nclient might leak more information than necessary regarding its recommendation\nmodel and dataset. At the same time, the disclosure of the client's preferences\nto the server is also a matter of concern. Devising privacy-preserving\nprotocols using general cryptographic primitives (e.g., secure multi-party\ncomputation or homomorphic encryption), is a typical approach to overcome\nprivacy concerns, but in conjunction with state-of-the-art recommender systems\noften yields far-from-practical solutions.\n  In this paper, we tackle this problem from the direction of constructing\ncrypto-friendly machine learning algorithms. In particular, we propose\nCryptoRec, a secure two-party computation protocol for Recommendation as a\nService, which encompasses a novel recommender system. This model possesses two\ninteresting properties: (1) It models user-item interactions in an item-only\nlatent feature space in which personalized user representations are\nautomatically captured by an aggregation of pre-learned item features. This\nmeans that a server with a pre-trained model can provide recommendations for a\nclient whose data is not in its training set. Nevertheless, re-training the\nmodel with the client's data still improves accuracy. (2) It only uses addition\nand multiplication operations, making the model straightforwardly compatible\nwith homomorphic encryption schemes.\n  We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of CryptoRec on three real-world\ndatasets.

It is imperative to detect them in a timely manner. Traditionally,\nthis is done through the usage of blacklists, which cannot be exhaustive, and\ncannot detect newly generated malicious URLs. To address this, recent years\nhave witnessed several efforts to perform Malicious URL Detection using Machine\nLearning. The most popular and scalable approaches use lexical properties of\nthe URL string by extracting Bag-of-words like features, followed by applying\nmachine learning models such as SVMs. There are also other features designed by\nexperts to improve the prediction performance of the model. These approaches\nsuffer from several limitations: (i) Inability to effectively capture semantic\nmeaning and sequential patterns in URL strings; (ii) Requiring substantial\nmanual feature engineering; and (iii) Inability to handle unseen features and\ngeneralize to test data. To address these challenges, we propose URLNet, an\nend-to-end deep learning framework to learn a nonlinear URL embedding for\nMalicious URL Detection directly from the URL. Specifically, we apply\nConvolutional Neural Networks to both characters and words of the URL String to\nlearn the URL embedding in a jointly optimized framework. This approach allows\nthe model to capture several types of semantic information, which was not\npossible by the existing models. We also propose advanced word-embeddings to\nsolve the problem of too many rare words observed in this task.

We then\npropose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify\nan assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic\nregion. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted\nlocation are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between\nthemselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays\nand thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between\neach verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance\ninference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise\na novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and\nthe three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client\ncould manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We\nevaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients\n(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired\nand wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab\ntestbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such\nas the client's geographical nearness to the verifiers. For wireless\nevaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired\nclients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile\nwireless link.

Observing\nthat many attack strategies aim to perturb image pixels in ways that are\nvisually imperceptible, we place JPEG compression at the core of our proposed\nShield defense framework, utilizing its capability to effectively \"compress\naway\" such pixel manipulation. To immunize a DNN model from artifacts\nintroduced by compression, Shield \"vaccinates\" a model by re-training it with\ncompressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate\nmultiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble\ndefense. On top of that, Shield adds an additional layer of protection by\nemploying randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an\nimage using random compression levels, making it harder for an adversary to\nestimate the transformation performed. This novel combination of vaccination,\nensembling, and randomization makes Shield a fortified multi-pronged\nprotection. We conducted extensive, large-scale experiments using the ImageNet\ndataset, and show that our approaches eliminate up to 94% of black-box attacks\nand 98% of gray-box attacks delivered by the recent, strongest attacks, such as\nCarlini-Wagner's L2 and DeepFool.

CATT implemented physical kernel isolation as the first generic and\npractical software-only defense to protect kernel from being rowhammered as\nkernel is one of the most appealing targets.\n  In this paper, we develop a novel exploit that could effectively defeat the\nphysical kernel isolation and gain both root and kernel privileges.

The exploit is\nmotivated by our key observation that the modern OSes have double-owned kernel\nbuffers (e.g., video buffers and SCSI Generic buffers) owned concurrently by\nthe kernel and user domains. The existence of such buffers invalidates the\nphysical kernel isolation and makes the rowhammer-based attack possible again.\nExisting conspicuous rowhammer attacks achieving the root/kernel privilege\nescalation exhaust the page cache or even the whole system memory. Instead, we\npropose a new technique, named memory ambush.

First, existing measures of memory-hardness only account for\ndynamic (i.e., runtime) memory usage, and do not consider static memory usage.\nWe propose a new definition of static-memory-hard function (SHF) which takes\ninto account static memory usage and allows the formalization of larger memory\nrequirements for efficient functions, than in the dynamic setting (where memory\nusage is inherently bounded by runtime). We then give two SHF constructions\nbased on pebbling; to prove static-memory-hardness, we define a new pebble game\n(\"black-magic pebble game\"), and new graph constructions with optimal\ncomplexity under our proposed measure.\n  Secondly, existing memory-hardness models implicitly consider linear\ntradeoffs between the costs of time and space.

In the first scheme, the two dimension ($2$D) input\nimage is divided into various blocks of size $N \\times N$. Each block is\ntransformed into a one dimensional ($1$D) array by using the Zigzag pattern.\nThen, the exclusive or (XOR) logical operation is used to encrypt each block\nwith the analogous secret key. In the second scheme, after the transformation\nprocess, the first block of each image is encrypted by the corresponding secret\nkey. Then, before the next block is encrypted, it is XORed with the first\nencrypted block to become the next input to the encrypting routine and so on.\nThis feedback mechanism depends on the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of\noperation which considers the heart of some ciphers because it is highly\nnonlinear.

Billing needs coarse-grained\nmeasurements where there are no, or minimal, privacy concerns. On the other\nhand, operation needs fine-grained measurements which can highly affect users'\nprivacy. Hence, users might be reluctant to participate in operational metering\nto protect their privacy. To overcome this issue, UP might offer rewards to\nallure users to report their measurements which endangers their privacy. In\nthis paper, we survey the literature on privacy-preserving metering in smart\ngrid. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize the literature based on whether\nmeasurements need to be attributable to users or not. This categorization is\nhighly effective because attribution is one of the main causes of privacy\nissues. Our survey shows that rewarding schemes and incentive-based demand\nresponse are new research topics with limited studies on it. Hence, we propose\ntwo privacy-preserving rewarding schemes for operational metering. First, a\nlight-weight solution that utilizes an already established link of trust i.e.\nBanks. It is based on the assumption that banks will not leak a client account\ndetails. This solution is based on hash chains and blind signatures to assure\nusers anonymity with minimal overhead for the UP and the smart meter. The bank\nin this approach is state-less in which is not required the bank to keep\ncommunications states of users and the UP.

Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and\nGaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding\ni.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often sub-optimal as\nit forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically\nassociated with matrix analysis. In this work, we consider the design of\ndifferential privacy mechanism specifically for a matrix-valued query function.\nThe proposed solution is to utilize a matrix-variate noise, as opposed to the\ntraditional scalar-valued noise. Particularly, we propose a novel differential\nprivacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which\nadds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution.\nWe prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential\nprivacy, and show that it allows the structural characteristics of the\nmatrix-valued query function to naturally be exploited. Furthermore, due to the\nmulti-dimensional nature of the MVG mechanism and the matrix-valued query, we\nintroduce the concept of directional noise, which can be utilized to mitigate\nthe impact the noise has on the utility of the query. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe performance of the MVG mechanism and the advantages of directional noise\nusing three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find\nthat the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art\napproaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline.

Var-CNN's improvements are especially notable in low-data\nscenarios, where it reduces the FPR of prior art by $3.12\\%$ while increasing\nthe TPR by $13\\%$. Overall, insights used to develop Var-CNN can be applied to\nfuture deep learning based attacks, and substantially reduce the amount of\ntraining data needed to perform a successful website fingerprinting attack.\nThis shortens the time needed for data collection and lowers the likelihood of\nhaving data staleness issues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 00:21:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 23:37:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bhat", "Sanjit", ""], ["Lu", "David", ""], ["Kwon", "Albert", ""], ["Devadas", "Srinivas", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10417", "submitter": "Abbas Acar", "authors": "Abbas Acar, Hidayet Aksu, A.

Continuous\nauthentication can address this issue. However, existing methods are either not\nreliable or not usable. In this paper, we introduce a usable and reliable\nmethod called Wearable Assisted Continuous Authentication (WACA). WACA relies\non the sensor based keystroke dynamics, where the authentication data is\nacquired through the built in sensors of a wearable (e.g., smartwatch) while\nthe user is typing. We implemented the WACA framework and evaluated its\nperformance on real devices with real users. The empirical evaluation of WACA\nreveals that WACA is feasible and its error rate is as low as 1 percent with 30\nseconds of processing time and 2 3% for 20 seconds. The computational overhead\nis minimal. Furthermore, we tested WACA against different attack scenarios.\nWACA is capable of identifying insider threats with very high accuracy (99.2%)\nand also robust against powerful adversaries such as imitation and statistical\nattackers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 14:04:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Mar 2018 19:30:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Acar", "Abbas", ""], ["Aksu", "Hidayet", ""], ["Uluagac", "A.

The defender, on the other hand,\ntypically tries to decrease leakage by introducing some controlled noise. This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nadversary. In this work we consider operators for modeling visible and\ninvisible choice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic\nproperties. We then formalize the interplay between defender and adversary in a\ngame-theoretic framework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the\npayoff is information leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games,\ndepending on whether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether\nor not the choices of the defender are visible to the adversary. Finally, we\nestablish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information leakage, and\nprovide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of equilibrium)\nfor both attacker and defender in the various cases.

Quite often companies and organizations\nare willing to share data for the sake of mutual benefit. However, the sharing\nof such data comes with risks, as problems with privacy may arise. Sensitive\ndata, along with sensitive knowledge inferred from this data, must be protected\nfrom unintentional exposure to unauthorized parties. One form of the inferred\nknowledge is frequent patterns mined in the form of frequent itemsets from\ntransactional databases. The problem of protecting such patterns is known as\nthe frequent itemset hiding problem.\n  In this paper we present a toolbox, which provides several implementations of\nfrequent itemset hiding algorithms. Firstly, we summarize the most important\naspects of each algorithm. We then introduce the architecture of the toolbox\nand its novel features.
