However, those advantages,\nironically, are the causes of security and privacy problems, which emerge\nbecause the data owned by different users are stored in some cloud servers\ninstead of under their own control. To deal with security problems, various\nschemes based on the Attribute- Based Encryption (ABE) have been proposed\nrecently. However, the privacy problem of cloud computing is yet to be solved.\nThis paper presents an anonymous privilege control scheme AnonyControl to\naddress the user and data privacy problem in a cloud. By using multiple\nauthorities in cloud computing system, our proposed scheme achieves anonymous\ncloud data access, finegrained privilege control, and more importantly,\ntolerance to up to (N -2) authority compromise. Our security and performance\nanalysis show that AnonyControl is both secure and efficient for cloud\ncomputing environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 20:12:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 00:13:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 03:54:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 7 Jul 2012 23:18:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 05:59:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2013 16:55:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Jung", "Taeho", ""], ["Li", "Xiang-Yang", ""], ["Wan", "Zhiguo", ""], ["Wan", "Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.2660", "submitter": "Taeho Jung", "authors": "Taeho Jung, XuFei Mao, Xiang-Yang Li, Shaojie Tang, Wei Gong, Lan\n  Zhang", "title": "Data Aggregation without Secure Channel: How to Evaluate a Multivariate\n  Polynomial Securely", "comments": "9 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, conference, IEEE INFOCOM 2013", "journal-ref": "INFOCOM, 2013 Proceedings IEEE, pp. 2634-2642.

One of the key\nprinciples in protecting privacy is data minimisation. This principle requires\nthat only the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish a certain\ngoal is collected and processed. \"Privacy-enhancing\" communication protocols\nhave been proposed to guarantee data minimisation in a wide range of\napplications.

In this\nwork, we propose a general formal framework to analyse and compare\ncommunication protocols with respect to privacy by data minimisation. Privacy\nrequirements are formalised independent of a particular protocol in terms of\nthe knowledge of (coalitions of) actors in a three-layer model of personal\ninformation. These requirements are then verified automatically for particular\nprotocols by computing this knowledge from a description of their\ncommunication. We validate our framework in an identity management (IdM) case\nstudy. As IdM systems are used more and more to satisfy the increasing need for\nreliable on-line identification and authentication, privacy is becoming an\nincreasingly critical issue.
