The latter are usually regarded as a central concept\nof cryptography, but the very existence of one-way functions depends on\ndifficult conjectures in complexity theory, most notably on the notorious \"$P\n\\ne NP$\" conjecture.\n  In this paper, we suggest protocols for secure computation of the sum,\nproduct, and some other functions, without using any one-way functions. A new\ninput that we offer here is that, in contrast with other proposals, we conceal\n\"intermediate results\" of a computation. For example, when we compute the sum\nof $k$ numbers, only the final result is known to the parties; partial sums are\nnot known to anybody. Other applications of our method include voting/rating\nover insecure channels and a rather elegant and efficient solution of Yao's\n\"millionaires' problem\".\n  Then, while it is fairly obvious that a secure (bit) commitment between two\nparties is impossible without a one-way function, we show that it is possible\nif the number of parties is at least 3. We also show how our (bit) commitment\nscheme for 3 parties can be used to arrange an unconditionally secure (bit)\ncommitment between just two parties if they use a \"dummy\" (e.g., a computer) as\nthe third party. We explain how our concept of a \"dummy\" is different from a\nwell-known concept of a \"trusted third party\".\n  We also suggest a protocol, without using a one-way function, for \"mental\npoker\", i.e., a fair card dealing (and playing) over distance. We also propose\na secret sharing scheme where an advantage over Shamir's and other known secret\nsharing schemes is that nobody, including the dealer, ends up knowing the\nshares owned by any particular player.\n  It should be mentioned that computational cost of our protocols is negligible\nto the point that all of them can be executed without a computer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 04:47:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Grigoriev", "Dima", ""], ["Shpilrain", "Vladimir", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5091", "submitter": "Hai-yan Sun", "authors": "Haiyan Sun, Qiaoyan Wen, Hua Zhang, Zhengping Jin and Wenmin Li", "title": "Cryptanalysis and improvement of two certificateless three-party\n  authenticated key agreement protocols", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, two certificateless three-party authenticated key agreement\nprotocols were proposed, and both protocols were claimed they can meet the\ndesirable security properties including forward security, key compromise\nimpersonation resistance and so on.
