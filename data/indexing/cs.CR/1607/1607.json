However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short of\ndetecting more elaborate types of attack. To study such attacks, we devise a\nnovel formalization of Internet routing, and apply this model to routing\nanomalies in order to establish a comprehensive attacker model. We use this\nmodel to precisely classify attacks and to evaluate their impact and\ndetectability. We analyze the eligibility of attack tactics that suit an\nattacker's goals and demonstrate that related work mostly focuses on less\nimpactful kinds of attacks.\n  We further propose, implement and test the Hijacking Event Analysis Program\n(HEAP), a new approach to investigate hijacking alarms. Our approachis designed\nto seamlessly integrate with previous work in order to reduce the high rates of\nfalse alarms inherent to these techniques. We leverage several unique data\nsources that can reliably disprove malicious intent. First, we make use of an\nInternet Routing Registry to derive business or organisational relationships\nbetween the parties involved in an event. Second, we use a topology-based\nreasoning algorithm to rule out events caused by legitimate operational\npractice. Finally, we use Internet-wide network scans to identify\nSSL/TLS-enabled hosts, which helps to identify non-malicious events by\ncomparing public keys prior to and during an event. In our evaluation, we prove\nthe effectiveness of our approach, and show that day-to-day routing anomalies\nare harmless for the most part. More importantly, we use HEAP to assess the\nvalidity of publicly reported alarms. We invite researchers to interface with\nHEAP in order to cross-check and narrow down their hijacking alerts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 02:05:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Schlamp", "Johann", ""], ["Holz", "Ralph", ""], ["Jacquemart", "Quentin", ""], ["Carle", "Georg", ""], ["Biersack", "Ernst W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00117", "submitter": "Gianluca Stringhini", "authors": "Andreas Haslebacher, Jeremiah Onaolapo, Gianluca Stringhini", "title": "All Your Cards Are Belong To Us: Understanding Online Carding Forums", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Underground online forums are platforms that enable trades of illicit\nservices and stolen goods.

The notion of\nprivacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be\npublished and, according to that, assessing the degree of sensitiveness of\ntheir contents.

This problem is motivated by energy\nharvesting communications with wireless energy transfer, where an added goal is\nto deliver a minimum amount of energy to a receiver in addition to delivering\nsecure data to another receiver. In this paper, we characterize the exact\nsecrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and\nreceiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is\nequivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel under a\ndouble-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the\nconverse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present\ntwo achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable\nscheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable\nscheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian\ncodebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy\ntransfer without sacrificing from the secure rate.

Notably, we solely\nutilize mechanisms that have been or currently are in the process of being\nstandardized at the IETF to aid the wide applicability of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 06:49:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Henze", "Martin", ""], ["Hummen", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Matzutt", "Roman", ""], ["Wehrle", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.03273", "submitter": "Emrah Akyol", "authors": "Kivanc Mihcak, Emrah Akyol, Tamer Basar, Cedric Langbort", "title": "Scalar Quadratic-Gaussian Soft Watermarking Games", "comments": "submitted for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.GT cs.IT cs.MM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the zero-sum game problem of soft watermarking: The hidden\ninformation (watermark) comes from a continuum and has a perceptual value; the\nreceiver generates an estimate of the embedded watermark to minimize the\nexpected estimation error (unlike the conventional watermarking schemes where\nboth the hidden information and the receiver output are from a discrete finite\nset).

With\nhindsight, the reasons can be identified easily enough: either the security\ntask itself is too cumbersome and/or time-consuming, or it creates high\nfriction with the users` primary task. The aim of the research presented here\nis to equip designers who select and implement security mechanisms with a\nmethod for identifying the ``best fit`` security mechanism at the design stage.\nSince many usability problems have been identified with authentication, we\nfocus on ``best fit`` authentication, and present a framework that allows\nsecurity designers not only to model the workload associated with a particular\nauthentication method, but more importantly to model it in the context of the\nuser`s primary task. We draw on results from cognitive psychology to create a\nmethod that allows a designer to understand the impact of a particular\nauthentication method on user productivity and satisfaction. In a validation\nstudy using a physical mockup of an airline check-in kiosk, we demonstrate that\nthe model can predict user performance and satisfaction. Furthermore, design\nexperts suggested personalized order recommendations which were similar to our\nmodel`s predictions. Our model is the first that supports identification of a\nholistic fit between the task of user authentication and the context in which\nit is performed.

The two main hard problems\nunderlying its security are the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest\nvector problem (CVP). Various algorithms have been studied for solving these\nproblems, and for SVP, lattice sieving currently dominates in terms of the\nasymptotic time complexity: one can heuristically solve SVP in time\n$2^{0.292d}$ in high dimensions $d$ [BDGL'16]. Although several SVP algorithms\ncan also be used to solve CVP, it is not clear whether this also holds for\nheuristic lattice sieving methods. The best time complexity for CVP is\ncurrently $2^{0.377d}$ [BGJ'14].\n  In this paper we revisit sieving algorithms for solving SVP, and study how\nthese algorithms can be modified to solve CVP and its variants as well. Our\nfirst method is aimed at solving one problem instance and minimizes the overall\ntime complexity for a single CVP instance with a time complexity of\n$2^{0.292d}$. Our second method minimizes the amortized time complexity for\nseveral instances on the same lattice, at the cost of a larger preprocessing\ncost. We can solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) with\n$2^{0.636d}$ space and preprocessing, in $2^{0.136d}$ time, while the query\ncomplexity can even be reduced to $2^{\\epsilon d}$ at the cost of preprocessing\ntime and memory complexities of $(1/\\epsilon)^{O(d)}$.\n  For easier variants of CVP, such as approximate CVP and bounded distance\ndecoding (BDD), we further show how the preprocessing method achieves even\nbetter complexities. For instance, we can solve approximate CVPP with large\napproximation factors $k$ with polynomial-sized advice in polynomial time if $k\n= \\Omega(\\sqrt{d/\\log d})$, heuristically closing the gap between the\ndecision-CVPP result of [AR'04] and the search-CVPP result of [DRS'14].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2016 18:59:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Laarhoven", "Thijs", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04811", "submitter": "James Christopher Foreman PhD", "authors": "James Christopher Foreman and Dheeraj Gurugubelli", "title": "Cyber Attack Surface Analysis of Advanced Metering Infrastructure", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "The Electricity Journal 28.1 (2015): 94-103", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure have been an issue of importance in\nindustry over the past several years, as well as a focus of academic research.\nCyber attacks of various types and magnitude have been on the rise targeted\nspecifically at power grids.

It has been found that the proposed substitution boxes have\noutstanding cryptographic characteristics and outperform the various recent\nsubstitution boxes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmad", "Musheer", ""], ["AlSharari", "Hamed D", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05113", "submitter": "Nicolas Papernot", "authors": "Nicolas Papernot and Patrick McDaniel", "title": "On the Effectiveness of Defensive Distillation", "comments": "Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report experimental results indicating that defensive distillation\nsuccessfully mitigates adversarial samples crafted using the fast gradient sign\nmethod, in addition to those crafted using the Jacobian-based iterative attack\non which the defense mechanism was originally evaluated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 14:58:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Papernot", "Nicolas", ""], ["McDaniel", "Patrick", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05171", "submitter": "Roger Piqueras Jover", "authors": "Roger Piqueras Jover", "title": "LTE security, protocol exploits and location tracking experimentation\n  with low-cost software radio", "comments": "Extended reports, analysis and results from \"LTE protocol exploits\"\n  presentation at ShmooCon 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile standard being implemented\nglobally to provide connectivity and access to advanced services for personal\nmobile devices.
