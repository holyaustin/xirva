This problem arises in a range of\napplications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust\nand reputation, monitoring and other tasks, where the computing nodes is\nexpected to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint\ncomputation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the\nfield of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party\ncomputation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scale\nPeer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical algorithms in the security domain, and a practical Peer-to-Peer\ndeployment.\n  We consider two security models. The first is the semi-honest model where\npeers correctly follow the protocol, but try to reveal private information. We\nprovide three possible schemes for secure multi-party numerical computation for\nthis model and identify a single light-weight scheme which outperforms the\nothers. Using extensive simulation results over real Internet topologies, we\ndemonstrate that our scheme is scalable to very large networks, with up to\nmillions of nodes. The second model we consider is the malicious peers model,\nwhere peers can behave arbitrarily, deliberately trying to affect the results\nof the computation as well as compromising the privacy of other peers. For this\nmodel we provide a fourth scheme to defend the execution of the computation\nagainst the malicious peers. The proposed scheme has a higher complexity\nrelative to the semi-honest model.

Since n/(k-1) is near the optimal factor of n/k, and can be chosen to\nbe close to 1, the proposed technique is space efficient. Furthermore, each\nshare is information theoretically secure, i.e. it does not depend on any\nunproven assumption of computational intractability. Such a recursive technique\nhas potential applications in secure and reliable storage of information on the\nWeb and in sensor networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jan 2009 02:08:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Parakh", "Abhishek", ""], ["Kak", "Subhash", ""]]}]
