However, large $n$ player interactions are more realistically\nmodeled as games of incomplete information, where players may know little to\nnothing about the types of other players. Unfortunately, games in incomplete\ninformation settings lose many of the nice properties of complete information\ngames: the quality of equilibria can become worse, the equilibria lose their\nex-post properties, and coordinating on an equilibrium becomes even more\ndifficult. Because of these problems, we would like to study games of\nincomplete information, but still implement equilibria of the complete\ninformation game induced by the (unknown) realized player types.\n  This problem was recently studied by Kearns et al. and solved in large games\nby means of introducing a weak mediator: their mediator took as input reported\ntypes of players, and output suggested actions which formed a correlated\nequilibrium of the underlying game. Players had the option to play\nindependently of the mediator, or ignore its suggestions, but crucially, if\nthey decided to opt-in to the mediator, they did not have the power to lie\nabout their type. In this paper, we rectify this deficiency in the setting of\nlarge congestion games. We give, in a sense, the weakest possible mediator: it\ncannot enforce participation, verify types, or enforce its suggestions.\nMoreover, our mediator implements a Nash equilibrium of the complete\ninformation game. We show that it is an (asymptotic) ex-post equilibrium of the\nincomplete information game for all players to use the mediator honestly, and\nthat when they do so, they end up playing an approximate Nash equilibrium of\nthe induced complete information game.

Informally, the allocation must\nmatch agents to their preferred goods in order to maximize social welfare, but\nthis preference is exactly what agents wish to hide. Therefore, we consider the\nproblem under the relaxed constraint of joint differential privacy: for any\nagent i, no coalition of agents excluding i should be able to learn about the\nvaluation function of agent i. In this setting, the full allocation is no\nlonger published---instead, each agent is told what good to get. We first show\nthat with a small number of identical copies of each good, it is possible to\nefficiently and accurately solve the maximum weight matching problem while\nguaranteeing joint differential privacy.

However,\nbecause existing key distribution methods cannot be fully trusted enough for\nautomatic use, key management has remained a user problem. We propose a\nfundamentally new approach to the key distribution problem by empowering\nend-users with the capacity to independently verify the authenticity of public\nkeys using an additional media attestment. This permits client software to\nautomatically lookup public keys from a keyserver without trusting the\nkeyserver, because any attempted MITM attacks can be detected by end-users.\nThus, our protocol is designed to enable a new breed of messaging clients with\ntrue end-to-end encryption built in, without the hassle of requiring users to\nmanually manage the public keys, that is verifiably secure against MITM\nattacks, and does not require trusting any third parties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 01:02:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Heinrich", "Stuart", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.7236", "submitter": "Henning Schnoor", "authors": "Henning Schnoor and Oliver Woizekowski", "title": "Active Linkability Attacks", "comments": "44 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study linking attacks on communication protocols.

However, relatively little is known about the\ncommunication complexity of this primitive.\n  In this work, we develop powerful information theoretic tools to prove lower\nbounds on the communication complexity of MPC. We restrict ourselves to a\n3-party setting in order to bring out the power of these tools without\nintroducing too many complications. Our techniques include the use of a data\nprocessing inequality for residual information - i.e., the gap between mutual\ninformation and G\\'acs-K\\\"orner common information, a new information\ninequality for 3-party protocols, and the idea of distribution switching by\nwhich lower bounds computed under certain worst-case scenarios can be shown to\napply for the general case.\n  Using these techniques we obtain tight bounds on communication complexity by\nMPC protocols for various interesting functions. In particular, we show\nconcrete functions that have \"communication-ideal\" protocols, which achieve the\nminimum communication simultaneously on all links in the network. Also, we\nobtain the first explicit example of a function that incurs a higher\ncommunication cost than the input length in the secure computation model of\nFeige, Kilian and Naor (1994), who had shown that such functions exist. We also\nshow that our communication bounds imply tight lower bounds on the amount of\nrandomness required by MPC protocols for many interesting functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 14:55:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Apr 2014 15:32:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Data", "Deepesh", ""], ["Prabhakaran", "Vinod M.", ""], ["Prabhakaran", "Manoj M.", ""]]}]
