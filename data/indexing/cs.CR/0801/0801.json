The network implements linear network\ncoding to deliver $n$ packets from source to each receiver, and the wiretapper\ncan eavesdrop on $\\mu$ arbitrarily chosen links. A coding scheme is proposed\nthat can achieve the maximum possible rate of $k=n-\\mu$ packets that are\ninformation-theoretically secure from the adversary. A distinctive feature of\nour scheme is that it is universal: it can be applied on top of any\ncommunication network without requiring knowledge of or any modifications on\nthe underlying network code. In fact, even a randomized network code can be\nused. Our approach is based on Rouayheb-Soljanin's formulation of a wiretap\nnetwork as a generalization of the Ozarow-Wyner wiretap channel of type II.\nEssentially, the linear MDS code in Ozarow-Wyner's coset coding scheme is\nreplaced by a maximum-rank-distance code over an extension of the field in\nwhich linear network coding operations are performed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2007 12:50:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 02:45:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "Danilo", ""], ["Kschischang", "Frank R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0575", "submitter": "Manik Lal Das", "authors": "Manik Lal Das", "title": "A Flexible and Secure Remote Systems Authentication Scheme Using Smart\n  Cards", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Published in the Transactions on Electronics, Computer and\n  Communication, 1(2):78-82, 2006", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The paper presents an authentication scheme for remote systems using smart\ncard.
