That is why the reduction in price of the\nRFID tags has been accompanied with an increasing attention paid to this\ntechnology. However, since tags are resource-constrained devices sending\nidentification data wirelessly, designing secure and private RFID\nidentification protocols is a challenging task. This scenario is even more\ncomplex when scalability must be met by those protocols.\n  Assuming the existence of a lightweight, secure, private and scalable RFID\nidentification protocol, there exist other concerns surrounding the RFID\ntechnology. Some of them arise from the technology itself, such as distance\nchecking, but others are related to the potential of RFID systems to gather\nhuge amount of tracking data. Publishing and mining such moving objects data is\nessential to improve efficiency of supervisory control, assets management and\nlocalisation, transportation, etc. However, obvious privacy threats arise if an\nindividual can be linked with some of those published trajectories. The present\ndissertation contributes to the design of algorithms and protocols aimed at\ndealing with the issues explained above. First, we propose a set of protocols\nand heuristics based on a distributed architecture that improve the efficiency\nof the identification process without compromising privacy or security.\nMoreover, we present a novel distance-bounding protocol based on graphs that is\nextremely low-resource consuming. Finally, we present two trajectory\nanonymisation methods aimed at preserving the individuals' privacy when their\ntrajectories are released.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:33:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Trujillo-Rasua", "Rolando", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.5670", "submitter": "Yoshihiro Terasawa", "authors": "Yoshihiro Terasawa", "title": "A simple authentication by common strings", "comments": "in Japanese", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It was the problem of finding the minimum value of the sum of the distances\nof the path through all cities Overview TSP.

A paper at Financial\nCryptography 2012 conference explains that it is a system which \"uses no fancy\ncryptography\", and is \"by no means perfect\". It depends on a well-known\ncryptographic standard SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic\nprocess which allows one to make money by producing bitcoins. We reformulate\nthis problem as a Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and\nreduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem. We estimate the speed of\nthis process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems\nand it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at\nmost 1.86. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save tens of millions\nof dollars per year in electricity bills. Miners who set up mining operations\nface many economic incertitudes such as high volatility. In this paper we point\nout that there are fundamental incertitudes which depend very strongly on the\nbitcoin specification. The energy efficiency of bitcoin miners have already\nbeen improved by a factor of about 10,000, and we claim that further\nimprovements are inevitable. Better technology is bound to be invented, would\nit be quantum miners. More importantly, the specification is likely to change.\nA major change have been proposed in May 2013 at Bitcoin conference in San\nDiego by Dan Kaminsky. However, any sort of change could be flatly rejected by\nthe community which have heavily invested in mining with the current\ntechnology. Another question is the reward halving scheme in bitcoin. The\ncurrent bitcoin specification mandates a strong 4-year cyclic property. We find\nthis property totally unreasonable and harmful and explain why and how it needs\nto be changed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2013 19:06:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 17:23:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 14:06:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Courtois", "Nicolas T.", ""], ["Grajek", "Marek", ""], ["Naik", "Rahul", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8063", "submitter": "Ashish Kumar", "authors": "Ashish Kumar, Anupam Gupta", "title": "Some Efficient Solutions to Yao's Millionaire Problem", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present three simple and efficient protocol constructions to solve Yao's\nMillionaire Problem when the parties involved are non-colluding and\nsemi-honest.

The Cloud computing concept offers dynamically scalable resources\nprovisioned as a service over the Internet. Economic benefits are the main\ndriver for the Cloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure\nand operational expenditure. In order for this to become reality, however,\nthere are still some challenges to be solved. Most important among these are\nsecurity and trust issues,since the users data has to be released to the Cloud\nand thus leaves the protection sphere of the data owner.In contrast to\ntraditional solutions, where the IT services are under proper physical,logical\nand personnel controls, Cloud Computing moves the application software and\ndatabases to the large data centers, where the management of the data and\nservices may not be fully trustworthy. This unique attribute, however, poses\nmany new security challenges which have not been well understood. Security is\nto save data from danger and vulnerability. There are so many dangers and\nvulnerabilities to be handled. Various security issues and some of their\nsolution are explained and are concentrating mainly on public cloud security\nissues and their solutions. Data should always be encrypted when stored(using\nseparate symmetric encryption keys)and transmitted. If this is implemented\nappropriately, even if another tenant can access the data, all that will appear\nis gibberish. So a method is proposed such that we are encrypting the whole\ndata along with the cryptographic key.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 06:11:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Thomas", "Geethu", ""], ["Jose", "Prem", "V"], ["Afsar", "P.", ""]]}]
