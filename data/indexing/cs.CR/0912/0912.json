We provide general techniques to produce\nprivacy-preserving approximations of classifiers learned via (regularized)\nempirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy definition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we\napply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM\nclassification. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for\nprivacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails\nperturbing the objective function before optimizing over classifiers. If the\nloss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria,\nwe prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and\nprovide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further\npresent a privacy-preserving technique for tuning the parameters in general\nmachine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees\nfor the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving\nanalogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We\nobtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real\ndemographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically\nand empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous\nstate-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff\nbetween privacy and learning performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 04:35:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2010 19:33:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2010 05:26:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 23:16:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 22:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhuri", "Kamalika", ""], ["Monteleoni", "Claire", ""], ["Sarwate", "Anand D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0453", "submitter": "Matthieu Finiasz", "authors": "Matthieu Finiasz", "title": "NP-completeness of Certain Sub-classes of the Syndrome Decoding Problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of Syndrome Decoding was proven to be NP-complete in 1978 and,\nsince then, quite a few cryptographic applications have had their security rely\non the (provable) difficulty of solving some instances of it.

Two distinct and separate methods are\npresented.\n  Method 1: Alter the symbol set of the language by adding additional redundant\nsymbols for frequent symbols. This will reduce the high frequency of more\ncommonly used symbols. Hence, frequency analysis upon ciphertext will not be\npossible. Hence, decryption will be possible.\n  Method 2: Computers use binary base 2. Most encryption systems use ciphering\nto convert data to ciphertext. The author presents the theory and several\npossible implementations of a method for computers analogous to speaking\nanother language. This is done by using a binary base other than base 2. Ex.\nFibonacci, Phi or Prime.\n  In addition, steganography may be used for creating alternate binary bases.\n  This kind of encryption significantly increases the complexity of decryption.\nFirst the binary base must be known. Only then, can decryption begin.\n  This kind of encryption also breaks the transitivity of\nplaintext-codebook-binary; the correlation of letters-ASCII-base2. With this\ntransitivity broken, decryption is logically impossible. Coupled with\nencrypting the plaintext, binary encryption makes decryption uncrackable. It\nmay produce false positives--information theoretic secure, and requires much\nmore computing power to resolve than is currently used in brute force\ndecryption. Hence, the assertion that these combination of methods are\ncomputationally secure--impervious to brute force.\n  The proposed system has a drawback. It is not as compressed as a base2.\n(Similar to adding random padding to the encryption.) However, this is\nacceptable, since the goal is very strong encryption:\n  Both methods are not decryptable by method uncrackable - by conventional,\nstatistical means.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2009 04:56:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2009 01:32:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 01:08:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zirkind", "Givon", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4694", "submitter": "Charles Sauerbier", "authors": "Charles Sauerbier", "title": "Discovery of Elliptic Curve Cryptographic Private Key in O(n)", "comments": "2 pages, 0 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An algorithm is presented that in context of public key use of Elliptic Curve\nCryptography allows discovery of the private key in worst case O(n).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2009 17:50:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sauerbier", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4742", "submitter": "Chao Li", "authors": "Chao Li, Michael Hay, Vibhor Rastogi, Gerome Miklau, Andrew McGregor", "title": "Optimizing Histogram Queries under Differential Privacy", "comments": "22 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Differential privacy is a robust privacy standard that has been successfully\napplied to a range of data analysis tasks.

Typical\nlifetimes of gene sets and number of offspring from different parents affect\nthis genetic drift and the level of correlation between gene sets. The\nfrequency of mutations similarly affects the gene pool.
