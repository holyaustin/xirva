We show\nthat traffic analysis is even a greater threat to privacy than previously\nthought by introducing a new attack that can be carried out remotely. In\nparticular, we show that, to perform traffic analysis, adversaries do not need\nto directly observe the traffic patterns. Instead, they can gain sufficient\ninformation by sending probes from a far-off vantage point that exploits a\nqueuing side channel in routers. To demonstrate the threat of such remote\ntraffic analysis, we study a remote website detection attack that works against\nhome broadband users. Because the remotely observed traffic patterns are more\nnoisy than those obtained using previous schemes based on direct local traffic\nmonitoring, we take a dynamic time warping (DTW) based approach to detecting\nfingerprints from the same website. As a new twist on website fingerprinting,\nwe consider a website detection attack, where the attacker aims to find out\nwhether a user browses a particular web site, and its privacy implications. We\nshow experimentally that, although the success of the attack is highly\nvariable, depending on the target site, for some sites very low error rates. We\nalso show how such website detection can be used to deanonymize message board\nusers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2011 05:55:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Xun", ""], ["Kiyavash", "Negar", ""], ["Schear", "Nab\u00edl", ""], ["Borisov", "Nikita", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0105", "submitter": "Abhradeep Thakurta", "authors": "Prateek Jain, Pravesh Kothari, Abhradeep Thakurta", "title": "Differentially Private Online Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of preserving privacy in the online\nlearning setting. We study the problem in the online convex programming (OCP)\nframework---a popular online learning setting with several interesting\ntheoretical and practical implications---while using differential privacy as\nthe formal privacy measure. For this problem, we distill two critical\nattributes that a private OCP algorithm should have in order to provide\nreasonable privacy as well as utility guarantees: 1) linearly decreasing\nsensitivity, i.e., as new data points arrive their effect on the learning model\ndecreases, 2) sub-linear regret bound---regret bound is a popular\ngoodness/utility measure of an online learning algorithm.\n  Given an OCP algorithm that satisfies these two conditions, we provide a\ngeneral framework to convert the given algorithm into a privacy preserving OCP\nalgorithm with good (sub-linear) regret. We then illustrate our approach by\nconverting two popular online learning algorithms into their differentially\nprivate variants while guaranteeing sub-linear regret ($O(\\sqrt{T})$). Next, we\nconsider the special case of online linear regression problems, a practically\nimportant class of online learning problems, for which we generalize an\napproach by Dwork et al. to provide a differentially private algorithm with\njust $O(\\log^{1.5} T)$ regret.

Several studies demonstrate that standard settings\ndirectly cause an unnoticed over-sharing and that the users have trouble\nunderstanding and configuring adequate settings. Using the three simple\nprinciples of color coding, ease of access, and application of common\npractices, we developed a new privacy interface that increases the usability\nsignificantly. The results of our user study underlines the extent of the\ninitial problem and documents that our interface enables faster, more precise\nauthorisation and leads to increased intelligibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2011 21:42:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Paul", "Thomas", ""], ["Puscher", "Daniel", ""], ["Strufe", "Thorsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6147", "submitter": "Xiongfeng Ma", "authors": "Xiongfeng Ma and Zhen Zhang and Xiaoqing Tan", "title": "Explicit combinatorial design", "comments": "13 pages, no figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CC cs.CR cs.DM quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A combinatorial design is a family of sets that are almost disjoint, which is\napplied in pseudo random number generations and randomness extractions.

The idea is\nthat a randomized query satisfies differential privacy if the likelihood of\nobtaining a certain answer for a database $x$ is not too different from the\nlikelihood of obtaining the same answer on adjacent databases, i.e. databases\nwhich differ from $x$ for only one individual. Information flow is an area of\nSecurity concerned with the problem of controlling the leakage of confidential\ninformation in programs and protocols. Nowadays, one of the most established\napproaches to quantify and to reason about leakage is based on the R\\'enyi min\nentropy version of information theory. In this paper, we analyze critically the\nnotion of differential privacy in light of the conceptual framework provided by\nthe R\\'enyi min information theory. We show that there is a close relation\nbetween differential privacy and leakage, due to the graph symmetries induced\nby the adjacency relation. Furthermore, we consider the utility of the\nrandomized answer, which measures its expected degree of accuracy. We focus on\ncertain kinds of utility functions called \"binary\", which have a close\ncorrespondence with the R\\'enyi min mutual information. Again, it turns out\nthat there can be a tight correspondence between differential privacy and\nutility, depending on the symmetries induced by the adjacency relation and by\nthe query. Depending on these symmetries we can also build an optimal-utility\nrandomization mechanism while preserving the required level of differential\nprivacy. Our main contribution is a study of the kind of structures that can be\ninduced by the adjacency relation and the query, and how to use them to derive\nbounds on the leakage and achieve the optimal utility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 09:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"], ["Andr\u00e9s", "Miguel E.", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"], ["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", "", "INRIA Saclay -\n  Ile de France"], ["Palamidessi", "Catuscia", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"]]}, {"id": "1109.6874", "submitter": "Matthew Wright PhD", "authors": "Dustin Bachrach, Christopher Nunu, Dan S.

However, groups can be easily blocked from\ncommunicating through blocking of posts with the given hashtags. We propose\n#h00t, a system for censorship resistant microblogging. #h00t presents an\ninterface that is much like Twitter, except that hashtags are replaced with\nvery short hashes (e.g., 24 bits) of the group identifier. Naturally, with such\nshort hashes, hashtags from different groups may collide and #h00t users will\nactually seek to create collisions. By encrypting all posts with keys derived\nfrom the group identifiers, #h00t client software can filter out other groups'\nposts while making such filtering difficult for the adversary. In essence, by\nleveraging collisions, groups can tunnel their posts in other groups' posts. A\ncensor could not block a given group without also blocking the other groups\nwith colliding hashtags. We evaluate the feasibility of #h00t through traces\ncollected from Twitter, showing that a single modern computer has enough\ncomputational throughput to encrypt every tweet sent through Twitter in real\ntime. We also use these traces to analyze the bandwidth and anonymity tradeoffs\nthat would come with different variations on how group identifiers are encoded\nand hashtags are selected to purposefully collide with one another.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 16:12:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bachrach", "Dustin", ""], ["Nunu", "Christopher", ""], ["Wallach", "Dan S.", ""], ["Wright", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6914", "submitter": "Filippo Del Tedesco", "authors": "Filippo Del Tedesco, Sebastian Hunt, and David Sands", "title": "A Semantic Hierarchy for Erasure Policies", "comments": "18 pages, ICISS 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of logical data erasure, contrasting with physical\nerasure in the same way that end-to-end information flow control contrasts with\naccess control.
