The separation of\nplanes in SDN, however, introduces new vulnerabilities in SDN networks since\nthe difference in processing packets at each plane allows an adversary to\nfingerprint the network's packet-forwarding logic. In this paper, we study the\nfeasibility of fingerprinting the controller-switch interactions by a remote\nadversary, whose aim is to acquire knowledge about specific flow rules that are\ninstalled at the switches. This knowledge empowers the adversary with a better\nunderstanding of the network's packet-forwarding logic and exposes the network\nto a number of threats. In our study, we collect measurements from hosts\nlocated across the globe using a realistic SDN network comprising of OpenFlow\nhardware and software switches. We show that, by leveraging information from\nthe RTT and packet-pair dispersion of the exchanged packets, fingerprinting\nattacks on SDN networks succeed with overwhelming probability. We also show\nthat these attacks are not restricted to active adversaries, but can be equally\nmounted by passive adversaries that only monitor traffic exchanged with the SDN\nnetwork. Finally, we discuss the implications of these attacks on the security\nof SDN networks, and we present and evaluate an efficient countermeasure to\nstrengthen SDN networks against fingerprinting. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our countermeasure in deterring fingerprinting attacks on SDN\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 11:19:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cui", "Heng", ""], ["Karame", "Ghassan O.", ""], ["Klaedtke", "Felix", ""], ["Bifulco", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06961", "submitter": "Boris Ryabko", "authors": "Boris Ryabko", "title": "Two-faced processes and random number generators", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe random processes (with binary alphabet) whose entropy is less\nthan 1 (per letter), but they mimic true random process, i.e., by definition,\ngenerated sequence can be interpreted as the result of the flips of a fair coin\nwith sides that are labeled 0 and 1.

In this paper, we explore the state of the art inter cloud\nmigration techniques and identify the potential security threats in the scope\nof Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS. We propose an inter cloud data\nmigration mechanism that offers better security guarantees and faster response\ntime for migrating large scale data files in cloud database management systems.\nThe proposed approach enhances the data security processes used to achieve\nsecure data migration between cloud nodes thus improves applications response\ntime and throughput. The performance of the proposed approach is validated by\nmeasuring its impact on response time and throughput, and comparing the\nperformance to that of other techniques in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 12:11:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hababeh", "Ismail", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08454", "submitter": "Yongge Wang", "authors": "Yongge Wang", "title": "Quantum Resistant Random Linear Code Based Public Key Encryption Scheme\n  RLCE", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lattice based encryption schemes and linear code based encryption schemes\nhave received extensive attention in recent years since they have been\nconsidered as post-quantum candidate encryption schemes. Though LLL reduction\nalgorithm has been one of the major cryptanalysis techniques for lattice based\ncryptographic systems, key recovery cryptanalysis techniques for linear code\nbased cryptographic systems are generally scheme specific. In recent years,\nseveral important techniques such as Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack, filtration\nattacks, and algebraic attacks have been developed to crypt-analyze linear code\nbased encryption schemes. Though most of these cryptanalysis techniques are\nrelatively new, they prove to be very powerful and many systems have been\nbroken using them. Thus it is important to design linear code based\ncryptographic systems that are immune against these attacks. This paper\nproposes linear code based encryption scheme RLCE which shares many\ncharacteristics with random linear codes. Our analysis shows that the scheme\nRLCE is secure against existing attacks and we hope that the security of the\nRLCE scheme is equivalent to the hardness of decoding random linear codes.\nExample parameters for different security levels are recommended for the scheme\nRLCE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 16:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yongge", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08515", "submitter": "Igor Linkov", "authors": "Zachary A.

However, risk is not the only possible\ncyber security metric. Other metrics such as resilience can exist and could be\npotentially very valuable to defenders of ICS systems. Often, metrics are\ndefined as measurable properties of a system that quantify the degree to which\nobjectives of the system are achieved. Metrics can provide cyber defenders of\nan ICS with critical insights regarding the system. Metrics are generally\nacquired by analyzing relevant attributes of that system. In terms of cyber\nsecurity metrics, ICSs tend to have unique features: in many cases, these\nsystems are older technologies that were designed for functionality rather than\nsecurity. They are also extremely diverse systems that have different\nrequirements and objectives. Therefore, metrics for ICSs must be tailored to a\ndiverse group of systems with many features and perform many different\nfunctions. In this chapter, we first outline the general theory of performance\nmetrics, and highlight examples from the cyber security domain and ICS in\nparticular. We then focus on a particular example of a class of metrics that is\ndifferent from the one we have considered in earlier chapters. Instead of risk,\nhere we consider metrics of resilience. Resilience is defined by the National\nAcademy of Sciences (2012) as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb,\nrecover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events.\nThis chapter presents two approaches for the generation of metrics based on the\nconcept of resilience using a matrix-based approach and a network-based\napproach. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of different\nmethods is presented along with a process and tips intended to aid in devising\neffective metrics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Dec 2015 00:26:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Collier", "Zachary A.", ""], ["Panwar", "Mahesh", ""], ["Ganin", "Alexander A.", ""], ["Kott", "Alex", ""], ["Linkov", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08546", "submitter": "Aylin Caliskan", "authors": "Aylin Caliskan, Fabian Yamaguchi, Edwin Dauber, Richard Harang, Konrad\n  Rieck, Rachel Greenstadt, and Arvind Narayanan", "title": "When Coding Style Survives Compilation: De-anonymizing Programmers from\n  Executable Binaries", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.14722/ndss.2018.23304", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The ability to identify authors of computer programs based on their coding\nstyle is a direct threat to the privacy and anonymity of programmers.
