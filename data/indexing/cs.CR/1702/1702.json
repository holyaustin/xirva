One natural approach to this problem is to first\ncreate a list of sensitive keywords, and then identify Twitter accounts that\nuse these words in their tweets. But such an approach may overlook sensitive\naccounts that are not covered by the subjective choice of keywords. In this\npaper, we instead explore finding sensitive accounts by examining the\npercentage of anonymous and identifiable followers the accounts have. This\napproach is motivated by an earlier study showing that sensitive accounts\ntypically have a large percentage of anonymous followers and a small percentage\nof identifiable followers.\n  To this end, we first considered the problem of automatically determining if\na Twitter account is anonymous or identifiable. We find that simple techniques,\nsuch as checking for name-list membership, perform poorly. We designed a\nmachine learning classifier that classifies accounts as anonymous or\nidentifiable. We then classified an account as sensitive based on the\npercentages of anonymous and identifiable followers the account has. We applied\nour approach to approximately 100,000 accounts with 404 million active\nfollowers. The approach uncovered accounts that were sensitive for a diverse\nnumber of reasons. These accounts span across varied themes, including those\nthat are not commonly proposed as sensitive or those that relate to socially\nstigmatized topics. To validate our approach, we applied Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) topic analysis to the tweets in the detected sensitive and\nnon-sensitive accounts. LDA showed that the sensitive and non-sensitive\naccounts obtained from the methodology are tweeting about distinctly different\ntopics. Our results show that it is indeed possible to objectively identify\nsensitive accounts at the scale of Twitter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 08:52:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Peddinti", "Sai Teja", ""], ["Ross", "Keith W.", ""], ["Cappos", "Justin", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00249", "submitter": "Martin Eker{\\aa}", "authors": "Martin Eker{\\aa} and Johan H{\\aa}stad", "title": "Quantum algorithms for computing short discrete logarithms and factoring\n  RSA integers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we generalize the quantum algorithm for computing short\ndiscrete logarithms previously introduced by Eker{\\aa} so as to allow for\nvarious tradeoffs between the number of times that the algorithm need be\nexecuted on the one hand, and the complexity of the algorithm and the\nrequirements it imposes on the quantum computer on the other hand.\n  Furthermore, we describe applications of algorithms for computing short\ndiscrete logarithms.

We show that\nall of the existing solutions for PRL - including secure 2-party computation\n(S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP)\nblocking to ensure subquadratic cost - violate at least one of the three\ndesiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but\nhave either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy\nguarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost.\nThis is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit\nthe release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms\nfor PRL allow the release of matching records.\n  In light of this deficiency, we propose a novel privacy model, called output\nconstrained differential privacy, that shares the strong privacy protection of\nDP, but allows for the truthful release of the output of a certain function\napplied to the data. We apply this to PRL, and show that protocols satisfying\nthis privacy model permit the disclosure of the true matching records, but\ntheir execution is insensitive to the presence or absence of a single\nnon-matching record. We find that prior work that combine DP and S2PC\ntechniques even fail to satisfy this end-to-end privacy model.

Given the\ncoinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have\nadopted an elusive behavior of \"free-riding\" so that they can acquire the\nbenefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far,\nunderstanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective\nof the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this\npaper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\\qoi) for the\nassessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing\nfor threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics,\nincluding correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators.

The combined effect of these operations is that\nattackers are unable to gain persistent control of the system. The CPS stays\nsafe and stable even under frequent resets because of the inertia present.\nFurther, resets simplify certain diversification mechanisms and makes them\nfeasible to implement in CPSs with limited computing resources.\n  We evaluate our idea on two real-world systems: an engine management unit of\na car and a flight controller of a quadcopter. Roughly speaking, these two\nsystems provide typical and extreme operational requirements for evaluating\nFIRED in terms of stability, algorithmic complexity, and safety requirements.\nWe show that FIRED provides robust security guarantees against hijacking\nattacks and persistent CPS threats. We find that our defense is suitable for\nemerging CPS such as commodity unmanned vehicles that are currently unregulated\nand cost sensitive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Arroyo", "Miguel", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hidenori", ""], ["Sethumadhavan", "Simha", ""], ["Yang", "Junfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.06612", "submitter": "Douglas Stinson", "authors": "Navid Nasr Esfahani, Ian Goldberg and Douglas R.

The attack we developed exploits the real-time\nnature of the learning process that allows the adversary to train a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) that generates prototypical samples of the targeted\ntraining set that was meant to be private (the samples generated by the GAN are\nintended to come from the same distribution as the training data).\nInterestingly, we show that record-level DP applied to the shared parameters of\nthe model, as suggested in previous work, is ineffective (i.e., record-level DP\nis not designed to address our attack).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 05:00:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 May 2017 20:21:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 16:38:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Hitaj", "Briland", ""], ["Ateniese", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Perez-Cruz", "Fernando", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07476", "submitter": "Ilya Mironov", "authors": "Ilya Mironov", "title": "Renyi Differential Privacy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of IEEE 30th Computer Security Foundations Symposium\n  CSF 2017, pages 263-275, IEEE, Aug 2017", "doi": "10.1109/CSF.2017.11", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a natural relaxation of differential privacy based on the Renyi\ndivergence.

The attack works although in SGX enclaves there are no timers, no\nlarge pages, no physical addresses, and no shared memory. In a semi-synchronous\nattack, we extract 96% of an RSA private key from a single trace. We extract\nthe full RSA private key in an automated attack from 11 traces within 5\nminutes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 09:57:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 10:28:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 11:18:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Schwarz", "Michael", "", "Graz University of Technology"], ["Weiser", "Samuel", "", "Graz University of Technology"], ["Gruss", "Daniel", "", "Graz University of Technology"], ["Maurice", "Cl\u00e9mentine", "", "Graz University of Technology"], ["Mangard", "Stefan", "", "Graz University of Technology"]]}]
