However in mobile devices there are different factors that need to be\nconsidered in order to get more useful recommendations and increase the quality\nof the user experience. This paper gives an overview of the factors related to\nthe quality and proposes a new hybrid recommendation model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 05:51:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Polatidis", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Georgiadis", "Christos K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6970", "submitter": "Mahdi Soodkhah Mohammadi", "authors": "Mahdi Soodkhah Mohammadi, Abbas Ghaemi Bafghi", "title": "A Privacy-Preserving Electronic Payment System for DRM", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of major considerations in an online business is customer privacy.\nConsumers are not interested in being monitored and identified by sellers. Some\nsolutions are proposed to hide selection of the customer but in the payment\nphase, there will be a leakage of information as online shopper can infer some\ninformation about customer's preference due to the price, which is paid by\ncustomer. This is a big threat to customer privacy. Our solution to this\nproblem consists of a number of one-unit payment steps that cannot be linked to\neach other or to customer's identity. At the end of purchase, content provider\nwill receive appropriate amount of money while customer will acquire a valid\nlicense anonymously. Content provider will not be able to gain any information\nabout the customer or the content that is purchased. In addition, a dispute\nresolution scheme is presented for cases of conflict between customer and\ncontent provider. A series of analyses on the security, complexity and DRM\nrequirements are presented which indicate security and practicality of our\nscheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 10:03:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mohammadi", "Mahdi Soodkhah", ""], ["Bafghi", "Abbas Ghaemi", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6986", "submitter": "Louis Sibomana", "authors": "Louis Sibomana, Hung Tran, and Quang Anh Tran", "title": "Impact of Secondary User Communication on Security Communication of\n  Primary User", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, spectrum sharing has been considered as a promising solution to\nimprove the spectrum utilization. It however may be vulnerable to security\nproblems as the primary and secondary network access the same resource.\nTherefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of a cognitive\nradio network in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV) who illegally listens to\nthe primary user (PU) communication in which the transmit power of the\nsecondary transmitter (SU-Tx) is subject to the joint constraint of peak\ntransmit power of the SU-Tx and outage probability of the PU. Accordingly, an\nadaptive transmit power policy and an analytical expression of symbol error\nprobability are derived for the SU. Most importantly, security evaluations of\nprimary network in terms of the probability of existence of non-zero secrecy\ncapacity and outage probability of secrecy capacity are obtained. Numerical\nresults reveal a fact that the security of the primary network does not only\ndepends on the channel mean powers between primary and secondary networks, but\nalso strongly depends on the channel condition of the SU-Tx to EAV link and\ntransmit power policy of the SU-Tx.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 11:42:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sibomana", "Louis", ""], ["Tran", "Hung", ""], ["Tran", "Quang Anh", ""]]}]
