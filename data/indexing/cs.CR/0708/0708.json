In a better case\nusing a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe\nO(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),\nwhere the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,\nXSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit.

In this paper, we revisit and extend the NP-complete\ndecision procedure for a bounded number of sessions. We use a, now standard,\ndeducibility constraints formalism for modeling security protocols. Our first\ncontribution is to give a simple set of constraint simplification rules, that\nallows to reduce any deducibility constraint system to a set of solved forms,\nrepresenting all solutions (within the bound on sessions).\n  As a consequence, we prove that deciding the existence of key cycles is\nNP-complete for a bounded number of sessions. The problem of key-cycles has\nbeen put forward by recent works relating computational and symbolic models.\nThe so-called soundness of the symbolic model requires indeed that no key cycle\n(e.g., enc(k,k)) ever occurs in the execution of the protocol. Otherwise,\nstronger security assumptions (such as KDM-security) are required.\n  We show that our decision procedure can also be applied to prove again the\ndecidability of authentication-like properties and the decidability of a\nsignificant fragment of protocols with timestamps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2007 11:20:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2009 16:43:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Comon-Lundh", "Hubert", ""], ["Cortier", "V\u00e9ronique", ""], ["Zalinescu", "Eugen", ""]]}]
