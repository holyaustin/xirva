Contextual\nintegrity is a privacy theory that conceptualises the appropriateness of\ninformation sharing based on the contexts in which this information is to be\nshared. Computational models of Contextual Integrity assume the existence of\nwell-defined contexts, in which individuals enact pre-defined roles and\ninformation sharing is governed by an explicit set of norms. However, contexts\nin Online Social Networks are known to be implicit, unknown a priori and ever\nchanging; users relationships are constantly evolving; and the information\nsharing norms are implicit. This makes current Contextual Integrity models not\nsuitable for Online Social Networks.\n  In this paper, we propose the first computational model of Implicit\nContextual Integrity, presenting an information model and an Information\nAssistant Agent that uses the information model to learn implicit contexts,\nrelationships and the information sharing norms to help users avoid\ninappropriate information exchanges and undesired information disseminations.\nThrough an experimental evaluation, we validate the properties of Information\nAssistant Agents, which are shown to: infer the information sharing norms even\nif a small proportion of the users follow the norms and in presence of\nmalicious users; help reduce the exchange of inappropriate information and the\ndissemination of sensitive information with only a partial view of the system\nand the information received and sent by their users; and minimise the burden\nto the users in terms of raising unnecessary alerts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 14:25:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 09:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Criado", "Natalia", ""], ["Such", "Jose M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02563", "submitter": "Joseph Fitzsimons", "authors": "Michal Hajdu\\v{s}ek and Carlos A.

In this paper, we make\nthe first attempt to cope with the privacy concerns for Web service\nrecommendation. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective\nprivacy-preserving framework by applying data obfuscation techniques, and\nfurther develop two representative privacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches\nunder this framework. Evaluation results from a publicly-available QoS dataset\nof real-world Web services demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our\nprivacy-preserving QoS prediction approaches.

A popular approach known as **differential privacy** offers\nprovable privacy guarantees, but it is often observed in practice that it could\nsubstantially hamper learning accuracy. In this paper we study the learnability\n(whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm) under Vapnik's general\nlearning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some\nintricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability.\n  In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable **if an only\nif** there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical\nrisk (AERM). In contrast, for non-private learning AERM alone is not sufficient\nfor learnability. This result suggests that when searching for private learning\nalgorithms, we can restrict the search to algorithms that are AERM. In light of\nthis, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally\nconsistent algorithm whenever the problem is learnable under privacy\nconstraint. We also propose a generic and practical algorithm and show that\nunder very general conditions it privately learns a wide class of learning\nproblems. Lastly, we extend some of the results to the more practical\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy and establish the existence of a\nphase-transition on the class of problems that are approximately privately\nlearnable with respect to how small $\\delta$ needs to be.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 03:52:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 13:02:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 19:55:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yu-Xiang", ""], ["Lei", "Jing", ""], ["Fienberg", "Stephen E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06422", "submitter": "Kerim Goztepe", "authors": "Kerim Goztepe", "title": "Recommendations on Future Operational Environments Command Control and\n  Cyber Security", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.13140/2.1.2406.1121", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  It is a well-known fact that today a nation's telecommunication networks,\ncritical infrastructure, and information systems are vulnerable to growing\nnumber of attacks in cyberspace.

Sequential aggregate signature,\nin turn, is a special kind of aggregate signature that only allows a signer to\nadd his signature into an aggregate signature in sequential order. This latter\nscheme has applications in diversified settings such as in reducing bandwidth\nof certificate chains and in secure routing protocols. Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai,\nShacham, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2006) presented the first sequential aggregate\nsignature scheme in the standard model. The size of their public key, however,\nis quite large (i.e., the number of group elements is proportional to the\nsecurity parameter), and therefore, they suggested as an open problem the\nconstruction of such a scheme with short keys.\n  In this paper, we propose the first sequential aggregate signature schemes\nwith short public keys (i.e., a constant number of group elements) in prime\norder (asymmetric) bilinear groups that are secure under static assumptions in\nthe standard model. Furthermore, our schemes employ a constant number of\npairing operations per message signing and message verification operation.\nTechnically, we start with a public-key signature scheme based on the recent\ndual system encryption technique of Lewko and Waters (TCC 2010). This technique\ncannot directly provide an aggregate signature scheme since, as we observed,\nadditional elements should be published in a public key to support aggregation.\nThus, our constructions are careful augmentation techniques for the dual system\ntechnique to allow it to support sequential aggregate signature schemes.

In CTS, digital image of the cheque is protected using\nstandard public key and symmetric key encryptions like RSA, triple DES etc.\nThis involves a lot of computation overhead and key management. The security\nalso depends on the hard mathematical problem and is only computationally\nsecure.Information theoretically secure, secret image sharing techniques can be\nused in the CTS for the secure and efficient processing of cheque image .In\nthis paper, we propose two simple and efficient secret image sharing schemes\nand a Cheque Truncation System based on these algorithms . In the proposed\nscheme,the presenting bank is acting as the dealer and the participants are the\ncustomer, and the drawee bank.The dealer should generate the shares of cheque\nand distributes it to customer and drawee bank.The validity of the shares are\nimportant during the reconstruction process. The proposed scheme also suggests\na method for cheating detection which identify any invalid shares submitted by\nthe customers, using the hashing technique. The experimental results shows that\nthe proposed scheme is efficient and secure compared with the existing scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 11:48:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sreela", "S.

Multi-party\nComputation enable parties to compute some joint function over their private\ninputs.The query results are obtained by performing a secure computation on the\nshares owned by the different servers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 09:02:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "Divya G.", ""], ["Binu", "V.
