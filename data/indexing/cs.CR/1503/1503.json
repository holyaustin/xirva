Given the impressive\nnumber of distance bounding protocols that are designed every year, it becomes\nurgent to provide researchers and engineers with a methodology to fairly\ncompare the protocols in spite of their various properties. This paper\nintroduces such a methodology based on concepts from the decision making field.\nThe methodology allows for a multi-criteria comparison of distance bounding\nprotocols, thereby identifying the most appropriate protocols once the context\nis provided. As a side effect, this paper clearly identifies the protocols that\nshould no longer be considered, regardless of the considered scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 10:29:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Avoine", "Gildas", ""], ["Mauw", "Sjouke", ""], ["Trujillo-Rasua", "Rolando", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.04624", "submitter": "Morgan Barbier", "authors": "Morgan Barbier, Jean-Marie Le Bars, Christophe Rosenberger", "title": "Image Watermaking With Biometric Data For Copyright Protection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we deal with the proof of ownership or legitimate usage of a\ndigital content, such as an image, in order to tackle the illegitimate copy.\nThe proposed scheme based on the combination of the watermark-ing and\ncancelable biometrics does not require a trusted third party, all the exchanges\nare between the provider and the customer.

Video games have two key features that make\nthem attractive cover protocols for censorship circumvention. First, due to the\npopularity of gaming platforms such as Steam, there are a lot of different\nvideo games, each with their own protocols and server infrastructure. Users of\nvideo-game-based censorship-circumvention tools can therefore diversify across\nmany games, making it difficult for the censor to respond by simply blocking a\nsingle cover protocol. Second, games in the same genre have many common\nfeatures and concepts. As a result, the same covert channel framework can be\neasily adapted to work with many different games. This means that circumvention\ntool developers can stay ahead of the censor by creating a diverse set of tools\nand by quickly adapting to blockades created by the censor.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing our coding\nscheme over two real-time strategy-games (including a very popular\nclosed-source game).

In order to deal with malicious\nattacks, k-anonymity solutions have been proposed to partially obfuscate\ntopological information that can be used to infer nodes' identity.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring k-anonymity in time-varying\ngraphs, i.e., graphs with a structure that changes over time, and multi-layer\ngraphs, i.e., graphs with multiple types of links. More specifically, we\nexamine the case in which the attacker has access to the degree of the nodes.\nThe goal is to generate a new graph where, given the degree of a node in each\n(temporal) layer of the graph, such a node remains indistinguishable from other\nk-1 nodes in the graph. In order to achieve this, we find the optimal\npartitioning of the graph nodes such that the cost of anonymizing the degree\ninformation within each group is minimum. We show that this reduces to a\nspecial case of a Generalized Assignment Problem, and we propose a simple yet\neffective algorithm to solve it.

Recently, a novel chaotic Image Cipher using one round Modified\nPermutation-Diffusion pattern (ICMPD) was proposed. Unlike traditional\npermutation-diffusion structure, the permutation is operated on bit level\ninstead of pixel level and the diffusion is operated on masked pixels, which\nare obtained by carrying out the classical affine cipher, instead of plain\npixels in ICMPD. Following a \\textit{divide-and-conquer strategy}, this paper\nreports that ICMPD can be compromised by a chosen-plaintext attack efficiently\nand the involved data complexity is linear to the size of the plain-image.\nMoreover, the relationship between the cryptographic kernel at the diffusion\nstage of ICMPD and modulo addition then XORing is explored thoroughly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 14:02:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yuansheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Leo Yu", ""], ["Wang", "Jia", ""], ["Zhang", "Yushu", ""], ["Wong", "Kwok-wo", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.07000", "submitter": "Aanjhan Ranganathan", "authors": "Ramya Jayaram Masti, Devendra Rai, Aanjhan Ranganathan, Christian\n  M\\\"uller, Lothar Thiele, Srdjan Capkun", "title": "Thermal Covert Channels on Multi-core Platforms", "comments": "15 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Side channels remain a challenge to information flow control and security in\nmodern computing platforms.

One approach for specifying policies is using role based\naccess control (RBAC) where authorization is given to roles instead of users.\nUsers are assigned to roles such that each user can access all the records that\nare allowed to his/her role. RBAC has a great interest because of its\nflexibility. One issue in RBAC is dealing with constraints. Usually, policies\nshould satisfy pre-defined constraints as for example separation of duty (SOD)\nwhich states that users are not allowed to play two conflicting roles.\nVerifying the satisfiability of constraints based on policies is time consuming\nand may lead to errors. Therefore, an automated verification is essential. In\nthis paper, we propose a theory for specifying policies and constraints in\nfirst order logic. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive list of constraints.\nWe identity constraints based on the relation between users and roles, between\nroles and permission on records, between users and permission on records, and\nbetween users, roles, and permission on records.
