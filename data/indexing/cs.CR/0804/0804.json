The traditional formulations of intruder deduction are\nusually given in natural-deduction-like systems and proving decidability\nrequires significant effort in showing that the rules are \"local\" in some\nsense. By using the well-known translation between natural deduction and\nsequent calculus, we recast the intruder deduction problem as proof search in\nsequent calculus, in which locality is immediate. Using standard proof\ntheoretic methods, such as permutability of rules and cut elimination, we show\nthat the intruder deduction problem can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the\nelementary deduction problems, which amounts to solving certain equations in\nthe underlying individual equational theories. We further show that this result\nextends to combinations of disjoint AC-convergent theories whereby the\ndecidability of intruder deduction under the combined theory reduces to the\ndecidability of elementary deduction in each constituent theory.

Under this\ncommunication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the\ncorresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on\nGaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy\ncapacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer\nbound proves to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper\ncoding achievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the\nMGBC-CM is established. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates that both\nusers can achieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic\nsecrecy requirement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Apr 2008 01:52:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Ruoheng", ""], ["Poor", "H.

An example is the positive\npartial transposition criterion. Here we present, for the first time, the\nanalogous thing for secret correlations. We introduce a computable criterion\nwhich certifies that a probability distribution between two honest parties and\nan eavesdropper cannot be (asymptotically) distilled into a secret key. The\nexistence of non-distillable correlations with positive secrecy cost, also\nknown as bound information, is an open question. This criterion may be the key\nfor finding bound information. However, if it turns out that this criterion\ndoes not detect bound information, then, a very interesting consequence\nfollows: any distribution with positive secrecy cost can increase the secrecy\ncontent of another distribution. In other words, all correlations with positive\nsecrecy cost constitute a useful resource.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2008 03:48:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2008 11:16:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Masanes", "Lluis", ""], ["Winter", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4628", "submitter": "Manik Lal Das", "authors": "Manik Lal Das", "title": "Comment - Practical Data Protection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Rawat and Saxena proposed a method for protecting data using\n``Disclaimer Statement''.
