On-line secret sharing is a\nuseful primitive when the set of participants grows in time, and redistributing\nthe secret is too expensive.

The complexity of a\nsecret sharing scheme is the size of the largest share a single participant can\nreceive over the size of the secret.

We show that the gap between these\nvalues can be arbitrarily large even for graph based access structures. We\npresent a general on-line secret sharing scheme that we call first-fit. Its\ncomplexity is the maximal degree of the access structure. We show, however,\nthat this on-line scheme is never optimal: the on-line complexity is always\nstrictly less than the maximal degree. On the other hand, we give examples\nwhere the first-fit scheme is almost optimal, namely, the on-line complexity\ncan be arbitrarily close to the maximal degree.

Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an\ninstance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet\narchitecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network (in\nrouters), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution\nand for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry\napplications that dominate today's Internet.\n  One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be\ndigitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to\ndistributing fake (aka \"poisoned\") content. However, in practice, this poses\ntwo challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to\nsignature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust\ncontext, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which\ncontent. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content\nsignatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning\nattacks.\n  This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning\nattacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation\nof content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management\narchitecture, elements of which we construct while carefully justifying\nspecific design choices.

Accordingly, the distortion under\nthe best of this kind of mechanisms at the worst-case query in a general query\nclass, so called the minimax distortion, provides a fundamental\ncharacterization of differentially private query release.\n  For the general class of statistical queries, we prove that with the\nsquared-error distortion measure, the minimax distortion is $O(1/n)$ by\nderiving asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds in the regime that the\ndatabase size $n$ goes to infinity. The upper bound is achievable by a\nmechanism $\\mathcal{E}$ and its corresponding companion estimators, which\npoints directly to the feasibility of the proposed approach in large databases.\nWe further evaluate the mechanism $\\mathcal{E}$ and the companion estimators\nthrough experiments on real datasets from Netflix and Facebook.
