Namely, in that case, d is the denominator\nof some convergent p_m/q_m of the continued fraction expansion of e/n, and\ntherefore d can be computed efficiently from the public key (n,e).\n  There are several extensions of Wiener's attack that allow the RSA\ncryptosystem to be broken when d is a few bits longer than n^{0.25}. They all\nhave the run-time complexity (at least) O(D^2), where d=Dn^{0.25}. Here we\npropose a new variant of Wiener's attack, which uses results on Diophantine\napproximations of the form |\\alpha - p/q| < c/q^2, and \"meet-in-the-middle\"\nvariant for testing the candidates (of the form rq_{m+1} + sq_m) for the secret\nexponent. This decreases the run-time complexity of the attack to O(D log(D))\n(with the space complexity O(D)).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Nov 2008 07:08:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dujella", "Andrej", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0475", "submitter": "Manoj Prabhakaran", "authors": "Yuval Ishai, Manoj Prabhakaran and Amit Sahai", "title": "Secure Arithmetic Computation with No Honest Majority", "comments": "minor editorial changes", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the complexity of securely evaluating arithmetic circuits over\nfinite rings. This question is motivated by natural secure computation tasks.\nFocusing mainly on the case of two-party protocols with security against\nmalicious parties, our main goals are to: (1) only make black-box calls to the\nring operations and standard cryptographic primitives, and (2) minimize the\nnumber of such black-box calls as well as the communication overhead.\n  We present several solutions which differ in their efficiency, generality,\nand underlying intractability assumptions. These include:\n  1. An unconditionally secure protocol in the OT-hybrid model which makes a\nblack-box use of an arbitrary ring $R$, but where the number of ring operations\ngrows linearly with (an upper bound on) $\\log|R|$.\n  2. Computationally secure protocols in the OT-hybrid model which make a\nblack-box use of an underlying ring, and in which the number of ring operations\ndoes not grow with the ring size. These results extend a previous approach of\nNaor and Pinkas for secure polynomial evaluation (SIAM J. Comput., 35(5),\n2006).\n  3. A protocol for the rings $\\mathbb{Z}_m=\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ which only\nmakes a black-box use of a homomorphic encryption scheme. When $m$ is prime,\nthe (amortized) number of calls to the encryption scheme for each gate of the\ncircuit is constant.\n  All of our protocols are in fact UC-secure in the OT-hybrid model and can be\ngeneralized to multiparty computation with an arbitrary number of malicious\nparties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 11:18:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 16:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 8 Nov 2008 17:54:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ishai", "Yuval", ""], ["Prabhakaran", "Manoj", ""], ["Sahai", "Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.1859", "submitter": "David Arroyo", "authors": "David Arroyo and Gonzalo Alvarez and Veronica Fernandez", "title": "A Basic Framework for the Cryptanalysis of Digital Chaos-Based\n  Cryptography", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Chaotic cryptography is based on the properties of chaos as source of\nentropy. Many different schemes have been proposed to take advantage of those\nproperties and to design new strategies to encrypt information.
