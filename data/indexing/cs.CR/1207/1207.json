These protocols typically assume the presence of direct\ncommunication links from the dealer to all participants, in which case the\ndealer can directly pass the shares of the secret to each participant. In this\npaper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have\ndirect communication links to all the participants, and instead, the dealer and\nthe participants form a general network. Existing methods are based on secure\nmessage transmissions from the dealer to each participant requiring\nconsiderable coordination in the network. In this paper, we present a\ndistributed algorithm for disseminating shares over a network, which we call\nthe SNEAK algorithm, requiring each node to know only the identities of its\none-hop neighbours. While SNEAK imposes a stronger condition on the network by\nrequiring the dealer to be what we call k-propagating rather than k-connected\nas required by the existing solutions, we show that in addition to being\ndistributed, SNEAK achieves significant reduction in the communication cost and\nthe amount of randomness required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 18:01:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 18:56:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2012 00:30:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 01:17:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 19:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Shah", "Nihar B.", ""], ["Rashmi", "K.

The user can access the required\ninformation through sending a request in the form of text to the web server,\nwhich is interpreted by the server side script to construct an SQL. The query\nis sent to the database which responds in order to generate an HTML page that\nis sent back to the user. Since the functioning of web application is a dynamic\nand complicated matter, certain threats to the database security have been\nregistered. One such alarming threat is the prevalence of SQL Injection Attack.\nHence a dynamic algorithm is given in this paper for preventing SQL Injection\nAttacks which is based on context free grammars and compiler parsing\ntechniques. The paper attempts to present the notation of a SQLI Prevent Parser\nfor the prevention of SQL Injection Attacks. This Parser determines the\nstructure of queries and compares whether the queries are functionally\nequivalent or not. This parser has been used on a sample web application and\nthe results have come out to be positive majors to prevent SQL Injection\nAttacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 07:39:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Patwari", "Neha", ""], ["Bhurani", "Parvati", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1700", "submitter": "Nadeem Javaid", "authors": "Z.

Our work focuses on\nthe design of a RFID authentication protocol which uses biometric data and\nwhich confirms the secrecy, the authentication and the privacy. Our protocol\nrequires a PRNG (Pseud-Random Number Generator), a robust hash function and\nBiometric hash function. The Biometric hash function is used to optimize and to\nprotect biometric data. For Security analysis of protocol proposed, we will use\nAVISPA and SPAN tools to verify the authentication and the secrecy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2012 09:16:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chikouche", "Noureddine", ""], ["Cherif", "Foudil", ""], ["Benmohammed", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5844", "submitter": "Andrew Clark", "authors": "Quanyan Zhu, Andrew Clark, Radha Poovendran, and Tamer Basar", "title": "SODEXO: A System Framework for Deployment and Exploitation of Deceptive\n  Honeybots in Social Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CR cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are becoming\nincreasingly popular, a growing number of malicious attacks, such as phishing\nand malware, are exploiting them.
