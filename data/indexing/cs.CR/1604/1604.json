By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can\nmanipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic\nbenefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such\nworks assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or\ndefense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with\nmultiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study\nthe defender-attackers interaction, two game models are considered. In the\nfirst, a Stackelberg game model is used in which the defender acts as a leader\nthat can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers,\nbefore deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties\nof the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the\nequilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited\nsystem information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In\nthe second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot\nanticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, we proposed a hybrid\nsatisfaction equilibrium - Nash equilibrium game and defined its equilibrium\nconcept. A search algorithm is also provided to find the equilibrium of the\nhybrid game. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to\nillustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and\ndefender. Our results show that by defending a very small set of measurements,\nthe grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks\nhave no effect on the system. Moreover, our results show how, at equilibrium,\nmultiple attackers can play a destructive role towards each other, by choosing\nto carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:32:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sanjab", "Anibal", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00204", "submitter": "Cornelius Diekmann", "authors": "Cornelius Diekmann, Stephan-A.

The state-of-the-art approaches to securely\ndelegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client\nmodest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In\nthis work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of\nthe minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum\ncomputation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind\nquantum computing protocols, the \"quantum\" part of the protocol, from the\nclients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum\ncorrelations (independent from the computation) between the client and the\nserver, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only\nclassical communication.

We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the\nclient, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation.

As with any client-server model, the server should not make\nany assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction.

In this paper, we demonstrate the\nprevalence and severity of this vulnerability surface and try to answer why\ndevelopers keep making this seemingly simple mistake. Specifically, we design\nand implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports\nparameter-aware fuzzing and has identified more than 100 vulnerabilities in six\nmajor versions of Android, including the latest version Android 6.0,\nMarshmallow. Some of the vulnerabilities have severe security implications,\ncausing privileged code execution or permanent Denial-of-Service (DoS). We\nanalyzed the root causes of these vulnerabilities to find that most of them\nexist because system service developers only considered exploitations via\npublic APIs. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side\npublic APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder\ninterface - the actual security boundary.
