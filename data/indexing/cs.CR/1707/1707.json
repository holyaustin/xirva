We are thinking of a variety of\nCrypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on.\nThe intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical\ncomputer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads.\nFor example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an\neavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random\ninput --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such\nquestions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated\nmeasures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to\nthe problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider\nrelated problems of (2) humanly computable \"one-way functions\" and (3) humanly\ncomputable \"pseudorandom generators\".\n  The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules\nthan standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons\nto be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern\ncomputability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human\ncomputability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more\nconcrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10^24 (Avogadro\nnumber of) steps.

Secure\nmultiparty computation (SMC) is a viable panacea for this, allowing distributed\nparties to make computations while the parties learn nothing about their data,\nbut the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed\nsettings, it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about\nindividuals to adversaries.

Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a\nnumber for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the\ndevelopment of effective risk-management strategies. We used a Bayesian State\nSpace Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead could be\npredicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model.

Furthermore, in contrast to existing\nnoise-injection based privacy-preserving mechanisms which have to reconfigure\nthe entire network when the topology or number of nodes varies, our approach is\napplicable to dynamic environments with time-varying coupling topologies.

When executing off-chain\ntransactions in current payment networks, parties must access the blockchain\nwithin bounded time to detect misbehaving parties that deviate from the\nprotocol. This opens a window for attacks in which a malicious party can steal\nfunds by deliberately delaying other parties' blockchain access and prevents\nparties from using payment networks when disconnected from the blockchain.\n  We present Teechain, the first layer-two payment network that executes\noff-chain transactions asynchronously with respect to the underlying\nblockchain.

Moreover, while still assuming that the knowledge operator allows\nfor unbounded computation, it can handle the fact that a computationally\nbounded agent cannot decrypt messages in a natural way, by distinguishing\nstrings and message terms. We demonstrate that our logic can capture BAN logic\nnotions by providing a translation of the BAN operators into our logic,\ncapturing belief by a form of probabilistic knowledge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:50:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Halpern", "Joseph Y.", "", "Cornell University"], ["van der Meyden", "Ron", "", "University\n  of New South Wales"], ["Pucella", "Riccardo", "", "Forrester Research"]]}, {"id": "1707.08751", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Joseph Y.

RA is usually realized as an interactive protocol, whereby a\ntrusted party -- verifier -- measures integrity of a potentially compromised\nremote device -- prover. Early work focused on purely software-based and fully\nhardware-based techniques, neither of which is ideal for low-end devices. More\nrecent results have yielded hybrid (SW/HW) security architectures comprised of\na minimal set of features to support efficient and secure RA on low-end\ndevices.\n  All prior RA techniques require on-demand operation, i.e, RA is performed in\nreal time. We identify some drawbacks of this general approach in the context\nof unattended devices: First, it fails to detect mobile malware that enters and\nleaves the prover between successive RA instances. Second, it requires the\nprover to engage in a potentially expensive (in terms of time and energy)\ncomputation, which can be harmful for critical or real-time devices.\n  To address these drawbacks, we introduce the concept of self-measurement\nwhere a prover device periodically (and securely) measures and records its own\nsoftware state, based on a pre-established schedule. A possibly untrusted\nverifier occasionally collects and verifies these measurements. We present the\ndesign of a concrete technique called ERASMUS : Efficient Remote Attestation\nvia Self-Measurement for Unattended Settings, justify its features and evaluate\nits performance. In the process, we also define a new metric -- Quality of\nAttestation (QoA). We argue that ERASMUS is well-suited for time-sensitive\nand/or safety-critical applications that are not served well by on-demand RA.\nFinally, we show that ERASMUS is a promising stepping stone towards handling\nattestation of multiple devices (i.e., a group or swarm) with high mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 20:57:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Carpent", "Xavier", ""], ["Rattanavipanon", "Norrathep", ""], ["Tsudik", "Gene", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09078", "submitter": "Jaouhar Fattahi", "authors": "Jaouhar Fattahi, Mohamed Mejri, Marwa Ziadia, Takwa Omrani, Emil\n  Pricop", "title": "Witness-Functions versus Interpretation-Functions for Secrecy in\n  Cryptographic Protocols: What to Choose?", "comments": "Accepted at the IEEE SMC (6 two column pages) on 2017-07-10", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/SMC.2017.8123025", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.\nOne of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is\nincreasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message\nexchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases.
