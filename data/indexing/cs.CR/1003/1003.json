If an eavesdropper observes a node that is added to the system to\nreplace a failed node, it will have access to all the data downloaded during\nrepair, which can potentially compromise the entire information in the system.\nWe are interested in determining the secrecy capacity of distributed storage\nsystems under repair dynamics, i.e., the maximum amount of data that can be\nsecurely stored and made available to a legitimate user without revealing any\ninformation to any eavesdropper.
