Moreover, these decisions\noften need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthy\nnature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimal\ntiming policy under incomplete information has broad applications in\ncybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application of\npatches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimal\ntiming are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-defined\nattack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case in\npractice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimal\ntiming of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We consider\na variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback and\nunknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutive\nsecurity updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associative\nbandit problem with dependent arms.

The scheme\ncompresses the digital audio signal decoded by a sound card and then encrypts\nit with a three-level chaotic encryption scheme. First, the position of every\nbit of the compressed data is permuted randomly with a pseudo-random number\nsequence (PRNS) generated by a 6-D chaotic map. Then, the obtained data are\nfurther permuted in the level of byte with a PRNS generated by a 7-D chaotic\nmap. Finally, it is operated with a multiround chaotic stream cipher. The whole\nsystem owns the following merits: the redundancy in the original audio file is\nreduced effectively and the corresponding unicity distance is increased; the\nbalancing point between a high security level of the system and real-time\nconduction speed is achieved well. In the ARM implementation, the framework of\ncommunication of multicast-multiuser in a subnet and the Internet Group Manage\nProtocol is adopted to obtain the function of communication between one client\nand other ones.

However, enforcing this strict guarantee\nin practice significantly distorts data and/or limits data uses, thus\ndiminishing the analytical utility of the differentially private results. In an\nattempt to address this shortcoming, several relaxations of differential\nprivacy have been proposed that trade off privacy guarantees for improved data\nutility. In this work, we argue that the standard formalization of differential\nprivacy is stricter than required by the intuitive privacy guarantee it seeks.\nIn particular, the standard formalization requires indistinguishability of\nresults between any pair of neighbor data sets, while indistinguishability\nbetween the actual data set and its neighbor data sets should be enough. This\nlimits the data controller's ability to adjust the level of protection to the\nactual data, hence resulting in significant accuracy loss. In this respect, we\npropose individual differential privacy, an alternative differential privacy\nnotion that offers em the same privacy guarantees as standard differential\nprivacy to individuals (even though not to groups of individuals). This new\nnotion allows the data controller to adjust the distortion to the actual data\nset, which results in less distortion and more analytical accuracy.

At the\nheart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines\nhardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret\nsharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other optimizations\n(i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT\nachieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks.
