The challenges of past work can be overcome by relying on a\ndeeper understanding of realistic home automation usage. More specifically, the\navailability of natural home automation scenarios, i.e., sequences of home\nautomation events that may realistically occur in an end-user's home, could\nhelp security researchers design better security/safety systems. This paper\npresents Helion, a framework for building a natural perspective of home\nautomation. Helion identifies the regularities in user-driven home automation,\ni.e., from user-driven routines that are increasingly being created by users\nthrough intuitive platform UIs. Our intuition for designing Helion is that\nsmart home event sequences created by users exhibit an inherent set of semantic\npatterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and\nuseful scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate\nthat this naturalness hypothesis holds, with a corpus of 30,518 home automation\nevents, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40 users. We then\ndemonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion are reasonable and valid\nfrom an end-user perspective, through an evaluation with 16 external\nevaluators. We further show the usefulness of Helion's scenarios by generating\n17 home security/safety policies with significantly less effort than existing\napproaches. We conclude by discussing key takeaways and future research\nchallenges enabled by Helion's natural perspective of home automation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2019 01:25:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Manandhar", "Sunil", ""], ["Moran", "Kevin", ""], ["Kafle", "Kaushal", ""], ["Tang", "Ruhao", ""], ["Poshyvanyk", "Denys", ""], ["Nadkarni", "Adwait", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.00174", "submitter": "Alejandro Aguado", "authors": "Alejandro Aguado and Victor Lopez and Diego Lopez and Momtchil Peev\n  and Andreas Poppe and Antonio Pastor and Jesus Folgueira and Vicente Martiin", "title": "The Engineering of Software-Defined Quantum Key Distribution Networks", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, Future Internet: Architectures and Protocols issue", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Magazine ( Volume: 57 , Issue: 7 , July 2019 )", "doi": "10.1109/MCOM.2019.1800763", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum computers will change the cryptographic panorama.

In this\npaper, we investigate FS in pre-TLS 1.3 protocols, which do not mandate FS, but\nstill widely used today.

This task\nis complicated when programs enforce value-dependent information-flow security\nproperties (in which classification of locations can vary depending on values\nin other locations) and complicated further when programs exploit\nshared-variable concurrency.\n  Prior work has formally defined a notion of concurrency-aware refinement for\npreserving value-dependent security properties.

As a result, an\napplication using shared libraries loads unused code into memory, which an\nattacker can use to perform code-reuse and similar types of attacks.

Fault Tolerance in Neural Networks is crucial in\nreal-time safety critical applications requiring computation for long\ndurations. Neural Networks with high regularisation exhibit superior fault\ntolerance, however, at the cost of classification accuracy. In the view of\ndifference in functionality, a Neural Network is modelled as two separate\nnetworks, i.e, the Feature Extractor with unsupervised learning objective and\nthe Classifier with a supervised learning objective. Traditional approaches of\ntraining the entire network using a single supervised learning objective is\ninsufficient to achieve the objectives of the individual components optimally.\nIn this work, a novel multi-criteria objective function, combining unsupervised\ntraining of the Feature Extractor followed by supervised tuning with Classifier\nNetwork is proposed. The unsupervised training solves two games simultaneously\nin the presence of adversary neural networks with conflicting objectives to the\nFeature Extractor. The first game minimises the loss in reconstructing the\ninput image for indistinguishability given the features from the Extractor, in\nthe presence of a generative decoder. The second game solves a minimax\nconstraint optimisation for distributional smoothening of feature space to\nmatch a prior distribution, in the presence of a Discriminator network. The\nresultant strongly regularised Feature Extractor is combined with the\nClassifier Network for supervised fine-tuning.

Through a preliminary\nstudy of 231 package-side fixing release of npm projects on GitHub, we observe\nthat a fixing release is rarely released on its own, with up to 85.72% of the\nbundled commits being unrelated to a fix. We then compare the package-side\nfixing release with changes on a client-side (client-side fixing release).\nThrough an empirical study of the adoption and propagation tendencies of 1,290\npackage-side fixing releases that impact throughout a network of 1,553,325\nreleases of npm packages, we find that stale clients require additional\nmigration effort, even if the package-side fixing release was quick (i.e.,\npackage patch landing). Furthermore, we show the influence of factors such as\nthe branch that the package-side fixing release lands on and the severity of\nvulnerability on its propagation. In addition to these lags we identify and\ncharacterize, this paper lays the groundwork for future research on how to\nmitigate lags in an ecosystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 05:22:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:32:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:58:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2021 08:14:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 08:49:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chinthanet", "Bodin", ""], ["Kula", "Raula Gaikovina", ""], ["McIntosh", "Shane", ""], ["Ishio", "Takashi", ""], ["Ihara", "Akinori", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Kenichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03415", "submitter": "Satsuya Ohata", "authors": "Satsuya Ohata, Koji Nuida", "title": "Communication-Efficient (Client-Aided) Secure Two-Party Protocols and\n  Its Application", "comments": "Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows a set of parties to compute a\nfunction jointly while keeping their inputs private.

Second, the blockchain should be resistant\nto network failures, such as cloud services shut down or malicious attack,\nwhile remains the high performance most of the time.\n  This paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a novel notion\ncalled fair validity for Byzantine agreement.

However, we also show that any Byzantine\nagreement could not achieve fair validity in an asynchronous network, so we\nfocus on synchronous protocols. This leads to our second contribution: we\npropose a fair, responsive and partition-resilient Byzantine agreement protocol\ntolerating up to 1/3 corruptions. Fairness means that our protocol achieves\nfair validity. Responsiveness means that the termination time only depends on\nthe actual network delay instead of depending on any pre-determined time bound.\nPartition-resilience means that the safety still holds even if the network is\npartitioned, and the termination will hold if the partition is resolved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 07:43:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chao", "Tzu-Wei", ""], ["Chung", "Hao", ""], ["Kuo", "Po-Chun", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03454", "submitter": "Andreas Nautsch", "authors": "Andreas Nautsch, Jose Patino, Amos Treiber, Themos Stafylakis, Petr\n  Mizera, Massimiliano Todisco, Thomas Schneider, Nicholas Evans", "title": "Privacy-Preserving Speaker Recognition with Cohort Score Normalisation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc.

We\nobserve agreement for 65 of the responded 94 bug reports, which suggests the\nrelevance of security smells for Ansible and Chef scripts amongst\npractitioners. Conclusion: We observe security smells to be prevalent in\nAnsible and Chef scripts, similar to that of the Puppet scripts. We recommend\npractitioners to rigorously inspect the presence of the identified security\nsmells in Ansible and Chef scripts using (i) code review, and (ii) static\nanalysis tools.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2019 17:35:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 20:09:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Rahman", "Akond", ""], ["Rahman", "Md.

Our results span data structure\nupper bounds, cryptographic applications, and data structure lower bounds, as\nsummarized next.\n  First, we apply Fiat--Naor inversion, a technique with cryptographic origins,\nto obtain a data structure upper bound. In particular, our technique yields a\nsuite of algorithms with space $S$ and (online) time $T$ for a preprocessing\nversion of the $N$-input 3SUM problem where $S^3\\cdot T = \\widetilde{O}(N^6)$.\nThis disproves a strong conjecture (Goldstein et al., WADS 2017) that there is\nno data structure that solves this problem for $S=N^{2-\\delta}$ and $T =\nN^{1-\\delta}$ for any constant $\\delta>0$.\n  Secondly, we show equivalence between lower bounds for a broad class of\n(static) data structure problems and one-way functions in the random oracle\nmodel that resist a very strong form of preprocessing attack. Concretely, given\na random function $F: [N] \\to [N]$ (accessed as an oracle) we show how to\ncompile it into a function $G^F: [N^2] \\to [N^2]$ which resists $S$-bit\npreprocessing attacks that run in query time $T$ where\n$ST=O(N^{2-\\varepsilon})$ (assuming a corresponding data structure lower bound\non 3SUM). In contrast, a classical result of Hellman tells us that $F$ itself\ncan be more easily inverted, say with $N^{2/3}$-bit preprocessing in $N^{2/3}$\ntime. We also show that much stronger lower bounds follow from the hardness of\nkSUM. Our results can be equivalently interpreted as security against\nadversaries that are very non-uniform, or have large auxiliary input, or as\nsecurity in the face of a powerfully backdoored random oracle.\n  Thirdly, we give non-adaptive lower bounds for 3SUM and a range of geometric\nproblems which match the best known lower bounds for static data structure\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2019 03:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Nov 2019 23:21:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 Jul 2021 20:59:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Golovnev", "Alexander", ""], ["Guo", "Siyao", ""], ["Horel", "Thibaut", ""], ["Park", "Sunoo", ""], ["Vaikuntanathan", "Vinod", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.08356", "submitter": "Kaiwen Shen", "authors": "Shuqiang Lu, Lingyun Ying, Wenjie Lin, Yu Wang, Meining Nie, Kaiwen\n  Shen, Lu Liu, Haixin Duan", "title": "New Era of Deeplearning-Based Malware Intrusion Detection: The Malware\n  Detection and Prediction Based On Deep Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the development of artificial intelligence algorithms like deep learning\nmodels and the successful applications in many different fields, further\nsimilar trails of deep learning technology have been made in cyber security\narea.

To that end, this paper\nproposes a blockchain based TES that enables agents to receive incentives for\nproviding voltage regulation services by i) maintaining an auditable reputation\nrating for each agent that is increased proportionately with each mitigation of\na voltage violation, ii) utilizing smart contracts to enforce the validity of\neach transaction and penalize reputation ratings in case of a mitigation\nfailure and iii) automating the negotiation and bidding of agent services by\nimplementing the contract net protocol (CNP) as a smart contract. Experimental\nresults on both simulated and real-world ADNs are executed to demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2019 23:05:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 23:12:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:59:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Saxena", "Shivam", ""], ["Farag", "Hany", ""], ["Turesson", "Hjalmar", ""], ["Kim", "Henry M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.08736", "submitter": "Haohan Bo", "authors": "Haohan Bo, Steven H.

For instance, to achieve\ndistributed consensus in the presence of adversaries, the underlying network\ngraph needs to satisfy certain robustness conditions. A typical approach to\nmaking networks structurally robust is to strategically add extra links between\nnodes, which might be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative way of improving network's robustness, that is by considering\nheterogeneity of nodes. Nodes in a network can be of different types and can\nhave multiple variants. As a result, different nodes can have disjoint sets of\nvulnerabilities, which means that an attacker can only compromise a particular\ntype of nodes by exploiting a particular vulnerability. We show that, by such a\ndiversification of nodes, attacker's ability to change the underlying network\nstructure is significantly reduced. Consequently, even a sparse network with\nheterogeneous nodes can exhibit the properties of a structurally robust\nnetwork. Using these ideas, we propose a distributed control policy that\nutilizes heterogeneity in the network to achieve resilient consensus in\nadversarial environment. We extend the notion of $(r,s)$-robustness to\nincorporate the diversity of nodes and provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions to guarantee resilient distributed consensus in heterogeneous\nnetworks.

In this paper, we analyze the online\necosystem of 3rd-parties embedded in top websites which amass the majority of\nonline tracking through 6 time snapshots taken every few months apart, in the\nduration of the last 2 years. We perform this analysis in three ways: 1) by\nlooking into the network activity that 3rd-parties impose on each publisher\nhosting them, 2) by constructing a bipartite graph of \"publisher-to-tracker\",\nconnecting 3rd parties with their publishers, 3) by constructing a\n\"tracker-to-tracker\" graph connecting 3rd-parties who are commonly found in\npublishers. We record significant changes through time in number of trackers,\ntraffic induced in publishers (incoming vs. outgoing), embeddedness of trackers\nin publishers, popularity and mixture of trackers across publishers. We also\nreport how such measures compare with the ranking of publishers based on Alexa.\nOn the last level of our analysis, we dig deeper and look into the connectivity\nof trackers with each other and how this relates to potential cookie\nsynchronization activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2019 12:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2020 01:57:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Solomos", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Ilia", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Ioannidis", "Sotiris", ""], ["Kourtellis", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12908", "submitter": "Hossein Zeinali", "authors": "Hossein Zeinali, Themos Stafylakis, Georgia Athanasopoulou, Johan\n  Rohdin, Ioannis Gkinis, Luk\\'a\\v{s} Burget, Jan \"Honza'' \\v{C}ernock\\'y", "title": "Detecting Spoofing Attacks Using VGG and SincNet: BUT-Omilia Submission\n  to ASVspoof 2019 Challenge", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present the system description of the joint efforts of Brno\nUniversity of Technology (BUT) and Omilia -- Conversational Intelligence for\nthe ASVSpoof2019 Spoofing and Countermeasures Challenge.
