An anomaly\ndetection system is trained only on examples of normal connections, and thus\nhas the potential to detect novel attacks. However, many anomaly detection\nsystems simply report the anomalous activity, rather than analysing it further\nin order to report higher-level information that is of more use to a security\nofficer.

The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global\nsensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we\ntake advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to\nquantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and\na hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to\ntransform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets\nincluding those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of\nthe query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in\nH) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be\ninaccurate.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of\nanswering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of\na graph and a labeling of its vertices. In particular, while our generic\nprocedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as\ngraphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using\ndifferent projection-based techniques.

Still, LDiiP itself\nis classical (monotonic, non-constructive), negation-incomplete, and does not\nhave the disjunction property. The price to pay for the negation completeness\nof our interactive proofs is their non-monotonicity and non-communality (for\nsingleton agent communities only). As a normal modal logic, LDiiP enjoys a\nstandard Kripke-semantics, which we justify by invoking the Axiom of Choice on\nLiiP's and then construct in terms of a concrete oracle-computable function.\nLDiiP's agent-centric internalised notion of proof can also be viewed as a\nnegation-complete disjunctive explicit refinement of standard KD45-belief, and\nyields a disjunctive but negation-incomplete explicit refinement of\nS4-provability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 13:41:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 09:35:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 08:55:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kramer", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5991", "submitter": "Nishant Doshi mr.", "authors": "Nishant Doshi, Devesh Jinwala", "title": "Constant Ciphertext Length in CP-ABE", "comments": "12 pages; NWC, 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ciphertext policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) is a technique in which\nuser with secret key containing attributes, only able to decrypt the message if\nthe attributes in the policy match with the attributes in secret key.

First, paths for\nanonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships\nbetween users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture relies\non a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we propose Pisces, a\ndecentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users'\nsocial links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an\napproach greatly improves the system's resilience to attackers.\n  A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to\ndiscover peers for use in a user's circuit. All existing solutions for secure\npeer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to\nunstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using\nrandom walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected\nnodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To\nsecure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if\nmalicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to\nimprove the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat\napproach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing\ntables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy,\nand use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.\n  Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network\ntopologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active\nattacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized protocol to\nenforce this policy is secure and has low overhead, and (c) the overall\nanonymity provided by our system significantly outperforms existing approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 22:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mittal", "Prateek", ""], ["Wright", "Matthew", ""], ["Borisov", "Nikita", ""]]}]
