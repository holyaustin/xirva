The accuracy of such algorithms depends\nsignificantly on the size of the underlying training dataset; in reality a\nsmall or medium sized organization often does not have the necessary data to\ntrain a reasonably accurate model. For such organizations, a realistic solution\nis to train their machine learning models based on their joint dataset (which\nis a union of the individual ones). Unfortunately, privacy concerns prevent\nthem from straightforwardly doing so. While a number of privacy-preserving\nsolutions exist for collaborating organizations to securely aggregate the\nparameters in the process of training the models, we are not aware of any work\nthat provides a rational framework for the participants to precisely balance\nthe privacy loss and accuracy gain in their collaboration. In this paper, by\nfocusing on a two-player setting, we model the collaborative training process\nas a two-player game where each player aims to achieve higher accuracy while\npreserving the privacy of its own dataset. We introduce the notion of Price of\nPrivacy, a novel approach for measuring the impact of privacy protection on the\naccuracy in the proposed framework. Furthermore, we develop a game-theoretical\nmodel for different player types, and then either find or prove the existence\nof a Nash Equilibrium with regard to the strength of privacy protection for\neach player.

A novel method for\nconstructing a key management service is presented that allows arbitrary\ncomputing hosts on one site to establish multiple secure communication sessions\nwith the hosts of another site. A key exchange protocol is proposed where\nsymmetric private keys are granted to hosts while satisfying the scalability\nneeds of an enterprise population of users. The key management service operates\nwithin a layered architectural style that is able to interoperate with various\nunderlying QKD implementations. Variable levels of security for the host\npopulation are enforced through a policy engine. A network layer provides key\ngeneration across a network of nodes connected by quantum links. Scheduling and\nrouting functionality allows quantum key material to be relayed across trusted\nnodes. Optimizations are performed to match the real-time host demand for key\nmaterial with the capacity afforded by the infrastructure. The result is a\nflexible and scalable architecture that is suitable for enterprise use and\nindependent of any specific QKD technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Dec 2017 13:47:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Tysowski", "Piotr K.", ""], ["Ling", "Xinhua", ""], ["L\u00fctkenhaus", "Norbert", ""], ["Mosca", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.02875", "submitter": "Irina Pashchenko", "authors": "Irina Pashchenko", "title": "One More Way to Encrypt a Message", "comments": "33 pages, 5 formulas, 3 C++ programs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work describes an example of an application of a novel method for\nsymmetric cryptography.

For instance, the fact\nthat two people share a meal describes a relationship independent of the meal's\ningredients. Multiple such relationships give rise to relations and their\nlattices. Lattices have topology. That topology informs the ways in which\ninformation may be observed, hidden, inferred, and dissembled.\n  Dowker's Theorem establishes a homotopy equivalence between two simplicial\ncomplexes derived from a relation. From a privacy perspective, one complex\ndescribes individuals with common attributes, the other describes attributes\nshared by individuals. The homotopy equivalence produces a lattice. An element\nin the lattice consists of two components, one being a set of individuals, the\nother being a set of attributes. The lattice operations join and meet each\namount to set intersection in one component and set union followed by a\npotentially privacy-puncturing inference in the other component.\n  Privacy loss appears as simplicial collapse of free faces. Such collapse is\nlocal, but the property of fully preserving both attribute and association\nprivacy requires a global condition: a particular kind of spherical hole. By\nlooking at the link of an identifiable individual in its encompassing Dowker\ncomplex, one can characterize that individual's attribute privacy via another\nsphere condition. Even when long-term attribute privacy is impossible, homology\nprovides lower bounds on how an individual may defer identification, when that\nindividual has control over how to reveal attributes. Intuitively, the idea is\nto first reveal information that could otherwise be inferred. This last result\nhighlights privacy as a dynamic process. Privacy loss may be cast as gradient\nflow.

Unfortunately, all deep learning classification systems are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work has studied adversarial\nattacks against static analysis-based malware classifiers which only classify\nthe content of the unknown file without execution. However, since the majority\nof malware is either packed or encrypted, malware classification based on\nstatic analysis often fails to detect these types of files. To overcome this\nlimitation, anti-malware companies typically perform dynamic analysis by\nemulating each file in the anti-malware engine or performing in-depth scanning\nin a virtual machine. These strategies allow the analysis of the malware after\nunpacking or decryption. In this work, we study different strategies of\ncrafting adversarial samples for dynamic analysis. These strategies operate on\nsparse, binary inputs in contrast to continuous inputs such as pixels in\nimages. We then study the effects of two, previously proposed defensive\nmechanisms against crafted adversarial samples including the distillation and\nensemble defenses. We also propose and evaluate the weight decay defense.\nExperiments show that with these three defensive strategies, the number of\nsuccessfully crafted adversarial samples is reduced compared to a standard\nbaseline system without any defenses. In particular, the ensemble defense is\nthe most resilient to adversarial attacks.

In order to reduce security vulnerabilities, public cloud providers\noffer firewall functionalities. When properly configured, a firewall protects\ncloud networks from cyber-attacks. However, proper firewall configuration\nrequires intimate knowledge of the protected system, high expertise and\non-going maintenance.\n  As a result, many organizations do not use firewalls effectively, leaving\ntheir cloud resources vulnerable. In this paper, we present a novel supervised\nlearning method, and prototype, which compute recommendations for firewall\nrules. Recommendations are based on sampled network traffic meta-data (NetFlow)\ncollected from a public cloud provider. Labels are extracted from firewall\nconfigurations deemed to be authored by experts. NetFlow is collected from\nnetwork routers, avoiding expensive collection from cloud VMs, as well as\nrelieving privacy concerns.\n  The proposed method captures network routines and dependencies between\nresources and firewall configuration. The method predicts IPs to be allowed by\nthe firewall. A grouping algorithm is subsequently used to generate a\nmanageable number of IP ranges. Each range is a parameter for a firewall rule.\n  We present results of experiments on real data, showing ROC AUC of 0.92,\ncompared to 0.58 for an unsupervised baseline. The results prove the hypothesis\nthat firewall rules can be automatically generated based on router data, and\nthat an automated method can be effective in blocking a high percentage of\nmalicious traffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Dec 2017 09:22:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bargury", "Michael", ""], ["Levin", "Roy", ""], ["Ronen", "Royi", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.09829", "submitter": "Domingo Gomez-Perez", "authors": "Domingo Gomez-Perez and Gu\\'ena\\\"el Renault", "title": "A Probabilistic Analysis on a Lattice Attack against DSA", "comments": "18 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analyzing the security of cryptosystems under attacks based on the malicious\nmodification of memory registers is a research topic of high importance.

The SA-KMP scheme distributes\nrepository containing the bindings of the en-tity's identity and its\ncorresponding public key to each vehicle and road side unit.

We demonstrate the efficiency of the SA-KMP\nthrough performance evaluations in terms of transmission and storage overhead,\nnetwork latency, and key generation time. Analytical results show that the\nSA-KMP is more scalable and outperforms the certificate-based PKI.
