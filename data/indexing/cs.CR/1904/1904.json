The watermark is embedded in the\nrearranged compressed measurements of the object, and then the signal is\ntransmitted through a public network.

In this\nwork, we consider an alternative question: is it possible to fool deep\nclassifiers, over all perceived objects of a certain type, by physically\nmanipulating the camera itself?

This paper\nproposes an unsupervised fast gradient sign method (UFGSM) to attack three\npopular CNN classifiers in BCIs, and demonstrates its effectiveness. We also\nverify the transferability of adversarial examples in BCIs, which means we can\nperform attacks even without knowing the architecture and parameters of the\ntarget models, or the datasets they were trained on.

A purely\nunsupervised methodology is ideal; however, research has shown that even a very\nsmall number of labeled examples can significantly improve the quality of\nanomaly detection. A methodology that minimizes the number of required labels\nwhile maximizing the quality of detection is desirable. False positives in this\ncontext result in wasted effort or blockage of legitimate traffic and false\nnegatives translate to undetected attacks.

To tackle this problem, we\npropose a differentially private approach for training neural networks. Our\napproach includes several new techniques for optimizing both privacy loss and\nmodel accuracy. We employ a generalization of differential privacy called\nconcentrated differential privacy(CDP), with both a formal and refined privacy\nloss analysis on two different data batching methods. We implement a dynamic\nprivacy budget allocator over the course of training to improve model accuracy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively improves\nprivacy loss accounting, training efficiency and model quality under a given\nprivacy budget.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 18:54:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2019 02:31:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2019 00:00:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2019 21:19:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 19 Dec 2019 22:50:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Lei", ""], ["Liu", "Ling", ""], ["Pu", "Calton", ""], ["Gursoy", "Mehmet Emre", ""], ["Truex", "Stacey", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.02368", "submitter": "Stefanos Leonardos Mr.", "authors": "Nikos Leonardos, Stefanos Leonardos, Georgios Piliouras", "title": "Oceanic Games: Centralization Risks and Incentives in Blockchain Mining", "comments": "[Best Paper Award] at the International Conference on Mathematical\n  Research for Blockchain Economy (MARBLE 2019)", "journal-ref": "Mathematical Research for Blockchain Economy, Springer\n  International Publishing, pp.:183-199, (2020)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-37110-4_13", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To participate in the distributed consensus of permissionless blockchains,\nprospective nodes -- or miners -- provide proof of designated, costly\nresources.

In this paper, we show that\nwithout any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker\ncan launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft\ninstances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. We assume\nthat the attacker has no access to any target-specific information, including\nsamples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by\nSoftmax to each class, and thus making the attack target-agnostic. These\nassumptions render all previous attack models inapplicable, to the best of our\nknowledge. To evaluate the proposed attack, we perform a set of experiments on\nface recognition and speech recognition tasks and show the effectiveness of the\nattack. Our work reveals a fundamental security weakness of the Softmax layer\nwhen used in transfer learning settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2019 20:03:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:18:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 06:51:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rezaei", "Shahbaz", ""], ["Liu", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.04433", "submitter": "Yinpeng Dong", "authors": "Yinpeng Dong, Hang Su, Baoyuan Wu, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu, Tong Zhang,\n  Jun Zhu", "title": "Efficient Decision-based Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Face\n  Recognition", "comments": "CVPR 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Face recognition has obtained remarkable progress in recent years due to the\ngreat improvement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Whilst several white-box\nattacks have been proposed for video models, black-box video attacks are still\nunexplored. To close this gap, we propose the first black-box video attack\nframework, called V-BAD.

The idea is that each road side unit (RSU) issues a signed\ntime-stamped tag as a proof for the vehicle's anonymous location. Proofs sent\nfrom multiple consecutive RSUs is used to create vehicle trajectory which is\nused as vehicle anonymous identity. Also, one RSU is not able to issue\ntrajectories for vehicles, rather the contributions of several RSUs are needed.\nBy this way, attackers need to compromise an infeasible number of RSUs to\ncreate fake trajectories. Moreover, upon receiving the proof of location from\nan RSU, the vehicle should solve a computational puzzle by running proof of\nwork (PoW) algorithm. So, it should provide a valid solution (proof of work) to\nthe next RSU before it can obtain a proof of location. Using the PoW can\nprevent the vehicles from creating multiple trajectories in case of low-dense\nRSUs. Then, during any reported event, e.g., road congestion, the event manager\nuses a matching technique to identify the trajectories sent from Sybil\nvehicles. The scheme depends on the fact that the Sybil trajectories are\nbounded physically to one vehicle; therefore, their trajectories should\noverlap. Extensive experiments and simulations demonstrate that our scheme\nachieves high detection rate to Sybil attacks with low false negative and\nacceptable communication and computation overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:57:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Baza", "Mohamed", ""], ["Nabil", "Mahmoud", ""], ["Bewermeier", "Niclas", ""], ["Fidan", "Kemal", ""], ["Mahmoud", "Mohamed", ""], ["Abdallah", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.05853", "submitter": "Noga Agmon", "authors": "Noga Agmon, Asaf Shabtai, Rami Puzis", "title": "Deployment Optimization of IoT Devices through Attack Graph Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3317549.3323411", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Internet of things (IoT) has become an integral part of our life at both\nwork and home.

The effect is uncertainty as to which technical offerings\nadequately match expectations expressed in legal standards. The uncertainty is\nexacerbated by a litany of successful privacy attacks, demonstrating that\ntraditional statistical disclosure limitation techniques often fall short of\nthe sort of privacy envisioned by legal standards.\n  We define predicate singling out, a new type of privacy attack intended to\ncapture the concept of singling out appearing in the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). Informally, an adversary predicate singles out a dataset $X$\nusing the output of a data release mechanism $M(X)$ if it manages to find a\npredicate $p$ matching exactly one row $x \\in X$ with probability much better\nthan a statistical baseline. A data release mechanism that precludes such\nattacks is secure against predicate singling out (PSO secure).\n  We argue that PSO security is a mathematical concept with legal consequences.\nAny data release mechanism that purports to \"render anonymous\" personal data\nunder the GDPR must be secure against singling out, and hence must be PSO\nsecure. We then analyze PSO security, showing that it fails to self-compose.\nNamely, a combination of $\\omega(\\log n)$ exact counts, each individually PSO\nsecure, enables an attacker to predicate single out. In fact, the composition\nof just two PSO-secure mechanisms can fail to provide PSO security.\n  Finally, we ask whether differential privacy and $k$-anonymity are PSO\nsecure. Leveraging a connection to statistical generalization, we show that\ndifferential privacy implies PSO security.

In addition, we design new attacks against ContractChecker exploiting\nvarious limits in real Blockchain systems (e.g., write unavailability,\nBlockchain forks, contract race conditions). We analyze and harden the security\nof ContractChecker protocols against the proposed new attacks.\n  For evaluating the cost, we build a functional prototype of the\nContractChecker on Ethereum/Solidity. By experiments on private and public\nEthereum testnets, we extensively evaluate the cost of the ContractChecker in\ncomparison with that of existing client-based log auditing works. The result\nshows the ContractChecker can scale to hundreds of clients and save client\ncosts by more than one order of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Apr 2019 04:42:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2019 17:03:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:28:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Kai", ""], ["Tang", "Yuzhe", ""], ["Kim", "Beom Heyn", ""], ["Xu", "Jianliang", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06809", "submitter": "Ao Liu", "authors": "Ao Liu, Lirong Xia, Andrew Duchowski, Reynold Bailey, Kenneth\n  Holmqvist, Eakta Jain", "title": "Differential Privacy for Eye-Tracking Data", "comments": "10 pages including appendix", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3314111.3319823", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As large eye-tracking datasets are created, data privacy is a pressing\nconcern for the eye-tracking community.

The system consists of a large number of randomly\n(Poisson-distributed) located access points (APs) serving multiple information\nusers (IUs) and an information-untrusted dual-antenna active energy harvester\n(EH). The active EH uses one antenna to legitimately harvest energy and the\nother antenna to eavesdrop information. The APs are networked by a centralized\ninfinite backhaul which allows the APs to synchronize and cooperate via a\ncentral processing unit (CPU). Closed-form expressions for the average\nharvested energy (AHE) and a tight lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate\n(ESR) are derived. The obtained lower bound on the ESR takes into account the\nIUs' knowledge attained by downlink effective precoded-channel training. Since\nthe transmit power constraint is per AP, the ESR is nonlinear in terms of the\ntransmit power elements of the APs and that imposes new challenges in\nformulating a convex power control problem for the downlink transmission. To\ndeal with these nonlinearities, a new method of balancing the transmit power\namong the APs via relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) which is proved to be\nrank-one globally optimal is derived. A fair comparison between the proposed\ncell-free and the colocated massive MIMO systems shows that the cell-free MIMO\noutperforms the colocated MIMO over the interval in which the AHE constraint is\nlow and vice versa. Also, the cell-free MIMO is found to be more immune to the\nincrease in the active eavesdropping power than the colocated MIMO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:06:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Alageli", "Mahmoud", ""], ["Ikhlef", "Aissa", ""], ["Alsifiany", "Fahad", ""], ["Abdullah", "Mohammed A.

To\nrealize the data extraction directly from the encrypted domain without the\nprivate key, a key-switching based least-significant-bit (KS-LSB) data hiding\nmethod has been designed.
