In this paper, we study security of an ITS\nauthentication scheme proposed by Wegman & Carter, in the case of partially\nknown authentication key. This scheme uses a new authentication key in each\nauthentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly\nUniversal$_2$ hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is\nmeasured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and\nthe uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct\nproofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the\ninformation-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability\nas used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the\nauthentication procedure has a failure probability $\\epsilon$ and the\nauthentication key has an $\\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under\nITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic\nmessage-tag pair is only bounded by $\\epsilon+|\\mT|\\epsilon'$, where $|\\mT|$ is\nthe size of the set of tags. Furthermore, the trace distance between the\nauthentication key distribution and the uniform increases to $|\\mT|\\epsilon'$\nafter having seen an authentic message-tag pair. Despite this, we are able to\nprove directly that the authenticated channel is indistinguishable from an\n(ideal) authentic channel (the desired functionality), except with probability\nless than $\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$. This proves that the scheme is\n($\\epsilon+\\epsilon'$)-UC-secure, without using the composability theorem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 16:19:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Abidin", "Aysajan", ""], ["Larsson", "Jan-\u00c5ke", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.0222", "submitter": "Saravanan Kumarasamy", "authors": "Saravanan kumarasamy, T.

In this paper, we give an unconditional secure\nauthentication scheme for network coding based on a linear code $C$.\nSafavi-Naini and Wang gave an authentication code for multi-receivers and\nmultiple messages. We notice that the scheme of Safavi-Naini and Wang is\nessentially constructed with Reed-Solomon codes.

The\ngeneralization to linear codes has the similar advantages as generalizing\nShamir's secret sharing scheme to linear secret sharing sceme based on linear\ncodes. One advantage of this generalization is that for a fixed message space,\nour scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their\nown messages, while the scheme with Reed-Solomon codes has a constraint on the\nnumber of verifying receivers. Another advantage is that we introduce access\nstructure in the generalized scheme.

One expectation for the future in this field is\nthat, the devices can be developed to support communication with higher data\nrates and more security. Research in this area suggests that a dominant means\nof supporting such communication capabilities will be through the use of\nWireless LANs. As the deployment of Wireless LAN increases well around the\nglobe, it is increasingly important for us to understand different technologies\nand to select the most appropriate one.\n  This paper provides a detailed study of the available wireless LAN\ntechnologies and the concerned issues, will give a brief description of what\nwireless LANs are, the need of Wireless LAN, History of wireless LAN,\nadvantages of Wireless Networks, with summarizing the related work on WLAN in\nacademic area, Wireless LAN technologies, some risks attacks against wireless\ntechnologies, suggesting some recommendations to protect wireless LAN network\nfrom attack, Finally we propose some research issues should be focused on in\nthe future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Mar 2013 04:17:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["AlShourbaji", "Ibrahim", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.1948", "submitter": "Phil Brooke", "authors": "Phillip J.

The\ncurrent architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate\ntransparently with one another, so security would require protecting every\ncomputer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems\ndepend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police\npatrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending\neach individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides\nsecurity against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,\nmembranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself. We\npropose applying these same principles to address the cybersecurity challenge.\nThis will require: (a) Enabling pervasive distribution of self-propagating\nsecurityware and creating a developer community for such securityware, and (b)\nModifying the protocols of internet routers to accommodate adaptive security\nsoftware that would regulate internet traffic. The analysis of the immune\nsystem architecture provides many other principles that should be applied to\ncybersecurity.

A robust CRT was recently proposed for a\nspecial case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli is more\nthan 1 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are\nco-prime. In this special case, a closed-form reconstruction from erroneous\nremainders was proposed and a necessary and sufficient condition on the\nremainder errors was obtained. It basically says that the reconstruction error\nis upper bounded by the remainder error level $\\tau$ if $\\tau$ is smaller than\na quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this paper, we consider the robust\nreconstruction problem for a general set of moduli. We first present a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for a robust\nreconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli and also\na corresponding robust reconstruction method. This can be thought of as a\nsingle stage robust CRT. We then propose a two-stage robust CRT by grouping the\nmoduli into several groups as follows. First, the single stage robust CRT is\napplied to each group. Then, with these robust reconstructions from all the\ngroups, the single stage robust CRT is applied again across the groups. This is\nthen easily generalized to multi-stage robust CRT. Interestingly, with this\ntwo-stage robust CRT, the robust reconstruction holds even when the remainder\nerror level $\\tau$ is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli.

In this paper, we explore the use of KASs in\nentity authentication protocols, where we use derived keys to encrypt\nchallenges. This novel use of KASs permits the efficient authentication of an\nentity in accordance with an authentication policy by associating entities with\nsecurity labels representing specific services. Cryptographic keys are\nassociated with each security label and demonstrating knowledge of an\nappropriate key is used as the basis for authentication. Thus, by controlling\nthe distribution of such keys, restrictions may be efficiently placed upon the\ncircumstances under which an entity may be authenticated and the services to\nwhich they may gain access.\n  In this work, we explore how both standardized protocols and novel\nconstructions may be developed to authenticate entities as members of a group\nassociated to a particular security label, whilst protecting the long-term\nsecrets in the system. We also see that such constructions may allow for\nauthentication whilst preserving anonymity, and that by including a trusted\nthird party we can achieve the authentication of individual identities and\nauthentication based on timestamps without the need for synchronized clocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 14:32:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alderman", "James", ""], ["Crampton", "Jason", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.4264", "submitter": "Wojciech Mazurczyk", "authors": "Pawel Kopiczko, Wojciech Mazurczyk, Krzysztof Szczypiorski", "title": "StegTorrent: a Steganographic Method for the P2P File Sharing Service", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper proposes StegTorrent a new network steganographic method for the\npopular P2P file transfer service-BitTorrent.
