Adversarial examples can\npose potential risks on safety and security critical applications. However,\nexisting defense approaches are still vulnerable to attacks, especially in a\nwhite-box attack scenario. To address this issue, we propose a new defense\napproach, named MulDef, based on robustness diversity. Our approach consists of\n(1) a general defense framework based on multiple models and (2) a technique\nfor generating these multiple models to achieve high defense capability. In\nparticular, given a target model, our framework includes multiple models\n(constructed from the target model) to form a model family. The model family is\ndesigned to achieve robustness diversity (i.e., an adversarial example\nsuccessfully attacking one model cannot succeed in attacking other models in\nthe family). At runtime, a model is randomly selected from the family to be\napplied on each input example. Our general framework can inspire rich future\nresearch to construct a desirable model family achieving higher robustness\ndiversity. Our evaluation results show that MulDef (with only up to 5 models in\nthe family) can substantially improve the target model's accuracy on\nadversarial examples by 22-74% in a white-box attack scenario, while\nmaintaining similar accuracy on legitimate examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 21:22:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2019 01:37:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2019 03:53:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Srisakaokul", "Siwakorn", ""], ["Zhang", "Yuhao", ""], ["Zhong", "Zexuan", ""], ["Yang", "Wei", ""], ["Xie", "Tao", ""], ["Li", "Bo", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00111", "submitter": "Sebastian Angel", "authors": "Sebastian Angel, David Lazar, Ioanna Tzialla", "title": "What's a little leakage between friends?", "comments": "Appears in WPES 2018.

Our considered system model\nconsists of one source, one destination, one untrusted relay, and one Willie.\nThe untrusted relay tries to extract the information signal, while the goal of\nWillie is to detect the presence of the information signal transmitted by the\nsource, in the current time slot. To overcome these two attacks, we illustrate\nthat the destination and the source should inject jamming signal to the network\nin phase I and phase II, respectively. Accordingly, the communication in our\nproposed system model is accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, when\nthe source transmits its data to the untrusted relay the destination broadcasts\nits jamming signal. In the second phase, when the relay retransmits the\nreceived signal, the source transmits a jamming signal with one of its\nantennas. For this system model, we propose a power allocation strategy to\nmaximize the instantaneous secrecy rate subject to satisfying the covert\nrequirements in both of the phases. Since the proposed optimization problem is\nnon-convex, we adopt the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach to\nconvert it to a convex optimization problem. Next, we extend our system model\nto a practical system model where there are multiple untrusted relays and\nmultiple Willies under two scenarios of noncolluding Willies and colluding\nWillies.

While blockchain is thought\nprimarily as the basis of Bitcoin, its application has grown far beyond\ncryptocurrencies due to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts\nare self-enforcing pieces of software, which reside and run over a hosting\nblockchain. Using blockchain-based smart contracts for secure and transparent\nmanagement to govern interactions (authentication, connection, and transaction)\nin Internet-enabled environments, mostly IoT, is a niche area of research and\npractice. However, writing trustworthy and safe smart contracts can be\ntremendously challenging because of the complicated semantics of underlying\ndomain-specific languages and its testability. There have been high-profile\nincidents that indicate blockchain smart contracts could contain various\ncode-security vulnerabilities, instigating financial harms. When it involves\nsecurity of smart contracts, developers embracing the ability to write the\ncontracts should be capable of testing their code, for diagnosing security\nvulnerabilities, before deploying them to the immutable environments on\nblockchains.

Most recent works on adversarial examples for image classification\nfocus on directly modifying pixels with minor perturbations. A common\nrequirement in all these works is that the malicious perturbations should be\nsmall enough (measured by an L_p norm for some p) so that they are\nimperceptible to humans. However, small perturbations can be unnecessarily\nrestrictive and limit the diversity of adversarial examples generated. Further,\nan L_p norm based distance metric ignores important structure patterns hidden\nin images that are important to human perception. Consequently, even the minor\nperturbation introduced in recent works often makes the adversarial examples\nless natural to humans. More importantly, they often do not transfer well and\nare therefore less effective when attacking black-box models especially for\nthose protected by a defense mechanism. In this paper, we propose a\nstructure-preserving transformation (SPT) for generating natural and diverse\nadversarial examples with extremely high transferability.

We note\none of the main reasons for the massive queries is that the adversarial example\nis required to be visually similar to the original image, but in many cases,\nhow adversarial examples look like does not matter much.

Following this approach, we propose two\ntechniques to significantly reduce the query complexity. First, we initialize\nan adversarial example with a gray color image on which every pixel has roughly\nthe same importance for the target model. Then we shrink the dimension of the\nattack space by perturbing a small region and tiling it to cover the input\nimage. To make our algorithm more effective, we stabilize a projected gradient\nascent algorithm with momentum, and also propose a heuristic approach for\nregion size selection.

In\nthis work, through a theoretical study, we investigate the adversarial risk and\nrobustness of classifiers and draw a connection to the well-known phenomenon of\nconcentration of measure in metric measure spaces. We show that if the metric\nprobability space of the test instance is concentrated, any classifier with\nsome initial constant error is inherently vulnerable to adversarial\nperturbations.\n  One class of concentrated metric probability spaces are the so-called Levy\nfamilies that include many natural distributions. In this special case, our\nattacks only need to perturb the test instance by at most $O(\\sqrt n)$ to make\nit misclassified, where $n$ is the data dimension. Using our general result\nabout Levy instance spaces, we first recover as special case some of the\npreviously proved results about the existence of adversarial examples. However,\nmany more Levy families are known (e.g., product distribution under the Hamming\ndistance) for which we immediately obtain new attacks that find adversarial\nexamples of distance $O(\\sqrt n)$.\n  Finally, we show that concentration of measure for product spaces implies the\nexistence of forms of \"poisoning\" attacks in which the adversary tampers with\nthe training data with the goal of degrading the classifier.

Experimental\nresults on two real world datasets demonstrate that SAFE outperforms both the\nsurvival analysis model and recurrent neural network model alone as well as\nstate-of-the-art fraud early detection approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2018 21:28:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 21:12:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Panpan", ""], ["Yuan", "Shuhan", ""], ["Wu", "Xintao", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.04774", "submitter": "Saba Eskandarian", "authors": "Saba Eskandarian, Jonathan Cogan, Sawyer Birnbaum, Peh Chang Wei\n  Brandon, Dillon Franke, Forest Fraser, Gaspar Garcia Jr., Eric Gong, Hung T.\n  Nguyen, Taresh K.

Experimental results show that four known attacks can\nrender standard DNNs useless in classifying Android malware, that known\ndefenses can at most defend three of the four attacks, and that HashTran-DNN\ncan effectively defend against all of the four attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2018 01:39:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Deqiang", ""], ["Baral", "Ramesh", ""], ["Li", "Tao", ""], ["Wang", "Han", ""], ["Li", "Qianmu", ""], ["Xu", "Shouhuai", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.06528", "submitter": "Matt Weinberg", "authors": "Jonah Brown-Cohen, Arvind Narayanan, Christos-Alexandros Psomas, S.\n  Matthew Weinberg", "title": "Formal Barriers to Longest-Chain Proof-of-Stake Protocols", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The security of most existing cryptocurrencies is based on a concept called\nProof-of-Work, in which users must solve a computationally hard cryptopuzzle to\nauthorize transactions (`one unit of computation, one vote').

Although a wide-range of defense techniques have been\ndeveloped against these attacks, the existing mitigation strategies have\nseveral limitations. In particular, most of the existing mitigation approaches\nare based on aborting or restarting the victim program when a memory-safety\nattack is detected, thus making the system unavailable. This might not be\nacceptable in systems with stringent timing constraints, such as cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS), since the system unavailability leaves the control system in an\nunsafe state. To address this problem, we propose CIMA -- a resilient and\nlight-weight mitigation technique that prevents invalid memory accesses at\nruntime. CIMA manipulates the compiler-generated control flow graph to\nautomatically detect and bypass unsafe memory accesses at runtime, thereby\nmitigating memory-safety attacks along the process. An appealing feature of\nCIMA is that it also ensures system availability and resilience of the CPS even\nunder the presence of memory-safety attacks.

To further force the generated samples to be natural, we\nintroduce a second attack constrained on the semantic structure of the face\nwhich has the half speed of the first attack with the success rate of 99.96%.\nBoth attacks are extremely robust against the state-of-the-art defense methods\nwith the success rate of equal or greater than 53.59%.

This study will be useful to software\ndesigners to decide upon the best techniques to use based upon their needs, for\nresearchers to understand the state-of-the-art and for commercial obfuscator\ndevelopers to develop new techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:05:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Renuka", ""], ["Kurian", "Anjana Mariam", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.11057", "submitter": "Naveed Ahmed Azam", "authors": "Naveed Ahmed Azam, Umar Hayat, Ikram Ullah", "title": "Efficient Construction of a Substitution Box Based on a Mordell Elliptic\n  Curve Over a Finite Field", "comments": "We have updated Lemma 4.

In\nmany well-known security systems substitution box (S-box) is the only\nnon-linear component. Recently, it is shown that the security of a cryptosystem\ncan be improved by using dynamic S-boxes instead of a static S-box. This fact\nnecessitates the construction of new secure S-boxes. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient method for the generation of S-boxes based on a class of Mordell\nelliptic curves (MECs) over prime fields by defining different total orders.\nThe proposed scheme is developed in such a way that for each input it outputs\nan S-box in linear time and constant space. Due to this property, our method\ntakes less time and space as compared to all existing S-box construction\nmethods over elliptic curve. Furthermore, it is shown by the computational\nresults that the proposed method is capable of generating cryptographically\nstrong S-boxes with comparable security to some of the existing S-boxes\nconstructed over different mathematical structures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:27:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2019 14:33:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Azam", "Naveed Ahmed", ""], ["Hayat", "Umar", ""], ["Ullah", "Ikram", ""]]}]
