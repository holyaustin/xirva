Our model is similar to the model of bounded-quantum\nstorage, however, we consider an explicit noise model inspired by present-day\ntechnology. To illustrate the power of this new model, we show that a protocol\nfor oblivious transfer (OT) is secure for any amount of quantum-storage noise,\nas long as honest players can perform perfect quantum operations. Our model\nalso allows the security of protocols that cope with noise in the operations of\nthe honest players and achieve more advanced tasks such as secure\nidentification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2007 16:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 16:43:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Jun 2008 18:48:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wehner", "Stephanie", ""], ["Schaffner", "Christian", ""], ["Terhal", "Barbara", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3500", "submitter": "Shiguo Lian", "authors": "Shiguo Lian", "title": "Secure Fractal Image Coding", "comments": "21 pages, 8 figures.

In this paper, a secure fractal image coding scheme is proposed and\nevaluated, which encrypts some of the fractal parameters during fractal\nencoding, and thus, produces the encrypted and encoded image. The encrypted\nimage can only be recovered by the correct key. To keep secure and efficient,\nonly the suitable parameters are selected and encrypted through in-vestigating\nthe properties of various fractal parameters, including parameter space,\nparameter distribu-tion and parameter sensitivity. The encryption process does\nnot change the file format, keeps secure in perception, and costs little time\nor computational resources. These properties make it suitable for secure image\nencoding or transmission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 03:53:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lian", "Shiguo", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3663", "submitter": "P.F.

Combining\nthese two properties we can produce unilateral one-way function and provide a\ncase of utilizing this function to construct encryption algorithm. The\nmultiple-precision (MP) library is used to analyze nonlinear dynamics systems\nand achieve the code. As an example, we provide a scheme of encrypting a\nplaintext by employing the one-way function with Lorenz system.
