A number of voice recognition methods have been\ndeveloped using a pitch estimation process which are very vulnerable in low\nSignal to Noise Ratio (SNR) environments thus, these programs fail to provide\nthe desired level of accuracy and robustness. Also, most text independent\nspeaker recognition programs are incapable of coping with unauthorized attempts\nto gain access by tampering with the samples or reference database. The\nproposed text-independent voice recognition system makes use of multilevel\ncryptography to preserve data integrity while in transit or storage. Encryption\nand decryption follow a transform based approach layered with pseudorandom\nnoise addition whereas for pitch detection, a modified version of the\nautocorrelation pitch extraction algorithm is used. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed algorithm can decrypt the signal under test with\nexponentially reducing Mean Square Error over an increasing range of SNR.\nFurther, it outperforms the conventional algorithms in actual identification\ntasks even in noisy environments.

We apply quantitative approaches to information flow in the\nfirst two cases, and we propose improvements for the usual solutions based on\nprocess equivalences for the third case. In the first scenario we consider the\nproblem of defining the information leakage in interactive systems where\nsecrets and observables can alternate during the computation and influence each\nother. We show that the information-theoretic approach which interprets such\nsystems as (simple) noisy channels is not valid. The principle can be recovered\nif we consider channels with memory and feedback. We also propose the use of\ndirected information from input to output as the real measure of leakage in\ninteractive systems. In the second scenario we consider the problem of\nstatistical disclosure control, which concerns how to reveal accurate\nstatistics about a set of respondents while preserving the privacy of\nindividuals. We focus on the concept of differential privacy, a notion that has\nbecome very popular in the database community. We show how to model the query\nsystem in terms of an information-theoretic channel, and we compare the notion\nof differential privacy with that of min-entropy leakage.In the third scenario\nwe address the problem of using process equivalences to characterize\ninformation-hiding properties. We show that, in the presence of nondeterminism,\nthis approach may rely on the assumption that the scheduler \"works for the\nbenefit of the protocol\", and this is often not a safe assumption. We present a\nformalism in which we can specify admissible schedulers and, correspondingly,\nsafe versions of complete-trace equivalence and bisimulation, and we show that\nsafe equivalences can be used to establish information-hiding properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Nov 2011 13:51:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 15:22:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 13 Feb 2012 18:11:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3093", "submitter": "Vladimir Anashin", "authors": "Vladimir Anashin and Andrei Khrennikov and Ekaterina Yurova", "title": "T-functions revisited: New criteria for bijectivity/transitivity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Designs, Codes and Cryptography, Volume 71, Issue 3 (2014), Page\n  383-407", "doi": "10.1007/s10623-012-9741-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper presents new criteria for bijectivity/transitivity of T-functions\nand fast knapsack-like algorithm of evaluation of a T-function.

Dictionary attacks may\nbe of two kinds: online and offline. While offline dictionary attacks are\npossible only if the adversary is able to collect data for a successful\nprotocol execution by eavesdropping on the communication channel and can be\nsuccessfully countered using public key cryptography, online dictionary attacks\ncan be performed by anyone and there is no satisfactory solution to counter\nthem. This paper presents a new authentication protocol which is called\nCompChall (computational challenge). The proposed protocol uses only one way\nhash functions as the building blocks and attempts to eliminate online\ndictionary attacks by implementing a challenge-response system. This\nchallenge-response system is designed in a fashion that it does not pose any\ndifficulty to a genuine user but is time consuming and computationally\nintensive for an adversary trying to launch a large number of login requests\nper unit time as in the case of an online dictionary attack. The protocol is\nstateless and thus less vulnerable to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Nov 2011 10:20:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Goyal", "Vipul", ""], ["Kumar", "Virendra", ""], ["Singh", "Mayank", ""], ["Abraham", "Ajith", ""], ["Sanyal", "Sugata", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3758", "submitter": "Sugata Sanyal", "authors": "Soumyendu Das, Subhendu Das, Bijoy Bandyopadhyay, Sugata Sanyal", "title": "Steganography and Steganalysis: Different Approaches", "comments": "11 Pages, 5 Figures; International Journal of Computers, Information\n  Technology and Engineering (IJCITAE), Vol. 2, No 1, June, 2008, Serial\n  Publications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Steganography is the technique of hiding confidential information within any\nmedia.

Although that article succeeded\nin developing important tools towards the acquired goal, it failed in putting\nthe tools together in a rigorous and correct way, and the given formal claim on\nthe guaranteed amount of min-entropy needs to be revisited.

Yet, their\nbenefits over existing coding schemes are manifold. First, to overcome the\ncorrupted packets, our codes use information theoretic techniques, rather than\ncryptographic primitives. Thus, no secret channel between the senders and the\nreceivers is required. Second, the encoders in the suggested scheme are\noblivious to the strength of the adversary, yet perform as if its strength was\nknown in advance. Third, the sparse structure of the codes facilitates\nefficient decoding. Finally, the codes easily fit a decentralized scenario with\nseveral sources, when no communication between the sources is allowed.\n  We present both exhaustive as well as efficient decoding rules.

Many existing mechanisms\nfocus on frequency counts of the points in some a priori partition of the\ndomain that is difficult to determine.

Our approach is\nbased on the observation that, the sensitivity of sorting, as a function on\nsets of real numbers, can be bounded. Together with isotonic regression, the\ndataset can be accurately reconstructed. To extend the mechanism to higher\ndimension, we employ locality preserving function to map the dataset to a\nbounded interval. Although there are fundamental limits on the performance of\nlocality preserving functions, fortunately, our problem only requires distance\npreservation in the \"easier\" direction, and the well-known Hilbert\nspace-filling curve suffices to provide high accuracy. The publishing process\nis simple from the publisher's point of view: the publisher just needs to map\nthe data, sort them, group them, add Laplace noise and publish the dataset. The\nonly parameter to determine is the group size which can be chosen based on\npredicted generalization errors.
