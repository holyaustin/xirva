However,\nwork by Laurie and Clayton (2004) has shown that for a uniform proof-of-work\nscheme on email to have an impact on SPAM, it would also be onerous enough to\nimpact on senders of \"legitimate\" email. I suggest that a non-uniform\nproof-of-work scheme on email may be a solution to this problem, and describe a\nframework that has the potential to limit SPAM, without unduly penalising\nlegitimate senders, and is constructed using only current SPAM filter\ntechnology, and a small change to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).\nSpecifically, I argue that it is possible to make sending SPAM 1,000 times more\nexpensive than sending \"legitimate\" email (so called HAM). Also, unlike the\nsystem proposed by Debin Liu and Jean Camp (2006), it does not require the\ncomplications of maintaining a reputation system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2007 02:01:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gardner-Stephen", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5425", "submitter": "{\\L}ukasz Chmielewski Mr.", "authors": "{\\L}ukasz Chmielewski and Jaap-Henk Hoepman", "title": "Fuzzy Private Matching (Extended Abstract)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": null, "abstract": "  In the private matching problem, a client and a server each hold a set of $n$\ninput elements. The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these\ntwo sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and\nnothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain\napplications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that\nreports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a\nprivate matching protocol is called \\emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance,\nwhen elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.\n  We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment.\nElements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show\nthat the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect.\nSubsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first,\nsimple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \\binom{T}{t} (T\n\\log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message\ncomplexity of $O(n T (\\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor\ntime complexity. Additionally, we present protocols based on the computation of\nthe Hamming distance and on oblivious transfer, that have different, sometimes\nmore efficient, performance characteristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2007 13:35:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chmielewski", "\u0141ukasz", ""], ["Hoepman", "Jaap-Henk", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5455", "submitter": "Shujun Li Dr.", "authors": "Shujun Li, Gonzalo Alvarez, Zhong Li and Wolfgang A.
