Recent attacks have all\nexploited the underlying shared hardware. While practical, mounting such a\ncomplicated attack is still akin to listening on a private conversation in a\ncrowded train station. The attacker has to either perform significant manual\nlabor or use AI systems to automate the process. The recent academic literature\npoints to the latter option. With the abundance of cheap computing power and\nthe improvements made in AI, it is quite advantageous to automate such tasks.\nBy using AI systems however, malicious parties also inherit their weaknesses.\nOne such weakness is undoubtedly the vulnerability to adversarial samples.\n  In contrast to the previous literature, for the first time, we propose the\nuse of adversarial learning as a defensive tool to obfuscate and mask private\ninformation. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by first training\nCNNs and other machine learning classifiers on leakage trace of different\nprocesses. After training highly accurate models (99+% accuracy), we\ninvestigate their resolve against adversarial learning methods. By applying\nminimal perturbations to input traces, the adversarial traffic by the defender\ncan run as an attachment to the original process and cloak it against a\nmalicious classifier.\n  Finally, we investigate whether an attacker can protect her classifier model\nby employing adversarial defense methods, namely adversarial re-training and\ndefensive distillation. Our results show that even in the presence of an\nintelligent adversary that employs such techniques, all 10 of the tested\nadversarial learning methods still manage to successfully craft adversarial\nperturbations and the proposed cloaking methodology succeeds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2018 20:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 01:11:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Inci", "Mehmet Sinan", ""], ["Eisenbarth", "Thomas", ""], ["Sunar", "Berk", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.01394", "submitter": "Albert Cheu", "authors": "Albert Cheu and Adam Smith and Jonathan Ullman and David Zeber and\n  Maxim Zhilyaev", "title": "Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling", "comments": "Updated to correct a typo", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-17653-2_13", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of designing scalable, robust protocols for computing\nstatistics about sensitive data.

To\ncircumvent this impediment, we propose an adaptive physical layer\nauthentication scheme based on machine-learning as an intelligent process to\nlearn and utilize the complex and time-varying environment, and hence to\nimprove the reliability and robustness of physical layer authentication.\nExplicitly, a physical layer attribute fusion model based on a kernel machine\nis designed for dealing with multiple attributes without requiring the\nknowledge of their statistical properties. By modeling the physical layer\nauthentication as a linear system, the proposed technique directly reduces the\nauthentication scope from a combined N-dimensional feature space to a single\ndimensional (scalar) space, hence leading to reduced authentication complexity.\nBy formulating the learning (training) objective of the physical layer\nauthentication as a convex problem, an adaptive algorithm based on kernel\nleast-mean-square is then proposed as an intelligent process to learn and track\nthe variations of multiple attributes, and therefore to enhance the\nauthentication performance.

Sensor data contains a lot of sensitive information about the user and\ndevices. However, an attacker inside or near a smart home environment can\npotentially exploit the innate wireless medium used by these devices to\nexfiltrate sensitive information from the encrypted payload (i.e., sensor data)\nabout the users and their activities, invading user privacy. With this in\nmind,in this work, we introduce a novel multi-stage privacy attack against user\nprivacy in a smart environment. It is realized utilizing state-of-the-art\nmachine-learning approaches for detecting and identifying the types of IoT\ndevices, their states, and ongoing user activities in a cascading style by only\npassively sniffing the network traffic from smart home devices and sensors. The\nattack effectively works on both encrypted and unencrypted communications. We\nevaluate the efficiency of the attack with real measurements from an extensive\nset of popular off-the-shelf smart home IoT devices utilizing a set of diverse\nnetwork protocols like WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE. Our results show that an\nadversary passively sniffing the traffic can achieve very high accuracy (above\n90%) in identifying the state and actions of targeted smart home devices and\ntheir users. To protect against this privacy leakage, we also propose a\ncountermeasure based on generating spoofed traffic to hide the device states\nand demonstrate that it provides better protection than existing solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 12:56:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 18:47:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Acar", "Abbas", ""], ["Fereidooni", "Hossein", ""], ["Abera", "Tigist", ""], ["Sikder", "Amit Kumar", ""], ["Miettinen", "Markus", ""], ["Aksu", "Hidayet", ""], ["Conti", "Mauro", ""], ["Sadeghi", "Ahmad-Reza", ""], ["Uluagac", "Selcuk", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.02949", "submitter": "Odemir Bruno PhD", "authors": "Jeaneth Machicao, Marcela Alves, Murilo S.

The more general notion of ramp schemes requires\nthe reconstruction of secret from any $t+g$ shares, for a positive integer gap\nparameter $g$.

Exeum proposes a novel method to provide price stable digital\ntokens whose values are pegged to real world assets, serving as a bridge\nbetween the real world and the decentralized economy.\n  Pegged tokens issued by Exeum - for example, USDE refers to a stable token\nissued by the system whose value is pegged to USD - are backed by virtual\nassets in a virtual asset exchange where users can deposit the base token of\nthe system and take long or short positions. Guaranteeing the stability of the\npegged tokens boils down to the problem of maintaining the peg of the virtual\nassets to real world assets, and the main mechanism used by Exeum is\ncontrolling the swap rate of assets. If the swap rate is fully controlled by\nthe system, arbitrageurs can be incentivized enough to restore a broken peg;\nExeum distributes statistical arbitrage trading software to decentralize this\ntype of market making activity. The last major component of the system is a\ncentral bank equivalent that determines the long term interest rate of the base\ntoken, pays interest on the deposit by inflating the supply if necessary, and\nremoves the need for stability fees on pegged tokens, improving their\nusability.\n  To the best of our knowledge, Exeum is the first to propose a truly\ndecentralized method for developing a stablecoin that enables 1:1 value\nconversion between the base token and pegged assets, completely removing the\nmismatch between supply and demand.

The algorithms render the\ngyroscope and accelerometer sensors useless as they generate road trajectories\nindistinguishable from plausible paths (both in terms of turn angles and roads\ncurvature). We also designed, built, and demonstrated that the magnetometer can\nbe actively spoofed using a combination of carefully controlled coils. We\nimplemented and evaluated the impact of the attack using both real-world and\nsimulated driving traces in more than 10 cities located around the world. Our\nevaluations show that it is possible for an attacker to reach destinations that\nare as far as 30 km away from the true destination without being detected. We\nalso show that it is possible for the adversary to reach almost 60-80% of\npossible points within the target region in some cities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2018 13:00:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Narain", "Sashank", ""], ["Ranganathan", "Aanjhan", ""], ["Noubir", "Guevara", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.03537", "submitter": "Ryan McKenna", "authors": "Ryan McKenna, Gerome Miklau, Michael Hay, Ashwin Machanavajjhala", "title": "Optimizing error of high-dimensional statistical queries under\n  differential privacy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PVLDB, 11 (10): 1206-1219, 2018", "doi": "10.14778/3231751.3231769", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Differentially private algorithms for answering sets of predicate counting\nqueries on a sensitive database have many applications.

The close resemblance of our hash function family with SIS, leads\nus to the first candidate collision-resistant hash function that is both\nnatural and universal in an average-case sense.\n  Finally, our results enrich our understanding of the connections between PPP,\nlattice problems and other concrete cryptographic assumptions, such as the\ndiscrete logarithm problem over general groups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:54:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Sotiraki", "Katerina", ""], ["Zampetakis", "Manolis", ""], ["Zirdelis", "Giorgos", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.06478", "submitter": "Shohreh Hosseinzadeh", "authors": "Shohreh Hosseinzadeh, Hans Liljestrand, Ville Lepp\\\"anen, Andrew\n  Paverd", "title": "Mitigating Branch-Shadowing Attacks on Intel SGX using Control Flow\n  Randomization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3268935.3268940", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a promising hardware-based\ntechnology for protecting sensitive computations from potentially compromised\nsystem software.

We define this model formally using\nappropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability and semantic security\n(which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it QCCA1 in analogy to\nthe classical CCA1 security model.

METHOD: To\nunderstand the industrial impact of the proposed methodology, we considered the\n200 most popular OSS Java libraries used by SAP in its own software. Our\nanalysis included 10905 distinct GAVs (group, artifact, version) when\nconsidering all the library versions. RESULTS: We found that about 20% of the\ndependencies affected by a known vulnerability are not deployed, and therefore,\nthey do not represent a danger to the analyzed library because they cannot be\nexploited in practice. Developers of the analyzed libraries are able to fix\n(and actually responsible for) 82% of the deployed vulnerable dependencies. The\nvast majority (81%) of vulnerable dependencies may be fixed by simply updating\nto a new version, while 1% of the vulnerable dependencies in our sample are\nhalted, and therefore, potentially require a costly mitigation strategy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our case study shows that the correct counting allows software\ndevelopment companies to receive actionable information about their library\ndependencies, and therefore, correctly allocate costly development and audit\nresources, which is spent inefficiently in case of distorted measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2018 12:22:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pashchenko", "Ivan", ""], ["Plate", "Henrik", ""], ["Ponta", "Serena Elisa", ""], ["Sabetta", "Antonino", ""], ["Massacci", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.09897", "submitter": "Nathan VanHoudnos", "authors": "Carson D.

Functional side channels arise when an attacker\nknows that a secret value of a server stays fixed for a certain time. Then, the\nattacker can observe the server executions on a sequence of different public\ninputs, each paired with the same secret input. Thus for each secret, the\nattacker observes a function from public inputs to execution time, for\ninstance, and she can compare these functions for different secrets. First, we\nintroduce a notion of noninterference for functional side channels. We focus on\nthe case of noisy observations, where we demonstrate with examples that there\nis a practical functional side channel in programs that would be deemed\ninformation-leak-free or be underestimated using the standard definition.\nSecond, we develop a framework and techniques for debugging programs for\nfunctional side channels. We extend evolutionary fuzzing techniques to generate\ninputs that exploit functional dependencies of response times on public inputs.\nWe adapt existing results and algorithms in functional data analysis to model\nthe functions and discover the existence of side channels. We use a functional\nextension of standard decision tree learning to pinpoint the code fragments\ncausing a side channel if there is one.
