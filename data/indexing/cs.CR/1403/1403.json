The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing\nmatrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth.\nThey can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete\nand operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to\ninvestigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and\nsymmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we\npropose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from\nmeasurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these\nmodels will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both\nCS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme\nfor parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer\nprotection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random\npermutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable\npermutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the\npermuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix,\nwhich satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming\nprobability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are\nconstructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that\nunlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption\nalways leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of\nembedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance.\nBesides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against\nadditive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 02:47:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yushu", ""], ["Wong", "Kwok-Wo", ""], ["Xiao", "Di", ""], ["Zhang", "Leo Yu", ""], ["Li", "Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6367", "submitter": "Shuling  Wang", "authors": "Shuling Wang and Flemming Nielson and Hanne Riis Nielson", "title": "A Framework for Hybrid Systems with Denial-of-Service Security Attack", "comments": "19 pages, 1 figures, the short version was accepted by FORTE 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.CR cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hybrid systems are integrations of discrete computation and continuous\nphysical evolution.

Towards the embedding\nprocess, several graph theoretic watermarking algorithmic techniques encode the\nwatermark values as graph structures and embed them in application programs.\nRecently, we presented an efficient codec system for encoding a watermark\nnumber $w$ as a reducible permutation graph $F[\\pi^*]$ through the use of\nself-inverting permutations $\\pi^*$.

More precisely, for a specific input $I_{key}$ of\nthe program $P$, our model takes the dynamic call-graph $G(P, I_{key})$ of $P$\nand the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$, and produces the watermarked program $P^*$\nhaving the following key property: its dynamic call-graph $G(P^*, I_{key})$ is\nisomorphic to the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$.

We study this question in the context of a\nrating prediction service based on matrix factorization. We construct a\nprotocol of interactions between the service and users that has remarkable\noptimality properties: it is privacy-preserving, in that no inference algorithm\ncan succeed in inferring a user's private attribute with a probability better\nthan random guessing; it has maximal accuracy, in that no other\nprivacy-preserving protocol improves rating prediction; and, finally, it\ninvolves a minimal disclosure, as the prediction accuracy strictly decreases\nwhen the service reveals less information. We extensively evaluate our protocol\nusing several rating datasets, demonstrating that it successfully blocks the\ninference of gender, age and political affiliation, while incurring less than\n5% decrease in the accuracy of rating prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 16:53:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ioannidis", "Stratis", ""], ["Montanari", "Andrea", ""], ["Weinsberg", "Udi", ""], ["Bhagat", "Smriti", ""], ["Fawaz", "Nadia", ""], ["Taft", "Nina", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.8137", "submitter": "Ravi Sundaram", "authors": "Rajesh Krishnan and Ravi Sundaram", "title": "Secure and scalable match: overcoming the universal circuit bottleneck\n  using group programs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Confidential Content-Based Publish/Subscribe (C-CBPS) is an interaction\n(pub/sub) model that allows parties to exchange data while still protecting\ntheir security and privacy interests.
