These attacks which aim at\ninjecting bogus/spurious data into the receiver, involve inferring transmission\nparameters and finding PHY characteristics of the transmitted signals so as to\nspoof the received signal. Non-contiguous (NC) OFDM systems have been argued to\nhave low probability of exploitation (LPE) characteristics against classic\nattacks based on cyclostationary analysis, and the corresponding PHY has been\ndeemed to be secure. However, with the advent of machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms, adversaries can devise data-driven attacks to compromise such\nsystems. It is in this vein that PHY spoofing performance of adversaries\nequipped with supervised and unsupervised ML tools are investigated in this\npaper. The supervised ML approach is based on deep neural networks (DNN) while\nthe unsupervised one employs variational autoencoders (VAEs). In particular,\nVAEs are shown to be capable of learning representations from NC-OFDM signals\nrelated to their PHY characteristics such as frequency pattern and modulation\nscheme, which are useful for PHY spoofing. In addition, a new metric based on\nthe disentanglement principle is proposed to measure the quality of such\nlearned representations. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of\nthe spoofing adversaries highly depends on the subcarriers' allocation\npatterns. Particularly, it is shown that utilizing a random subcarrier\noccupancy pattern secures NC-OFDM systems against ML-based attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 03:34:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:28:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nooraiepour", "Alireza", ""], ["Bajwa", "Waheed U.", ""], ["Mandayam", "Narayan B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.00200", "submitter": "Edward Raff", "authors": "Edward Raff, William Fleming, Richard Zak, Hyrum Anderson, Bill\n  Finlayson, Charles Nicholas, Mark McLean", "title": "KiloGrams: Very Large N-Grams for Malware Classification", "comments": "Appearing in LEMINCS @ KDD'19, August 5th, 2019, Anchorage, Alaska,\n  United States", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  N-grams have been a common tool for information retrieval and machine\nlearning applications for decades.

However, the core idea of an IDS is a reactive\nmechanism in nature even though it detects intrusions which have already been\nin the system. Hence, the reactive mechanisms would be way behind and not\neffective for the actions taken by agile and smart attackers. Due to the\ninherent limitation of an IDS with the reactive nature, intrusion prevention\nsystems (IPSs) have been developed to thwart potential attackers and/or\nmitigate the impact of the intrusions before they penetrate into the system. In\nthis chapter, we introduce an integrated defense mechanism to achieve intrusion\nprevention in a software-defined Internet-of-Things (IoT) network by leveraging\nthe technologies of cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target\ndefense, namely MTD (i.e., network topology shuffling). In addition, we\nvalidate their effectiveness and efficiency based on the devised graphical\nsecurity model (GSM)-based evaluation framework. To develop an adaptive,\nproactive intrusion prevention mechanism, we employed fitness functions based\non the genetic algorithm in order to identify an optimal network topology where\na network topology can be shuffled based on the detected level of the system\nvulnerability. Our simulation results show that GA-based shuffling schemes\noutperform random shuffling schemes in terms of the number of attack paths\ntoward decoy targets. In addition, we observe that there exists a tradeoff\nbetween the system lifetime (i.e., mean time to security failure) and the\ndefense cost introduced by the proposed MTD technique for fixed and adaptive\nshuffling schemes.

This work shows that mounting\nmore complex COSI attacks such as deanonymizing the owner of an account,\ndetermining if the victim owns sensitive content, and determining the victim's\naccount type often requires considering more than two states. Furthermore,\nrobust attacks require supporting a variety of browsers since the victim's\nbrowser cannot be predicted apriori.

To enable our approach, we\nintroduce the concept of a COSI attack class. We propose two novel techniques\nto generalize existing COSI attack instances into COSI attack classes and to\ndiscover new COSI attack classes.

The randomization\nmodule employs a newly proposed LDP protocol named utility enhancing\nrandomization, which allows LATENT to maintain high utility compared to\nexisting LDP protocols.

The\nsecurity definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based,\nand not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable,\ncomputational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new\ndefinitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational:\na scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into\nan ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to\nblock messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By\nmodifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one\ngets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations\nare composable, resulting in composable security.\n  Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the\nasymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite\nreduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from\nthe ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite\ninstance of some computational problem.

Audits can reveal fraudulent\n(or simply careless) policyholders not following reported security procedures,\nin which case the insurer can refuse to indemnify the policyholder. However,\nthe insurer has to bear an audit cost even when the policyholders have followed\nthe prescribed security procedures. As audits can be expensive, a key problem\ninsurers face is to devise an auditing strategy to deter policyholders from\nmisrepresenting their security levels to gain a premium discount. This\ndecision-making problem was motivated by conducting interviews with\nunderwriters and reviewing regulatory filings in the U.S.; we discovered that\npremiums are determined by security posture, yet this is often self-reported\nand insurers are concerned by whether security procedures are practised as\nreported by the policyholders.\n  To address this problem, we model this interaction as a Bayesian game of\nincomplete information and devise optimal auditing strategies for the insurers\nconsidering the possibility that the policyholder may misrepresent her security\nlevel. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical\nconsideration of post-incident claims management in cyber security.

One naive approach to the problem is adding Laplace random noises,\nhowever, it makes aggregated scores extremely fragile to new types of strategic\nbehaviors tailored to the local privacy setting: data amplification attack and\nview disguise attack.

Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce\nstronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous\nstate-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target\nattack task. We further use the adversarial samples generated by our MAN to\nimprove the robustness of the classification model. It can also achieve better\nclassification accuracy than other methods when attacked by various methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2019 15:59:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Jiangfan", ""], ["Dong", "Xiaoyi", ""], ["Zhang", "Ruimao", ""], ["Chen", "Dongdong", ""], ["Zhang", "Weiming", ""], ["Yu", "Nenghai", ""], ["Luo", "Ping", ""], ["Wang", "Xiaogang", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.05310", "submitter": "Ruffin White", "authors": "Ruffin White and Gianluca Caiazza and Chenxu Jiang and Xinyue Ou and\n  Zhiyue Yang and Agostino Cortesi and Henrik Christensen", "title": "Network Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Excavation of Secure DDS\n  Systems", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 10 sections plus references", "journal-ref": "Workshop on Software Security for Internet of Things (SSIoT) at\n  IEEE EuroS&P 2019", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distribution Service (DDS) is a realtime peer-to-peer protocol that serves as\na scalable middleware between distributed networked systems found in many\nIndustrial IoT domains such as automotive, medical, energy, and defense.

We show that\ngeneral-case covert computation is possible by implementing a set of basic\ncovert logic gates capable of simulating any circuit (functionally complete).\nTo further motivate the study of covert computation, we apply our new framework\nto resolve an outstanding complexity question; we use our covert circuitry to\nshow that the unique assembly verification problem within the growth-only aTAM\nwith negative interactions is coNP-complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Aug 2019 17:31:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2020 19:49:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cantu", "Angel A.", ""], ["Luchsinger", "Austin", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert", ""], ["Wylie", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.06086", "submitter": "Zeyad Al-Odat", "authors": "Zeyad A.

However,\ntheir robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show\nthat using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can\nsignificantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design\nrobust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have\nbeen taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial\nedges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to\ndiscriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean\ngraphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available\nin the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised\nknowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the\nrobustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is\nneglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of\nimproving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean\ngraphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized\naggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial\nedges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a\npoisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to\npenalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts,\nand transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned\ngraph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.

However, the existed\nsolutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain\nbottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'\ncausality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that\nhonest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent\nfor any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.\n  On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global\nblock sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult.

In Sash, the\nblockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control\ndecisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are\ncorrectly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a ``data\nmarketplace'' by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial\ntransaction and providing ``by design'' remuneration to data producers.\nFinally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for\ncryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to\ndistribute decryption keys.

These attacks do\nnot seek to degrade classification accuracy, but rather to have the classifier\nlearn to classify to a target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in\na test example. Launching backdoor attacks does not require knowledge of the\nclassifier or its training process - it only needs the ability to poison the\ntraining set with (a sufficient number of) exemplars containing a sufficiently\nstrong backdoor pattern (labeled with the target class). Here we address\npost-training detection of backdoor attacks in DNN image classifiers, seldom\nconsidered in existing works, wherein the defender does not have access to the\npoisoned training set, but only to the trained classifier itself, as well as to\nclean examples from the classification domain. This is an important scenario\nbecause a trained classifier may be the basis of e.g. a phone app that will be\nshared with many users. Detecting backdoors post-training may thus reveal a\nwidespread attack. We propose a purely unsupervised anomaly detection (AD)\ndefense against imperceptible backdoor attacks that: i) detects whether the\ntrained DNN has been backdoor-attacked; ii) infers the source and target\nclasses involved in a detected attack; iii) we even demonstrate it is possible\nto accurately estimate the backdoor pattern.

AMD SEV encrypts the main memory of virtual machines with\nVM-specific keys, thereby denying the higher-privileged hypervisor access to a\nguest's memory. To enable the cloud customer to verify the correct deployment\nof his virtual machine, SEV additionally introduces a remote attestation\nprotocol.This paper analyzes the firmware components that implement the SEV\nremote attestation protocol on the current AMD Epyc Naples CPU series. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible to extract critical CPU-specific keys that are\nfundamental for the security of the remote attestation protocol.Building on the\nextracted keys, we propose attacks that allow a malicious cloud provider a\ncomplete circumvention of the SEV protection mechanisms.

We show that the severity of our\nproposed attacks is very high as no purely software-based mitigations are\npossible. This effectively renders the SEV technology on current AMD Epyc CPUs\nuseless when confronted with an untrusted cloud provider.
