A source and a destination intend to share secret information over\na Gaussian channel in the presence of a wiretapper who observes the\ntransmission through another Gaussian channel. Two constraints are imposed on\nthe source-to-destination channel; namely, the source can transmit only binary\nphase shift keyed (BPSK) symbols, and symbol-by-symbol hard-decision\nquantization is applied to the received symbols of the destination. An\nerror-free public channel is also available for the source and destination to\nexchange messages in order to help the secret sharing process. The wiretapper\ncan perfectly observe all messages in the public channel. It is shown that a\nsecret sharing scheme that employs a random ensemble of regular low density\nparity check (LDPC) codes can achieve the key capacity of the BPSK-constrained\nGaussian wiretap channel asymptotically with increasing block length. To\naccommodate practical constraints of finite block length and limited decoding\ncomplexity, fixed irregular LDPC codes are also designed to replace the regular\nLDPC code ensemble in the proposed secret sharing scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Sep 2010 21:16:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Oct 2010 15:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 03:51:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Chan Wong", ""], ["Wong", "Tan F.", ""], ["Shea", "John M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3539", "submitter": "Fangying Xiao", "authors": "Fangying Xiao and Hanwu Chen", "title": "Is A Quantum Stabilizer Code Degenerate or Nondegenerate for Pauli\n  Channel?", "comments": "7 pages,1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mapping an error syndrome to the error operator is the core of quantum\ndecoding network and is also the key step of recovery.
