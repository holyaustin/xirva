As the usage of\nmobile devices grows, so does the desire to implement biometric identification\ninto such devices. A large majority of mobile devices being used are mobile\nphones. While work is being done to implement different types of biometrics\ninto mobile phones, such as photo based biometrics, voice is a more natural\nchoice. The idea of voice as a biometric identifier has been around a long\ntime. One of the major concerns with using voice as an identifier is the\ninstability of voice. We have developed a protocol that addresses those\ninstabilities and preserves privacy. This paper describes a novel protocol that\nallows a user to authenticate using voice on a mobile/remote device without\ncompromising their privacy. We first discuss the \\vv protocol, which has\nrecently been introduced in research literature, and then describe its\nlimitations. We then introduce a novel adaptation and extension of the vaulted\nverification protocol to voice, dubbed $V^3$. Following that we show a\nperformance evaluation and then conclude with a discussion of security and\nfuture work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 23:24:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "R.

Unlike cryptography which only scrambles secret\ndata keeping them overt, steganography covers secret data into medium files\nsuch as image files and transmits them in total secrecy avoiding drawing\neavesdroppers suspicions. However, considering that the public channel is\nmonitored by eavesdroppers, it is vulnerable to stego-attacks which refer to\nrandomly trying to break the medium file and recover the secret data out of it.\nThat is often true because steganalysts assume that the secret data are encoded\ninto a single medium file and not into multiple ones that complement each\nother. This paper proposes a text steganography method for hiding secret\ntextual data using two mediums; a Pangram sentence containing all the\ncharacters of the alphabet, and an uncompressed image file. The algorithm tries\nto search for every character of the secret message into the Pangram text. The\nsearch starts from a random index called seed and ends up on the index of the\nfirst occurrence of the character being searched for. As a result, two indexes\nare obtained, the seed and the offset indexes. Together they are embedded into\nthe three LSBs of the color channels of the image medium. Ultimately, both\nmediums mainly the Pangram and the image are sent to the receiver. The\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it makes the covert data hard to be\nrecovered by unauthorized parties as it uses two mediums, instead of one, to\ndeliver the secret data.

Steganography has many requirements, the foremost one is\nirrecoverability which refers to how hard it is for someone apart from the\noriginal communicating parties to detect and recover the hidden data out of the\nsecret communication. A good strategy to guaranteeirrecoverability is to cover\nthe secret data not usinga trivial method based on a predictable algorithm, but\nusing a specific random pattern based on a mathematical algorithm. This paper\nproposes an image steganography technique based on theCanny edge detection\nalgorithm.It is designed to hide secret data into a digital image within the\npixels that make up the boundaries of objects detected in the image. More\nspecifically, bits of the secret data replace the three LSBs of every color\nchannel of the pixels detected by the Canny edge detection algorithm as part of\nthe edges in the carrier image. Besides, the algorithm is parameterized by\nthree parameters: The size of the Gaussian filter, a low threshold value, and a\nhigh threshold value. These parameters can yield to different outputs for the\nsame input image and secret data. As a result, discovering the inner-workings\nof the algorithm would be considerably ambiguous, misguiding steganalysts from\nthe exact location of the covert data.

Improvement of pictorial information for betterment of\nhuman perception like deblurring, de-noising in several fields such as\nsatellite imaging, medical imaging etc are renewed research thrust.\nSpecifically we would like to elaborate our experience on the significance of\ncomputer vision as one of the domains where hardware implemented algorithms\nperform far better than those implemented through software. So far embedded\ndesign engineers have successfully implemented their designs by means of\nApplication Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and/or Digital Signal\nProcessors (DSP), however with the advancement of VLSI technology a very\npowerful hardware device namely the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\ncombining the key advantages of ASICs and DSPs was developed which have the\npossibility of reprogramming making them a very attractive device for rapid\nprototyping.Communication of image and video data in multiple FPGA is no longer\nfar away from the thrust of secured transmission among them, and then the\nrelevance of cryptography is indeed unavoidable. This paper shows how the\nXilinx hardware development platform as well Mathworks Matlab can be used to\ndevelop hardware based computer vision algorithms and its corresponding crypto\ntransmission channel between multiple FPGA platform from a system level\napproach, making it favourable for developing a hardware-software co-design\nenvironment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 05:16:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sangeet", ""], ["pal", "Chandrajit", ""], ["paul", "Rourab", ""], ["Maity", "Satyabrata", ""], ["Sau", "Suman", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6458", "submitter": "Stephen Jordan", "authors": "Gorjan Alagic, Stacey Jeffery, and Stephen P.

In this work, we propose a new notion of\nobfuscation, which we call partial-indistinguishability. This notion is based\non computationally universal groups with efficiently computable normal forms,\nand appears to be incomparable with existing definitions. We describe universal\ngate sets for both classical and quantum computation, in which our definition\nof obfuscation can be met by polynomial-time algorithms. We also discuss some\npotential applications to testing quantum computers.

This protocol enables load-balance among relays to be\nflexibly controlled by a proper setting of the parameter $k$, and covers the\navailable works as special cases, like ones with the optimal relay selection\n($k=1$) and ones with the random relay selection ($k = n$, i.e. the number of\nsystem nodes).
