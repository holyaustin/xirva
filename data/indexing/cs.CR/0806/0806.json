In the presented scheme, the signatory and the receiver can share\na long-term secret key with the arbitrator by utilizing the key together with a\nrandom number. While in previous quantum signature schemes, the key shared\nbetween the signatory and the arbitrator or between the receiver and the\narbitrator could be used only once, and thus each time when a signatory needs\nto sign, the signatory and the receiver have to obtain a new key shared with\nthe arbitrator through a quantum key distribution protocol.

Furthermore the Internet has\nemerged to an important communication medium. These facts and the raising\navailability of broadband internet access has led to the fusion of these two\nservices. Voice over IP or short VoIP is the keyword, that describes this\ncombination. The advantages of VoIP in comparison to classic telephony are\nlocation independence, simplification of transport networks, ability to\nestablish multimedia communications and the low costs. Nevertheless one can\neasily see, that combining two technologies, always brings up new challenges\nand problems that have to be solved. It is undeniable that one of the most\nannoying facet of the Internet nowadays is email spam. According to different\nsources email spam is considered to be 80 to 90 percent of the email traffic\nproduced. The threat of so called voice spam or Spam over Internet Telephony\n(SPIT) is even more fatal, for the annoyance and disturbance factor is much\nhigher. As instance an email that hits the inbox at 4 p.m. is useless but will\nnot disturb the user much. In contrast a ringing phone at 4 p.m. will lead to a\nmuch higher disturbance. From the providers point of view both email spam and\nvoice spam produce unwanted traffic and loss of trust of customers into the\nservice. In order to mitigate this threat different approaches from different\nparties have been developed. This paper focuses on state of the art anti voice\nspam solutions, analyses them and reveals their weak points. In the end a SPIT\nproducing benchmark tool will be introduced, that attacks the presented anti\nvoice spam solutions.

As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is\nunconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter\ncan cause the protocol to fail.

In end-to-end error\ncorrection, it is known that we can correct up to the min-cut between the\nsource and destinations. However, if we use Byzantine detection schemes, we can\ndetect polluted data, drop them, and therefore, only transmit valid data. For\nthe dropped data, the destinations perform erasure correction, which is\ncomputationally lighter than error correction. We show that, with enough\nattackers present in the network, Byzantine detection schemes may improve the\nthroughput of the network since we choose to forward only reliable information.\nWhen the probability of attack is high, a packet-based detection scheme is the\nmost bandwidth efficient; however, when the probability of attack is low, the\noverhead involved with signing each packet becomes costly, and the\ngeneration-based scheme may be preferred.
