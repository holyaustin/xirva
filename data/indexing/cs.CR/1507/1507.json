In the system, when the BS transmits random sequences to\nlegitimate users for sharing common randomness, the eavesdroppers can attempt\nthe pilot contamination attack (PCA) in which each of eavesdroppers transmits\nits target user's training sequence in hopes of acquiring possible information\nleak by steering beam towards the eavesdropper. We show that there exists a\ncrucial complementary relation between the received signal strengths at the\neavesdropper and its target user. This relation tells us that the eavesdropper\ninevitably leaves a trace that enables us to devise a way of measuring the\namount of information leakage to the eavesdropper even if PCA parameters are\nunknown. To this end, we derive an estimator for the channel gain from the BS\nto the eavesdropper and propose a rate-adaptation scheme for adjusting the\nlength of secret key under the PCA.

We present main enabling tools and resulting communication schemes\nin an expository manner, along with key insights and design principles emerging\nfrom them. The main achievable schemes are based on real interference\nalignment, channel prefixing via cooperative jamming, and structured\nsignalling. Real interference alignment enables aligning the cooperative\njamming signals together with the message carrying signals at the eavesdroppers\nto protect them akin to one-time-pad protecting messages in wired systems. Real\ninterference alignment also enables decodability at the legitimate receivers by\nrendering message carrying and cooperative jamming signals separable, and\nsimultaneously aligning the cooperative jamming signals in the smallest\npossible sub-space. The main converse techniques are based on two key lemmas\nwhich quantify the secrecy penalty by showing that the net effect of an\neavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel\ninputs; and the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between\nthe cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate.

Considering the current attacking landscape, it is\nclear that developing secure software should be a main concern in all software\ndevelopment projects. In traditional software projects, security issues require\ndetailed planning in an initial planning phase, typically resulting in a\ndetailed security analysis (e.g., threat and risk analysis), a security\narchitecture, and instructions for security implementation (e.g., specification\nof key sizes and cryptographic algorithms to use). Agile software development\nmethods like Scrum are known for reducing the initial planning phases (e.g.,\nsprint 0 in Scrum) and for focusing more on producing running code. Scrum is\nalso known for allowing fast adaption of the emerging software to changes of\ncustomer wishes. For security, this means that it is likely that there are no\ndetailed security architecture or security implementation instructions from the\nstart of the project. It also means that a lot of design decisions will be made\nduring the runtime of the project. Hence, to address security in Scrum, it is\nnecessary to consider security issues throughout the whole software development\nprocess. Secure Scrum is a variation of the Scrum framework with special focus\non the development of secure software throughout the whole software development\nprocess. It puts emphasis on implementation of security related issues without\nthe need of changing the underlying Scrum process or influencing team dynamics.\nSecure Scrum allows even non- security experts to spot security issues, to\nimplement security features, and to verify implementations.

Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate\nblocks---collections of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's\nledger. Block creation requires nodes to invest computational resources, but\nalso carries a reward in the form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator.\nWhile the protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks,\nstrong nodes can in fact gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create\nand selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish\nmining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a\nspecific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).\n  In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining attacks, and\nprovide an algorithm to find $\\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers within\nthe model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies. As\na consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power\nan attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the\nprofit threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable\nattack -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the\npolicies given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating\nattack-withdrawals.\n  Using our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure\nto selfish mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next,\nwe gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays,\nand show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold\nvanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from\nthe protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of\nselfish mining and double spending attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 13:43:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2015 07:48:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sapirshtein", "Ayelet", ""], ["Sompolinsky", "Yonatan", ""], ["Zohar", "Aviv", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06189", "submitter": "Pablo Buiras", "authors": "Pablo Buiras, Deian Stefan, Alejandro Russo", "title": "On Dynamic Flow-Sensitive Floating-Label Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Flow-sensitive analysis for information-flow control (IFC) allows data\nstructures to have mutable security labels, i.e., labels that can change over\nthe course of the computation.

The problem of outlier detection is to find a small number of\ninstances that are apparently distant from the remaining instances. On the\nother hand, the objective of differential privacy is to conceal presence (or\nabsence) of any particular instance. Outlier detection and privacy protection\nare thus intrinsically conflicting tasks. In this paper, instead of reporting\noutliers detected, we present two types of differentially private queries that\nhelp to understand behavior of outliers. One is the query to count outliers,\nwhich reports the number of outliers that appear in a given subspace. Our\nformal analysis on the exact global sensitivity of outlier counts reveals that\nregular global sensitivity based method can make the outputs too noisy,\nparticularly when the dimensionality of the given subspace is high. Noting that\nthe counts of outliers are typically expected to be relatively small compared\nto the number of data, we introduce a mechanism based on the smooth upper bound\nof the local sensitivity. The other is the query to discovery top-$h$ subspaces\ncontaining a large number of outliers. This task can be naively achieved by\nissuing count queries to each subspace in turn. However, the variation of\nsubspaces can grow exponentially in the data dimensionality. This can cause\nserious consumption of the privacy budget. For this task, we propose an\nexponential mechanism with a customized score function for subspace discovery.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first trial to ensure\ndifferential privacy for distance-based outlier analysis.

It is important to protect the privacy of data in an outsourced\nk-NN system.\n  Prior works have all assumed the data owners (who submit data to the\noutsourced k-NN system) are a single trusted party.

In this work, we present the first framing and exploration of privacy\npreservation in an outsourced k-NN system with multiple data owners. We\nconsider the various threat models introduced by this modification. We discover\nthat under a particularly practical threat model that covers numerous\nscenarios, there exists a set of adaptive attacks that breach the data privacy\nof any exact k-NN system. The vulnerability is a result of the mathematical\nproperties of k-NN and its output. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving\nalternative system supporting kernel density estimation using a Gaussian\nkernel, a classification algorithm from the same family as k-NN. In many\napplications, this similar algorithm serves as a good substitute for k-NN.
