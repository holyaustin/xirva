These third parties are responsible only for the pair-wise key\nestablishment among sensor nodes, so they do not observe the physical\nphenomenon nor route data packets to other nodes. The proposed method is\nexplained here with respect to four important issues: how secret shares are\ndistributed, how local neighbours are discovered, how legitimate third parties\nare verified, and how secure channels are established. Moreover, the\nperformance of the scheme is analyzed with regards to five metrics: local\nconnectivity, resistance to node capture, memory usage, communication overhead,\nand computational burden. Our scheme not only secures the transmission channels\nof nodes but also guarantees high local connectivity of the sensor network, low\nusage of memory resources, perfect network resilience against node capture, and\ncomplete prevention against impersonation attacks. As it is demonstrated in\nthis paper, using a number of third parties equals to 10% of the total number\nof sensor nodes in the area of interest, the proposed method can achieve at\nleast 99.42% local connectivity with a very low usage of available storage\nresources (less than 385 bits on each sensor node).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 21:56:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Almowuena", "Saleh", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.2423", "submitter": "Anumol Joseph", "authors": "Anumol Joseph, K.

Such a dual visibility\nof the friendship may raise privacy threats. This is because both users can\nseparately control the visibility of a friendship link to other users and their\nprivacy policies for the link may not be consistent. Even if one of them\nconceals the link from a third user, the third user may find such a friendship\nlink from another user's friend list. In addition, as most users allow their\nfriends to see their friend lists in most social network systems, an adversary\ncan exploit the inconsistent policies to launch privacy attacks to identify and\ninfer many of a targeted user's friends. In this paper, we propose, analyze and\nevaluate such an attack which is called Friendship Identification and Inference\n(FII) attack. In a FII attack scenario, we assume that an adversary can only\nsee his friend list and the friend lists of his friends who do not hide the\nfriend lists from him. Then, a FII attack contains two attack steps: 1) friend\nidentification and 2) friend inference. In the friend identification step, the\nadversary tries to identify a target's friends based on his friend list and\nthose of his friends. In the friend inference step, the adversary attempts to\ninfer the target's friends by using the proposed random walk with restart\napproach. We present experimental results using three real social network\ndatasets and show that FII attacks are generally efficient and effective when\nadversaries and targets are friends or 2-distant neighbors. We also\ncomprehensively analyze the attack results in order to find what values of\nparameters and network features could promote FII attacks.
