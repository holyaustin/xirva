The concept of verifiable\ncomputation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a\npowerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to\nprovide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested\ncomputations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the\ncomputations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational\nburden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform\na large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily\nverify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical\ncuriosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud\ncomputing systems.\n  Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for\nverifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a\nstate-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation,\noriginally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by\nCormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU,\nobtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art\nsequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces\nthe slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original\ncomputations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small\nruntime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and\nclient-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming\nproblems.

SYN Flooding is a type of DoS\nwhich is harmful to network as the flooding of packets may delay other users\nfrom accessing the server and in severe cases, the server may need to be shut\ndown, wasting valuable resources, especially in critical real-time services\nsuch as in e-commerce and the medical field. The objective of this paper is to\nreview the state-of-the art of detection mechanisms for SYN flooding. The\ndetection schemes for SYN Flooding attacks have been classified broadly into\nthree categories - detection schemes based on the router data structure,\ndetection schemes based on statistical analysis of the packet flow and\ndetection schemes based on artificial intelligence. The advantages and\ndisadvantages for various detection schemes under each category have been\ncritically examined. The performance measures of the categories have also been\ncompared.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 16:42:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Manna", "Mehdi Ebady", ""], ["Amphawan", "Angela", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1895", "submitter": "Ch Suneetha", "authors": "D.

The notion has been recently extended\nto the identity-based setting by Bellare et al. (Eurocrypt'12). We provide one\nmore step in this direction, by considering the notion of hierarchical\nidentity-based (lossy) trapdoor functions (HIB-TDFs). Hierarchical\nidentity-based cryptography has proved very useful both for practical\napplications and to establish theoretical relations with other cryptographic\nprimitives.\n  The notion of security for IB-TDFs put forward by Bellare et al. easily\nextends to the hierarchical scenario, but an (H)IB-TDF secure in this sense is\nnot known to generically imply other related primitives with security against\nadaptive-id adversaries, not even IND-ID-CPA secure encryption. Our first\ncontribution is to define a new security property for (H)IB-TDFs. We show that\nfunctions satisfying this property imply secure cryptographic primitives in the\nadaptive identity-based setting: these include encryption schemes with semantic\nsecurity under chosen-plaintext attacks, deterministic encryption schemes, and\n(non-adaptive) hedged encryption schemes that maintain some security when\nmessages are encrypted using randomness of poor quality.\n  Then, we describe the first pairing-based HIB-TDF realization. Our HIB-TDF\nconstruction is based on techniques that differ from those of Bellare et al. in\nthat it uses a hierarchical predicate encryption scheme as a key ingredient.\nThe resulting HIB-TDF is proved to satisfy the new security definition, against\neither selective or, for hierarchies of constant depth, adaptive adversaries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 08:43:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 08:10:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 11:59:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 07:13:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Escala", "Alex", ""], ["Herranz", "Javier", ""], ["Libert", "Benoit", ""], ["Rafols", "Carla", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.5921", "submitter": "Olivia Saierli", "authors": "Nicolae Constantinescu", "title": "Estimators in Cryptography", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": "Ann.
