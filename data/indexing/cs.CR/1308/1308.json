In this paper, we propose a method to\ndetect this specific kind of counterfeit. Firstly, the color image is converted\nfrom RGB color space to YCbCr color space and then the R, G, B and Y-component\nare splitted into fixed-size overlapping blocks and, features are extracted\nfrom the R, G and B-components image blocks on one hand and on the other, from\nthe DCT representation of the R, G, B and Ycomponent image block. The feature\nvectors obtained are then lexicographically sorted to make similar image blocks\nneighbors and duplicated image blocks are identified using Euclidean distance\nas similarity criterion. Experimental results showed that the proposed method\ncan detect the duplicated regions when there is more than one copy move forged\narea in the image and even in case of slight rotations, JPEG compression,\nshift, scale, blur and noise addition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Aug 2013 19:15:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wandji", "Nathalie Diane", ""], ["Xingming", "Sun", ""], ["Kue", "Moise Fah", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.5996", "submitter": "Sharma Shankar Anandane", "authors": "Harit Shah, Sharma Shankar Anandane, Shrikanth", "title": "Security Issues on Cloud Computing", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1206.2597 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Cloud Computing concept offers dynamically scalable resources provisioned\nas a service over the Internet.Economic benefits are the main driver for the\nCloud, since it promises the reduction of capital expenditure and operational\nexpenditure.In order for this to become reality, however, there are still some\nchallenges to be solved.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving\nconstruction for auction mechanism design in the big data, which prevents\nadversaries from learning unnecessary information except those implied in the\nvalid output of the auction. More specifically, we considered one of the most\ngeneral form of the auction (to deal with the variety), and greatly improved\nthe the efficiency and scalability by approximating the NP-hard problems and\navoiding the design based on garbled circuits (to deal with velocity and\nvolume), and finally prevented stakeholders from lying to each other for their\nown benefit (to deal with the veracity). We achieve these by introducing a\nnovel privacy-preserving winner determination algorithm and a novel payment\nmechanism. Additionally, we further employ a blind signature scheme as a\nbuilding block to let bidders verify the authenticity of their payment reported\nby the auctioneer.
