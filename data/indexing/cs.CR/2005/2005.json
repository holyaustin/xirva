With\nextensive simulations and analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed\narchitectures have the potential to decrease the additional storage cost\nincurred by LiTiChain to zero and improve security at the expense of\ncomputational cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2020 15:33:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Garlapati", "Shravan", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.01654", "submitter": "Jonathan Spring", "authors": "Rawan Al-Shaer and Jonathan M.

It has been studied from different contexts by\nemploying mathematical, psychological, and fuzzy approaches. Image\nsteganography is the art of hiding secret data into an image in such a way that\nit cannot be detected by an intruder. In image steganography, hiding secret\ndata in the plain or non-edge regions of the image is significant due to the\nhigh similarity and redundancy of the pixels in their neighborhood. However,\nthe similarity measure of the neighboring pixels, i.e., their proximity in\ncolor space, is perceptual rather than mathematical. This paper proposes an\ninterval type 2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) to determine the similarity\nbetween the neighboring pixels by involving an instinctive human perception\nthrough a rule-based approach. The pixels of the image having high similarity\nvalues, calculated using the proposed IT2 FLS similarity measure, are selected\nfor embedding via the least significant bit (LSB) method. We term the proposed\nprocedure of steganography as IT2 FLS LSB method. Moreover, we have developed\ntwo more methods, namely, type 1 fuzzy logic system based least significant\nbits (T1FLS LSB) and Euclidean distance based similarity measures for least\nsignificant bit (SM LSB) steganographic methods. Experimental simulations were\nconducted for a collection of images and quality index metrics, such as PSNR,\nUQI, and SSIM are used. All the three steganographic methods are applied on\ndatasets and the quality metrics are calculated. The obtained stego images and\nresults are shown and thoroughly compared to determine the efficacy of the IT2\nFLS LSB method. Finally, we have done a comparative analysis of the proposed\napproach with the existing well-known steganographic methods to show the\neffectiveness of our proposed steganographic method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2020 08:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ashraf", "Zubair", ""], ["Roy", "Mukul Lata", ""], ["Muhuri", "Pranab K.", ""], ["Lohani", "Q.

To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection\nmechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain\nprotocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the\nnext block based on the relative stake held by the node.

We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each\nblock, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the\ndigital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain\npower, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all\nthe valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake\nto enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the\nchain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection\nrule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When\nwe use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to\nvulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant\nfunction implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync\nsatisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence\nit is secure.

The search for ideal secret sharing schemes for some special\ninteresting families of multipartite access structures, has been carried out by\nmany authors. In this paper a new concept of study of ideal access structures\nis proposed. We do not consider special classes of access structures defined by\nimposing certain prescribed assumptions, but we investigate all access\nstructures obtained from uniform polymatroids using the method developed by\nFarr\\`as, Mart\\'i-Farr\\'e and Padr\\'o. They satisfy necessary condition to be\nideal, i.e., they are matroid ports. Moreover some objects in this family can\nbe useful for the applications of secret sharing. The choice of uniform\npolymatroids is motivated by the fact that each such polymatroid defines ideal\naccess structures. The method presented in this article is universal and can be\ncontinued with other classes of polymatroids in further similar studies. Here\nwe are especially interested in hierarchy of participants determined by the\naccess structure and we distinguish two main classes: they are compartmented\nand hierarchical access structures. The vast majority of papers discussing\nhierarchical access structures consider access structures which are compartment\nor totally hierarchical.

To achieve this, we first develop an algorithm to generate adversarial\nphishing URLs. We then reproduce 41 MLPU systems and record their baseline\nperformance. Finally, we simulate an evasion attack to evaluate these MLPU\nsystems against our generated adversarial URLs. Results: In comparison to\nprevious works, our attack is: (i) effective as it evades all the models with\nan average success rate of 66% and 85% for famous (such as Netflix, Google) and\nless popular phishing targets (e.g., Wish, JBHIFI, Officeworks) respectively;\n(ii) realistic as it requires only 23ms to produce a new adversarial URL\nvariant that is available for registration with a median cost of only\n$11.99/year. We also found that popular online services such as Google\nSafeBrowsing and VirusTotal are unable to detect these URLs. (iii) We find that\nAdversarial training (successful defence against evasion attack) does not\nsignificantly improve the robustness of these systems as it decreases the\nsuccess rate of our attack by only 6% on average for all the models. (iv)\nFurther, we identify the security vulnerabilities of the considered MLPU\nsystems.

Selecting the value of\n$K$ induces a classic security-usability trade-off. When $K$ is too large a\nhacker can (quickly) break into a significant fraction of user accounts, but\nwhen $K$ is too low we will start to annoy honest users by locking them out\nafter a few mistakes.

This improves over the truncation method of ABY3\n(Mohassel et al., CCS 2018) that uses RCA and consumes a round complexity that\nis of the order of the depth of RCA.\n  An extensive benchmarking of BLAZE for the aforementioned ML algorithms over\na 64-bit ring in both WAN and LAN settings shows massive improvements over\nABY3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2020 19:18:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Patra", "Arpita", ""], ["Suresh", "Ajith", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.09107", "submitter": "Lior Shafir", "authors": "Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr, and Lior Shafir", "title": "NXNSAttack: Recursive DNS Inefficiencies and Vulnerabilities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper exposes a new vulnerability and introduces a corresponding attack,\nthe NoneXistent Name Server Attack (NXNSAttack), that disrupts and may paralyze\nthe DNS system, making it difficult or impossible for Internet users to access\nwebsites, web e-mail, online video chats, or any other online resource.

Thus, there is a\nneed for a reliable and scalable remote recovery mechanism that works even\nafter attackers have taken full control over devices, possibly misusing them or\ntrying to render them useless.\n  To tackle this problem, we present Lazarus, a system that enables the remote\nrecovery of compromised IoT devices.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital\ncontact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact\ntracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements\nand close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact\ntracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed\nthat higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better\ncontrolled epidemic.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep\nneural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect\nCOVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in\nnumber, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the\nvulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are\nvulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation\n(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we\nfocus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest\nX-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple\niterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure\nresulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,\nwhich cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results\ndemonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,\neven in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average\nnorm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for\nthe nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted\nUAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The\ntargeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given\ntarget class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in\npractical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they\nemphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns.

The\naverage app size has increased three to four times over five years. In this\npaper, we explore a new paradigm of targeted inter-procedural analysis that can\nskip irrelevant code and focus only on the flows of security-sensitive sink\nAPIs. To this end, we propose a technique called on-the-fly bytecode search,\nwhich searches the disassembled app bytecode text just in time when a caller\nneeds to be located. In this way, it guides targeted (and backward)\ninter-procedural analysis step by step until reaching entry points, without\nrelying on a whole-app graph. Such search-based inter-procedural analysis,\nhowever, is challenging due to Java polymorphism, callbacks, asynchronous\nflows, static initializers, and inter-component communication in Android apps.\nWe overcome these unique obstacles in our context by proposing a set of\nbytecode search mechanisms that utilize flexible searches and forward object\ntaint analysis. Atop of this new inter-procedural analysis, we further adjust\nthe traditional backward slicing and forward constant propagation to provide\nthe complete dataflow tracking of sink API calls. We have implemented a\nprototype called BackDroid and compared it with Amandroid in analyzing 3,178\nmodern popular apps for crypto and SSL misconfigurations. The evaluation shows\nthat for such sink-based problems, BackDroid is 37 times faster (2.13 v.s.\n78.15 minutes) and has no timed-out failure (v.s. 35% in Amandroid), while\nmaintaining close or even better detection effectiveness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 May 2020 12:50:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Daoyuan", ""], ["Gao", "Debin", ""], ["Deng", "Robert H.", ""], ["Chang", "Rocky K.

Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be\nmodified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting\ntarget for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing\nmillions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety\nof tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on\nsymbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation.\nRecently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts.\nHowever, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less\neffective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving\nlow code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to\nachieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination\nof symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on\nsmart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart\ncontracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a\nsmart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex\nconditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts.\nMoreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently\ngenerate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract\nstates in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius\nby comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for\nsmart contracts.

Secure Multi-Execution (SME)\npromises to provide secure IFC without modifying the behaviour of already\nsecure programs, a property known as transparency. Implementations of SME exist\nfor the web and as plug-ins to several programming languages. Furthermore, SME\ncan in theory work in a black-box manner, meaning that it can be programming\nlanguage agnostic, making it perfect for securing legacy or third-party\nsystems.

The question is, how come, given all these advantages, that\nthese techniques are not ubiquitous in practice? The answer lies, partially, in\nthe issue of runtime and memory overhead. SME and its variants are\nprohibitively expensive to deploy in many non-trivial situations. Why is this\nthe case? On the surface, the reason is simple. The techniques in the SME\nfamily all rely on the idea of multi-execution, running all or parts of a\nprogram multiple times to achieve noninterference. Naturally, this causes\noverhead.

Facing the\nincreasingly complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security\npolicy management mechanism which can be completely transparent to any\nunderlying information.

Most of the previously proposed SAT-based cryptanalysis\napproaches are blackbox techniques, in the sense that the cryptanalysis problem\nis encoded as a SAT instance and then a CDCL SAT solver is invoked to solve the\nsaid instance. A weakness of this approach is that the encoding thus generated\nmay be too large for any modern solver to solve efficiently.

Ironically and perhaps unfortunately, these\ndeletions make users more susceptible to privacy violations by malicious actors\nwho specifically hunt post deletions at large scale. The reason for such\nhunting is simple: deleting a post acts as a powerful signal that the post\nmight be damaging to its owner. Today, multiple archival services are already\nscanning social media for these deleted posts. Moreover, as we demonstrate in\nthis work, powerful machine learning models can detect damaging deletions at\nscale.\n  Towards restraining such a global adversary against users' right to be\nforgotten, we introduce Deceptive Deletion, a decoy mechanism that minimizes\nthe adversarial advantage. Our mechanism injects decoy deletions, hence\ncreating a two-player minmax game between an adversary that seeks to classify\ndamaging content among the deleted posts and a challenger that employs decoy\ndeletions to masquerade real damaging deletions. We formalize the Deceptive\nGame between the two players, determine conditions under which either the\nadversary or the challenger provably wins the game, and discuss the scenarios\nin-between these two extremes. We apply the Deceptive Deletion mechanism to a\nreal-world task on Twitter: hiding damaging tweet deletions.

Key to our solution is the use of online active learning,\nwhich iteratively updates the models by sampling payloads that are estimated to\nmaximally improve them. We evaluate the efficacy of active fuzzing by\nimplementing it for a water purification plant testbed, finding it can\nautomatically discover a test suite of flow, pressure, and over/underflow\nattacks, all with substantially less time, data, and network access than the\nmost comparable approach.

We study changes in\nvulnerabilities, code quality, project activity, and software engineering\npractices.\n  Method: We use a mixed methods approach, collecting multiple types of\nquantitative data and qualitative data from web sites and an interview with a\ndeveloper who worked on post-Heartbleed changes. We use regression\ndiscontinuity analysis to determine changes in levels and slopes of code and\nproject activity metrics resulting from Heartbleed.\n  Results: The OpenSSL project made tremendous improvements to code quality and\nsecurity after Heartbleed. By the end of 2016, the number of commits per month\nhad tripled, 91 vulnerabilities were found and fixed, code complexity decreased\nsignificantly, and OpenSSL obtained a CII best practices badge, certifying its\nuse of good open source development practices.\n  Conclusions: The OpenSSL project provides a model of how an open source\nproject can adapt and improve after a security event. The evolution of OpenSSL\nshows that the number of known vulnerabilities is not a useful indicator of\nproject security.

This paper proposes a blockchain-enabled framework for P2P energy\ntrading among producer and consumer agents in a smart grid. A fully\ndecentralized market settlement mechanism is designed, which does not rely on a\ncentralized entity to settle the market and encourages producers and consumers\nto negotiate on energy trading with their nearby agents truthfully. To this\nend, the electrical distance of agents is considered in the pricing mechanism\nto encourage agents to trade with their neighboring agents. In addition, a\nreputation factor is considered for each agent, reflecting its past performance\nin delivering the committed energy. Before starting the negotiation, agents\nselect their trading partners based on their preferences over the reputation\nand proximity of the trading partners. An Anonymous Proof of Location (A-PoL)\nalgorithm is proposed that allows agents to prove their location without\nrevealing their real identity. The practicality of the proposed framework is\nillustrated through several case studies, and its security and privacy are\nanalyzed in detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 06:49:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Khorasany", "Mohsen", ""], ["Dorri", "Ali", ""], ["Razzaghi", "Reza", ""], ["Jurdak", "Raja", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.14585", "submitter": "Jiska Classen", "authors": "Jiska Classen, Matthias Hollick", "title": "DEMO: Extracting Physical-Layer BLE Advertisement Information from\n  Broadcom and Cypress Chips", "comments": "13th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile\n  Networks", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3395351.3401699", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multiple initiatives propose utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)\nadvertisements for contact tracing and SARS-CoV-2 exposure notifications.

Although a few media reports mentioned the\nexistence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks\nthe understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In\nthis paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android\nmalware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile\napp dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique\napps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time\nof mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple\nperspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious\nbehaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed\napps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic\nbroke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using\nthe same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their\nmain purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit\nby using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the\nCOVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a\nlong time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious\ndevelopers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including\nEnglish-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate\nfuture research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19\nthemed apps (and malware) to the research community.

Petit (2017) was the first to demonstrate that torsion point\ninformation could noticeably lower the difficulty of finding secret isogenies.\nIn particular, Petit showed that \"overstretched\" parameterizations of SIDH\ncould be broken in polynomial time. However, this did not impact the security\nof any cryptosystems proposed in the literature. The contribution of this paper\nis twofold: First, we strengthen the techniques of Petit by exploiting\nadditional information coming from a dual and a Frobenius isogeny. This extends\nthe impact of torsion point attacks considerably. In particular, our techniques\nyield a classical attack that completely breaks the n-party group key exchange\nof Azarderakhsh et al. for 6 parties or more, and a quantum attack for 3\nparties or more that improves on the best known asymptotic complexity. We also\nprovide a Magma implementation of our attack for 6 parties. We give the full\nrange of parameters for which our attacks apply.
