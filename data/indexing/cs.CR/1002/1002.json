Our objective is\nto incorporate the volatility of the users biometric features into the\ngenerated key, so as to make the key unguessable to an attacker lacking\nsignificant knowledge of the users biometrics. We go one step further trying to\nincorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation so\nas to provide better security.

The proposed approach is composed of three modules\nnamely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and\n3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and\ntexture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images\nrespectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the\nfeature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit\nsecure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template. For\nexperimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly\navailable sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database.
