Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point\n(AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are\nrequired to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to\nthe wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that\ndo not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are\nconnected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to\nconventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other\nnetworks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for\nWMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols\nfor WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all\nassumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does\nnot hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in\nWMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First,\nit identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and\nthe network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality,\ndata integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed.\nThen various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed.\nAfter enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network\nlayer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for\nthese attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Feb 2011 03:49:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1237", "submitter": "Vadim Zaliva", "authors": "Vadim Zaliva", "title": "Applying static code analysis to firewall policies for the purpose of\n  anomaly detection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Treating modern firewall policy languages as imperative, special purpose\nprogramming languages, in this article we will try to apply static code\nanalysis techniques for the purpose of anomaly detection.\n  We will first abstract a policy in common firewall policy language into an\nintermediate language, and then we will try to apply anomaly detection\nalgorithms to it.\n  The contributions made by this work are:\n  1.

Even within the\nphone, different apps with different privileges can communicate with one\nanother, allowing one app to trick another into improperly exercising its\nprivileges (a Confused Deputy attack). In Quire, we engineered two new security\nmechanisms into Android to address these issues. First, we track the call chain\nof IPCs, allowing an app the choice of operating with the diminished privileges\nof its callers or to act explicitly on its own behalf. Second, a lightweight\nsignature scheme allows any app to create a signed statement that can be\nverified anywhere inside the phone. Both of these mechanisms are reflected in\nnetwork RPCs, allowing remote systems visibility into the state of the phone\nwhen an RPC is made. We demonstrate the usefulness of Quire with two example\napplications. We built an advertising service, running distinctly from the app\nwhich wants to display ads, which can validate clicks passed to it from its\nhost. We also built a payment service, allowing an app to issue a request which\nthe payment service validates with the user.

The aim of the SecCo workshop\nseries is to cover the gap between the security and the concurrency\ncommunities. More precisely, the workshop promotes the exchange of ideas,\ntrying to focus on common interests and stimulating discussions on central\nresearch questions. In particular, we called for papers dealing with security\nissues (such as authentication, integrity, privacy, confidentiality, access\ncontrol, denial of service, service availability, safety aspects, fault\ntolerance, trust, language-based security, probabilistic and information\ntheoretic models) in emerging fields like web services, mobile ad-hoc networks,\nagent-based infrastructures, peer-to-peer systems, context-aware computing,\nglobal/ubiquitous/pervasive computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 05:22:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", "", "University of Eindhoven, Netherlands"], ["Cortier", "V\u00e9ronique", "", "LORIA-CNRS, France"]]}, {"id": "1102.5191", "submitter": "Eric Lim", "authors": "Ghizlane Orhanou, Said El Hajji, Youssef Bentaleb and Jalal Laassiri", "title": "EPS Confidentiality and Integrity mechanisms Algorithmic Approach", "comments": "Available online at http://ijcsi.org", "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7,\n  Issue 4, No 4, July 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Long Term Evolution of UMTS is one of the latest steps in an advancing\nseries of mobile telecommunications systems.

A strong extractor takes two inputs, a weakly-random x and a\nuniformly random seed y, and outputs a string which appears uniform, even given\ny. For a non-malleable extractor nmExt, the output nmExt(x,y) should appear\nuniform given y as well as nmExt(x,A(y)), where A is an arbitrary function with\nA(y) not equal to y.\n  We show that an extractor introduced by Chor and Goldreich is non-malleable\nwhen the entropy rate is above half. It outputs a linear number of bits when\nthe entropy rate is 1/2 + alpha, for any alpha>0. Previously, no nontrivial\nparameters were known for any non-malleable extractor. To achieve a polynomial\nrunning time when outputting many bits, we rely on a widely-believed conjecture\nabout the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Our\nanalysis involves a character sum estimate, which may be of independent\ninterest.\n  Using our non-malleable extractor, we obtain protocols for \"privacy\namplification\": key agreement between two parties who share a weakly-random\nsecret. Our protocols work in the presence of an active adversary with\nunlimited computational power, and have asymptotically optimal entropy loss.\nWhen the secret has entropy rate greater than 1/2, the protocol follows from a\nresult of Dodis and Wichs, and takes two rounds. When the secret has entropy\nrate delta for any constant delta>0, our new protocol takes a constant\n(polynomial in 1/delta) number of rounds. Our protocols run in polynomial time\nunder the above well-known conjecture about primes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 14:17:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Mar 2011 18:07:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 15 Apr 2011 04:35:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 16:56:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2011 17:06:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 3 Sep 2011 16:20:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dodis", "Yevgeniy", ""], ["Li", "Xin", ""], ["Wooley", "Trevor D.", ""], ["Zuckerman", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5495", "submitter": "David Nowak", "authors": "Sylvain Heraud and David Nowak", "title": "A Formalization of Polytime Functions", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-22863-6_11", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.CR cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a deep embedding of Bellantoni and Cook's syntactic\ncharacterization of polytime functions.

A Petri net\nrepresents the composition of a controlled and a controller systems, possibly\nsharing places and transitions. Low transitions represent local actions of the\ncontrolled system, high transitions represent local decisions of the\ncontroller, and downgrading transitions represent synchronized actions of both\ncomponents.
