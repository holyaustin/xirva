In this paper we provide\ntwo primary contributions to the security evaluation literature - a\nrepresentative survey, and a novel framework for evaluating security that is\nflexible, applicable to all three use cases, and readily interpretable. In our\nsurvey of the literature we identify the distinct themes from each community's\nevaluation procedures side by side and flesh out the drawbacks and benefits of\neach. The evaluation framework we propose includes comprehensively modeling the\nresource, labor, and attack costs in dollars incurred based on expected\nresource usage, accuracy metrics, and time. This framework provides a unified\napproach in that it incorporates the accuracy and performance metrics, which\ndominate intrusion detection evaluation, the time to detection and impact to\ndata and resources of an attack, favored by educational competitions' metrics,\nand the monetary cost of many essential security components used in financial\nanalysis. Moreover, it is flexible enough to accommodate each use case, easily\ninterpretable and comparable, and comprehensive in terms of costs\nconsidered.Finally, we provide two examples of the framework applied to\nreal-world use cases. Overall, we provide a survey and a grounded, flexible\nframework with multiple concrete examples for evaluating security which can\naddress the needs of three currently distinct communities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:09:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2019 02:22:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2019 22:17:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Iannacone", "Michael D.", ""], ["Bridges", "Robert A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00112", "submitter": "Yanni Georghiades", "authors": "Yanni Georghiades, Steven Flolid, Sriram Vishwanath", "title": "HashCore: Proof-of-Work Functions for General Purpose Processors", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Over the past five years, the rewards associated with mining Proof-of-Work\nblockchains have increased substantially. As a result, miners are heavily\nincentivized to design and utilize Application Specific Integrated Circuits\n(ASICs) that can compute hashes far more efficiently than existing general\npurpose hardware. Currently, it is difficult for most users to purchase and\noperate ASICs due to pricing and availability constraints, resulting in a\nrelatively small number of miners with respect to total user base for most\npopular cryptocurrencies. In this work, we aim to invert the problem of ASIC\ndevelopment by constructing a Proof-of-Work function for which an existing\ngeneral purpose processor (GPP, such as an x86 IC) is already an optimized\nASIC. In doing so, we will ensure that any would-be miner either already owns\nan ASIC for the Proof-of-Work system they wish to participate in or can attain\none at a competitive price with relative ease. In order to achieve this, we\npresent HashCore, a Proof-of-Work function composed of \"widgets\" generated\npseudo-randomly at runtime that each execute a sequence of general purpose\nprocessor instructions designed to stress the computational resources of such a\nGPP. The widgets will be modeled after workloads that GPPs have been optimized\nfor, for example, the SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite for x86 ICs, in a technique\nwe refer to as inverted benchmarking. We provide a proof that HashCore is\ncollision-resistant regardless of how the widgets are implemented. We observe\nthat GPP designers/developers essentially create an ASIC for benchmarks such as\nSPEC CPU 2017. By modeling HashCore after such benchmarks, we create a\nProof-of-Work function that can be run most efficiently on a GPP, resulting in\na more accessible, competitive, and balanced mining market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 22:42:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2019 21:35:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Georghiades", "Yanni", ""], ["Flolid", "Steven", ""], ["Vishwanath", "Sriram", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00241", "submitter": "Terry Shue Chien Lau", "authors": "Terry Shue Chien Lau, Chik How Tan", "title": "Key Recovery Attack on Rank Quasi-Cyclic Code-based Signature Scheme", "comments": "4 pages, the full version will be made available later; The second\n  reference is: Y.

Given\nan initial set of seed PDF files, our framework utilizes a set of neural\nnetworks to 1) discover the correlation between these PDF files and the\nexecution in the target program, and 2) leverage such correlation to generate\nnew seed files that more likely explore new paths in the target program. Our\nexperiments on a set of widely used PDF viewers demonstrate that the improved\nseed inputs produced by our framework could significantly increase the code\ncoverage of the target program and the likelihood of detecting program crashes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2019 09:35:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Liang", ""], ["Zhang", "Yang", ""], ["Zhang", "Yi", ""], ["Wu", "Chen", ""], ["Li", "Zhangtan", ""], ["Fu", "Yu", ""], ["Li", "Haisheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02595", "submitter": "Antonino Sabetta", "authors": "Serena E.

If the out-of-virtual-machine\nsecurity tools want to monitor some kernel objects, they need to intercept the\noperation of the whole memory page. Since there are some other objects stored\nin the monitored pages, the modification of them will also trigger the monitor.\nTherefore, page-level memory monitor usually introduces overhead to related\nkernel services of the target virtual machine. In this paper, we propose a\nlow-overhead kernel object monitoring approach to reduce the overhead caused by\npage-level monitor. The core idea is to migrate the target kernel objects to a\nprotected memory area and then to monitor the corresponding new memory pages.\nSince the new pages only contain the kernel objects to be monitored, other\nkernel objects will not trigger our monitor.

There have been effective schemes such as satisfiability-checking\n(SAT)-based attacks that can potentially decrypt obfuscated circuits, called\ndeobfuscation. Deobfuscation runtime could have a large span ranging from few\nmilliseconds to thousands of years or more, depending on the number and layouts\nof the ICs and camouflaged gates.

Other key properties of the\nalgorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online\ninterface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small\ngroup of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the\nsame perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of\nindividuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks).

Five single classifiers and four ensemble classifiers\nwere applied to distinguish malicious domains from benign ones. In addition, a\nbinary particle swarm optimisation (BPSO) based feature selection method was\nused to improve the performance of single classifiers. Experimental results\nshow that, based on the web domains' popularity and performance data features,\nthe examined machine learning techniques can accurately identify malicious\ndomains in different ways. Furthermore, the BPSO-based feature selection\nprocedure is shown to be an effective way to improve the performance of\nclassifiers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Feb 2019 14:10:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Chiong", "Raymond", ""], ["Pranata", "Ilung", ""], ["Susilo", "Willy", ""], ["Bao", "Yukun", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.08874", "submitter": "Bargav Jayaraman", "authors": "Bargav Jayaraman and David Evans", "title": "Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice", "comments": "Revised version of a paper in USENIX Security 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Differential privacy is a strong notion for privacy that can be used to prove\nformal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, $\\epsilon$, about how much\ninformation is leaked by a mechanism.

Cognitive radio is a promising technology that allows the unlicensed\nusers, known as secondary users (SUs) to access licensed bands without making\ninterference to licensed users or primary users (PUs). As cloud computing has\nbecome popular in recent years, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) can be\nintegrated with the cloud platform. One of the important issues in CRNs is\nsecurity. It becomes a problem since CRNs use radio frequencies as a medium for\ntransmitting and CRNs share the same issues with wireless communication\nsystems. Another critical issue in CRNs is performance.

Therefore, they can\nfreely choose which coin to mine for higher profit, where the profitability\ndepends on both the coin price and mining difficulty. Some miners can\nimmediately switch the coin to mine only when mining difficulty changes because\nthe difficulty changes are more predictable than that for the coin price, and\nwe call this behavior fickle mining.\n  In this paper, we study the effects of fickle mining by modeling a game\nbetween two coins. To do this, we consider both fickle miners and some factions\n(e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) that stick to mining one coin to maintain that\nchain. In this model, we show that fickle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in\nwhich only a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to\nthe less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those who conduct\nmining even after coin mining difficulty increases. This situation would cause\nsevere centralization, weakening the security of the coin system.\n  To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems (e.g., BTC vs. BCH)\nare moving toward, we traced the historical changes of mining power for BTC and\nBCH. In addition, we analyze the recent \"hash war\" between Bitcoin ABC and SV,\nwhich confirms our theoretical analysis.
