The main goal is to generate a\ndegraded wiretap channel in application layer over which Wyner-type secrecy\nencoding is invoked to deliver additional secure information. More\nspecifically, we study secrecy enhancement of DES block cipher working in\ncipher feedback model (CFB) when adjustable and intentional noise is introduced\ninto encrypted data in application layer. A verification strategy in exhaustive\nsearch step of linear attack is designed to allow Eve to mount a successful\nattack in the noisy environment. Thus, a controllable wiretap channel is\ncreated over multiple frames by taking advantage of errors in Eve's\ncryptanalysis, whose secrecy capacity is found for the case of known channel\nstates at receivers. As a result, additional secure information can be\ndelivered by performing Wyner type secrecy encoding over super-frames ahead of\nencryption, namely, our proposed secrecy encoding-then-encryption scheme. These\nsecrecy bits could be taken as symmetric keys for upcoming frames. Numerical\nresults indicate that a sufficiently large secrecy rate can be achieved by\nselective noise addition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 01:52:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Khiabani", "Yahya S.", ""], ["Wei", "Shuangqing", ""], ["Yuan", "Jian", ""], ["Wang", "Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0222", "submitter": "Sorina Ionica", "authors": "Sorina Ionica (INRIA Nancy - Grand Est / LORIA, INRIA Rocquencourt)", "title": "Pairing-based algorithms for jacobians of genus 2 curves with maximal\n  endomorphism ring", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Number Theory 133 (2013) 3755-3770", "doi": "10.1016/j.jnt.2013.04.023", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using Galois cohomology, Schmoyer characterizes cryptographic non-trivial\nself-pairings of the $\\ell$-Tate pairing in terms of the action of the\nFrobenius on the $\\ell$-torsion of the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve.

As such, verifying the integrity of Internet-based searches over\nvast amounts of web contents is essential.\n  We provide the first solution to this general security problem. We introduce\nthe concept of an authenticated web crawler and present the design and\nprototype implementation of this new concept. An authenticated web crawler is a\ntrusted program that computes a special \"signature\" $s$ of a collection of web\ncontents it visits. Subject to this signature, web searches can be verified to\nbe correct with respect to the integrity of their produced results. This\nsignature also allows the verification of complicated queries on web pages,\nsuch as conjunctive keyword searches. In our solution, along with the web pages\nthat satisfy any given search query, the search engine also returns a\ncryptographic proof. This proof, together with the signature $s$, enables any\nuser to efficiently verify that no legitimate web pages are omitted from the\nresult computed by the search engine, and that no pages that are non-conforming\nwith the query are included in the result. An important property of our\nsolution is that the proof size and the verification time both depend solely on\nthe sizes of the query description and the query result, but not on the number\nor sizes of the web pages over which the search is performed.\n  Our authentication protocols are based on standard Merkle trees and the more\ninvolved bilinear-map accumulators.

The main\nidea is to replace its permutation matrix by adding to it a rank 1 matrix. The\nmotivation for this change is twofold: it would allow the use of codes that\nwere shown to be insecure in the original McEliece's cryptosystem, and it would\nreduce the key size while keeping the same security against generic decoding\nattacks. The authors suggest to use generalized Reed-Solomon codes instead of\nGoppa codes. The public code built with this method is not anymore a\ngeneralized Reed-Solomon code. On the other hand, it contains a very large\nsecret generalized Reed-Solomon code. In this paper we present an attack that\nis built upon a distinguisher which is able to identify elements of this secret\ncode. The distinguisher is constructed by considering the code generated by\ncomponent-wise products of codewords of the public code (the so-called \"square\ncode\"). By using square-code dimension considerations, the initial generalized\nReed-Solomon code can be recovered which permits to decode any ciphertext. A\nsimilar technique has already been successful for mounting an attack against a\nhomomorphic encryption scheme suggested by Bogdanoc et \\textit{al.}.
