We answer the question affirmatively for\nextremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the\nnetwork and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path\neach round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this\npath may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key\nsetting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the\namount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves\noptimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error.

With specific proposals in the\nliterature, a critical question must be answered: can secure VC systems be\npractical and satisfy the requirements of safety applications, in spite of the\nsignificant communication and processing overhead and other restrictions\nsecurity and privacy-enhancing mechanisms impose? To answer this question, we\ninvestigate in this paper the following three dimensions for secure and\nprivacy-enhancing VC schemes: the reliability of communication, the processing\noverhead at each node, and the impact on a safety application. The results\nindicate that with the appropriate system design, including sufficiently high\nprocessing power, applications enabled by secure VC can be in practice as\neffective as those enabled by unsecured VC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2008 22:35:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Papadimitratos", "Panos", ""], ["Calandriello", "Giorgio", ""], ["Hubaux", "Jean-Pierre", ""], ["Lioy", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2668", "submitter": "Panos Papadimitratos", "authors": "Marcin Poturalski, Panos Papadimitratos and Jean-Pierre Hubaux", "title": "Secure Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks: Formal Investigation of\n  Possibility", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ACM Symposium on Information, Computer and Communications Security\n  (ASIACCS), pages 189{200, Tokyo, Japan, March 2008", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless communication enables a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from\ncommodity to tactical systems.

The detection of\naggregation disruptions and the removal of faulty nodes provides robustness. At\nthe same time, after removing faulty nodes, the WSN can enjoy low cost (secure)\naggregation.

Unlike in the fast fading scenario,\nwhere the frames supporting the transmission of the codewords were equivalent\nand completely characterized by the channel statistics, in our present scenario\nthe frames are unique, and characterized by a specific set of channel\nrealizations. This leads to more involved inter-frame power allocation\nstrategies, and in some cases even to the need for a third level of power\ncontrol. We also show that for parallel slow fading channels, the CSI feedback\nhelps in the battle against jamming, as evidenced by the significant\ndegradation to system performance when CSI is not sent back.

Both transmitter and\njammer are subject to power constraints which can be enforced over each\ncodeword short-term / peak) or over all codewords (long-term / average), hence\ngenerating different scenarios. All our jamming problems are formulated as\nzero-sum games, having the probability of outage as pay-off function and power\ncontrol functions as strategies. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive\ncoverage of these problems, under fast and slow fading, peak and average power\nconstraints, pure and mixed strategies, with and without channel state\ninformation (CSI) feedback. In this first part we study the fast fading\nscenario. We first assume full CSI to be available to all parties. For peak\npower constraints, a Nash equilibrium of pure strategies is found. For average\npower constraints, both pure and mixed strategies are investigated. With pure\nstrategies, we derive the optimal power control functions for both intra-frame\nand inter-frame power allocation. Maximin and minimax solutions are found and\nshown to be different, which implies the non-existence of a saddle point. In\naddition we provide alternative perspectives in obtaining the optimal\nintra-frame power control functions under the long-term power constraints. With\nmixed strategies, the Nash equilibrium is found by solving the generalized form\nof an older problem dating back to Bell and Cover \\cite{bell}. Finally, we\nderive a Nash equilibrium of the game in which no CSI is fed back from the\nreceiver.
