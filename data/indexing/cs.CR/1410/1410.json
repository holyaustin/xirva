In general, we can formalize information-theoretic\nsecurity in various ways: some of them can be formalized as stand-alone\nsecurity by extending (or relaxing) Shannon's perfect secrecy or by other ways\nsuch as semantic security; some of them can be done based on composable\nsecurity. Then, a natural question about this is: what is the gap between the\nformalizations? To answer the question, we investigate relationships between\nseveral formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key\nencryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key\nencryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist\ndecryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:\nformalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using\nmutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of\nindistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and\ncomposable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti. Then, we explicitly show the\nequivalence and non-equivalence between those formalizations. Under the model,\nwe also derive lower bounds on the adversary's (or distinguisher's) advantage\nand the size of secret-keys required under all of the above formalizations.\nAlthough some of them may be already known, we can explicitly derive them all\nat once through our relationships between the formalizations.

While differential privacy has been accepted as a standard\nfor privacy protection, applying differential privacy in location based\napplications presents new challenges, as the protection needs to be enforced on\nthe fly for a single user and needs to incorporate temporal correlations\nbetween a user's locations.\n  In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to preserve location privacy\nwith rigorous privacy guarantee.

We found out that if HTML5-based mobile\napps become popular--it seems to go that direction based on the current\nprojection--many of the things that we normally do today may become dangerous,\nincluding reading from 2D barcodes, scanning Wi-Fi access points, playing MP4\nvideos, pairing with Bluetooth devices, etc. This paper describes how\nHTML5-based apps can become vulnerable, how attackers can exploit their\nvulnerabilities through a variety of channels, and what damage can be achieved\nby the attackers. In addition to demonstrating the attacks through example\napps, we have studied 186 PhoneGap plugins, used by apps to achieve a variety\nof functionalities, and we found that 11 are vulnerable. We also found two real\nHTML5-based apps that are vulnerable to the attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Oct 2014 19:24:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Xing", ""], ["Luo", "Tongbo", ""], ["Tsui", "Derek G.", ""], ["Du", "Wenliang", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8082", "submitter": "Reginald Smith", "authors": "Reginald D.
