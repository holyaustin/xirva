Thus in this work, we discuss\nhow to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a\nsummary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major\nwatermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely\ncenters upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and\ndetectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to\na particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the\noptimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection\nschemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum\nschemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with\nthe perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level\ndiscourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this\nwork, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs\nfrom the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not\nreject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be\neasily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of\nembedding strength.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2007 05:37:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhong", "Jidong", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.0430", "submitter": "Shishir Nagaraja", "authors": "Shishir Nagaraja", "title": "Anonymity in the Wild: Mixes on unstructured networks", "comments": "published in Privacy Enhancing Technologies 2007, Ottawa", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": null, "abstract": "  As decentralized computing scenarios get ever more popular, unstructured\ntopologies are natural candidates to consider running mix networks upon.

It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some\nlimited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has\nessentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction\ntechniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on\nthe raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)\nsetting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of\ndifferent techniques are known and proven to work.\n  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the\nclassical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness\nextraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our\nresult allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the\nquantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to\nencrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure\nagainst a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum\nuncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure\nencryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show\nhow to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum\nattacker.
