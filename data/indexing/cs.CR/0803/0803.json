Reasoning\nabout privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant\nis the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background\nknowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels\nsuch as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how\none can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of\nauxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of\ncurrent anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations\nindependently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We\ninvestigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent\nanonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models\nof limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can\nbreach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques.\nThe class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more\npositive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as\ndifferential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use\nof arbitrary side information. This resistance enables stand-alone design of\nanonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other\nreleases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an\nimportant class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the\nproperty. This significantly enlarges the class of protocols known to enable\nmodular design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2008 00:36:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2008 16:23:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ganta", "Srivatsava Ranjit", ""], ["Kasiviswanathan", "Shiva Prasad", ""], ["Smith", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0037", "submitter": "Abedelaziz Mohaisen", "authors": "Tamer AbuHmed, Abedelaziz Mohaisen, DaeHun Nyang", "title": "A Survey on Deep Packet Inspection for Intrusion Detection Systems", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Magazine of Korea Telecommunication Society, vol. 24, No. 11, pp.\n  25-36, November 2007", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Deep packet inspection is widely recognized as a powerful way which is used\nfor intrusion detection systems for inspecting, deterring and deflecting\nmalicious attacks over the network.

In particular, we attempted to\nrelax and vary the conditions and parameters of current Snort rules, using a\nsimilar approach to classic rule learning operators such as generalisation and\nspecialisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through\nexperiments with standard datasets and show that we are able to detect\npreviously undeleted variants of various attacks. We conclude by discussing the\ngeneral effectiveness and appropriateness of generalisation in Snort based ids\nrule processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:59:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2008 10:42:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Twycross", "Jamie", ""], ["Hesketh-Roberts", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3230", "submitter": "Avik Chaudhuri", "authors": "Avik Chaudhuri, Prasad Naldurg, and Sriram Rajamani", "title": "A Type System for Data-Flow Integrity on Windows Vista", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.OS cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Windows Vista operating system implements an interesting model of\nmulti-level integrity.

Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are\neither hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes\nconsidering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs\ndeployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our\nproposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop\nprotocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our\nprotocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity\nalong with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation\nprocess which is $O(\\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for\nfurther verification of aggregated results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 18:08:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mlaih", "Esam", ""], ["Aly", "Salah A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3946", "submitter": "Shiva Kasiviswanathan", "authors": "Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan and Adam Smith", "title": "On the `Semantics' of Differential Privacy: A Bayesian Formulation", "comments": "Older version of this paper was titled: \"A Note on Differential\n  Privacy: Defining Resistance to Arbitrary Side Information\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Differential privacy is a definition of \"privacy'\" for algorithms that\nanalyze and publish information about statistical databases.
