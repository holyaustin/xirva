The search\nmay either be a single keyword search or a complex query search like\nconjunctive or Boolean keyword search. Information leakage is quite high for\ndynamic SSE, where data might be updated. It has been proven that to avoid this\ninformation leakage an SSE scheme with dynamic data must be forward private. A\ndynamic SSE scheme is said to be forward private, if adding a keyword-document\npair does not reveal any information about the previous search result with that\nkeyword.\n  In SSE setting, the data owner has very low computation and storage power. In\nthis setting, though some schemes achieve forward privacy with\nhonest-but-curious cloud, it becomes difficult to achieve forward privacy when\nthe server is malicious, meaning that it can alter the data. Verifiable dynamic\nSSE requires the server to give a proof of the result of the search query. The\ndata owner can verify this proof efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed a\ngeneric publicly verifiable dynamic SSE (DSSE) scheme that makes any forward\nprivate DSSE scheme verifiable without losing forward privacy. The proposed\nscheme does not require any extra storage at owner-side and requires minimal\ncomputational cost as well for the owner. Moreover, we have compared our scheme\nwith the existing results and show that our scheme is practical.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:04:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sardar", "Laltu", ""], ["Ruj", "Sushmita", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00043", "submitter": "Parham Gohari", "authors": "Parham Gohari, Bo Wu, Matthew Hale and Ufuk Topcu", "title": "The Dirichlet Mechanism for Differential Privacy on the Unit Simplex", "comments": "Submitted to ACC 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As members of a network share more information with each other and network\nproviders, sensitive data leakage raises privacy concerns. To address this need\nfor a class of problems, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors\nbelonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be seen in many applications,\nsuch as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We\nuse differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for these\ndevelopments. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a\nvector within the unit simplex to the same domain according to a Dirichlet\ndistribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit\nsimplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit\nsimplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is\nrequired. We verify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for two cases,\nnamely, identity queries and average queries. In the former case, we derive\nexpressions for the differential privacy level of privatizing a single vector\nwithin the unit simplex. In the latter case, we study the mechanism for\nprivatizing the average of a collection of vectors, each of which is in the\nunit simplex. We establish a trade-off between the strength of privacy and the\nvariance of the mechanism output, and we introduce a parameter to balance the\ntrade-off between them.

In this paper, we derive much tighter upper bound on\nDFR than the current upper bound using constraint relaxation and union bound.\nEspecially, the above-mentioned factors are all considered in derivation of new\nupper bound and the centered binomial distribution is not approximated to\nsubgaussian distribution. In addition, since the error dependency is\nconsidered, the new upper bound is much closer to the real DFR than the\nprevious upper bound. Furthermore, the new upper bound is parameterized by\nusing Chernoff-Cramer bound in order to facilitate calculation of new upper\nbound for the parameters of NewHope. Since the new upper bound is much lower\nthan the DFR requirement of PQC, this DFR margin is used to improve the\nsecurity and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope. As a result, the security level\nof NewHope is improved by 7.2 % or bandwidth efficiency is improved by 5.9 %.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 01:21:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2019 11:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 01:33:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Minki", ""], ["Lee", "Seunghwan", ""], ["Lee", "Eunsang", ""], ["Shin", "Dong-Joon", ""], ["Kim", "Young-Sik", ""], ["No", "Jong-Seon", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00472", "submitter": "Massimo Battaglioni Dr.", "authors": "Paolo Santini, Massimo Battaglioni, Marco Baldi and Franco Chiaraluce", "title": "Analysis of the error correction capability of LDPC and MDPC codes under\n  parallel bit-flipping decoding and application to cryptography", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Iterative decoders used for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) and\nmoderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes are not characterized by a\ndeterministic decoding radius and their error rate performance is usually\nassessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations.

We show that, by fabricating a fake issuer profile and\ngenerating a suitably altered certificate, an attacker is able to impersonate a\nlegitimate issuer and can produce certificates that cannot be distinguished\nfrom originals by the Blockcerts validation procedure. We also propose some\npossible countermeasures against an attack of this type, which require the use\nof a classic public key infrastructure or a decentralized identity system\nintegrated with the Blockcerts protocol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Baldi", "Marco", ""], ["Chiaraluce", "Franco", ""], ["Kodra", "Migelan", ""], ["Spalazzi", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.04753", "submitter": "Andre Nguyen", "authors": "Andre T.

In the past few years, many efforts have been spent on\nexploring query-optimisation attacks to find adversarial examples of either\nblack-box or white-box DNN models, as well as the defending countermeasures\nagainst those attacks. In this work, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models\nunder the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which has not been\ninvestigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the\naforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such\nattacks must acquire the outputs from the models by multiple times before\nactually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in\npractice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised\nonto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In\ncontrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can\nmitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative\nmodels, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively\nstudied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to\neither transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode\noutputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples.

CDAG\nallows multiple parallel updates to the ledger and converges them at the next\nstep providing finality to the blocks. It partitions the updates into\nnon-intersecting buckets of transactions to prevent the generation of\nconflicting blocks and divide the time into slots to provide enough time for\nthem to propagate in the network. Multiple simultaneous updates improve the\nthroughput of CDAG, and the converging step helps to finalize them faster, even\nin the presence of conflicts. Moreover, CDAG provides a total order among the\nblocks of the ledger to support smart contracts, unlike some of the other\nblockDAG protocols.\n  We evaluate the performance of CDAG on Google Cloud Platform using Google\nKubernetes Engine, simulating a real-time network.

Second, the patches\nintroduce many additional IOTLB flushes, leading to extra IOTLB misses, and the\nmisses would have negative impacts on I/O performance of all peripheral\ndevices. In this paper, we propose PiBooster, a novel lightweight approach for\nimproving the performance in page table management. First, PiBooster shortens\nthe execution paths of the page table (de)allocations by the PiBooster cache,\nwhich maintains dedicated buffers for serving page table (de)allocations.\nSecond, PiBooster eliminates the additional IOTLB misses with a fine-grained\nvalidation scheme, which performs page table and DMA validations separately,\ninstead of doing both together.

One of the key challenges is to\nconstruct a training dataset that matches a target task without compromising on\nprivacy of the data sources. To this end, we consider the following distributed\ndata summarizataion problem. Given K private source datasets denoted by\n$[D_i]_{i\\in [K]}$ and a small target validation set $D_v$, which may involve a\nconsiderable covariate shift with respect to the sources, compute a summary\ndataset $D_s\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i\\in [K]} D_i$ such that its statistical\ndistance from the validation dataset $D_v$ is minimized.

The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various\napplications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low\nproduction cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation,\nautonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet\nof Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in\nsensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the\nIoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the\nInternet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e.\nthere is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the\nflowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big\nconcern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and\ncollaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms\nof security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these\nsystems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks.\nTherefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along\nwith the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks\nare provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated\ninto mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are\ninvestigated under that umbrella: \"Passive Attacks\" and \"Active Attacks\".\nUnderstanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help\nto pave a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT\ntechnology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:09:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Butun", "Ismail", ""], ["\u00d6sterberg", "Patrik", ""], ["Song", "Houbing", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.13315", "submitter": "Kemal Davaslioglu", "authors": "Kemal Davaslioglu, Sohraab Soltani, Tugba Erpek, Yalin E.

Recently (2017) it was shown that existing\nsecure logging protocols are vulnerable to crash attack in which the adversary\nmodifies the log file and then crashes the system to make it indistinguishable\nfrom a normal system crash. The attacker was assumed to be non-adaptive and not\nbe able to see the file content before modifying and crashing it (which will be\nimmediately after modifying the file). The authors also proposed a system\ncalled SLiC that protects against this attacker. In this paper, we consider an\n(insider) adaptive adversary who can see the file content as new log operations\nare performed. This is a powerful adversary who can attempt to rewind the\nsystem to a past state. We formalize security against this adversary and\nintroduce a scheme with provable security. We show that security against this\nattacker requires some (small) protected memory that can become accessible to\nthe attacker after the system compromise. We show that existing secure logging\nschemes are insecure in this setting, even if the system provides some\nprotected memory as above. We propose a novel mechanism that, in its basic\nform, uses a pair of keys that evolve at different rates, and employ this\nmechanism in an existing logging scheme that has forward integrity to obtain a\nsystem with provable security against adaptive (and hence non-adaptive) crash\nattack. We implemented our scheme on a desktop computer and a Raspberry Pi, and\nshowed in addition to higher security, a significant efficiency gain over SLiC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:56:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Avizheh", "Sepideh", ""], ["Safavi-Naini", "Reihaneh", ""], ["Li", "Shuai", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.14268", "submitter": "Tianhao Wang", "authors": "Tianhao Wang, Florian Kerschbaum", "title": "RIGA: Covert and Robust White-Box Watermarking of Deep Neural Networks", "comments": "WebConf'21 (Full Paper)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Watermarking of deep neural networks (DNN) can enable their tracing once\nreleased by a data owner.

Here, the adversary first extracts the model architecture or\nhyperparameters through side channel leakage, followed by stealing the\nfunctionality of the target model by training the reconstructed architecture on\na synthetic dataset.

This framework captures the fact that extracting the\nexact target model is difficult due to experimental uncertainty while inferring\nmodel hyperparameters and stochastic nature of training to steal the target\nmodel functionality. Specifically, we use Bayesian Networks to capture\nuncertainty in estimating the target model under various extraction attacks\nbased on the subjective notion of probability.
