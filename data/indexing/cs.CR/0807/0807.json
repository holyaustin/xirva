Confidentiality is achieved by\nprotecting (or \"locking\") the source coefficients required to decode the\nencoded data, without preventing intermediate nodes from running their standard\nnetwork coding operations.

Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by\nDodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P,\nwhich can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the\nother. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in\ntime (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an\nadditional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the\nadversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors\nsecure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.\n  We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts\na shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and\nsecurity parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W.

In the case of scale-free\nnetworks, on the other hand, this threshold becomes vanishingly small in the\nlimit of infinite system size. We find that the initial rate at which a rumour\nspreads is much higher in scale-free networks than in random graphs, and that\nthe rate at which the spreading proceeds on scale-free networks is further\nincreased when assortative degree correlations are introduced. The impact of\ndegree correlations on the final fraction of nodes that ever hears a rumour,\nhowever, depends on the interplay between network topology and the rumour\nspreading rate.
