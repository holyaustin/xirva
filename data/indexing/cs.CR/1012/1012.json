In this paper we study\nthe characteristics of spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to\ncounter anti spam technology, spammers change their mode of operation,\ntherefore continues evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers\ntechnology has become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the\nexisting anti spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively.\nIn order to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails\nfrom a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to\nFebruary 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and\ncontents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with\nattachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's identity,\nrandomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay machines, mass mailing\ncapability and defining spamming duration. Spammers do not use spam software to\nsend spam without attachment. From our study we observed that, four years old\nheavy users email accounts attract more spam than four years old light users\nmail accounts. Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not\nreceive spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new\nemail accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts have\nattracted more spam than 14 months old light users.

Generally the users require only certain aggregate\nfunctions of this distributed data. Computation of this aggregate data under\nthe end-to-end information flow paradigm by communicating all the relevant data\nto a central collector node is a highly inefficient solution for this purpose.\nAn alternative proposition is to perform in-network computation. This, however,\nraises questions such as: what is the optimal way to compute an aggregate\nfunction from a set of statistically correlated values stored in different\nnodes; what is the security of such aggregation as the results sent by a\ncompromised or faulty node in the network can adversely affect the accuracy of\nthe computed result. In this paper, we have presented an energy-efficient\naggregation algorithm for WSNs that is secure and robust against malicious\ninsider attack by any compromised or faulty node in the network. In contrast to\nthe traditional snapshot aggregation approach in WSNs, a node in the proposed\nalgorithm instead of unicasting its sensed information to its parent node,\nbroadcasts its estimate to all its neighbors. This makes the system more\nfault-tolerant and increase the information availability in the network. The\nsimulations conducted on the proposed algorithm have produced results that\ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Dec 2010 10:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2529", "submitter": "Jaydip Sen", "authors": "Jaydip Sen", "title": "A Survey on Reputation and Trust-Based Systems for Wireless\n  Communication Networks", "comments": "16 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal HIT Transaction on ECCN (Electronics,\n  Communication, Computers and Networking), pp. 92-111.

One limitation of many available techniques is\nthat the sets of users and roles are bounded. In this paper, we propose a\nsymbolic framework to overcome this difficulty. We design an automated security\nanalysis technique, parametric in the number of users and roles, by adapting\nrecent methods for model checking infinite state systems that use first-order\nlogic and state-of-the-art theorem proving techniques. Preliminary experiments\nwith a prototype implementations seem to confirm the scalability of our\ntechnique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Dec 2010 10:53:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Armando", "A.", ""], ["Ranise", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5895", "submitter": "Miodrag Mihaljevic", "authors": "Miodrag J.

The considered systems employ\nerror-correction coding for reliability, a stream cipher for encryption, and\nhomophonic coding to enhance the protection of the key used in the stream\ncipher, on which relies the security of all the system transmissions. This\npaper presents a security evaluation of such systems from a computational\ncomplexity point of view, which serves as a source for establishing dedicated\nhomophonic code design criteria. The security evaluation shows that the\ncomputational complexity of recovering the secret key, given all the\ninformation an attacker could gather during passive attacks he can mount, is\nlower bounded by the complexity of the related LPN (Learning Parity in Noise)\nproblem in both the average and worst case. This gives guidelines to construct\na dedicated homophonic encoder which maximizes the complexity of the underlying\nLPN problem for a given encoding overhead. Finally, this paper proposes a\ngeneric homophonic coding strategy that fulfills the proposed design criteria\nand thus both enhances security while minimizing the induced overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 09:27:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mihaljevic", "Miodrag J.", ""], ["Oggier", "Frederique", ""], ["Imai", "Hideki", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5997", "submitter": "Salah A.

Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase capacity, and\nenhance security services between two core (relay) network nodes, an ingress\nnode and an egress node. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) has been\nproposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node\n(source) and an egress node (destination) to distribute the network flow among\nmultiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and\nattacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core\nnetwork nodes.\n  This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely,\nthe paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering\nscheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This\nscheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic\nengineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE)\nis proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers,\nswitches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link\nattack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths\nbetween the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against\nmultiple attacked links. The proposed scheme can be applied to secure core\nnetworks such as optical and IP networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 18:29:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""], ["Ansari", "Nirwan", ""], ["Poor", "H.
