It gives an upper bound on the entropy loss of a random\nvariable $X$ in case the adversary who having already learned some random\nvariables $Z_{1},\\ldots,Z_{\\ell}$ correlated with $X$, obtains some further\ninformation $Z_{\\ell+1}$ about $X$. Analogously to the information-theoretic\ncase, one might expect that also for the \\emph{computational} variants of\nentropy the loss depends only on the actual leakage, i.e. on $Z_{\\ell+1}$.\nSurprisingly, Krenn et al.\\ have shown recently that for the most commonly used\ndefinitions of computational entropy this holds only if the computational\nquality of the entropy deteriorates exponentially in\n$|(Z_{1},\\ldots,Z_{\\ell})|$. This means that the current standard definitions\nof computational entropy do not allow to fully capture leakage that occurred\n\"in the past\", which severely limits the applicability of this notion.\n  As a remedy for this problem we propose a slightly stronger definition of the\ncomputational entropy, which we call the \\emph{modulus computational entropy},\nand use it as a technical tool that allows us to prove a desired chain rule\nthat depends only on the actual leakage and not on its history. Moreover, we\nshow that the modulus computational entropy unifies other,sometimes seemingly\nunrelated, notions already studied in the literature in the context of\ninformation leakage and chain rules. Our results indicate that the modulus\nentropy is, up to now, the weakest restriction that guarantees that the chain\nrule for the computational entropy works. As an example of application we\ndemonstrate a few interesting cases where our restricted definition is\nfulfilled and the chain rule holds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 19:43:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2013 16:59:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 16:43:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Skorski", "Maciej", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.2253", "submitter": "Jaydip Sen", "authors": "Jaydip Sen", "title": "Security and Privacy Challenges in Cognitive Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "36 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Therefore, the resulting encryption scheme is not sufficiently\nefficient to be used in practice and it is inappropriate for many applications\nsuch as small ubiquitous computing devices with limited resources such as smart\ncards, active RFID tags, wireless sensor networks and other embedded devices.\n  In this work, for the first time, we introduce an efficient universal random\ndata padding (URDP) scheme, and show how it can be used to construct a \"direct\"\nCCA2-secure encryption scheme from \"any\" worst-case hardness problems in\n(ideal) lattice in the standard model, resolving a problem that has remained\nopen till date. This novel approach is a \"black-box\" construction and leads to\nthe elimination of separate encryption, as it avoids using general\ntransformation from CPA-secure scheme to a CCA2-secure one. IND-CCA2 security\nof this scheme can be tightly reduced in the standard model to the assumption\nthat the underlying primitive is an one-way trapdoor function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2013 08:22:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 19:07:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rastaghi", "Roohallah", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.6424", "submitter": "Rupam Sharma", "authors": "Rupam kumar sharma", "title": "Generation of Biometric key for use in DES", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 9,\n  Issue 6, No 1, November 2012 ISSN (Online): 1694-0814", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Cryptography is an important field in the area of data encryption.

Unfortunately, they also become fertile grounds for hackers to\ndeploy malware and to spread virus. There is an urgent need to have a \"security\nanalytic & forensic system\" which can facilitate analysts to examine, dissect,\nassociate and correlate large number of mobile applications. An effective\nanalytic system needs to address the following questions: How to automatically\ncollect and manage a high volume of mobile malware? How to analyze a zero-day\nsuspicious application, and compare or associate it with existing malware\nfamilies in the database? How to perform information retrieval so to reveal\nsimilar malicious logic with existing malware, and to quickly identify the new\nmalicious code segment? In this paper, we present the design and implementation\nof DroidAnalytics, a signature based analytic system to automatically collect,\nmanage, analyze and extract android malware. The system facilitates analysts to\nretrieve, associate and reveal malicious logics at the \"opcode level\". We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of DroidAnalytics using 150,368 Android applications,\nand successfully determine 2,494 Android malware from 102 different families,\nwith 342 of them being zero-day malware samples from six different families. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in showing such a\nlarge Android malware analysis/detection. The evaluation shows the\nDroidAnalytics is a valuable tool and is effective in analyzing malware\nrepackaging and mutations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 14:48:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 06:16:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Mar 2013 16:01:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 09:36:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Min", ""], ["Sun", "Mingshen", ""], ["Lui", "John C.
