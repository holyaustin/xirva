Recently, there have been several natural generalizations of\nthese objects, in the context and study of tamper resilient cryptography. These\nare seeded non-malleable extractors, introduced in [DW09]; seedless\nnon-malleable extractors, introduced in [CG14b]; and non-malleable codes,\nintroduced in [DPW10].\n  However, explicit constructions of non-malleable extractors appear to be\nhard, and the known constructions are far behind their non-tampered\ncounterparts.\n  In this paper we make progress towards solving the above problems. Our\ncontributions are as follows.\n  (1) We construct an explicit seeded non-malleable extractor for min-entropy\n$k \\geq \\log^2 n$. This dramatically improves all previous results and gives a\nsimpler 2-round privacy amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss,\nmatching the best known result in [Li15b].\n  (2) We construct the first explicit non-malleable two-source extractor for\nmin-entropy $k \\geq n-n^{\\Omega(1)}$, with output size $n^{\\Omega(1)}$ and\nerror $2^{-n^{\\Omega(1)}}$.\n  (3) We initiate the study of two natural generalizations of seedless\nnon-malleable extractors and non-malleable codes, where the sources or the\ncodeword may be tampered many times. We construct the first explicit\nnon-malleable two-source extractor with tampering degree $t$ up to\n$n^{\\Omega(1)}$, which works for min-entropy $k \\geq n-n^{\\Omega(1)}$, with\noutput size $n^{\\Omega(1)}$ and error $2^{-n^{\\Omega(1)}}$. We show that we can\nefficiently sample uniformly from any pre-image. By the connection in [CG14b],\nwe also obtain the first explicit non-malleable codes with tampering degree $t$\nup to $n^{\\Omega(1)}$, relative rate $n^{\\Omega(1)}/n$, and error\n$2^{-n^{\\Omega(1)}}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 07:18:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chattopadhyay", "Eshan", ""], ["Goyal", "Vipul", ""], ["Li", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.00172", "submitter": "Tuhin Borgohain", "authors": "Tuhin Borgohain, Sugata Sanyal", "title": "Technical Analysis of Security Infrastructure in RFID Technology", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper is a technical analysis of the security infrastructure in the field\nof RFID technology.

Whether it is a password for user authentication or a secret key\nfor a cryptographic primitive, picking it requires the user to trade-off\nusability costs with resistance against an adversary: a simple password is\neasier to remember but is also easier to guess; likewise, a shorter\ncryptographic key may require fewer computational and storage resources but it\nis also easier to attack. A fundamental question is how one can optimally\nresolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also\nutilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen\nits attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing\nthe optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two\ntypes of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that\nare ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive\nthe mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically\npessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg\nEquilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a\ncapped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform\nrandomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the\nattacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash\nEquilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,\nsignifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases.

One of the\nfundamental tenets of CCN is that data, or content, is a named and addressable\nentity in the network. Consumers request content by issuing interest messages\nwith the desired content name. These interests are forwarded by routers to\nproducers, and the resulting content object is returned and optionally cached\nat each router along the path. In-network caching makes it difficult to enforce\naccess control policies on sensitive content outside of the producer since\nrouters only use interest information for forwarding decisions. To that end, we\npropose an Interest-Based Access Control (IBAC) scheme that enables access\ncontrol enforcement using only information contained in interest messages,\ni.e., by making sensitive content names unpredictable to unauthorized parties.\nOur IBAC scheme supports both hash- and encryption-based name obfuscation. We\naddress the problem of interest replay attacks by formulating a mutual trust\nframework between producers and consumers that enables routers to perform\nauthorization checks when satisfying interests from their cache. We assess the\ncomputational, storage, and bandwidth overhead of each IBAC variant.

In this paper, we focus on a very\nsensitive and increasingly exposed type of data: location data. There are two\nmain scenarios in which fake traces are of extreme value to preserve location\nprivacy: publishing datasets of location trajectories, and using location-based\nservices. Despite advances in protecting (location) data privacy, there is no\nquantitative method to evaluate how realistic a synthetic trace is, and how\nmuch utility and privacy it provides in each scenario. Also, the lack of a\nmethodology to generate privacy-preserving fake traces is evident. In this\npaper, we fill this gap and propose the first statistical metric and model to\ngenerate fake location traces such that both the utility of data and the\nprivacy of users are preserved. We build upon the fact that, although\ngeographically they visit distinct locations, people have strongly semantically\nsimilar mobility patterns, for example, their transition pattern across\nactivities (e.g., working, driving, staying at home) is similar. We define a\nstatistical metric and propose an algorithm that automatically discovers the\nhidden semantic similarities between locations from a bag of real location\ntraces as seeds, without requiring any initial semantic annotations. We\nguarantee that fake traces are geographically dissimilar to their seeds, so\nthey do not leak sensitive location information. We also protect contributors\nto seed traces against membership attacks. Interleaving fake traces with mobile\nusers' traces is a prominent location privacy defense mechanism.

Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art in\nphysical-layer security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open\ncommunications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer.\nWe also introduce the family of various jamming attacks and their\ncounter-measures, including the constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive\njammer, adaptive jammer and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the\nintegration of physical-layer security into existing authentication and\ncryptography mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some\ntechnical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are\nsummarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 04:29:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 Apr 2016 12:29:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zou", "Yulong", ""], ["Zhu", "Jia", ""], ["Wang", "Xianbin", ""], ["Hanzo", "Lajos", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07929", "submitter": "Yulong Zou Dr.", "authors": "Yulong Zou, Jia Zhu, Xuelong Li, and Lajos Hanzo", "title": "Relay Selection for Wireless Communications Against Eavesdropping: A\n  Security-Reliability Tradeoff Perspective", "comments": "16 pages, IEEE Network, 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/MNET.2016.7579030", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article examines the secrecy coding aided wireless communications from a\nsource to a destination in the presence of an eavesdropper from a\nsecurity-reliability tradeoff (SRT) perspective. Explicitly, the security is\nquantified in terms of the intercept probability experienced at the\neavesdropper, while the outage probability encountered at the destination is\nused to measure the transmission reliability. We characterize the SRT of\nconventional direct transmission from the source to the destination and show\nthat if the outage probability is increased, the intercept probability\ndecreases, and vice versa. We first demonstrate that the employment of relay\nnodes for assisting the source-destination transmissions is capable of\ndefending against eavesdropping, followed by quantifying the benefits of\nsingle-relay selection (SRS) as well as of multi-relay selection (MRS) schemes.\nMore specifically, in the SRS scheme, only the single \"best\" relay is selected\nfor forwarding the source signal to the destination, whereas the MRS scheme\nallows multiple relays to participate in this process. It is illustrated that\nboth the SRS and MRS schemes achieve a better SRT than the conventional direct\ntransmission, especially upon increasing the number of relays. Numerical\nresults also show that as expected, the MRS outperforms the SRS in terms of its\nSRT. Additionally, we present some open challenges and future directions for\nthe wireless relay aided physical-layer security.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 05:54:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 14:06:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 01:09:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zou", "Yulong", ""], ["Zhu", "Jia", ""], ["Li", "Xuelong", ""], ["Hanzo", "Lajos", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07945", "submitter": "James Sellwood", "authors": "Jason Crampton, James Sellwood", "title": "Relationships, Paths and Principal Matching: A New Approach to Access\n  Control", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent work on relationship-based access control has begun to show how it can\nbe applied to general computing systems, as opposed to simply being employed\nfor social networking applications. The use of relationships to determine\nauthorization policies enables more powerful policies to be defined than those\nbased solely on the commonly used concept of role membership. The\nrelationships, paths and principal matching (RPPM) model described here is a\nformal access control model using relationships and a two-stage request\nevaluation process. We make use of path conditions, which are similar to\nregular expressions, to define policies. We then employ non-deterministic\nfinite automata to determine which policies are applicable to a request. The\npower and robustness of the RPPM model allows us to include contextual\ninformation in the authorization process (through the inclusion of logical\nentities) and allows us to support desirable policy foundations such as\nseparation of duty and Chinese Wall. Additionally, the RPPM model naturally\nsupports a caching mechanism which has significant impact on request evaluation\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 07:26:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 14:33:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 19 Sep 2015 08:26:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Crampton", "Jason", ""], ["Sellwood", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.08154", "submitter": "Mehdi Ghayoumi", "authors": "Kambiz Ghazinour and Mehdi Ghayoumi", "title": "Dynamic Modeling for Representing Access Control Policies Effect", "comments": "6 Pages, ICCS , 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In large databases, creating user interface for browsing or performing\ninsertion, deletion or modification of data is very costly in terms of\nprogramming.
