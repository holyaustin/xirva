ECC is an ideal candidate\nfor implementation on constrained devices where the major computational\nresources i.e. speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication\nprotocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels\nwith traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. Moreover, in\nseveral application areas such as person identification and eVoting, it is\nfrequently required of entities to prove knowledge of some fact without\nrevealing this knowledge. Such proofs of knowledge are called Zero Knowledge\nInteractive Proofs (ZKIP) and involve interactions between two communicating\nparties, the Prover and the Verifier. In a ZKIP, the Prover demonstrates the\npossesion of some information (e.g. authentication information) to the Verifier\nwithout disclosing it. In this paper, we focus on the application of ZKIP\nprotocols on resource constrained devices.

For instance, one scenario involves a querier, Bob, who wants to\ntest if his DNA string, $Q$, is close to a DNA string, $Y$, owned by a data\nowner, Alice, but Bob does not want to reveal $Q$ to Alice and Alice is willing\nto reveal $Y$ to Bob \\emph{only if} it is close to $Q$. We describe a\nprivacy-enhanced method for comparing two compressed DNA sequences, which can\nbe used to achieve the goals of such a scenario. Our method involves a\nreduction to set differencing, and we describe a privacy-enhanced protocol for\nset differencing that achieves absolute privacy for Bob (in the information\ntheoretic sense), and a quantifiable degree of privacy protection for Alice.\nOne of the important features of our protocols, which makes them ideally suited\nto privacy-enhanced DNA sequence comparison problems, is that the communication\ncomplexity of our solutions is proportional to a threshold that bounds the\ncardinality of the set differences that are of interest, rather than the\ncardinality of the sets involved (which correlates to the length of the DNA\nsequences). Moreover, in our protocols, the querier, Bob, can easily compute\nthe set difference only if its cardinality is close to or below a specified\nthreshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 22:58:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Eppstein", "David", ""], ["Goodrich", "Michael T.", ""], ["Baldi", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3631", "submitter": "Rahat Afreen Mrs.", "authors": "Rahat Afreen, S.C.

Design of a secure and efficient communication\nprotocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we\npropose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user\nanonymity while maintaining communication efficiency in a WMN. The security\nprotocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the\nbackbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is\nachieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature\nscheme. Simulation results demonstrate that while the protocols have minimal\nstorage and communication overhead, they are robust and provide high level of\nsecurity and privacy to the users of the network services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 17:01:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5594", "submitter": "Aslan Askarov", "authors": "Aslan Askarov (Cornell University), Andrew Myers (Cornell University)", "title": "Attacker Control and Impact for Confidentiality and Integrity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 7, Issue 3 (September\n  26, 2011) lmcs:987", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-7(3:17)2011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Language-based information flow methods offer a principled way to enforce\nstrong security properties, but enforcing noninterference is too inflexible for\nrealistic applications. Security-typed languages have therefore introduced\ndeclassification mechanisms for relaxing confidentiality policies, and\nendorsement mechanisms for relaxing integrity policies. However, a continuing\nchallenge has been to define what security is guaranteed when such mechanisms\nare used. This paper presents a new semantic framework for expressing security\npolicies for declassification and endorsement in a language-based setting. The\nkey insight is that security can be characterized in terms of the influence\nthat declassification and endorsement allow to the attacker. The new framework\nintroduces two notions of security to describe the influence of the attacker.\nAttacker control defines what the attacker is able to learn from observable\neffects of this code; attacker impact captures the attacker's influence on\ntrusted locations. This approach yields novel security conditions for checked\nendorsements and robust integrity. The framework is flexible enough to recover\nand to improve on the previously introduced notions of robustness and qualified\nrobustness. Further, the new security conditions can be soundly enforced by a\nsecurity type system. The applicability and enforcement of the new policies is\nillustrated through various examples, including data sanitization and\nauthentication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 21:19:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 13:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Askarov", "Aslan", "", "Cornell University"], ["Myers", "Andrew", "", "Cornell University"]]}, {"id": "1107.5881", "submitter": "Francois Le Gall", "authors": "Fran\\c{c}ois Le Gall", "title": "Quantum Private Information Retrieval with Sublinear Communication\n  Complexity", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This note presents a quantum protocol for private information retrieval, in\nthe single-server case and with information-theoretical privacy, that has\nO(\\sqrt{n})-qubit communication complexity, where n denotes the size of the\ndatabase.
