Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third\nparties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and\nSAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open\nsystems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a\ndiscovery phase is added to the protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker\nto set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO\nauthentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we\nevaluate one of the most popular and widely deployed SSO protocols - OpenID. We\nfound four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous\nresearch, and show their applicability to real-life implementations.

Indeed, E-learning systems have capacity to adapt\ncontent and learning process according to the learner profile. Adaptation\ntechniques using advanced behavioral analysis mechanisms, called \"Learner\nModeling\" or \"Profiling\". The latter require continuous tracking of the\nactivities of the learner to identify gaps and strengths in order to tailor\ncontent to their specific needs or advise and accompany him during his\napprenticeship. However, the disadvantage of these systems is that they cause\nlearners' discouragement, for learners, alone with his screen loses its\nmotivation to improve. Adding social extension to learning, to avoid isolation\nof learners and boost support and interaction between members of the learning\ncommunity, was able to increase learner's motivation. However, the tools to\nfacilitate social interactions integrated to E-learning platforms can be used\nfor purposes other than learning. These needs, which can be educational,\nprofessional or personal, create a mixture of data from the private life and\npublic life of learners. With the integration of these tools for e-learning\nsystems and the growth of the amount of personal data stored in the databases\nof these latter, protecting the privacy of students becomes a major concern.\nIndeed, the exchange of profiles between e-learning systems is done without the\npermission of their owners. Furthermore, the profiling behavior analysis\ncurrently represents a very cost-effective way to generate profits by selling\nthese profiles advertising companies. Today, the right to privacy is threatened\nfrom all sides. In addition to the threat from pirates, the source of the most\ndangerous threats is that from service providers online that users devote a\nblind trust. Control and centralized data storage and access privileges that\nhave suppliers are responsible for the threat. Our work is limited to the\nprotection of personal data in e-learning systems.

In the absence of solutions that take into account the\nprotection and respect of privacy in e-learning systems that integrate social\nlearning tools, we designed our own solution. Our \"ApprAide\" system uses a set\nof protocols based on security techniques to protect users' privacy. In\naddition, our system incorporates tools that promote social interactions as a\nsocial learning network, a chat tool and a virtual table.

To overcome this issue and to take many\nother benefits of cloud computing, outsourcing PPDM tasks to the cloud\nenvironment has recently gained special attention. We consider the scenario\nwhere n entities outsource their databases (in encrypted format) to the cloud\nand ask the cloud to perform the clustering task on their combined data in a\nprivacy-preserving manner.

Unlike prior Sybil-resistant P2P\nsystems based on social networks, Persea does not rely on two key assumptions:\n(i) that the social network is fast mixing, and (ii) that there is a small\nratio of attack edges to honest peers.

Usually, their efficiency and correctness are analyzed\nusing probabilistic tools under the assumption that the inputs and queries are\nindependent of the internal randomness of the data structure. In this work, we\nconsider data structures in a more robust model, which we call the adversarial\nmodel. Roughly speaking, this model allows an adversary to choose inputs and\nqueries adaptively according to previous responses. Specifically, we consider a\ndata structure known as \"Bloom filter\" and prove a tight connection between\nBloom filters in this model and cryptography.\n  A Bloom filter represents a set $S$ of elements approximately, by using fewer\nbits than a precise representation. The price for succinctness is allowing some\nerrors: for any $x \\in S$ it should always answer `Yes', and for any $x \\notin\nS$ it should answer `Yes' only with small probability.\n  In the adversarial model, we consider both efficient adversaries (that run in\npolynomial time) and computationally unbounded adversaries that are only\nbounded in the number of queries they can make. For computationally bounded\nadversaries, we show that non-trivial (memory-wise) Bloom filters exist if and\nonly if one-way functions exist. For unbounded adversaries we show that there\nexists a Bloom filter for sets of size $n$ and error $\\varepsilon$, that is\nsecure against $t$ queries and uses only $O(n \\log{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}}+t)$\nbits of memory.
