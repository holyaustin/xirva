The \\textit{density} $d$ of an SSP instance is defined by the\nratio of $n$ to $m$, where $m$ is the logarithm of the largest integer within\n$A$. Based on the structural and statistical properties of subset sums, we\npresent an improved enumeration scheme for SSP, and implement it as a complete\nand exact algorithm (EnumPlus). The algorithm always equivalently reduces an\ninstance to be low-density, and then solve it by enumeration. Through this\napproach, we show the possibility to design a sole algorithm that can\nefficiently solve arbitrary density instance in a uniform way. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm has considerable performance advantage over previous algorithms.\nFirstly, it extends the density scope, in which SSP can be solved in expected\npolynomial time. Specifically, It solves SSP in expected $O(n\\log{n})$ time\nwhen density $d \\geq c\\cdot \\sqrt{n}/\\log{n}$, while the previously best\ndensity scope is $d \\geq c\\cdot n/(\\log{n})^{2}$. In addition, the overall\nexpected time and space requirement in the average case are proven to be\n$O(n^5\\log n)$ and $O(n^5)$ respectively. Secondly, in the worst case, it\nslightly improves the previously best time complexity of exact algorithms for\nSSP. Specifically, the worst-case time complexity of our algorithm is proved to\nbe $O((n-6)2^{n/2}+n)$, while the previously best result is $O(n2^{n/2})$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2007 14:43:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2008 02:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wan", "Changlin", ""], ["Shi", "Zhongzhi", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3757", "submitter": "Alexander Kholosha", "authors": "Tor Helleseth and Alexander Kholosha and Aina Johanssen", "title": "$m$-Sequences of Different Lengths with Four-Valued Cross Correlation", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CR", "license": null, "abstract": "  {\\bf Abstract.} Considered is the distribution of the cross correlation\nbetween $m$-sequences of length $2^m-1$, where $m$ is even, and $m$-sequences\nof shorter length $2^{m/2}-1$.

Our security\narchitecture comprises basically of two parts; a key handshaking scheme based\non simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key by a receiver\nnode. Our architecture allows both base-station-to-node or node-to-base-station\nsecure communications, and node-to-node secure communications. Analysis and\nsimulation results show that, our proposed architecture ensures a good level of\nsecurity for communications in the network and could effectively be implemented\nusing the limited computation, memory and energy budgets of the current\ngeneration sensor nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2007 01:49:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Haque", "Md.

Pixel expansion has been a major issue of VSS schemes. A\nnumber of probabilistic VSS schemes with minimum pixel expansion have been\nproposed for binary secret images. This paper presents a general probabilistic\n(k, n)-VSS scheme for gray-scale images and another scheme for color images.\nWith our schemes, the pixel expansion can be set to a user-defined value. When\nthis value is 1, there is no pixel expansion at all. The quality of\nreconstructed secret images, measured by Average Relative Difference, is\nequivalent to Relative Difference of existing deterministic schemes. Previous\nprobabilistic VSS schemes for black-and-white images with respect to pixel\nexpansion can be viewed as special cases of the schemes proposed here\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2007 03:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Dao-Shun", ""], ["Yi", "Feng", ""], ["Li", "Xiaobo", ""]]}]
