In these\nprograms, participants install devices in their vehicles that monitor their\ndriving behavior, which raises some privacy concerns. Some devices collect\nfine-grained speed data to monitor driving habits. Companies that use these\ndevices claim that their approach is privacy-preserving because speedometer\nmeasurements do not have physical locations. However, we show that with\nknowledge of the user's home location, as the insurance companies have, speed\ndata is sufficient to discover driving routes and destinations when trip data\nis collected over a period of weeks. To demonstrate the real-world\napplicability of our approach we applied our algorithm, elastic pathing, to\ndata collected over hundreds of driving trips occurring over several months.\nWith this data and our approach, we were able to predict trip destinations to\nwithin 250 meters of ground truth in 10% of the traces and within 500 meters in\n20% of the traces. This result, combined with the amount of speed data that is\nbeing collected by insurance companies, constitutes a substantial breach of\nprivacy because a person's regular driving pattern can be deduced with repeated\nexamples of the same paths with just a few weeks of monitoring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 23:11:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Firner", "Bernhard", ""], ["Sugrim", "Shridatt", ""], ["Yang", "Yulong", ""], ["Lindqvist", "Janne", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0102", "submitter": "Mahdi Zamani", "authors": "Mahdi Zamani and Mahnush Movahedi and Mohammad Ebadzadeh and Hossein\n  Pedram", "title": "A DDoS-Aware IDS Model Based on Danger Theory and Mobile Agents", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.AI cs.CR cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an artificial immune model for intrusion detection in distributed\nsystems based on a relatively recent theory in immunology called Danger theory.\nBased on Danger theory, immune response in natural systems is a result of\nsensing corruption as well as sensing unknown substances.

Thus these functions are not\npseudorandom generators by definition. On the other hand, NIST SP800-22 does\nnot cover some of the important laws for randomness. Two fundamental limit\ntheorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law\nof the iterated logarithm (LIL). Several frequency related tests in NIST\nSP800-22 cover the central limit theorem while no NIST SP800-22 test covers\nLIL.\n  This paper proposes techniques to address the above challenges that NIST\nSP800-22 testing suite faces.

We believe that resources other than\ncryptographic keys can be used for communication privacy. We consider private\nmessage transmission (PMT) in an abstract multipath communication model between\ntwo communicants, Alice and Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. Alice\nand Bob have pre-shared keys and Eve is computationally unbounded. There are a\ntotal of $n$ paths and the three parties can have simultaneous access to at\nmost $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_e$ paths. The parties can switch their paths after\nevery $\\lambda$ bits of communication. We study perfect (P)-PMT versus\nasymptotically-perfect (AP)-PMT protocols. The former has zero tolerance of\ntransmission error and leakage, whereas the latter allows for positive error\nand leakage that tend to zero as the message length increases. We derive the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which P-PMT and AP-PMT are possible.\nWe also introduce explicit P-PMT and AP-PMT constructions. Our results show\nAP-PMT protocols attain much higher information rates than P-PMT ones.\nInterestingly, AP-PMT is possible even in poorest condition where $t_a=t_b=1$\nand $t_e=n-1$.

In this paper, we propose solutions\nto conduct range queries over outsourced encrypted data. The existing methods\nleak valuable information to the cloud which can violate the security guarantee\nof the underlying encryption schemes. In general, the main security primitive\nused to evaluate range queries is secure comparison (SC) of encrypted integers.\nHowever, we observe that the existing SC protocols are not very efficient. To\nthis end, we first propose a novel SC scheme that takes encrypted integers and\noutputs encrypted comparison result. We empirically show its practical\nadvantage over the current state-of-the-art. We then utilize the proposed SC\nscheme to construct two new secure range query protocols. Our protocols protect\ndata confidentiality, privacy of user's query, and also preserve the semantic\nsecurity of the encrypted data; therefore, they are more secure than the\nexisting protocols.

To address this problem, we propose a suit of\npriority-aware private matching schemes to privately match the similarity with\npotential friends in the vicinity. Unlike most existing work, our proposed\npriority-aware matching scheme (P-match) achieves the privacy goal by combining\nthe commutative encryption function and the Tanimoto similarity coefficient\nwhich considers both the number of common attributes between users as well as\nthe corresponding priorities on each common attribute. Further, based on the\nnewly constructed similarity function which takes the ratio of attributes\nmatched over all the input set into consideration, we design an enhanced\nversion to deal with some potential attacks such as unlimitedly inputting the\nattribute set on either the initiator side or the responder side, etc. Finally,\nour proposed E-match avoids the heavy cryptographic operations and improves the\nsystem performance significantly by employing a novel use of the Bloom filter.\nThe security and communication/computation overhead of our schemes are\nthoroughly analyzed and evaluated via detailed simulations and implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 05:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Niu", "Ben", ""], ["Zhang", "Tanran", ""], ["Zhu", "Xiaoyan", ""], ["Li", "Hui", ""], ["Lu", "Zongqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8170", "submitter": "Pablo Rauzy", "authors": "Pablo Rauzy (LTCI), Sylvain Guilley", "title": "A Formal Proof of Countermeasures against Fault Injection Attacks on\n  CRT-RSA", "comments": "PROOFS, Santa Barbara, CA : United States (2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13389-013-0065-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, we describe a methodology that aims at either breaking or\nproving the security of CRT-RSA implementations against fault injection\nattacks.
