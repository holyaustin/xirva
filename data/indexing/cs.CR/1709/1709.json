However, in such settings, they have been\nshown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, including the deliberate\nmanipulation of data at test time to evade detection. In this work, we focus on\nthe vulnerability of linear classifiers to evasion attacks. This can be\nconsidered a relevant problem, as linear classifiers have been increasingly\nused in embedded systems and mobile devices for their low processing time and\nmemory requirements. We exploit recent findings in robust optimization to\ninvestigate the link between regularization and security of linear classifiers,\ndepending on the type of attack. We also analyze the relationship between the\nsparsity of feature weights, which is desirable for reducing processing cost,\nand the security of linear classifiers. We further propose a novel octagonal\nregularizer that allows us to achieve a proper trade-off between them. Finally,\nwe empirically show how this regularizer can improve classifier security and\nsparsity in real-world application examples including spam and malware\ndetection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 19:11:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Demontis", "Ambra", ""], ["Russu", "Paolo", ""], ["Biggio", "Battista", ""], ["Fumera", "Giorgio", ""], ["Roli", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00054", "submitter": "Thee Chanyaswad", "authors": "Thee Chanyaswad, Changchang Liu, Prateek Mittal", "title": "RON-Gauss: Enhancing Utility in Non-Interactive Private Data Release", "comments": "Appears in PoPETS 2019.1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A key challenge facing the design of differential privacy in the\nnon-interactive setting is to maintain the utility of the released data.

Although these rules work well in practice,\nexpanding them to model further passwords is a laborious task that requires\nspecialized expertise. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce\nPassGAN, a novel approach that replaces human-generated password rules with\ntheory-grounded machine learning algorithms. Instead of relying on manual\npassword analysis, PassGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to\nautonomously learn the distribution of real passwords from actual password\nleaks, and to generate high-quality password guesses. Our experiments show that\nthis approach is very promising. When we evaluated PassGAN on two large\npassword datasets, we were able to surpass rule-based and state-of-the-art\nmachine learning password guessing tools. However, in contrast with the other\ntools, PassGAN achieved this result without any a-priori knowledge on passwords\nor common password structures. Additionally, when we combined the output of\nPassGAN with the output of HashCat, we were able to match 51%-73% more\npasswords than with HashCat alone.

However, the existing ad hoc\nefforts lack either efficiency or privacy. In this work, we first identify\nseveral efficiency concerns in SilentWhsipers. Armed with this knowledge, we\ndesign and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized\nPBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and\non-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our\nsimulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple\ncredit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of\nstabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a\ntransaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs\nmaintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing,\nwhile providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals\nfor routing in PBT networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 02:30:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 23:44:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Roos", "Stefanie", ""], ["Moreno-Sanchez", "Pedro", ""], ["Kate", "Aniket", ""], ["Goldberg", "Ian", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05750", "submitter": "NhatHai Phan", "authors": "NhatHai Phan, Xintao Wu, Han Hu, Dejing Dou", "title": "Adaptive Laplace Mechanism: Differential Privacy Preservation in Deep\n  Learning", "comments": "IEEE ICDM 2017 - regular paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus on developing a novel mechanism to preserve\ndifferential privacy in deep neural networks, such that: (1) The privacy budget\nconsumption is totally independent of the number of training steps; (2) It has\nthe ability to adaptively inject noise into features based on the contribution\nof each to the output; and (3) It could be applied in a variety of different\ndeep neural networks.

To overcome this difficulty, we propose\na simple, efficient and robust image encryption algorithm based on combined\napplications of quasigroups and chaotic standard map. The proposed image cipher\nis based on the popular substitution-diffusion architecture (Shanon) where a\nquasigroup of order 256 and chaotic standard map have been used for the\nsubstitution and permutation of image pixels respectively. Due to the\nintroduction of quasigroup as part of the secret key along with the parameter\nand initial conditions of the chaotic standard map, the key space has been\nincreased significantly. The proposed image cipher is very fast due to the fact\nthat the substitution based on the quasigroup operations is very simple and can\nbe executed easily through the lookup table operations on Latin squares (which\nare Cayley operation tables of quasigroups) and the permutation is performed\nrow-by-row as well as column-by-column using the pseudo random number sequences\ngener-ated through the chaotic standard map.

We model security issues as stochastic systems. This allows us to\nfind weaknesses in existing security systems and propose new solutions.\nExploring the vulnerabilities of existing security tools can prevent\ncyber-attacks from taking advantages of the system weaknesses. We propose a\nhybrid network security scheme including intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and\nhoneypots scattered throughout the network. This combines the advantages of two\nsecurity technologies. A honeypot is an activity-based network security system,\nwhich could be the logical supplement of the passive detection policies used by\nIDSs. This integration forces us to balance security performance versus cost by\nscheduling device activities for the proposed system. By formulating the\nscheduling problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (DEC-POMDP), decisions are made in a distributed manner at each device\nwithout requiring centralized control. The partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP) is a useful choice for controlling stochastic systems. As a\ncombination of two Markov models, POMDPs combine the strength of hidden Markov\nModel (HMM) (capturing dynamics that depend on unobserved states) and that of\nMarkov decision process (MDP) (taking the decision aspect into account).\nDecision making under uncertainty is used in many parts of business and\nscience.We use here for security tools.We adopt a high-quality approximation\nsolution for finite-space POMDPs with the average cost criterion, and their\nextension to DEC-POMDPs.

With intact position data of trains, our detection\nsystem can effectively detect the FDI attacks on trains' voltage and current\nmeasurements even if the attacker has full and accurate knowledge of the TPS,\nattack detection, and real-time system state. In particular, the GAD system\nfeatures an adaptive mechanism that ensures low false positive and negative\nrates in detecting the attacks under noisy system measurements.

Among\nexisting covert channels stands the domain name system (DNS) protocol. Although\nthe detection of covert channels over the DNS has been thoroughly studied in\nthe last decade, previous research dealt with a specific subclass of covert\nchannels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection is\nnot undermined, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware\nremained overlooked. The goal of this study is to propose a method for\ndetecting both tunneling and low-throughput data exfiltration over the DNS.\nTowards this end, we propose a solution composed of a supervised feature\nselection method, and an interchangeable, and adjustable anomaly detection\nmodel trained on legitimate traffic. In the first step, a one-class classifier\nis applied for detecting domain-specific traffic that does not conform with the\nnormal behavior. Then, in the second step, in order to reduce the false\npositive rate resulting from the attempt to detect the low-throughput data\nexfiltration we apply a rule-based filter that filters data exchange over DNS\nused by legitimate services. Our solution was evaluated on a medium-scale\nrecursive DNS server logs, and involved more than 75,000 legitimate uses and\nalmost 2,000 attacks. Evaluation results shows that while DNS tunneling is\ncovered with at least 99% recall rate and less than 0.01% false positive rate,\nthe detection of low throughput exfiltration is more difficult.

We show consistency between simulation and\nanalytical results under various system parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:56:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:24:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 20:24:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dabaghchian", "Monireh", ""], ["Alipour-Fanid", "Amir", ""], ["Zeng", "Kai", ""], ["Wang", "Qingsi", ""], ["Auer", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10147", "submitter": "John Clemens", "authors": "J.

This paper details the desirable features and properties of such a\nsystem, and introduces Maat, a prototype implementation of an M&A service that\nmeets these properties. Maat is a platform service that provides a centralized\npolicy-driven framework for determining which measurement tools and protocols\nto use to meet the needs of a given integrity evaluation. Maat simplifies the\ntask of integrating integrity measurements into a range of larger trust\ndecisions such as authentication, network access control, or delegated\ncomputations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 19:50:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pendergrass", "J.

Compared to the state of the art, the main advantage of\nCAOS is that it supports concurrent access without a proxy, for multiple\nread-only clients and a single read-write client. Concurrent access is achieved\nby letting clients maintain independent maps that describe how the data is\nstored. These maps might diverge from client to client, but it is guaranteed\nthat no client will ever lose track of current data. We achieve efficiency and\nconcurrency at the expense of perfect obfuscation: in CAOS the extent to which\naccess patterns are hidden is determined by the resources allocated to its\nbuilt-in obfuscation mechanism. To assess this trade-off we provide both a\nsecurity and a performance analysis of our protocol instance. We additionally\nprovide a proof-of-concept implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:57:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 17:40:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 13:16:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ordean", "Mihai", ""], ["Ryan", "Mark", ""], ["Galindo", "David", ""]]}]
