These protocols enable a\ncomputationally weak verifier to offload computations to a powerful but\nuntrusted prover, while providing the verifier with a guarantee that the prover\nperformed the computations correctly. Despite substantial progress, existing\nimplementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the\nextra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of\ncorrectness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee.\n  We describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally\ndue to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show\nhow to implement the prover in this protocol in time O(S log S), where S is the\nsize of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our\nrefinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently \"regular\";\nfor these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to O(S). That is,\nour prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only\na constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no\nguarantee.\n  We argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove\nsome theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x\nspeedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our\nprover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the\ncircuit.

QKD is the first technology offering\ninformation theoretic secret-key distribution that relies only on the\nfundamental principles of quantum physics. Point-to-point QKD devices have\nreached a mature industrial state; however, these devices are severely limited\nin distance, since signals at the quantum level (e.g. single photons) are\nhighly affected by the losses in the communication channel and intermediate\ndevices. To overcome this limitation, intermediate nodes (i.e. repeaters) are\nused. Both, quantum-regime and trusted, classical, repeaters have been proposed\nin the QKD literature, but only the latter can be implemented in practice. As a\nnovelty, we propose here a new QKD network model based on the use of not fully\ntrusted intermediate nodes, referred as weakly trusted repeaters. This approach\nforces the attacker to simultaneously break several paths to get access to the\nexchanged key, thus improving significantly the security of the network. We\nformalize the model using network codes and provide real scenarios that allow\nusers to exchange secure keys over metropolitan optical networks using only\npassive components.
