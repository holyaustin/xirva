An initial shared information between the\nlegitimate users allowed them to extract more information from the channel than\nthe one obtained by the adversary. That original paper recognized the need for\na privacy amplification step but no specific protocol was presented.

This work merges main ideas of the protection\ngiven by the light's noise in a protocol applied to wireless channels.

Military mission\nsuccess is highly dependent on the communications and information systems\n(CISs) that support the mission and their use in the cyber battlespace. The\ninexorably growing dependency on computational information processing for\nweapons, intelligence, communication, and logistics systems continues to\nincrease the vulnerability of missions to various cyber threats. Attacks on\nCISs or other cyber incidents degrade or disrupt the usage of CISs, and the\nresulting mission capability, performance, and completion. These incidents are\nexpected to increase in frequency and sophistication. The workshop participants\nconcluded that the key to solving the mission impact assessment problem was in\nadopting and developing a new model-driven paradigm that creates and validates\nmechanisms of modeling the mission organization, the mission(s), and the\ncyber-vulnerable systems that support the mission(s). Such models then simulate\nor portray the impacts of the cyber-attacks. In addition, such model-based\nanalysis could explore multiple alternative mitigation and work-around\nstrategies - an essential part of coping with mission impact - and select the\noptimal course of mitigating actions.

The current implementation looks at the\nPassword/Pin numbers of Credit/Debit cards that are used on Automated Teller\nMachine (ATM),though the underlying design of the system can be used in many\nother scenarios. A password that is generated will be allocated to a particular\nuser and to the ATM that is nearest to the user. LAPPS ensures the following\nqualities of the passwords that it generates. Location Awareness: The passwords\nare generated according to the users' geographical area, that they request\ntheir passwords from. So a password will only be active in just one location.\nTime Awareness: A password will only be valid for five minutes. The unused\npasswords will be discarded. Dynamic: The user has to have a new password each\ntime he/she logs in. A password is generated to be used only once. User\nOriented/Specific: The received password can only be used by the requester, and\ncan only be used on its allocated ATM. Two Factor Authenticity: The\nconfidential information will be secured using two-factor authentication. For\nextra security, a Pin generating device has been introduced. This will produce\nan eight digit number that the user has to supply to the mobile application,\nbefore requesting for a password. The user can obtain a pin number by inserting\nhis/her Debit/Credit card and the fixed password that has been allocated when\nthe user registers with the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Jan 2016 14:36:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Magurawalage", "Chathura Sarathchandra", ""], ["Yang", "Kun", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.02281", "submitter": "David Wu", "authors": "David J.

The eID system ensures unique identification and secure\nauthentication for citizens protecting access to applications where sensitive\nand personal data is involved. In particular, the Austrian eID system supports\nthree main use cases: Identification and authentication of Austrian citizens,\nelectronic representation, and foreign citizen authentication at Austrian\npublic sector applications. For supporting all these use cases, several\ncomponents -- either locally deployed in the applications' domain or centrally\ndeployed -- need to communicate with each other. While local deployments have\nsome advantages in terms of scalability, still a central deployment of all\ninvolved components would be advantageous, e.g. due to less maintenance\nefforts.

To bypass the issue on privacy, in this paper we propose an\napproach on how the complete Austrian eID ecosystem can be moved into a public\ncloud in a privacy-preserving manner by applying selected cryptographic\ntechnologies (in particular using proxy re-encryption and redactable\nsignatures).

In this paper,\nwe investigate the privacy of the aforementioned protocols based on Ouafi and\nPhan formal privacy model and show that both IHRMA and I2SRS protocols cannot\nprovide private authentication for RFID users. Moreover, we showthat these\nprotocols are vulnerable to impersonation, DoS and traceability attacks. Then,\nby considering the drawbacks of the studied protocols and implementation of\nmessages with new structures, we present two improved efficient and secure\nauthentication protocols to ameliorate the performance of Cai et al schemes.\nOur analysis illustrate that the existing weaknesses of the discussed protocols\nare eliminated in our proposed protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 17:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ghaemmaghami", "Seyed Salman Sajjadi", ""], ["Haghbin", "Afrooz", ""], ["Mirmohseni", "Mahtab", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.04743", "submitter": "Ryan Williams", "authors": "Ryan Williams", "title": "Strong ETH Breaks With Merlin and Arthur: Short Non-Interactive Proofs\n  of Batch Evaluation", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an efficient proof system for Multipoint Arithmetic Circuit\nEvaluation: for every arithmetic circuit $C(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ of size $s$ and\ndegree $d$ over a field ${\\mathbb F}$, and any inputs $a_1,\\ldots,a_K \\in\n{\\mathbb F}^n$,\n  $\\bullet$ the Prover sends the Verifier the values $C(a_1), \\ldots, C(a_K)\n\\in {\\mathbb F}$ and a proof of $\\tilde{O}(K \\cdot d)$ length, and\n  $\\bullet$ the Verifier tosses $\\textrm{poly}(\\log(dK|{\\mathbb\nF}|/\\varepsilon))$ coins and can check the proof in about $\\tilde{O}(K \\cdot(n\n+ d) + s)$ time, with probability of error less than $\\varepsilon$.\n  For small degree $d$, this \"Merlin-Arthur\" proof system (a.k.a.

In addition, the\nBBT attack is based on several conjectures that are assumed to hold when\nparameters are chosen according to standard distributions, which can be\nmitigated, if not avoided. This paper shows how to choose special distributions\nso that these conjectures do not hold making the BBT attack ineffective for\nbraid groups with sufficiently many strands.

We include a proof-of-concept\nimplementation of our constructions and show that network functions can be\nprivately processed by an untrusted cloud provider in a few milliseconds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 00:24:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Melis", "Luca", ""], ["Asghar", "Hassan Jameel", ""], ["De Cristofaro", "Emiliano", ""], ["Kaafar", "Mohamed Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06502", "submitter": "Mehdi Tibouchi", "authors": "Jeremy Maitin-Shepard, Mehdi Tibouchi and Diego Aranha", "title": "Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash", "comments": "Implementation available on https://github.com/jbms/ecmh", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A homomorphic, or incremental, multiset hash function, associates a hash\nvalue to arbitrary collections of objects (with possible repetitions) in such a\nway that the hash of the union of two collections is easy to compute from the\nhashes of the two collections themselves: it is simply their sum under a\nsuitable group operation. In particular, hash values of large collections can\nbe computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a\nvery useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity\nverification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding.\n  Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature\nare hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash\nfunctions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of\n2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual\nhash functions), and they are also quite slow.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which\ncombines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient\nencoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one\nhand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values\nprovide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a\nhighly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical\nevaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per\nsecond on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level---many\ntimes faster than previous practical methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Maitin-Shepard", "Jeremy", ""], ["Tibouchi", "Mehdi", ""], ["Aranha", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06562", "submitter": "Deepesh Data", "authors": "Deepesh Data", "title": "Secure Computation of Randomized Functions", "comments": "10 pages, 1 figure, Accepted in IEEE International Symposium on\n  Information Theory 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541860", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two user secure computation of randomized functions is considered, where only\none user computes the output.
