Aspect Oriented Programming\n(AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of\nthinking about program structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the\nclass, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. The goal of the\npaper is to present that Aspect Oriented Programming AspectJ integrated with\nSpring AOP provides very powerful mechanisms for stronger enforcement of\nsecurity.Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) allows weaving a security aspect\ninto an application providing additional security functionality or introducing\ncompletely new security mechanisms.Implementation of security with AOP is a\nflexible method to develop separated, extensible and reusable pieces of code\ncalled aspects.In this comparative study paper, we argue that Spring AOP\nprovides stronger enforcement of security than AspectJ.We have shown both\nSpring AOP and AspectJ strive to provide a comprehensive AOP solutions and\ncomplements each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 15:08:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sirbi", "Kotrappa", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Prakash Jayanth", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4555", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Michael Stieghahn and Thomas Engel", "title": "Law-Aware Access Control and its Information Model", "comments": "IEEE Publication Format,\n  https://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computing, Vol. 2, No. 6, June 2010, NY, USA, ISSN\n  2151-9617", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cross-border access to a variety of data such as market information,\nstrategic information, or customer-related information defines the daily\nbusiness of many global companies, including financial institutions.

The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Khisti", "Ashish", ""], ["Wornell", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5894", "submitter": "Anna Rimoldi", "authors": "Anna Rimoldi, Massimiliano Sala, Ilia Toli", "title": "A possible intrinsic weakness of AES and other cryptosystems", "comments": "46 pages- updated bibliography and fixed minor problems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been suggested that the algebraic structure of AES (and other similar\nblock ciphers) could lead to a weakness exploitable in new attacks.
