Since building a\ntest bed is a complicated process, having a pre-built testbed would save the\ntime of future researchers.

QKD is a cutting-edge\nsecurity technology that provides mathematically proven security by using\nquantum physical effects and information theoretical axioms to generate a\nguaranteed non-disclosed stream of encryption keys. Although it has been a\nfield of theoretical research for some time, it has only been producing\nmarket-ready solutions for a short period of time. The downside of this\ntechnology is that its key generation rate is only around 52,000 key bits per\nsecond over a distance of 50 km. As this rate limits the data throughput to the\nsame rate, it is substandard for normal modern communications, especially for\nsecurely interconnecting networks. IPsec, on the other hand, is a well-known\nsecurity protocol that uses classical encryption and is capable of exactly\ncreating site-to-site virtual private networks. This paper presents a solution\nthat combines the performance advantages of IPsec with QKD. The combination\nsacrifices only a small portion of QKD security by using the generated keys a\nlimited number of times instead of just once. As a part of this, the solution\nanswers the question of how many data bits per key bit make sensible upper and\nlower boundaries to yield high performance while maintaining high security.\nWhile previous approaches complement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE),\nthis approach simplifies the implementation with a new key synchronization\nconcept, proposing a lightweight protocol that uses relatively few, slim\ncontrol messages and sparse acknowledgement. Furthermore, it provides a\nLinux-based module for the AIT QKD software using the Netlink XFRM Application\nProgrammers Interface to feed the quantum key to the IP***ABSTRACT TRUNCATED TO\n1920 CHARS***\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jan 2018 11:01:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Marksteiner", "Stefan", ""], ["Rainer", "Benjamin", ""], ["Maurhart", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.01932", "submitter": "Ryan Wails", "authors": "Ryan Wails, Yixin Sun, Aaron Johnson, Mung Chiang, Prateek Mittal", "title": "Tempest: Temporal Dynamics in Anonymity Systems", "comments": "Conference version to appear at The 18th Privacy Enhancing\n  Technologies Symposium (PETS 2018)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many recent proposals for anonymous communication omit from their security\nanalyses a consideration of the effects of time on important system components.\nIn practice, many components of anonymity systems, such as the client location\nand network structure, exhibit changes and patterns over time.

Chameleon departs from the common assumption of additive or linear\nsecret sharing models where three or more parties need to communicate in the\nonline phase: the framework allows two parties with private inputs to\ncommunicate in the online phase under the assumption of a third node generating\ncorrelated randomness in an offline phase. Almost all of the heavy\ncryptographic operations are precomputed in an offline phase which\nsubstantially reduces the communication overhead.

Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is\nchallenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of\nthe transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: phase one in which each\ntransmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats\nsuch transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter\nuses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net\ninterference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is\nsimultaneously useful for all receivers.

In large scale networks like the Internet of Things\n(IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises\nprivacy challenges. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible\nBC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or\nsummarize their transactions and age their data and to exercise the \"right to\nbe forgotten\". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for\ndifferent transactions. To allow for the removal of stored transactions, all\nkeys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage.\nMOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed\nhash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction\nto provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the\ninformation that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a\nreward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing\nmemory consumption. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that\nMOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks.

The survey includes a range of\nvulnerabilities and potential attacks aimed at MIDs, medical and imaging\ninformation systems, and medical protocols and standards such as DICOM and HL7.\nResults: Based on our survey, we found that CT devices face the greatest risk\nof cyber-attack, due to their pivotal role in acute care imaging. Thus, we\nidentified several possible attack vectors that target the infrastructure and\nfunctionality of CT devices, which can cause: 1. Disruption of the parameters'\nvalues used in the scanning protocols within the CT devices (e.g., tampering\nwith the radiation exposure levels); 2. Mechanical disruption of the CT device\n(e.g., changing the pitch); 3. Disruption of the tomography scan signals\nconstructing the digital images; and 4. Denial-of-Service attacks against the\nCT device.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jan 2018 08:05:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 17:32:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mahler", "Tom", ""], ["Nissim", "Nir", ""], ["Shalom", "Erez", ""], ["Goldenberg", "Israel", ""], ["Hassman", "Guy", ""], ["Makori", "Arnon", ""], ["Kochav", "Itzik", ""], ["Elovici", "Yuval", ""], ["Shahar", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.05659", "submitter": "Hannes Bartz", "authors": "Hannes Bartz and Gianluigi Liva", "title": "On Decoding Schemes for the MDPC-McEliece Cryptosystem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, it has been shown how McEliece public-key cryptosystems based on\nmoderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes allow for very compact keys compared\nto variants based on other code families.

Attackers can utilize CRAs to hijack the control\nflow of programs to perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Many\ndefenses, classed into software-based and hardware-based, have been proposed.\nHowever, software-based methods are difficult to be deployed in practical\nsystems due to high performance overhead. Hardware-based methods can reduce\nperformance overhead but may require extending instruction set architectures\n(ISAs) and modifying compiler or suffer the vulnerability of key leakage. To\ntackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hardware-based control flow\nchecking method to resist CRAs with negligible performance overhead without\nextending ISAs, modifying compiler and leaking the encryption/decryption key.\nThe key technique involves two control flow checking mechanisms. The first one\nis the encrypted Hamming distances (EHDs) matching between the physical\nunclonable function (PUF) response and the return addresses, which prevents\nattackers from returning between gadgets so long as the PUF response is secret,\nthus resisting ROP attacks. The second one is the liner encryption/decryption\noperation (XOR) between PUF response and the instructions at target addresses\nof call and jmp instructions to defeat JOP attacks. Advanced return-based\nfull-function reuse attacks will be prevented with the dynamic key-updating\nmethod.

This has resulted in its practical use for either primary detection\nengines or for supplementary heuristic detection by anti-malware vendors.\nRecent work in adversarial machine learning has shown that deep learning models\nare susceptible to gradient-based attacks, whereas non-differentiable models\nthat report a score can be attacked by genetic algorithms that aim to\nsystematically reduce the score. We propose a more general framework based on\nreinforcement learning (RL) for attacking static portable executable (PE)\nanti-malware engines.

Instead, an RL agent\nis equipped with a set of functionality-preserving operations that it may\nperform on the PE file. Through a series of games played against the\nanti-malware engine, it learns which sequences of operations are likely to\nresult in evading the detector for any given malware sample. This enables\ncompletely black-box attacks against static PE anti-malware, and produces\nfunctional evasive malware samples as a direct result.

An important utility of such EMR systems is: a next generation\nof Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) will extract knowledge from these\nelectronic medical records to enable physicians to do accurate and effective\ndiagnosis. It is anticipated that in future such medical records will be shared\nthrough cloud among different physicians to improve the quality of health care.\nTherefore, right protection of medical records is important to protect their\nownership once they are shared with third parties. Watermarking is a proven\nwell known technique to achieve this objective. The challenges associated with\nwatermarking of EMR systems are: (1) some fields in EMR are more relevant in\nthe diagnosis process; as a result, small variations in them could change the\ndiagnosis, and (2) a misdiagnosis might not only result in a life threatening\nscenario but also might lead to significant costs of the treatment for the\npatients. The major contribution of this paper is an information-preserving\nwatermarking scheme to address the above-mentioned challenges. We model the\nwatermarking process as a constrained optimization problem. We demonstrate,\nthrough experiments, that our scheme not only preserves the diagnosis accuracy\nbut is also resilient to well known attacks for corrupting the watermark.

However,\nchanging pseudonyms will not be that useful if previous and current pseudonyms\nare easily linked together. Therefore different techniques have been proposed\nto hide the pseudonym changes and make it difficult to link pseudonyms\ntogether. Most of these techniques do not fully quarantine privacy when\nchanging a pseudonym under some situations such as low traffic. In this paper,\nwe provide a technique for changing pseudonyms that has the same privacy level\nunder all traffic conditions. The technique relies on fixed mix zones that are\nplanted and distributed over the roads. By this technique, a vehicle guarantees\na high level of security when changing its pseudonym at that mix zone which\nwill make it very difficult for an adversary to link particular pseudonyms\ntogether and hence reveal real identity.
