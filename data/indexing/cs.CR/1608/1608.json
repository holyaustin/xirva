The gap between the low-level events and the high-level abnormal\nbehaviors makes it hard to infer which single events are related to the real\nabnormal activities, especially considering that there are massive \"noisy\"\nlow-level events happening in between. Hence, the existing work that focus on\ndetecting single entities/events can hardly achieve high detection accuracy.\nDifferent from previous work, we design and implement GID, an efficient\ngraph-based intrusion detection technique that can identify abnormal event\nsequences from a massive heterogeneous process traces with high accuracy.

We underline that the vulnerability exploited by the KYE\nattack is proper of SDN and is not present in legacy networks.

Due to the lack of intrinsic distance\nmeasures among entities, and the exponentially large event space, most existing\nwork relies heavily on heuristics to calculate abnormal scores for events.\nDifferent from previous work, we propose a principled and unified probabilistic\nmodel APE (Anomaly detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity\nembedding) that directly models the likelihood of events. In this model, we\nembed entities into a common latent space using their observed co-occurrence in\ndifferent events. More specifically, we first model the compatibility of each\npair of entities according to their embeddings. Then we utilize the weighted\npairwise interactions of different entity types to define the event\nprobability. Using Noise-Contrastive Estimation with \"context-dependent\" noise\ndistribution, our model can be learned efficiently regardless of the large\nevent space. Experimental results on real enterprise surveillance data show\nthat our methods can accurately detect abnormal events compared to other\nstate-of-the-art abnormal detection techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 16:15:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Ting", ""], ["Tang", "Lu-An", ""], ["Sun", "Yizhou", ""], ["Chen", "Zhengzhang", ""], ["Zhang", "Kai", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07679", "submitter": "Sungho Jeon", "authors": "Sungho Jeon, Jeong-Han Yun, Seungoh Choi, Woo-Nyon Kim", "title": "Passive Fingerprinting of SCADA in Critical Infrastructure Network\n  without Deep Packet Inspection", "comments": "IEEE 8 pages, submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the first technique of passive fingerprinting for Supervisory\nControl And Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks without Deep Packet Inspection\n(DPI) and experience on real environment.

Recent work has\nchallenged this approach by developing schemes, based on a chain partition of\nthe information flow policy, that do not require public information for key\nderivation, the trade-off being that a user may need to be assigned more than\none secret. In general, many different chain partitions exist for the same\npolicy and, until now, it was not known how to compute an appropriate one.\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a tree partition, of which chain\npartitions are a special case.

We establish a number of results\nlinking the amount of secret material that needs to be distributed to users\nwith a weighted acyclic graph derived from the tree partition.
