Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a\nlogic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4\nto be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of\nqu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +\nf(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4\nand alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,\nmanifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is\nfalsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax\n* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To\nthe signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1\nand Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.\nTherefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which\nconnotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in\nREESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly\nselected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2007 04:31:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 14:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Shenghui", ""], ["Lu", "Shuwang", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.0858", "submitter": "Mohamed Kaaniche", "authors": "Eric Alata (LAAS), Vincent Nicomette (LAAS), Mohamed Ka\\^aniche\n  (LAAS), Marc Dacier (LAAS), Matthieu Herrb (LAAS)", "title": "Lessons Learned from the deployment of a high-interaction honeypot", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc. 6th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC-6),\n  Coimbra (Portugal), 18-20 octobre 2006 (18/10/2006) 39-44", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from the\nobservation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine.

Unlike previous works, where a\nnoiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and\nfeedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite\ninterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in\nthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive\nchannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is\nshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity\nto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the\nwiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a\nprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel\nfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even\nwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination\nchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of\nthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over\nthe channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is\nextended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\\Lambda$ channel where it is\nshown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the\ncapacity in the absence of the wiretapper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2007 02:43:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lai", "Lifeng", ""], ["Gamal", "Hesham El", ""], ["Poor", "H.

Secondly, we propose a new construction based on\ntextual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of\nautomated challenges easier.
