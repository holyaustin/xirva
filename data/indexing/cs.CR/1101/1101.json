First, the specific entropy profile of encrypted data makes\ntheir detection very easy. Second, the use of cryptography can be more or less\nregulated, not to say forbidden, according to the countries. If the right to\nfreely protect our personal and private data is a fundamental right, it must\nnot hinder the action of Nation States with respect to National security.\nAllowing encryption to citizens holds for bad guys as well.\n  In this paper we propose a new approach in information and communication\nsecurity that may solve all these issues, thus representing a rather\ninteresting trade-off between apparently opposite security needs. We introduce\nthe concept of scalable security based on computationnally hard problem of\ncoding theory with the PERSEUS technology.\n  The core idea is to encode date with variable punctured convolutional codes\nin such a way that any cryptanalytic attempt will require a time-consuming\nencoder reconstruction in order to decode. By adding noise in a suitable way,\nthat reconstruction becomes untractable in practice except for Intelligence\nservices that however must use supercomputers during a significant, scalable\namount of time. Hence it limits naturally any will to unduly performs such\nattacks (eg. against citizens' privacy).\n  On the users' side, encoder and noise parameters are first exchanged through\nan initial, short HTTPS session. The principles behind that approach have been\nmathematically validated in 1997 and 2007. We present the PERSEUS library we\nhave developed under the triple GPL/LGPL/MPL licences. This library can be used\nto protect any kind of data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 09:13:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Filiol", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0104", "submitter": "Anjan Krishnamurthy", "authors": "Anjan K, Jibi Abraham and Mamatha Jadhav V", "title": "Design of Transport Layer Based Hybrid Covert Channel Detection Engine", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures, Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5121/ijasuc.2010.1409", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Computer network is unpredictable due to information warfare and is prone to\nvarious attacks.

How to benefit from the adversary's\nuncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a\nconnection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create\nuncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done\n\"safely\", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This\nresult illustrates that \"hiding in a crowd of $k$\" indeed offers some privacy\nguarantees. This result also suggests an alternative approach to output\nperturbation for satisfying differential privacy: namely, adding a random\nsampling step in the beginning and pruning results that are too sensitive to\nchange of a single tuple. Regarding the second question, we provide both\npositive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a\nrandom-sampling pre-processing step to a differentially-private algorithm can\ngreatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset\nresulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the\nnegative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary's\nuncertainty likely does not compose.

A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers\n(MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone\nthrough the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and\ncommunicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the\ninvolvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in\nWMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,\nstringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to\nsupport real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,\nreliable and efficient routing protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end\nlatency. Design of a secure and efficient routing protocol for WMNs, therefore,\nis of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable\nrouting protocol that also provides user anonymity in WMNs. The protocol is\nbased on an accurate estimation of the available bandwidth in the wireless\nlinks and a robust estimation of the end-to-end delay in a routing path, and\nminimization of control message overhead. The user anonymity, authentication\nand data privacy is achieved by application of a novel protocol that is based\non Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulations carried out on the proposed\nprotocol demonstrate that it is more efficient than some of the existing\nrouting protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jan 2011 09:58:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2819", "submitter": "Michael Tschantz", "authors": "Michael Carl Tschantz, Dilsun Kaynar and Anupam Datta", "title": "Formal Verification of Differential Privacy for Interactive Systems", "comments": "65 pages with 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data\nanalysis with a well-developed theory for functions.

Its claimed advantages in security and efficiency are compromised.\nThe analysis in this paper illustrates that although the first two failures may\nbe fixed by modifying the shuffling protocol, the last one is too serious to\nfix at a tolerable cost. Especially, an attack is proposed to show how easily\nsoundness of the shuffling scheme can be compromised. Moreover, the most\nsurprising discovery in this paper is that it is formally illustrated that in\npractice it is impossible to fix soundness of the shuffling scheme by Wikstrom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 04:51:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Kun", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5578", "submitter": "Daniele Perito", "authors": "Daniele Perito, Claude Castelluccia, Mohamed Ali Kaafar, Pere Manils", "title": "How Unique and Traceable are Usernames?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Suppose you find the same username on different online services, what is the\nprobability that these usernames refer to the same physical person? This work\naddresses what appears to be a fairly simple question, which has many\nimplications for anonymity and privacy on the Internet. One possible way of\nestimating this probability would be to look at the public information\nassociated to the two accounts and try to match them. However, for most\nservices, these information are chosen by the users themselves and are often\nvery heterogeneous, possibly false and difficult to collect. Furthermore,\nseveral websites do not disclose any additional public information about users\napart from their usernames (e.g., discus- sion forums or Blog comments),\nnonetheless, they might contain sensitive information about users. This paper\nexplores the possibility of linking users profiles only by looking at their\nusernames. The intuition is that the probability that two usernames refer to\nthe same physical person strongly depends on the \"entropy\" of the username\nstring itself. Our experiments, based on crawls of real web services, show that\na significant portion of the users' profiles can be linked using their\nusernames. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that usernames\nare considered as a source of information when profiling users on the Internet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 17:04:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 15:02:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 10:04:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Perito", "Daniele", ""], ["Castelluccia", "Claude", ""], ["Kaafar", "Mohamed Ali", ""], ["Manils", "Pere", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5613", "submitter": "Syed (Shawon) Rahman", "authors": "Anthony Bisong and Syed (Shawon) M.
