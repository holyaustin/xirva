Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements)\nis essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and\navoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a\nTCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer\nholds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the\nprotocol. In fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is\nto bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to\nconceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders\narbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows,\nleading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal\ntreatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism\nto force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect\nacknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would\nbe identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender\ngenerates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could\ngenerate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender;\nthe sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof\nwould indicate a cheating receiver. The scheme is very efficient in the sense\nthat the TCP sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the\nproofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. The scheme is\nbased on an aggregate authenticator. In addition, the proposed solution can be\napplied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring correct\nfeedback.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2008 02:56:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 04:27:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2011 02:37:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Aldar C-F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.0693", "submitter": "Tsuyoshi Ito", "authors": "Tsuyoshi Ito, Hirotada Kobayashi, Keiji Matsumoto", "title": "Oracularization and Two-Prover One-Round Interactive Proofs against\n  Nonlocal Strategies", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A central problem in quantum computational complexity is how to prevent\nentanglement-assisted cheating in multi-prover interactive proof systems. It is\nwell-known that the standard oracularization technique completely fails in some\nproof systems under the existence of prior entanglement. This paper studies two\nconstructions of two-prover one-round interactive proof systems based on\noracularization. First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially\nsmall soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest\nprovers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use\narbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time\nhierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still\nadvantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use\nquantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round\ninteractive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query\nprobabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even\nagainst dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a\nconsequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap\nbetween completeness and soundness, in which each prover responds with only two\nbits. In other words, it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse-polynomial\nthe value of a classical two-prover one-round game, even when provers are\nentangled and each sends a two-bit answer to a verifier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 18:24:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Tsuyoshi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hirotada", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Keiji", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1319", "submitter": "Mohamed Abdel Ghany Mr", "authors": "Mohamed Abdel Ghany, Ahmed Sultan and Hesham El Gamal", "title": "ARQ-Based Secret Key Sharing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "WINC-TR-1002", "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops a novel framework for sharing secret keys using existing\nAutomatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols.
