Rather than obfuscating network\nidentity through higher level protocols, we propose a more direct solution: a\nrouting protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity,\nproviding a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to\nbe defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value.\n  Given current research initiatives advocating \"clean slate\" Internet designs,\nan opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that\ndecouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity\nproblem. Recently, Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), but it does not\nprotect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP, which will\nnot be acceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation\nInternet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker\nlocated at any single point within the network, including the user's ISP. A\nmajor design challenge is to provide this protection without including an\napplication-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path\nconstruction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path\nsegments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of\nthe path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design\nfeatures include the choice of many different paths through the network and the\njoining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party.

A closer examination reveals that they are closer\nto being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied\nrather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto\ncurrencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto\ncurrencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for\nbitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor\ndouble spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of\nmillions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of\nmillions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet\ninsufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the\nprotection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused.

First, our\nalgorithm performs each reliable computation with the following amortized\nresource costs: $O(m + n \\log n)$ messages, $O(m + n \\log n)$ computational\noperations, and $O(\\ell)$ latency, where $\\ell$ is the depth of the circuit\nthat computes $f$. Second, the expected total number of corruptions is $O(t\n(\\log^{*} m)^2)$, after which the adversarially controlled parties are\neffectively quarantined so that they cause no more corruptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2014 06:44:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 15:17:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "George", ""], ["Saia", "Jared", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.1196", "submitter": "Zoltan Gingl", "authors": "Robert Mingesz, Gergely Vadai and Zoltan Gingl", "title": "What kind of noise guarantees security for the\n  Kirchhoff-Loop-Johnson-Noise key exchange?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Fluctuation and Noise Letters 13:(3) E1450021 (2014)", "doi": "10.1142/S0219477514500217", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is a supplement to our recent one about the analysis of the\nnoise properties in the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) secure key exchange\nsystem [Gingl and Mingesz, PLOS ONE 9 (2014) e96109,\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096109].

Moreover, the transaction syntax\nallows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of\nmutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some\nfinancial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the\nproperties of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin contracts have several potential\napplications in the digital economy, so far they have not been widely used in\nreal life.

To deal with a flood attack, we have proposed Neighbor\nDefense Technique for Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (NDTAODV). This makes\nAODV more robust. The proposed technique has been designed to isolate the flood\nattacker with the use of timers, peak value and hello alarm technique. We have\nsimulated our work in Network Simulator NS-2.33 (NS-2) with different pause\ntimes by way of different number of malicious nodes. We have compared the\nperformance of NDTAODV with the AODV in normal situation as well as in the\npresence of malicious attacks. We have considered Packet Delivery Fraction\n(PDF), Average Throughput (AT) and Normalized Routing Load (NRL) for comparing\nthe performance of NDTAODV and AODV.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 17:23:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Akshai", ""], ["Gandhi", "Savita", ""], ["Chaubey", "Nirbhay", ""], ["Tada", "Naren", ""], ["Trivedi", "Srushti", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.6263", "submitter": "Hemalata  Gosavi A", "authors": "Hemalata A.

In the prior works,\ndetecting these ECVs use a set of sinks pertaining to the ECVs under detection.\nIn this paper, we argue that a more comprehensive and effective approach should\nstart by a systematic selection and classification of vulnerability-specific\nsinks (VSinks). The set of VSinks is much larger than those used in the\nprevious works. Based on these VSinks, our sink-driven approach can detect\ndifferent kinds of ECVs in an app in two steps. First, VSinks and their\ncategories are identified through a typical forward reachability analysis.\nSecond, based on each VSink's category, a corresponding detection method is\nused to identify the ECV via a customized backward dataflow analysis. We also\ndesign a semi-auto guided analysis and validation capability for system-only\nbroadcast checking to remove some false positives. We implement our sink-driven\napproach in a tool called ECVDetector and evaluate it with the top 1K Android\napps. Using ECVDetector we successfully identify a total of 49 vulnerable apps\nacross all four ECV categories we have defined.

However,\nlittle work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images. The\nexisting results in these two individual research areas cannot be combined\ndirectly for the robust coding of encrypted images. This is because the robust\ncoding of natural images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations\nusing sparse transforms such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is\nineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between encrypted\npixels. Moreover, the compression of encrypted images always generates code\nstreams with different significance. If one or more such streams are lost, the\nquality of the reconstructed images may drop substantially or decoding error\nmay exist, which violates the goal of robust coding of encrypted images. In\nthis work, we intend to design a robust coder, based on compressive sensing\nwith structurally random matrix, for encrypted images over packet transmission\nnetworks. The proposed coder can be applied in the scenario that Alice needs a\nsemi-trusted channel provider Charlie to encode and transmit the encrypted\nimage to Bob. In particular, Alice first encrypts an image using globally\nrandom permutation and then sends the encrypted image to Charlie who samples\nthe encrypted image using a structural matrix. Through an imperfect channel\nwith packet loss, Bob receives the compressive measurements and reconstructs\nthe original image by joint decryption and decoding. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed coder can be considered as an efficient multiple description\ncoder with a number of descriptions against packet loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 09:14:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yushu", ""], ["Wong", "Kwok-Wo", ""], ["Zhang", "Leo Yu", ""], ["Xiao", "Di", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.6912", "submitter": "Michele Peroli", "authors": "Michele Peroli, Luca Vigan\\`o, and Matteo Zavatteri", "title": "Non-collaborative Attackers and How and Where to Defend Flawed Security\n  Protocols (Extended Version)", "comments": "29 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Security protocols are often found to be flawed after their deployment.
