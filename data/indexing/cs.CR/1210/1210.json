However, it remains\ndifficult to increase the number of channels per node, thus the maximal degree\nof the network may be bounded. This is typically the case in grid topology\nnetworks, where each node has at most four neighbors. In this paper, we address\nthe following issue: if each node is likely to fail in an unpredictable manner,\nhow can we preserve some global reliability guarantees when the number of nodes\nkeeps increasing unboundedly ? To be more specific, we consider the problem or\nreliably broadcasting information on an asynchronous grid in the presence of\nByzantine failures -- that is, some nodes may have an arbitrary and potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our requirement is that a constant fraction of correct\nnodes remain able to achieve reliable communication. Existing solutions can\nonly tolerate a fixed number of Byzantine failures if they adopt a worst-case\nplacement scheme. Besides, if we assume a constant Byzantine ratio (each node\nhas the same probability to be Byzantine), the probability to have a fatal\nplacement approaches 1 when the number of nodes increases, and reliability\nguarantees collapse. In this paper, we propose the first broadcast protocol\nthat overcomes these difficulties. First, the number of Byzantine failures that\ncan be tolerated (if they adopt the worst-case placement) now increases with\nthe number of nodes. Second, we are able to tolerate a constant Byzantine\nratio, however large the grid may be. In other words, the grid becomes\nscalable.

One issue is whether the user can verify\nthat the server is actually storing the file, and typically a\nchallenge-response protocol is employed to convince the user that the file is\nindeed being stored correctly. The security of these schemes is phrased in\nterms of an extractor which will recover or retrieve the file given any\n\"proving algorithm\" that has a sufficiently high success probability.\n  This paper treats proof-of-retrievability schemes in the model of\nunconditional security, where an adversary has unlimited computational power.\nIn this case retrievability of the file can be modelled as error-correction in\na certain code. We provide a general analytical framework for such schemes that\nyields exact (non-asymptotic) reductions that precisely quantify conditions for\nextraction to succeed as a function of the success probability of a proving\nalgorithm, and we apply this analysis to several archetypal schemes. In\naddition, we provide a new methodology for the analysis of keyed POR schemes in\nan unconditionally secure setting, and use it to prove the security of a\nmodified version of a scheme due to Shacham and Waters under a slightly\nrestricted attack model, thus providing the first example of a keyed POR scheme\nwith unconditional security. We also show how classical statistical techniques\ncan be used to evaluate whether the responses of the prover are accurate enough\nto permit successful extraction. Finally, we prove a new lower bound on storage\nand communication complexity of POR schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2012 18:05:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Paterson", "Maura B.", ""], ["Stinson", "Douglas R.", ""], ["Upadhyay", "Jalaj", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.7931", "submitter": "Franti\\v{s}ek Mat\\'u\\v{s}", "authors": "Franti\\v{s}ek Mat\\'u\\v{s}", "title": "Polymatroids and polyquantoids", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "\\emph{Proceedings of WUPES 2012}, Sept.\\ 12--15, Mari\\'ansk\\'e\n  L\\'azn\\`i, Czech Republic, 126--136", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When studying entropy functions of multivariate probability distributions,\npolymatroids and matroids emerge.
