On the practical side, simple protocols for\nRabin Oblivious Transfer, 1-2 Oblivious Transfer and Bit Commitment are\npresented. No quantum memory is required for honest players, whereas the\nprotocols can only be broken by an adversary controlling a large amount of\nquantum memory. The protocols are efficient, non-interactive and can be\nimplemented with today's technology.\n  On the theoretical side, new entropic uncertainty relations involving\nmin-entropy are established and used to prove the security of protocols\naccording to new strong security definitions. For instance, in the realistic\nsetting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded\neavesdroppers, the uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD\nprotocols while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the\nstandard model with unbounded adversaries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 19:28:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Schaffner", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0492", "submitter": "Stephanie Wehner", "authors": "Stephanie Wehner, J\\\"urg Wullschleger", "title": "Composable Security in the Bounded-Quantum-Storage Model", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of ICALP 2008, pages 604--615", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR", "license": null, "abstract": "  We present a simplified framework for proving sequential composability in the\nquantum setting. In particular, we give a new, simulation-based, definition for\nsecurity in the bounded-quantum-storage model, and show that this definition\nallows for sequential composition of protocols. Damgard et al. (FOCS '05,\nCRYPTO '07) showed how to securely implement bit commitment and oblivious\ntransfer in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where the adversary is only\nallowed to store a limited number of qubits. However, their security\ndefinitions did only apply to the standalone setting, and it was not clear if\ntheir protocols could be composed. Indeed, we first give a simple attack that\nshows that these protocols are not composable without a small refinement of the\nmodel. Finally, we prove the security of their randomized oblivious transfer\nprotocol in our refined model. Secure implementations of oblivious transfer and\nbit commitment then follow easily by a (classical) reduction to randomized\noblivious transfer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 18:15:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wehner", "Stephanie", ""], ["Wullschleger", "J\u00fcrg", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1080", "submitter": "Cas Cremers", "authors": "Cas Cremers", "title": "On the Protocol Composition Logic PCL", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LO", "license": null, "abstract": "  A recent development in formal security protocol analysis is the Protocol\nComposition Logic (PCL).
