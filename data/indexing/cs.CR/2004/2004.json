First and foremost, finite computers cannot exactly represent\nsamples from continuous distributions, and previous work has demonstrated that\nseemingly innocuous numerical errors can entirely destroy privacy. Moreover,\nwhen the underlying data is itself discrete (e.g., population counts), adding\ncontinuous noise makes the result less interpretable.\n  With these shortcomings in mind, we introduce and analyze the discrete\nGaussian in the context of differential privacy. Specifically, we theoretically\nand experimentally show that adding discrete Gaussian noise provides\nessentially the same privacy and accuracy guarantees as the addition of\ncontinuous Gaussian noise. We also present an simple and efficient algorithm\nfor exact sampling from this distribution. This demonstrates its applicability\nfor privately answering counting queries, or more generally, low-sensitivity\ninteger-valued queries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2020 16:47:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2020 19:29:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2020 12:39:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2021 23:30:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Canonne", "Cl\u00e9ment L.", ""], ["Kamath", "Gautam", ""], ["Steinke", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00053", "submitter": "Congzheng Song", "authors": "Congzheng Song and Ananth Raghunathan", "title": "Information Leakage in Embedding Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Embeddings are functions that map raw input data to low-dimensional vector\nrepresentations, while preserving important semantic information about the\ninputs.

The protocol guarantees that only the latest channel state can be\nconfirmed on channel closure. LN nodes gossip about channels available for\nrouting and their total capacities. To issue a (multi-hop) payment, the sender\ncreates a route based on its local knowledge of the graph. As local channel\nbalances are not public, payments often fail due to insufficient balance at an\nintermediary hop. In that case, the payment is attempted along multiple routes\nuntil it succeeds. This constitutes a privacy-efficiency tradeoff: hidden\nbalances improve privacy but hinder routing efficiency.

Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to\npresent a message which attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they\nare a blocking user interface element.\n  Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list\nutilising an Austrian IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a\ntotal of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which 1538 were malicious.

A common belief among\npractitioners is that, for the latest generation of DDR4 systems that are\nprotected by TRR, RowHammer is no longer an issue in practice. However, in\nreality, very little is known about TRR. In this paper, we demystify the inner\nworkings of TRR and debunk its security guarantees. We show that what is\nadvertised as a single mitigation mechanism is actually a series of different\nsolutions coalesced under the umbrella term TRR. We inspect and disclose, via a\ndeep analysis, different existing TRR solutions and demonstrate that modern\nimplementations operate entirely inside DRAM chips. Despite the difficulties of\nanalyzing in-DRAM mitigations, we describe novel techniques for gaining\ninsights into the operation of these mitigation mechanisms. These insights\nallow us to build TRRespass, a scalable black-box RowHammer fuzzer. TRRespass\nshows that even the latest generation DDR4 chips with in-DRAM TRR, immune to\nall known RowHammer attacks, are often still vulnerable to new TRR-aware\nvariants of RowHammer that we develop. In particular, TRRespass finds that, on\nmodern DDR4 modules, RowHammer is still possible when many aggressor rows are\nused (as many as 19 in some cases), with a method we generally refer to as\nMany-sided RowHammer. Overall, our analysis shows that 13 out of the 42 modules\nfrom all three major DRAM vendors are vulnerable to our TRR-aware RowHammer\naccess patterns, and thus one can still mount existing state-of-the-art\nRowHammer attacks. In addition to DDR4, we also experiment with LPDDR4 chips\nand show that they are susceptible to RowHammer bit flips too.

Our\nscheme radically reduces CRL distribution overhead: each vehicle receives CRLs\ncorresponding only to its region of operation and its actual trip duration.\nMoreover, a \"fingerprint\" of CRL 'pieces' is attached to a subset of\n(verifiable) pseudonyms for fast CRL 'piece' validation (while mitigating\nresource depletion attacks abusing the CRL distribution). Our experimental\nevaluation shows that our scheme is efficient, scalable, dependable, and\npractical: with no more than 25 KB/s of traffic load, the latest CRL can be\ndelivered to 95% of the vehicles in a region (15 x 15 KM) within 15s, i.e.,\nmore than 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art. Overall, our scheme is a\ncomprehensive solution that complements standards and can catalyze the\ndeployment of secure and privacy-protecting VC systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Apr 2020 14:46:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Khodaei", "Mohammad", ""], ["Papadimitratos", "Panos", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.03428", "submitter": "Jiguo Li", "authors": "Jiguo Li, Xinfeng Zhang, Chuanmin Jia, Jizheng Xu, Li Zhang, Yue Wang,\n  Siwei Ma, Wen Gao", "title": "Universal Adversarial Perturbations Generative Network for Speaker\n  Recognition", "comments": "Accepted by ICME2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.AS cs.CR cs.SD", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Attacking deep learning based biometric systems has drawn more and more\nattention with the wide deployment of fingerprint/face/speaker recognition\nsystems, given the fact that the neural networks are vulnerable to the\nadversarial examples, which have been intentionally perturbed to remain almost\nimperceptible for human.

A\nconventional deep learning model is prone to privacy attacks that can recover\nthe sensitive information of individuals from either model parameters or\naccesses to the target model. Recently, differential privacy that offers\nprovable privacy guarantees has been proposed to train neural networks in a\nprivacy-preserving manner to protect training data. However, many approaches\ntend to provide the worst case privacy guarantees for model publishing,\ninevitably impairing the accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we\npresent a novel private knowledge transfer strategy, where the private teacher\ntrained on sensitive data is not publicly accessible but teaches a student to\nbe publicly released. In particular, a three-player\n(teacher-student-discriminator) learning framework is proposed to achieve\ntrade-off between utility and privacy, where the student acquires the distilled\nknowledge from the teacher and is trained with the discriminator to generate\nsimilar outputs as the teacher. We then integrate a differential privacy\nprotection mechanism into the learning procedure, which enables a rigorous\nprivacy budget for the training. The framework eventually allows student to be\ntrained with only unlabelled public data and very few epochs, and hence\nprevents the exposure of sensitive training data, while ensuring model utility\nwith a modest privacy budget. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10\ndatasets show that our students obtain the accuracy losses w.r.t teachers of\n0.89%, 2.29%, 5.16%, respectively with the privacy bounds of (1.93, 10^-5),\n(5.02, 10^-6), (8.81, 10^-6).

By\nsplitting a blockchain into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps\nincrease transaction throughput, reduce computational resources required, and\nincrease reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible\nsharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security\nlevel) have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from three main\ndrawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain, nodes can have different weight\n(power or stake) to create a consensus, and as such an adversary needs to\ncontrol half of the overall weight in order to manipulate the system ($p/2$\nsecurity level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight. Thus,\nit is only under the assumption that honest participants create as many nodes\nas they should that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the\n$p/2$ security level. Second, when some nodes leave the system, other nodes\nneed to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard in order to maintain the\nsecurity level. This has an adverse effect on system performance. Third, while\nsome $n/2$ approaches can maintain data integrity with up to $n/2$ Byzantine\nnodes, their systems can halt with a smaller number of Byzantine nodes. In this\npaper, we present a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding approach that does\nnot require honest participants to create multiple nodes, requires less node\nreassignment when some nodes leave the system, and can prevent the system from\nhalting. Our experiments show that our new approach outperforms existing\nblockchain sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and\nflexibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2020 20:31:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 06:42:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 22:59:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2020 19:30:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 9 Aug 2020 13:00:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:30:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Yibin", ""], ["Shao", "Jianhua", ""], ["Huang", "Yangyu", ""], ["Slaats", "Tijs", ""], ["D\u00fcdder", "Boris", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.04812", "submitter": "Vinayakumar R", "authors": "Simran K, Prathiksha Balakrishna, Vinayakumar Ravi, Soman KP", "title": "Deep Learning based Frameworks for Handling Imbalance in DGA, Email, and\n  URL Data Analysis", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.NE cs.SI eess.SP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Deep learning is a state of the art method for a lot of applications.

However, traditional techniques are not as efficient\nwith the advancement booms as well as different attack types and their\nsevereness. Thus, a strong-dynamically enhanced and up to date security system\nis required for next-generation IoT system. A huge technological advancement\nhas been noticed in Machine Learning (ML) which has opened many possible\nresearch windows to address ongoing and future challenges in IoT. In order to\ndetect attacks and identify abnormal behaviors of smart devices and networks,\nML is being utilized as a powerful technology to fulfill this purpose. In this\nsurvey paper, the architecture of IoT is discussed, following a comprehensive\nliterature review on ML approaches the importance of security of IoT in terms\nof different types of possible attacks. Moreover, ML-based potential solutions\nfor IoT security has been presented and future challenges are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 03:08:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Tahsien", "Syeda Manjia", ""], ["Karimipour", "Hadis", ""], ["Spachos", "Petros", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.05419", "submitter": "Nazatul Haque Sultan", "authors": "Nazatul Haque Sultan, Vijay Varadharajan, Lan Zhou, and Ferdous Ahmed\n  Barbhuiya", "title": "A Role-Based Encryption Scheme for Securing Outsourced Cloud Data in a\n  Multi-Organization Context", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a popular model which maps roles to\naccess permissions for resources and then roles to the users to provide access\ncontrol.

When they are deployed on the client-side, ML-based\nclassifiers are vulnerable to evasion attacks. However, such potential threats\nhave received relatively little attention because existing attacks destruct the\nfunctionalities or appearance of webpages and are conducted in the white-box\nscenario, making it less practical. Consequently, it becomes imperative to\nunderstand whether it is possible to launch evasion attacks with limited\nknowledge of the classifier, while preserving the functionalities and\nappearance.\n  In this work, we show that even in the grey-, and black-box scenarios,\nevasion attacks are not only effective on practical ML-based classifiers, but\ncan also be efficiently launched without destructing the functionalities and\nappearance. For this purpose, we propose three mutation-based attacks,\ndiffering in the knowledge of the target classifier, addressing a key technical\nchallenge: automatically crafting an adversarial sample from a known phishing\nwebsite in a way that can mislead classifiers. To launch attacks in the white-\nand grey-box scenarios, we also propose a sample-based collision attack to gain\nthe knowledge of the target classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our evasion attacks on the state-of-the-art, Google's phishing\npage filter, achieved 100% attack success rate in less than one second per\nwebsite. Moreover, the transferability attack on BitDefender's industrial\nphishing page classifier, TrafficLight, achieved up to 81.25% attack success\nrate.

Due to security concerns arising from aggregating\nraw data at a single server, several real world deployments in industry have\nembraced the LDP model.

First, we survey\nsolutions that combine cryptographic primitives like secure computation and\nanonymous communication with differential privacy to give alternatives to the\nLDP model that avoid a trusted server as in SDP but close the gap in accuracy.\nThese primitives introduce performance bottlenecks and necessitate efficient\nalternatives.

The main idea of Twins is that we can emulate Byzantine behavior by\nrunning two (or generally up to $k$) instances of a node with the same\nidentity. Each of the two instances (or Twins) runs unmodified, correct code.\n  The Twins approach requires only a thin network wrapper that delivers\nmessages to/from both Twins.

Building on this idea, Twins can systematically\ngenerate Byzantine attack scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled\nmanner, and check for desired protocol properties.\n  The paper demonstrates that Twins successfully reinstates several famous\nattacks on BFT protocols. In all cases, protocols break within fewer than a\ndozen protocol steps, hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose\nthe problems.

This belongs to the\nresearch area of interpretable ML but in a specific research domain (i.e.,\nmobile malware detection). Although several interpretable ML methods have been\nexhibited to explain the final classification results in many cutting-edge\nArtificial Intelligent (AI) based research fields, till now, there is no study\ninterpreting why an app is classified as malware or unveiling the\ndomain-specific challenges.\n  In this paper, to fill this gap, we propose a novel and interpretable\nML-based approach (named XMal) to classify malware with high accuracy and\nexplain the classification result meanwhile. (1) The first classification phase\nof XMal hinges multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and attention mechanism, and also\npinpoints the key features most related to the classification result. (2) The\nsecond interpreting phase aims at automatically producing neural language\ndescriptions to interpret the core malicious behaviors within apps. We evaluate\nthe behavior description results by comparing with the existing interpretable\nML-based methods (i.e., Drebin and LIME) to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nXMal. We find that XMal is able to reveal the malicious behaviors more\naccurately. Additionally, our experiments show that XMal can also interpret the\nreason why some samples are misclassified by ML classifiers. Our study peeks\ninto the interpretable ML through the research of Android malware detection and\nanalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 03:05:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Sep 2020 13:27:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Bozhi", ""], ["Chen", "Sen", ""], ["Gao", "Cuiyun", ""], ["Fan", "Lingling", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Wen", "Weiping", ""], ["Lyu", "Michael R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.11527", "submitter": "Haotian Weng", "authors": "Haotian Weng and Artem Lenskiy", "title": "A Trend-following Trading Indicator on Homomorphically Encrypted Data", "comments": "Accepted as a short paper by the 17th International Conference on\n  Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT 2020)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Algorithmic trading has proliferated the area of quantitative finance for\nalready over a decade.

The development towards\ncloud and edge native infrastructures is expected to continue in 6G networks,\nand we need holistic 6G network security architecture planning.

In this\npaper, we empirically demonstrate that the commonly used PGD attack may not be\noptimal for inner maximization, and improved inner optimizer can lead to a more\nrobust model. Then we leverage a learning-to-learn (L2L) framework to train an\noptimizer with recurrent neural networks, providing update directions and steps\nadaptively for the inner problem. By co-training optimizer's parameters and\nmodel's weights, the proposed framework consistently improves the model\nrobustness over PGD-based adversarial training and TRADES.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Apr 2020 20:15:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Xiong", "Yuanhao", ""], ["Hsieh", "Cho-Jui", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.12254", "submitter": "Fatemehsadat Mireshghallah", "authors": "Fatemehsadat Mireshghallah, Mohammadkazem Taram, Praneeth Vepakomma,\n  Abhishek Singh, Ramesh Raskar, Hadi Esmaeilzadeh", "title": "Privacy in Deep Learning: A Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The ever-growing advances of deep learning in many areas including vision,\nrecommendation systems, natural language processing, etc., have led to the\nadoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in production systems.

The collected data is\ncrucial in certain applications where IoT devices generate data for critical\ninfrastructure or systems whose failure may result in catastrophic results.\nSpecifically, for such critical applications, data storage poses challenges\nsince the data may be compromised during the storage and the integrity might be\nviolated without being noticed. In such cases, integrity and data provenance\nare required in order to be able to detect the source of any incident and prove\nit in legal cases if there is a dispute with the involved parties. To address\nthese issues, blockchain provides excellent opportunities since it can protect\nthe integrity of the data thanks to its distributed structure. However, it\ncomes with certain costs as storing huge amount of data in a public blockchain\nwill come with significant transaction fees. In this paper, we propose a highly\ncost effective and reliable digital forensics framework by exploiting multiple\ninexpensive blockchain networks as a temporary storage before the data is\ncommitted to Ethereum. To reduce Ethereum costs,we utilize Merkle trees which\nhierarchically stores hashes of the collected event data from IoT devices.

The\nundesirable severe drop in accuracy adversely affects the reliability of\nmachine learning algorithms and prohibits their deployment in realistic\napplications. This paper aims to address this dilemma by proposing a novel\npreprocessing framework, which we term Robust and Accurate Image\nclassificatioN(RAIN), to improve the robustness of given CNN classifiers and,\nat the same time, preserve their high prediction accuracies. RAIN introduces a\nnew randomization-enhancement scheme. It applies randomization over inputs to\nbreak the ties between the model forward prediction path and the backward\ngradient path, thus improving the model robustness. However, similar to\nexisting preprocessing-based methods, the randomized process will degrade the\nprediction accuracy. To understand why this is the case, we compare the\ndifference between original and processed images, and find it is the loss of\nhigh-frequency components in the input image that leads to accuracy drop of the\nclassifier. Based on this finding, RAIN enhances the input's high-frequency\ndetails to retain the CNN's high prediction accuracy. Concretely, RAIN consists\nof two novel randomization modules: randomized small circular shift (RdmSCS)\nand randomized down-upsampling (RdmDU). The RdmDU module randomly downsamples\nthe input image, and then the RdmSCS module circularly shifts the input image\nalong a randomly chosen direction by a small but random number of pixels.\nFinally, the RdmDU module performs upsampling with a detail-enhancement model,\nsuch as deep super-resolution networks. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nSTL10 and ImageNet datasets to verify the effectiveness of RAIN against various\ntypes of adversarial attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 02:03:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2020 11:34:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:56:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2020 13:24:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Du", "Jiawei", ""], ["Yan", "Hanshu", ""], ["Tan", "Vincent Y.
