Applications are manifold, most\nprominently the outsourcing of computations to cloud service providers, where\ndata is to be manipulated and processed in full confidentiality. Today, one of\nthe most intensively studied solutions to SFE is fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE).

Remarkably, this shows that fully homomorphic encryption is indeed an\noverly strong primitive to do SFE, as group homomorphic encryption with\nequality check is already sufficient.

This goal is\nachieved by taking advantage of the channel noise and without requiring a\nshared key. The model has attracted attention in recent years because it\ncaptures eavesdropping attack in wireless communication. The wiretap adversary\nis a passive eavesdropping adversary at the physical layer of communication. In\nthis paper we propose a model for adversarial wiretap (AWTP) channel that\nmodels active adversaries at this layer. We consider a $(\\rho_r, \\rho_w)$\nwiretap adversary who can see a fraction $\\rho_r$, and modify a fraction\n$\\rho_w$, of the sent codeword. The code components that are read and/or\nmodified can be chosen adaptively, and the subsets of read and modified\ncomponents in general, can be different. AWTP codes provide secrecy and\nreliability for communication over these channels. We give security and\nreliability definitions and measures for these codes, and define secrecy\ncapacity of an AWTP channel that represents the secrecy potential of the\nchannel. The paper has two main contributions. First, we prove a tight upper\nbound on the rate of AWTP codes with perfect secrecy for $(\\rho_r,\n\\rho_w)$-AWTP channels, and use the bound to derive the secrecy capacity of the\nchannel. We prove a similar bound for $\\epsilon$-secure codes also, but in this\ncase the bound is not tight. Second, we give an explicit construction for a\ncapacity achieving AWTP code family, and prove its security and efficiency\nproperties.
