However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized\nphysical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the\nattacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.\n  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by\n(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she\napproaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is\nbelieved to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the\ntoken to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based\nbiometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application\nsettings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors\navailable on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an\n\"in-pocket\" smartphone and a \"wrist-worn\" smartwatch), that all capture unique\nfacets of user's walking pattern.

If an adversary\nmanipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of\ndigital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature\nimposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This\nwork presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme\ndesigned to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring\nin the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually\nchallenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical\nprobes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that\nthe adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an\nauthentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides\nresilience against them.

CALIPER supports multiple modalities, key lengths, and security\nlevels and can be applied in two scenarios: One where the CAS must authenticate\nits user to a CAVE running on a remote server (device-server) for access to\nremote application data, and another where the CAS must authenticate its user\nto a locally running trusted computing module (TCM) for access to local\napplication data (device-TCM). We further demonstrate that CALIPER can leverage\ndevice hardware resources to enable privacy and security even when the device's\nkernel is compromised, and we show how this authentication protocol can even be\nexpanded to obfuscate direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM) malwares.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2016 17:33:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Rudd", "Ethan M.", ""], ["Boult", "Terrance E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.03162", "submitter": "Benjamin Leiding", "authors": "Benjamin Leiding and Andreas D\\\"ahn", "title": "Dead Letters to Alice - Reachability of E-Mail Addresses in the PGP Web\n  of Trust", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Over the last 25 years four million e-mail addresses have accumulated in the\nPGP web of trust.

We find that at least 6.7% of websites in the\nAlexa Top-5K use anti-adblocking scripts, acquired from 12 distinct entities --\nsome of which have a direct interest in nourishing the online advertising\nindustry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 09:44:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2016 13:17:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Nithyanand", "Rishab", ""], ["Khattak", "Sheharbano", ""], ["Javed", "Mobin", ""], ["Vallina-Rodriguez", "Narseo", ""], ["Falahrastegar", "Marjan", ""], ["Powles", "Julia E.", ""], ["De Cristofaro", "Emiliano", ""], ["Haddadi", "Hamed", ""], ["Murdoch", "Steven J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05269", "submitter": "Weiguo Zhang", "authors": "WeiGuo Zhang, ChunLei Xie, Enes Pasalic", "title": "Large Sets of Orthogonal Sequences Suitable for Applications in CDMA\n  Systems", "comments": "24 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

Our initial design method generates a large family of orthogonal sets\nof sequences derived from vectorial semi-bent functions. A modification of the\noriginal approach is proposed to avoid a hard combinatorial problem of\nallocating several such orthogonal sets to a single cell of a regular hexagonal\nnetwork, while preserving the orthogonality to adjacent cells. This\nmodification increases the number of users per cell by starting from shorter\ncodewords and then extending the length of these codewords to the desired\nlength. The specification and assignment of these orthogonal sets to a regular\ntessellation of hexagonal cells have been solved regardless of the parity and\nsize of $m$ (where $2^m$ is the length of the codewords).

First, we propose\nPINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user\nPINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website\ncontrolled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts\nlistening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any\npermission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user's PIN\nusing an artificial neural network. Based on a test set of fifty 4-digit PINs,\nPINlogger.js is able to correctly identify PINs in the first attempt with a\nsuccess rate of 74% which increases to 86 and 94% in the second and third\nattempts, respectively. The high success rates of stealing user PINs on mobile\ndevices via JavaScript indicate a serious threat to user security. With the\ntechnical understanding of the information leakage caused by mobile phone\nsensors, we then study users' perception of the risks associated with these\nsensors. We design user studies to measure the general familiarity with\ndifferent sensors and their functionality, and to investigate how concerned\nusers are about their PIN being discovered by an app that has access to all\nthese sensors. Our studies show that there is significant disparity between the\nactual and perceived levels of threat with regard to the compromise of the user\nPIN. We confirm our results by interviewing our participants using two\ndifferent approaches, within-subject and between-subject, and compare the\nresults. We discuss how this observation, along with other factors, renders\nmany academic and industry solutions ineffective in preventing such side\nchannel attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2016 12:27:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:46:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mehrnezhad", "Maryam", ""], ["Toreini", "Ehsan", ""], ["Shahandashti", "Siamak F.", ""], ["Hao", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05580", "submitter": "Ramkumar Lakshminarayanan", "authors": "Rajasekar Ramalingam, Ramkumar Lakshminarayanan, Shimaz Khan", "title": "Information Security Awareness at Oman Educational Institutions : An\n  Academic Prespective", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1602.06510", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The gap between the knowledge and the practices regarding the computer and\nInternet use are the major factors which influence security of Information.

We show that\nunlike the case in which privacy parameters are fixed, in the adaptive\nparameter setting, these two use cases are distinct. We show that there exist\nprivacy filters with bounds comparable (up to constants) with existing privacy\ncomposition theorems. We also give a privacy odometer that nearly matches\nnon-adaptive private composition theorems, but is sometimes worse by a small\nasymptotic factor. Moreover, we show that this is inherent, and that any valid\nprivacy odometer in the adaptive parameter setting must lose this factor, which\nshows a formal separation between the filter and odometer use-cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 May 2016 14:16:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 01:06:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rogers", "Ryan", ""], ["Roth", "Aaron", ""], ["Ullman", "Jonathan", ""], ["Vadhan", "Salil", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.08357", "submitter": "Jagdish Prasad Achara", "authors": "Jagdish Prasad Achara, Vincent Roca, Claude Castelluccia and Aurelien\n  Francillon", "title": "MobileAppScrutinator: A Simple yet Efficient Dynamic Analysis Approach\n  for Detecting Privacy Leaks across Mobile OSs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Smartphones, the devices we carry everywhere with us, are being heavily\ntracked and have undoubtedly become a major threat to our privacy.

They deploy\nsome security mechanisms to provide certain security services. Security\nprotocols are considered abstract when analyzed, but they can have extra\nvulnerabilities when implemented. This manuscript provides a holistic study on\nsecurity protocols. It reviews foundations of security protocols, taxonomy of\nattacks on security protocols and their implementations, and different methods\nand models for security analysis of protocols. Specifically, it clarifies\ndifferences between information-theoretic and computational security, and\ncomputational and symbolic models. Furthermore, a survey on computational\nsecurity models for authenticated key exchange (AKE) and password-authenticated\nkey exchange (PAKE) protocols, as the most important and well-studied type of\nsecurity protocols, is provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 19:08:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 00:06:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Toorani", "Mohsen", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09779", "submitter": "Daniel Roche", "authors": "Adam J.

We present an\noblivious cloud storage system, ObliviSync, that specifically targets one of\nthe most widely-used personal cloud storage paradigms: synchronization and\nbackup services, popular examples of which are Dropbox, iCloud Drive, and\nGoogle Drive. This setting provides a unique opportunity because the above\nprivacy properties can be achieved with a simpler form of ORAM called\nwrite-only ORAM, which allows for dramatically increased efficiency compared to\nrelated work. Our solution is asymptotically optimal and practically efficient,\nwith a small constant overhead of approximately 4x compared with non-private\nfile storage, depending only on the total data size and parameters chosen\naccording to the usage rate, and not on the number or size of individual files.\nOur construction also offers protection against timing-channel attacks, which\nhas not been previously considered in ORAM protocols. We built and evaluated a\nfull implementation of ObliviSync that supports multiple simultaneous read-only\nclients and a single concurrent read/write client whose edits automatically and\nseamlessly propagate to the readers. We show that our system functions under\nhigh work loads, with realistic file size distributions, and with small\nadditional latency (as compared to a baseline encrypted file system) when\npaired with Dropbox as the synchronization service.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 19:28:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aviv", "Adam J.", ""], ["Choi", "Seung Geol", ""], ["Mayberry", "Travis", ""], ["Roche", "Daniel S.", ""]]}]
