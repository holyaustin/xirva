The system includes novel\nenrollment and authentication protocols based on threshold homomorphic\ncryptosystem where the private key is shared between a user and the verifier.\nIn the THRIVE system, only encrypted binary biometric templates are stored in\nthe database and verification is performed via homomorphically randomized\ntemplates, thus, original templates are never revealed during the\nauthentication stage. The THRIVE system is designed for the malicious model\nwhere the cheating party may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol\nspecification. Since threshold homomorphic encryption scheme is used, a\nmalicious database owner cannot perform decryption on encrypted templates of\nthe users in the database. Therefore, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced\nusing a two-factor authentication scheme involving the user's private key and\nthe biometric data. We prove security and privacy preservation capability of\nthe proposed system in the simulation-based model with no assumption. The\nproposed system is suitable for applications where the user does not want to\nreveal her biometrics to the verifier in plain form but she needs to proof her\nphysical presence by using biometrics. The system can be used with any\nbiometric modality and biometric feature extraction scheme whose output\ntemplates can be binarized. The overall connection time for the proposed THRIVE\nsystem is estimated to be 336 ms on average for 256-bit biohash vectors on a\ndesktop PC running with quad-core 3.2 GHz CPUs at 10 Mbit/s up/down link\nconnection speed. Consequently, the proposed system can be efficiently used in\nreal life applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 18:07:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Karabat", "Cagatay", ""], ["Kiraz", "Mehmet Sabir", ""], ["Erdogan", "Hakan", ""], ["Savas", "Erkay", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8220", "submitter": "Irene Marquez Corbella", "authors": "Alain Couvreur (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), Irene\n  M\\'arquez-Corbella (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), Ruud Pellikaan", "title": "Cryptanalysis of public-key cryptosystems that use subcodes of algebraic\n  geometry codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "CIM-MS Series by Springer-Verlag (2014)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.AG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a polynomial time attack on the McEliece public key cryptosystem\nbased on subcodes of algebraic geometry (AG) codes.
