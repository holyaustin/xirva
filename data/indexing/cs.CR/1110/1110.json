However, the state-of-the-art anonymity networks do not provide an\neffective trust model. As a result, users cannot circumvent malicious or\nvulnerable routers, thus making them susceptible to malicious router based\nattacks (e.g., correlation attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel social\nnetwork based trust model to help anonymity networks circumvent malicious\nrouters and obtain secure anonymity. In particular, we design an input\nindependent fuzzy model to determine trust relationships between friends based\non qualitative and quantitative social attributes, both of which can be readily\nobtained from existing social networks. Moreover, we design an algorithm for\npropagating trust over an anonymity network. We integrate these two elements in\nSTor, a novel social network based Tor. We have implemented STor by modifying\nthe Tor's source code and conducted experiments on PlanetLab to evaluate the\neffectiveness of STor. Both simulation and PlanetLab experiment results have\ndemonstrated that STor can achieve secure anonymity by establishing trust-based\ncircuits in a distributed way. Although the design of STor is based on Tor\nnetwork, the social network based trust model can be adopted by other anonymity\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 14:00:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2011 12:44:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2011 02:39:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 16 Dec 2011 04:56:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 18 Jul 2012 06:08:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 09:48:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Peng", ""], ["Luo", "Xiapu", ""], ["Chen", "Ang", ""], ["Chang", "Rocky K.

Yet, in practical\nrealizations and experiments, the measuring devices at the receiver's (Bob)\nsite commonly do not measure a two-dimensional system but rather a quantum\nspace of a larger dimension. Such an enlargement sometimes results from\nimperfect devices. However, in various QKD protocols such enlargement exists\neven in the ideal scenario when all devices are assumed to be perfect. This\nissue is common, for instance, in QKD schemes implemented via photons, where\nthe parties' devices are based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers, as these\ninherently enlarge the quantum space in use.\n  We show how space enlargement at Bob's site exposes the implemented protocol\nto new kinds of attacks, attacks that have not yet been explicitly pinpointed\nnor rigorously analyzed. We name these the \"reversed space attacks\". A key\ninsight in formalizing our attacks, is the idea of taking all states defining\nBob's (large) measured space and reversing them in time in order to identify\nprecisely the space that an eavesdropper may attack. We employ such attacks on\ntwo variants of intereferometric-based QKD recently experimented by several\ngroups, and show how to get full information on the qubit sent by Alice, while\ninducing no errors at all. The technique we develop here has subsequently been\nused in a closely related work (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, Physical Review A,\n2014) to demonstrate a (weaker variant of) reversed-space attack on both\ninterferometric-based and polarization-based QKD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2011 02:17:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 May 2016 15:55:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gelles", "Ran", ""], ["Mor", "Tal", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6591", "submitter": "Victor Shcherbacov Alexei", "authors": "Piroska Csorgo and Victor Shcherbacov", "title": "On some quasigroup cryptographical primitives", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.GR cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose modifications of known quasigroup based stream ciphers.
