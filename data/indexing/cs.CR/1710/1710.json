The attacks have brought emphasis on forward privacy,\nwhich is the key concept behind solutions to the adaptive leakage-exploiting\nattacks, and will very likely to become mandatory in the design of new\nsearchable encryption schemes. For a long time, forward privacy implies\ninefficiency and thus most existing searchable encryption schemes do not\nsupport it.

In this model, the user and the databases engage in a two-phase\nscheme, namely, the prefetching phase where the user acquires side information\nand the retrieval phase where the user downloads desired information. In the\nprefetching phase, the user receives $m_n$ full messages from the $n$th\ndatabase, under the cache memory size constraint $\\sum_{n=1}^N m_n \\leq M$. In\nthe retrieval phase, the user wishes to retrieve a message such that no\nindividual database learns anything about the identity of the desired message.\nIn addition, the identities of the side information messages that the user did\nnot prefetch from a database must remain private against that database.

These protocols are designed under the assumption that separating\nin-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient for protection\nagainst cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid\nby recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle\nnetwork. Motivated by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have\nbeen proposed for in-vehicle networks that attempt to detect attacks by making\nuse of device fingerprinting using properties such as clock skew of an ECU. In\nthis paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in\nwhich an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages in order to\nmatch the clock skew of a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that,\nwhile the clock skew is a physical property of each ECU that cannot be changed\nby the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is based on\nnetwork traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an\nadversary.

Our extensive evaluation shows\nthat an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver\nwithin just one turn with 74.1%, 83.5%, and 90.8% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5\ndrivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle ---\nrespectively.

As\none of the most influential privacy definitions, differential privacy provides\na rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data publishing. Differentially\nprivate interactive publishing achieves good performance in many applications;\nhowever, the curator has to release a large number of queries in a batch or a\nsynthetic dataset in the Big Data era. To provide accurate non-interactive\npublishing results in the constraint of differential privacy, two challenges\nneed to be tackled: one is how to decrease the correlation between large sets\nof queries, while the other is how to predict on fresh queries. Neither is easy\nto solve by the traditional differential privacy mechanism. This paper\ntransfers the data publishing problem to a machine learning problem, in which\nqueries are considered as training samples and a prediction model will be\nreleased rather than query results or synthetic datasets. When the model is\npublished, it can be used to answer current submitted queries and predict\nresults for fresh queries from the public. Compared with the traditional\nmethod, the proposed prediction model enhances the accuracy of query results\nfor non-interactive publishing. Experimental results show that the proposed\nsolution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of Mean Absolute\nValue on a large group of queries. This also suggests the learning model can\nsuccessfully retain the utility of published queries while preserving privacy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:57:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Tianqing", ""], ["Xiong", "Ping", ""], ["Li", "Gang", ""], ["Zhou", "Wanlei", ""], ["Yu", "Philip S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.05202", "submitter": "Juan Caballero", "authors": "Irfan Ul Haq, Sergio Chica, Juan Caballero, Somesh Jha", "title": "Malware Lineage in the Wild", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Malware lineage studies the evolutionary relationships among malware and has\nimportant applications for malware analysis. A persistent limitation of prior\nmalware lineage approaches is to consider every input sample a separate malware\nversion. This is problematic since a majority of malware are packed and the\npacking process produces many polymorphic variants (i.e., executables with\ndifferent file hash) of the same malware version. Thus, many samples correspond\nto the same malware version and it is challenging to identify distinct malware\nversions from polymorphic variants. This problem does not manifest in prior\nmalware lineage approaches because they work on synthetic malware, malware that\nare not packed, or packed malware for which unpackers are available. In this\nwork, we propose a novel malware lineage approach that works on malware samples\ncollected in the wild. Given a set of malware executables from the same family,\nfor which no source code is available and which may be packed, our approach\nproduces a lineage graph where nodes are versions of the family and edges\ndescribe the relationships between versions. To enable our malware lineage\napproach, we propose the first technique to identify the versions of a malware\nfamily and a scalable code indexing technique for determining shared functions\nbetween any pair of input samples. We have evaluated the accuracy of our\napproach on 13 open-source programs and have applied it to produce lineage\ngraphs for 10 popular malware families.

Decoy Routers (DRs), placed in\nAutonomous Systems, proxy traffic from users; so the adversary, e.g., a\ncensorious government, attempts to avoid them. It is quite difficult to place\nDRs so the adversary cannot route around them for example, we need the\ncooperation of 850 ASes to contain China alone. In this paper, we consider a\ndifferent approach. We begin by noting that DRs need not intercept all the\nnetwork paths from a country, just those leading to Overt Destinations, i.e.,\nunfiltered websites hosted outside the country (usually popular ones, so that\nclient traffic to the OD does not make the censor suspicious. Our first\nquestion is; How many ASes are required for installing DRs to intercept a large\nfraction of paths from, e.g., China to the top n websites (as per Alexa)? How\ndoes this number grow with n? Few ASes (approx. 30) intercept over 90% of paths\nto the top n sites, for n = 10, 20...200. Our first contribution is to\ndemonstrate with real paths that the number of ASes required for a world-wide\nDR framework is small (approx. 30). Further, censor nations attempts to filter\ntraffic along the paths transiting these 30 ASes will not only block their own\ncitizens, but others residing in foreign ASes. Our second contribution in this\npaper is to consider the details of DR placement: not just in which ASes DRs\nshould be placed to intercept traffic, but exactly where in each AS. We find\nthat even with our small number of ASes, we still need a total of about 11,700\nDRs.We conclude that, even though a DR system involves far fewer ASes than\npreviously thought, it is still a major undertaking. For example, the current\nrouters cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if DR at line speed requires all new\nhardware, the cost alone would make such a project unfeasible for most actors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Oct 2017 06:14:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gosain", "Devashish", ""], ["Agarwal", "Anshika", ""], ["Chakravarty", "Sambuddho", ""], ["Acharya", "H.

In addition, we determine conditions under which the tradeoff\nregion given only the useful data coincides with that given full data.

Cyber operations manage a high volume\nof heterogeneous log data; hence, AD in such operations involves multiple\n(e.g., per IP, per data type) ensembles of detectors modeling heterogeneous\ncharacteristics (e.g., rate, size, type) often with adaptive online models\nproducing alerts in near real time. Because of high data volume, setting the\nthreshold for each detector in such a system is an essential yet underdeveloped\nconfiguration issue that, if slightly mistuned, can leave the system useless,\neither producing a myriad of alerts and flooding downstream systems, or giving\nnone. In this work, we build on the foundations of Ferragut et al. to provide a\nset of rigorous results for understanding the relationship between threshold\nvalues and alert quantities, and we propose an algorithm for setting the\nthreshold in practice. Specifically, we give an algorithm for setting the\nthreshold of multiple, heterogeneous, possibly dynamic detectors completely a\npriori, in principle. Indeed, if the underlying distribution of the incoming\ndata is known (closely estimated), the algorithm provides provably manageable\nthresholds. If the distribution is unknown (e.g., has changed over time) our\nanalysis reveals how the model distribution differs from the actual\ndistribution, indicating a period of model refitting is necessary.

On the one hand,\ncontext-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong\nprivacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On\nthe other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic\nprivacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data\nholder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by\nintroducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative\nadversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization\nschemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is\nformulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that\nsanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the\nindividuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the\nprivate variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we\ninvestigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the\nbinary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models,\nwe derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that\nthe privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion)\nmatch the theoretically optimal ones.

For camouflaged\nsequential circuits, the SAT attack requires that the internal state of the\ncircuit is controllable and observable via the scan chain. It has been\nimplicitly assumed that restricting scan chain access increases the security of\ncamouflaged ICs from reverse engineering attacks. In this paper, we develop a\nnew attack methodology to decamouflage sequential circuits without scan access.\nOur attack uses a model checker (a more powerful reasoning tool than a SAT\nsolver) to find a discriminating set of input sequences, i.e., one that is\nsufficient to determine the functionality of camouflaged gates. We propose\nseveral refinements, including the use of a bounded model checker, and\nsufficient conditions for determining when a set of input sequences is\ndiscriminating to improve the run-time and scalabilty of our attack. Our attack\nis able to decamouflage a large sequential benchmark circuit that implements a\nsubset of the VIPER processor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Oct 2017 14:34:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Massad", "Mohamed El", ""], ["Garg", "Siddharth", ""], ["Tripunitara", "Mahesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.10477", "submitter": "Leye Wang", "authors": "Leye Wang, Gehua Qin, Dingqi Yang, Xiao Han, Xiaojuan Ma", "title": "Geographic Differential Privacy for Mobile Crowd Coverage Maximization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For real-world mobile applications such as location-based advertising and\nspatial crowdsourcing, a key to success is targeting mobile users that can\nmaximally cover certain locations in a future period.

Thus, deletions may leave users more vulnerable to attacks on\ntheir privacy in general. Users hoping to make their posts forgotten face a\n\"damned if I do, damned if I don't\" dilemma. Many are shifting towards\nephemeral social platform like Snapchat, which will deprive us of important\nuser-data archival. In the form of intermittent withdrawals, we present, Lethe,\na novel solution to this problem of forgetting the forgotten. If the\nnext-generation social platforms are willing to give up the uninterrupted\navailability of non-deleted posts by a very small fraction, Lethe provides\nprivacy to the deleted posts over long durations. In presence of Lethe, an\nadversarial observer becomes unsure if some posts are permanently deleted or\njust temporarily withdrawn by Lethe; at the same time, the adversarial observer\nis overwhelmed by a large number of falsely flagged undeleted posts. To\ndemonstrate the feasibility and performance of Lethe, we analyze large-scale\nreal data about users' deletion over Twitter and thoroughly investigate how to\nchoose time duration distributions for alternating between temporary\nwithdrawals and resurrections of non-deleted posts. We find a favorable\ntrade-off between privacy, availability and adversarial overhead in different\nsettings for users exercising their right to delete. We show that, even against\nan ultimate adversary with an uninterrupted access to the entire platform,\nLethe offers deletion privacy for up to 3 months from the time of deletion,\nwhile maintaining content availability as high as 95% and keeping the\nadversarial precision to 20%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 23:45:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2018 22:09:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Minaei", "Mohsen", ""], ["Mondal", "Mainack", ""], ["Loiseau", "Patrick", ""], ["Gummadi", "Krishna", ""], ["Kate", "Aniket", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.11423", "submitter": "Rodolfo Silva", "authors": "Rodolfo Silva, Pedro Barbosa, Andrey Brito", "title": "DynSGX: A Privacy Preserving Toolset for Dynamically Loading Functions\n  into Intel(R) SGX Enclaves", "comments": "Paper accepted on CloudCom 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Intel(R) Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is a hardware-based technology for\nensuring security of sensitive data from disclosure or modification that\nenables user-level applications to allocate protected areas of memory called\nenclaves.
