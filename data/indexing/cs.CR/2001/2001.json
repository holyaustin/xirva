Improper methods of\nestablishing privacy for accessible datasets can compromise large amounts of\nuser data even if the adversary has a small amount of preliminary knowledge of\na user. Many researchers have been developing high-level privacy-preserving\nmechanisms that also retain the statistical integrity of the data to apply to\nmachine learning. Recent developments of differential privacy, such as the\nLaplace and Privelet mechanisms, drastically decrease the probability that an\nadversary can distinguish the elements in a data set and thus extract user\ninformation. In this paper, we develop three privacy-preserving mechanisms with\nthe discrete M-band wavelet transform that embed noise into data. The first two\nmethods (LS and LS+) add noise through a Laplace-Sigmoid distribution that\nmultiplies Laplace-distributed values with the sigmoid function, and the third\nmethod utilizes pseudo-quantum steganography to embed noise into the data. We\nthen show that our mechanisms successfully retain both differential privacy and\nlearnability through statistical analysis in various machine learning\nenvironments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2019 18:07:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Feb 2020 20:28:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Kenneth", ""], ["Lee", "Tony", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.00071", "submitter": "Sumit Mukherjee", "authors": "Sumit Mukherjee, Yixi Xu, Anusua Trivedi, Juan Lavista Ferres", "title": "privGAN: Protecting GANs from membership inference attacks at low cost", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made releasing of synthetic\nimages a viable approach to share data without releasing the original dataset.\nIt has been shown that such synthetic data can be used for a variety of\ndownstream tasks such as training classifiers that would otherwise require the\noriginal dataset to be shared.

The image perturbation is undertaken using a\nGAN-based Semi-Adversarial Network (SAN) - referred to as PrivacyNet - that\nmodifies an input face image such that it can be used by a face matcher for\nmatching purposes but cannot be reliably used by an attribute classifier.\nFurther, PrivacyNet allows a person to choose specific attributes that have to\nbe obfuscated in the input face images (e.g., age and race), while allowing for\nother types of attributes to be extracted (e.g., gender). Extensive experiments\nusing multiple face matchers, multiple age/gender/race classifiers, and\nmultiple face datasets demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed\nmulti-attribute privacy enhancing method across multiple face and attribute\nclassifiers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 18:53:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2020 00:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:13:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mirjalili", "Vahid", ""], ["Raschka", "Sebastian", ""], ["Ross", "Arun", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.00694", "submitter": "Zhili Chen Prof.", "authors": "Tianjiao Ni, Zhili Chen, Lin Chen, Hong Zhong, Shun Zhang, Yan Xu", "title": "Differentially Private Combinatorial Cloud Auction", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cloud service providers typically provide different types of virtual machines\n(VMs) to cloud users with various requirements.

However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own\nproblems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and\nthus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very\nlarge operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains\nrequire trusted validators.\n  In this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients,\nlike merchants, to safely accept fast payments. In Snappy, all payments are on\nthe chain, while small customer collaterals and moderate merchant collaterals\nact as payment guarantees. Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as\nstatekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using\nmajority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can\nrecover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a\ncolluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of\nprevious solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many\nmerchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and\nvalidators do not have to be trusted. Our Ethereum prototype shows that safe,\nfast (<2 seconds) and cheap payments are possible on existing blockchains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Jan 2020 17:45:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Mavroudis", "Vasilios", ""], ["W\u00fcst", "Karl", ""], ["Dhar", "Aritra", ""], ["Kostiainen", "Kari", ""], ["Capkun", "Srdjan", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.01387", "submitter": "Anindya Maiti", "authors": "Nisha Vinayaga-Sureshkanth, Raveen Wijewickrama, Anindya Maiti,\n  Murtuza Jadliwala", "title": "Security and Privacy Challenges in Upcoming Intelligent Urban\n  Micromobility Transportation Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Micromobility vehicles are gaining popularity due to their portable nature,\nand their ability to serve short distance urban commutes better than\ntraditional modes of transportation.

We\nused a capable cryptojacking detector named CMTracker that proposed by Hong et\nal. in 2018. We automatically and manually examined 2770 websites that had been\ndetected by CMTracker before the Coinhive shutdown. The results revealed that\n99\\% of sites no longer continue cryptojacking. 1\\% of websites still run 8\nunique mining scripts. By tracking these mining scripts, we detected 632 unique\ncryptojacking websites. Moreover, open-source investigations (OSINT)\ndemonstrated that attackers still use the same methods. Therefore, we listed\nthe typical patterns of cryptojacking. We concluded that cryptojacking is not\ndead after the Coinhive shutdown. It is still alive, but not as attractive as\nit used to be.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2020 21:20:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:30:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 06:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Varlioglu", "Said", ""], ["Gonen", "Bilal", ""], ["Ozer", "Murat", ""], ["Bastug", "Mehmet F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.03002", "submitter": "Jawad Ali", "authors": "Jawad Ali, Toqeer Ali, Yazed Alsaawy, Ahmad Shahrafidz Khalid,\n  Shahrulniza Musa", "title": "Blockchain-based Smart-IoT Trust Zone Measurement Architecture", "comments": "6 pages, 5 Figures, International Conference on Omni-Layer\n  Intelligent Systems, COINS May 2019. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:2001.01841", "journal-ref": "International Conference on Omni-Layer Intelligent Systems, COINS\n  May 2019, Pages 152-157", "doi": "10.1145/3312614.3312646", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  With a rapid growth in the IT industry, Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a\ntremendous attention and become a central aspect of our environment.

As\nauspicious as this approach is, it brings forth many challenges: from data\nsecurity to time latency issues with data computation as well as delivery to\nend users. Fog computing has emerged as an extension for cloud computing to\nbring data processing and storage close to end-users; however, it minimizes the\ntime latency issue but still suffers from data security challenges. For\ninstance, when a fog node providing services to end users is compromised, the\nusers' data security can be violated. Thus, this paper proposes a secure and\nfine-grained data access control scheme by integrating the CP-ABE algorithm and\nblockchain concept to prevent fog nodes from violating end users' data security\nin a situation where a compromised fog node is being ousted. We also classify\nthe fog nodes into fog federations, based on their attributes such as services\nand locations, to minimize the time latency and communication overhead between\nfog nodes and cloud server. Further, the exploitation and integration of the\nblockchain concept and the CP-ABE algorithm enables fog nodes in the same fog\nfederation to perform the authorization process in a distributed manner. In\naddition, to solve time latency and communication overhead problems, we equip\nevery fog node with an off-chain database to store most frequently accessed\ndata files for specific time, and with an on-chain access control policies\ntable (On-chain Files Tracking Table) which must be protected from being\ntampered by malicious (rogue) fog nodes. Therefore, blockchain plays a vital\nrole here as it is tamper-proof by nature. We demonstrate our scheme's\nefficiency and feasibility by designing algorithms and conducting a security\nanalysis. The provided analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and\nfeasible in ousting malicious (rogue) fog nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 19:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Alshehri", "Mohammed", ""], ["Panda", "Brajendra", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04520", "submitter": "Hang Hu", "authors": "Hang Hu, Limin Yang, Shihan Lin, Gang Wang", "title": "Security Vetting Process of Smart-home Assistant Applications: A First\n  Look and Case Studies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The popularity of smart-home assistant systems such as Amazon Alexa and\nGoogle Home leads to a booming third-party application market (over 70,000\napplications across the two stores).

BIS\nenables the users to prove and share the history of their insurances with other\nusers or insurances.

We base our work on the popular Bloom-Filter templates\nprotection & address the key challenges like sub-optimal performance and low\nunlinkability. Specifically, we focus on cases where Bloom-filter templates\nresults in non-ideal performance due to presence of large degradations within\niris images. Iris recognition is challenged with number of occluding factors\nsuch as presence of eye-lashes within captured image, occlusion due to eyelids,\nlow quality iris images due to motion blur. All of such degrading factors\nresult in obtaining non-reliable iris codes & thereby provide non-ideal\nbiometric performance. These factors directly impact the protected templates\nderived from iris images when classical Bloom-filters are employed. To this\nend, we propose and extend our earlier ideas of Morton-filters for obtaining\nbetter and reliable templates for iris. Morton filter based TP for iris codes\nis based on leveraging the intra and inter-class distribution by exploiting\nlow-rank iris codes to derive the stable bits across iris images for a\nparticular subject and also analyzing the discriminable bits across various\nsubjects. Such low-rank non-noisy iris codes enables realizing the template\nprotection in a superior way which not only can be used in constrained setting,\nbut also in relaxed iris imaging.

Moreover, previous protocols have faced\ngreat loss in efficiency in the case where the honesty of each committee's\nleader is in question. At the same time, no explicit incentive is provided for\nnodes to actively participate in the protocol.\n  We present CycLedger, a scalable and secure parallel protocol for distributed\nledger via sharding. Our protocol selects a leader and a partial set for each\ncommittee, who are in charge of maintaining intra-shard consensus and\ncommunicating with other committees, to reduce the amortized complexity of\ncommunication, computation, and storage on all nodes. We introduce a novel\nsemi-commitment scheme between committees and a recovery procedure to prevent\nthe system from crashing even when leaders of committees are malicious. To add\nincentive for the network, we use the concept of reputation, which measures\neach node's trusty computing power. As nodes with a higher reputation receive\nmore rewards, there is an encouragement for nodes with strong computing ability\nto work honestly to gain reputation. In this way, we strike out a new path to\nestablish scalability, security, and incentive for the sharding-based\ndistributed ledger.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Jan 2020 05:28:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2020 03:48:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 05:28:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 5 Apr 2020 12:38:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Mengqian", ""], ["Li", "Jichen", ""], ["Chen", "Zhaohua", ""], ["Chen", "Hongyin", ""], ["Deng", "Xiaotie", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.06909", "submitter": "Gernot Salzer", "authors": "Monika di Angelo, Gernot Salzer", "title": "Wallet Contracts on Ethereum -- Identification, Types, Usage, and\n  Profiles", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the area of blockchains, a wallet is anything that manages the access to\ncryptocurrencies and tokens.

An important assumption of today's\nNear-field Communication (NFC) enabled cards is the limited communication range\nbetween the commercial reader and the NFC cards -- a distance below 5~cm.\nPrevious approaches to attacking this assumption effectively use mobile phones\nand active relays to enlarge the communication range, in order to attack the\nNFC cards. However, these approaches require a power supply at the adversary\nside, and can be easily localized when mobile phones or active relays transmit\nNFC signals.\n  We propose ReCoil, a system that uses wearable passive relays to attack NFC\ncards by expanding the communication range to 49.6 centimeters, a ten-fold\nimprovement over its intended commercial distance. ReCoil is a magnetically\ncoupled resonant wireless power transfer system, which optimizes the energy\ntransfer by searching the optimal geometry parameters. Specifically, we first\nnarrow down the feasible area reasonably and design the ReCoil-Ant Colony\nAlgorithm such that the relays absorb the maximum energy from the reader. In\norder to reroute the signal to pass over the surface of human body, we then\ndesign a half waist band by carefully analyzing the impact of the distance and\norientation between two coils on the mutual inductance.

A growing body of prior work has demonstrated that\nmembership inference attack (MIA) can disclose specific private information in\nthe training data to an attacker. Meanwhile, the algorithmic fairness of\nmachine learning has increasingly caught attention from both academia and\nindustry. Algorithmic fairness ensures that the machine learning models do not\ndiscriminate a particular demographic group of individuals (e.g., black and\nfemale people). Given that MIA is indeed a learning model, it raises a serious\nconcern if MIA ``fairly'' treats all groups of individuals equally. In other\nwords, whether a particular group is more vulnerable against MIA than the other\ngroups. This paper examines the algorithmic fairness issue in the context of\nMIA and its defenses. First, for fairness evaluation, it formalizes the\nnotation of vulnerability disparity (VD) to quantify the difference of MIA\ntreatment on different demographic groups. Second, it evaluates VD on four\nreal-world datasets, and shows that VD indeed exists in these datasets. Third,\nit examines the impacts of differential privacy, as a defense mechanism of MIA,\non VD. The results show that although DP brings significant change on VD, it\ncannot eliminate VD completely. Therefore, fourth, it designs a new mitigation\nalgorithm named FAIRPICK to reduce VD.

To protect users' privacy, differential privacy has\nbeen widely studied in the literature. Specifically, a differentially private\nalgorithm adds noise to the true answer of a query to generate a noisy\nresponse. As a result, the information about the dataset leaked by the noisy\noutput is bounded by the privacy parameter. Oftentimes, a dataset needs to be\nused for answering multiple queries (e.g., for multiple analytics tasks), so\nthe level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus,\nit is crucial to keep track of the privacy spending which should not exceed the\ngiven privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is\nasked again on the same dataset, we may reuse the previous noisy response for\nthe current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design and\nimplement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving\ndifferential-privacy cost. Blockchain provides a distributed immutable ledger\nthat records each query's type, the noisy response used to answer each query,\nthe associated noise level added to the true query result, and the remaining\nprivacy budget in our system. Furthermore, since the blockchain records the\nnoisy response used to answer each query, we also design an algorithm to reuse\nprevious noisy response if the same query is asked repeatedly. Specifically,\nconsidering that different requests of the same query may have different\nprivacy requirements, our algorithm (via a rigorous proof) is able to set the\noptimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise (if\nnecessary) to minimize the accumulated privacy cost.

We propose NASS, an integrated framework to search for tailored NN\narchitectures designed specifically for SI. In particular, we propose to model\ncryptographic protocols as design elements with associated reward functions.\nThe characterized models are then adopted in a joint optimization with\npredicted hyperparameters in identifying the best NN architectures that balance\nprediction accuracy and execution efficiency. In the experiment, it is\ndemonstrated that we can achieve the best of both worlds by using NASS, where\nthe prediction accuracy can be improved from 81.6% to 84.6%, while the\ninference runtime is reduced by 2x and communication bandwidth by 1.9x on the\nCIFAR-10 dataset.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 06:37:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Feb 2020 17:08:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 16 Feb 2020 10:54:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bian", "Song", ""], ["Jiang", "Weiwen", ""], ["Lu", "Qing", ""], ["Shi", "Yiyu", ""], ["Sato", "Takashi", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11911", "submitter": "Mariana Gama", "authors": "Mariana Gama, Paulo Mateus, Andr\\'e Souto", "title": "A Private Quantum Bit String Commitment", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/e22030272", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an entanglement-based quantum bit string commitment protocol whose\ncomposability is proven in the random oracle model.
