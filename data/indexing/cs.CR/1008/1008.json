These are\nmechanisms that guarantee optimal utility to a large class of information\nconsumers, simultaneously, while preserving Differential Privacy [Dwork,\nMcSherry, Nissim, and Smith, TCC 2006]. Ghosh et al. have demonstrated, quite\nsurprisingly, a case where such a universally-optimal differentially-private\nmechanisms exists, when the information consumers are Bayesian. This result was\nrecently extended by Gupte and Sundararajan [PODS 2010] to risk-averse\nconsumers.\n  Both positive results deal with mechanisms (approximately) computing a single\ncount query (i.e., the number of individuals satisfying a specific property in\na given population), and the starting point of our work is a trial at extending\nthese results to similar settings, such as sum queries with non-binary\nindividual values, histograms, and two (or more) count queries. We show,\nhowever, that universally-optimal mechanisms do not exist for all these\nqueries, both for Bayesian and risk-averse consumers.\n  For the Bayesian case, we go further, and give a characterization of those\nfunctions that admit universally-optimal mechanisms, showing that a\nuniversally-optimal mechanism exists, essentially, only for a (single) count\nquery. At the heart of our proof is a representation of a query function $f$ by\nits privacy constraint graph $G_f$ whose edges correspond to values resulting\nby applying $f$ to neighboring databases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Aug 2010 09:21:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Brenner", "Hai", ""], ["Nissim", "Kobbi", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0781", "submitter": "Johannes Merkle", "authors": "Johannes Merkle, Michael Schwaiger, Oliver Bausinger, Marco\n  Breitenstein, Kristina Elwart, Markus Nuppeney", "title": "Towards Improving the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) Algorithm\n  (Extended Version)", "comments": "The present article is an extended version of the paper published at\n  the BIOSIG conference (copyright by Gesellschaft f\\\"ur Informatik)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) algorithm has become a standard\nmethod to assess fingerprint image quality.

The aim of undertaken this\nresearch is to come up with a block cipher where by the keys are randomly\ngenerated by ASNN which can then have any variable block length. This will show\nthe private key is kept and do not have to be exchange to the other side of the\ncommunication channel so it present a more secure procedure of key scheduling.\nThe process enables for a faster change in encryption keys and a network level\nencryption to be implemented at a high speed without the headache of\nfactorization. Approach: The block cipher is converted in public cryptosystem\nand had a low level of vulnerability to attack from brute, and moreover can\nable to defend against linear attacks since the Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANN) architecture convey non-linearity to the encryption/decryption\nprocedures. Result: In this paper is present to use the Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) with spiking neurons as its basic unit. The timing for the SNNs is\nconsidered and the output is encoded in 1's and 0's depending on the occurrence\nor not occurrence of spikes as well as the spiking neural networks use a sign\nfunction as activation function, and present the weights and the filter\ncoefficients to be adjust, having more degrees of freedom than the classical\nneural networks. Conclusion: In conclusion therefore, encryption algorithm can\nbe deployed in communication and security applications where data transfers are\nmost crucial. So this paper, the neural block cipher proposed where the keys\nare generated by the SNN and the seed is considered the public key which\ngenerates the both keys on both sides In future therefore a new research will\nbe conducted on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) impacts on communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Aug 2010 14:55:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Omari", "Saleh Ali K.", ""], ["Sumari", "Putra", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.5015", "submitter": "Hu Xiong", "authors": "Hu Xiong, Jianbin Hu, Tao Yang, Wei Xin, Zhong Chen", "title": "Efficient Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol for Vehicular\n  Communications with Trustworthy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce an efficient and trustworthy conditional\nprivacy-preserving communication protocol for VANETs based on proxy\nre-signature.
