In\nmany applications using audio watermarking, D/A and A/D conversions (denoted by\nDA/AD in this paper) are often involved. In previous works, however, the\nrobustness issue of audio watermarking against the DA/AD conversions has not\ndrawn sufficient attention yet. In our extensive investigation, it has been\nfound that the degradation of a watermarked audio signal caused by the DA/AD\nconversions manifests itself mainly in terms of wave magnitude distortion and\nlinear temporal scaling, making the watermark extraction failed. Accordingly, a\nDWT-based audio watermarking algorithm robust against the DA/AD conversions is\nproposed in this paper. To resist the magnitude distortion, the relative energy\nrelationships among different groups of the DWT coefficients in the\nlow-frequency sub-band are utilized in watermark embedding by adaptively\ncontrolling the embedding strength. Furthermore, the resynchronization is\ndesigned to cope with the linear temporal scaling. The time-frequency\nlocalization characteristics of DWT are exploited to save the computational\nload in the resynchronization. Consequently, the proposed audio watermarking\nalgorithm is robust against the DA/AD conversions, other common audio\nprocessing manipulations, and the attacks in StirMark Benchmark for Audio,\nwhich has been verified by experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 11:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Xiang", "Shijun", ""], ["Huang", "Jiwu", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0802", "submitter": "Patricia Reynier", "authors": "Dinu Coltuc, Jean-Marc Chassery (GIPSA-lab)", "title": "Very fast watermarking by reversible contrast mapping", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters 14, 4 (04/2007) pp 255-258", "doi": "10.1109/LSP.2006.884895", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CR cs.CV cs.IT math.IT", "license": null, "abstract": "  Reversible contrast mapping (RCM) is a simple integer transform that applies\nto pairs of pixels.

The embedded\ninformation bit-rates of the proposed spatial domain reversible watermarking\nscheme are close to the highest bit-rates reported so far.
