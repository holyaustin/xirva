DDoS attacks are treated as a congestion-control problem, but\nbecause most such congestion is caused by malicious hosts not obeying\ntraditional end-to-end congestion control, the problem must be handled by the\nrouters. Functionality is added to each router to detect and preferentially\ndrop packets that probably belong to an attack. Upstream routers are also\nnotified to drop such packets in order that the router's resources be used to\nroute legitimate traffic hence term pushback. Client puzzles have been\nadvocated as a promising countermeasure to DoS attacks in the recent years. In\norder to identify the attackers, the victim server issues a puzzle to the\nclient that sent the traffic. When the client is able to solve the puzzle, it\nis assumed to be authentic and the traffic from it is allowed into the server.\nIf the victim suspects that the puzzles are solved by most of the clients, it\nincreases the complexity of the puzzles. This puzzle solving technique allows\nthe traversal of the attack traffic throughout the intermediate routers before\nreaching the destination. In order to attain the advantages of both pushback\nand puzzle solving techniques, a hybrid scheme called Router based Pushback\ntechnique, which involves both the techniques to solve the problem of DDoS\nattacks is proposed.

We are going to present a dynamic security that\nsimultaneously realizes all the three functions with a high efficiency and then\ngive a security analysis. It also presents secure and dynamic key exchange\nmethod. Signature, encryption and key exchange are some of the most important\nand foundational Crypto-graphical tools. In most cases, they are all needed to\nprovide different secure functions. On the other hand, there are also some\nproposals on the efficient combination of key exchange. In this paper, we\npresent a dynamic, reliable and secure method for the exchange of session key.\nMoreover, the proposed modification method could achieve better performance\nefficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 06:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Abid", "Sohail", ""], ["Abid", "Shahid", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5666", "submitter": "Jesus Diaz Vico", "authors": "Jesus Diaz and David Arroyo and Francisco B.

It can be separated in two main parts: context and\nrequirements analysis and informal verification; and formal representation and\nprocedural verification. It is an iterative process where the early steps are\nsimpler than the last ones. Therefore, the effort required for detecting flaws\nis proportional to the complexity of the associated attack. Thus, we avoid\nwasting valuable resources for simple flaws that can be detected early in the\nverification process. In order to illustrate the advantages provided by our\nmethodology, we also analyze three real protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 22:30:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2012 13:37:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Diaz", "Jesus", ""], ["Arroyo", "David", ""], ["Rodriguez", "Francisco B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5728", "submitter": "Yusuf Motara", "authors": "Yusuf Moosa Motara", "title": "Functional Programming and Security", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.PL cs.SE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyses the security contribution of typical functional-language\nfeatures by examining them in the light of accepted information security\nprinciples.

In TranSteg,\ncompression of the overt data is used to make space for the steganogram. In\nthis paper we focus on analyzing the influence of the selection of speech\ncodecs on hidden transmission performance, that is, which codecs would be the\nmost advantageous ones for TranSteg. Therefore, by considering the codecs which\nare currently most popular for IP telephony we aim to find out which codecs\nshould be chosen for transcoding to minimize the negative influence on voice\nquality while maximizing the obtained steganographic bandwidth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 14:16:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Janicki", "Artur", ""], ["Mazurczyk", "Wojciech", ""], ["Szczypiorski", "Krzysztof", ""]]}]
