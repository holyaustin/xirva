This new currency, we denominated Toroid or TRD,\ncan be used more extensively for commerce than pseudo commodity\ncryptocurrencies due to its lower volatility. Also, is suitable for investment,\nas the tokens in each account multiply, return interest, when the market grows.\nLike the controlled fiat money of a central bank plus the benefits of an\ninflation-adjusted perpetuity bond. Collateral in base coin, for example BTC or\nETH, can be added to bootstrap your own Toroid investment or withdrawed after a\nvery small investment period. So, the Toroids are not created from nothing nor\nhave a limited monetary base. The minimum investment period can be very small,\nfor example one day, and you keep the interest but you can return the Toroids\nand refund your collateral. That is a one-side only peg to a deflationary\ncrypto-commodity. The stability is guaranteed by endogenous measurements of\nnumber of transactions and wallet pro-rated rebasement of balance to reduce\nvolatility of price. Each account has its own rebasement due to the account\ncreation timestamp. Rebasement control mechanism is progressive during initial\nbootstrap period because price manipulation protection is more severe when the\ncapital involved is smaller. Rebasement has a quick positive start to\nincentivize early adopters that see only big growth in their TRD account during\nbootstrap period. Finally, the new rebasement control makes it economically\ninfeasible for an attacker targeting the coin with manipulated transaction\nvolume if we set the minimum rebasement greater than profits from massive\ncurrency manipulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 04:59:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Orlicki", "Jose I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.00319", "submitter": "Na-Young Ahn", "authors": "Na-Young Ahn and Donghoon Lee", "title": "Privacy Protection Cache Policy on Hybrid Main Memory", "comments": "2 pages, 3 figures, IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration\n  Systems. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1707.02842", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "TVLSI-00488-2017", "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We firstly suggest privacy protection cache policy applying the duty to\ndelete personal information on a hybrid main memory system.

We consider a scenario in which an\nindividual shares his sequential data (such as genomic data or location\npatterns) with several service providers (SPs). In such a scenario, if his data\nis shared with other third parties without his consent, the individual wants to\ndetermine the service provider that is responsible for this unauthorized\nsharing. To provide this functionality, we propose a novel optimization-based\nwatermarking scheme for sharing of sequential data. Thus, in the case of an\nunauthorized sharing of sensitive data, the proposed scheme can find the source\nof the leakage by checking the watermark inside the leaked data. In particular,\nthe proposed schemes guarantees with a high probability that (i) the malicious\nSP that receives the data cannot understand the watermarked data points, (ii)\nwhen more than one malicious SPs aggregate their data, they still cannot\ndetermine the watermarked data points, (iii) even if the unauthorized sharing\ninvolves only a portion of the original data or modified data (to damage the\nwatermark), the corresponding malicious SP can be kept responsible for the\nleakage, and (iv) the added watermark is compliant with the nature of the\ncorresponding data. That is, if there are inherent correlations in the data,\nthe added watermark still preserves such correlations. Watermarking typically\nmeans changing certain parts of the data, and hence it may have negative\neffects on data utility. The proposed scheme also minimizes such utility loss\nwhile it provides the aforementioned security guarantees.

Specifically, the sender Alice first transmits message $M$ to\nthe receiver Bob over $(W_1,W_2)$ with an error correction code; then Alice\nemploys a hash function (i.e., $\\varepsilon$-AWU$_2$ hash functions) to\ngenerate a message tag $S$ of message $M$ using key $K$, and encodes $S$ to a\ncodeword $X^n$ by leveraging an existing strongly secure channel coding with\nexponentially small (in code length $n$) average probability of error; finally,\nAlice sends $X^n$ over $(W_1,W_2)$ to Bob who authenticates the received\nmessages.

Hence, an adversary can deceive the API to\noutput only her desired video and shot labels by periodically inserting an\nimage into the video at the rate of one frame per second. We also show that the\npattern of shot changes returned by the API can be mostly recovered by an\nalgorithm that compares the histograms of consecutive frames.

Our\nfindings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above\nvulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle\nof exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand,\ncybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and\nthe market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and\nexploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on\nlikelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation\nbetween market activity and exploit deployment.

However, an independent, localised and effective\nfleet control is required, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for the\nreasons: 1) increase in the number of drone fleets, 2) number of drones in a\nfleet might be multiple of tens, 3) time-criticality in making decisions by\nsuch fleets in the wild, 4) potential communication congestions/lag, and 5) in\nsome cases working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates-limited\ncommunication with control centre (i.e., operations spanning long period of\ntimes or military usage of such fleets in enemy territory). This self-ware,\nmission-focused and independent fleet of drones that potential utilises swarm\nintelligence for a) air-traffic and/or flight control management, b) obstacle\navoidance, c) self-preservation while maintaining the mission criteria, d)\ncollaboration with other fleets in the wild (autonomously) and e) assuring the\nsecurity, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data,\nsoftware) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet\nof drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 18:41:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Akram", "Raja Naeem", ""], ["Markantonakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Mayes", "Keith", ""], ["Habachi", "Oussama", ""], ["Sauveron", "Damien", ""], ["Steyven", "Andreas", ""], ["Chaumette", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.05811", "submitter": "Adi Akavia", "authors": "Adi Akavia, Dan Feldman, Hayim Shaul", "title": "Secure Search on the Cloud via Coresets and Sketches", "comments": "25 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  \\emph{Secure Search} is the problem of retrieving from a database table (or\nany unsorted array) the records matching specified attributes, as in SQL SELECT\nqueries, but where the database and the query are encrypted.

By empirically studying\ntwo state-of-the-art ML systems in the healthcare domain, we explore the\nfeasibility of such attacks. For example, we show that, without prior knowledge\nabout the host ML system, by modifying only 3.3{\\textperthousand} of the MLC's\nparameters, each with distortion below $10^{-3}$, the adversary is able to\nforce the misdiagnosis of target victims' skin cancers with 100\\% success rate.\nWe provide analytical justification for the success of such attacks, which\npoints to the fundamental characteristics of today's ML models: high\ndimensionality, non-linearity, and non-convexity. The issue thus seems\nfundamental to many ML systems. We further discuss potential countermeasures to\nmitigate MLC-based attacks and their potential technical challenges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 16:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xinyang", ""], ["Ji", "Yujie", ""], ["Wang", "Ting", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.07975", "submitter": "Vincent Bindschaedler", "authors": "Vincent Bindschaedler, Reza Shokri, Carl A.

The\nfirst phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the\nmeasured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter.\nViden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the\ntransmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints.

Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with\nmodern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily\ndeployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype\nand two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs\nbased solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a\nlow false identification rate of 0.2%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 16:51:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Kyong-Tak", ""], ["Shin", "Kang", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08424", "submitter": "Dmitry Kogan", "authors": "Dmitry Kogan, Nathan Manohar, Dan Boneh", "title": "T/Key: Second-Factor Authentication From Secure Hash Chains", "comments": "Accepted to ACM CCS 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Time-based one-time password (TOTP) systems in use today require storing\nsecrets on both the client and the server.

However, some features\nalso bring risk to users' privacy and security, whether through implementation\nerror, unexpected composition, or unintended use. Currently there is no general\nmethodology for weighing these costs and benefits.

This work addresses this\nproblem with a methodology for weighing the costs and benefits of giving\nwebsites default access to each browser feature. We model the benefit as the\nnumber of websites that require the feature for some user-visible benefit, and\nthe cost as the number of CVEs, lines of code, and academic attacks related to\nthe functionality. We then apply this methodology to 74 Web API standards\nimplemented in modern browsers. We find that allowing websites default access\nto large parts of the Web API poses significant security and privacy risks,\nwith little corresponding benefit.\n  We also introduce a configurable browser extension that allows users to\nselectively restrict access to low-benefit, high-risk features on a per site\nbasis.

The security analysis, including key space\nanalysis, key sensitivity analysis, cryptanalysis, and the comparison results\ndemonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme also achieves high security.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:24:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Lei", ""], ["Wang", "Shihong", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09537", "submitter": "Xiaoyu Ji", "authors": "Guoming Zhang, Chen Yan, Xiaoyu Ji, Taimin Zhang, Tianchen Zhang,\n  Wenyuan Xu", "title": "DolphinAtack: Inaudible Voice Commands", "comments": "15 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": "published on ACM Conference on Computer and Communications\n  Security (CCS) 2017", "doi": "10.1145/3133956.3134052", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Speech recognition (SR) systems such as Siri or Google Now have become an\nincreasingly popular human-computer interaction method, and have turned various\nsystems into voice controllable systems(VCS). Prior work on attacking VCS shows\nthat the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control\nthe systems. Hidden voice commands, though hidden, are nonetheless audible. In\nthis work, we design a completely inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that\nmodulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers (e.g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve\ninaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the\nmodulated low frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated,\nrecovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems.\nWe validate DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including\nSiri, Google Now, Samsung S Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By\ninjecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few\nproof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime\ncall on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode,\nand even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose\nhardware and software defense solutions. We validate that it is feasible to\ndetect DolphinAttack by classifying the audios using supported vector machine\n(SVM), and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to\ninaudible voice command attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:28:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Guoming", ""], ["Yan", "Chen", ""], ["Ji", "Xiaoyu", ""], ["Zhang", "Taimin", ""], ["Zhang", "Tianchen", ""], ["Xu", "Wenyuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09538", "submitter": "Rakesh Bobba", "authors": "Read Sprabery (1), Konstantin Evchenko (1), Abhilash Raj (2), Rakesh\n  B.

In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some\nparticipants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in\nproportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks\nthreaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH)\nattack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants\nreceive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools\nlaunch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a\nNash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack\ncalled selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by\ndeliberately generating forks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called\na fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The\nreward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH\nattacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH\nattack. When considering multiple pools - the current state of the Bitcoin\nnetwork - the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a\nBWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the\nminer's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can\nconsistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional\nforks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also\ndiscuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and\nefficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see\nFAW attacks among mining pools.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:05:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kwon", "Yujin", ""], ["Kim", "Dohyun", ""], ["Son", "Yunmok", ""], ["Vasserman", "Eugene", ""], ["Kim", "Yongdae", ""]]}]
