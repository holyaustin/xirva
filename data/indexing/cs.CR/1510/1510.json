In order to secure the transmission of secret data over\nthe public network (Internet), various schemes have been presented over the\nlast decade. Steganography combined with cryptography, can be one of the best\nchoices for solving this problem. This paper proposes a new steganographic\nmethod based on gray-level modification for true colour images using image\ntransposition, secret key and cryptography. Both the secret key and secret\ninformation are initially encrypted using multiple encryption algorithms\n(bitxor operation, bits shuffling, and stego key-based encryption); these are,\nsubsequently, hidden in the host image pixels. In addition, the input image is\ntransposed before data hiding. Image transposition, bits shuffling, bitxoring,\nstego key-based encryption, and gray-level modification introduce five\ndifferent security levels to the proposed scheme, making the data recovery\nextremely difficult for attackers. The proposed technique is evaluated by\nobjective analysis using various image quality assessment metrics, producing\npromising results in terms of imperceptibility and security.

More importantly, the\nproposed model is then implemented to thoroughly characterize various WPLI\ntechniques that utilize the spectrum features coming from the non-linear\nRF-front-end, under the influences from different transmitters, receivers, and\nwireless channels. Subsequently, the limitations of existing WPLI techniques\nare revealed and evaluated in details using both the developed theoretical\nmodel and in-lab experiments. The real-world requirements and constraints are\ncharacterized along each step in WPLI, including i) the signal processing at\nthe transmitter (device to be identified), ii) the various physical layer\nfeatures that originate from circuits, antenna, and environments, iii) the\nsignal propagation in various wireless channels, iv) the signal reception and\nprocessing at the receiver (the identifier), and v) the fingerprint extraction\nand classification at the receiver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 20:59:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 21:37:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Wenhao", ""], ["Sun", "Zhi", ""], ["Ren", "Kui", ""], ["Zhu", "Bocheng", ""], ["Piao", "Sixu", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08531", "submitter": "Guan-Hua Tu", "authors": "Guan-Hua Tu, Yuanjie Li, Chunyi Peng, Chi-Yu Li, Muhammad Taqi Raza,\n  Hsiao-Yun Tseng, Songwu Lu", "title": "New Threats to SMS-Assisted Mobile Internet Services from 4G LTE:\n  Lessons Learnt from Distributed Mobile-Initiated Attacks towards Facebook and\n  Other Services", "comments": "16 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile Internet is becoming the norm. With more personalized mobile devices\nin hand, many services choose to offer alternative, usually more convenient,\napproaches to authenticating and delivering the content between mobile users\nand service providers. One main option is to use SMS (i.e., short messaging\nservice). Such carrier-grade text service has been widely used to assist\nversatile mobile services, including social networking, banking, to name a few.\nThough the text service can be spoofed via certain Internet text service\nproviders which cooperated with carriers, such attacks haven well studied and\ndefended by industry due to the efforts of research community. However, as\ncellular network technology advances to the latest IP-based 4G LTE, we find\nthat these mobile services are somehow exposed to new threats raised by this\nchange, particularly on 4G LTE Text service (via brand-new distributed\nMobile-Initiated Spoofed SMS attack which is not available in legacy 2G/3G\nsystems). The reason is that messaging service over LTE shifts from the\ncircuit-switched (CS) design to the packet-switched (PS) paradigm as 4G LTE\nsupports PS only. Due to this change, 4G LTE Text Service becomes open to\naccess. However, its shields to messaging integrity and user authentication are\nnot in place. As a consequence, such weaknesses can be exploited to launch\nattacks (e.g., hijack Facebook accounts) against a targeted individual, a large\nscale of mobile users and even service providers, from mobile devices. Current\ndefenses for Internet-Initiated Spoofed SMS attacks cannot defend the\nunprecedented attack. Our study shows that 53 of 64 mobile services over 27\nindustries are vulnerable to at least one threat. We validate these\nproof-of-concept attacks in one major US carrier which supports more than 100\nmillion users. We finally propose quick fixes and discuss security insights and\nlessons we have learnt.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:57:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 17:25:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tu", "Guan-Hua", ""], ["Li", "Yuanjie", ""], ["Peng", "Chunyi", ""], ["Li", "Chi-Yu", ""], ["Raza", "Muhammad Taqi", ""], ["Tseng", "Hsiao-Yun", ""], ["Lu", "Songwu", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08546", "submitter": "Xiao Liu", "authors": "Seth Gilbert, Xiao Liu, Haifeng Yu", "title": "On Differentially Private Online Collaborative Recommendation Systems", "comments": "35 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In collaborative recommendation systems, privacy may be compromised, as\nusers' opinions are used to generate recommendations for others.
