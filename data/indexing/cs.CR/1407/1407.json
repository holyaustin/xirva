In 2008, Kasiviswanathan et al. (FOCS 2008) gave a generic\nconstruction of private learners, in which the sample complexity is (generally)\nhigher than what is needed for non-private learners. This gap in the sample\ncomplexity was then further studied in several followup papers, showing that\n(at least in some cases) this gap is unavoidable. Moreover, those papers\nconsidered ways to overcome the gap, by relaxing either the privacy or the\nlearning guarantees of the learner.\n  We suggest an alternative approach, inspired by the (non-private) models of\nsemi-supervised learning and active-learning, where the focus is on the sample\ncomplexity of labeled examples whereas unlabeled examples are of a\nsignificantly lower cost. We consider private semi-supervised learners that\noperate on a random sample, where only a (hopefully small) portion of this\nsample is labeled. The learners have no control over which of the sample\nelements are labeled. Our main result is that the labeled sample complexity of\nprivate learners is characterized by the VC dimension.\n  We present two generic constructions of private semi-supervised learners. The\nfirst construction is of learners where the labeled sample complexity is\nproportional to the VC dimension of the concept class, however, the unlabeled\nsample complexity of the algorithm is as big as the representation length of\ndomain elements. Our second construction presents a new technique for\ndecreasing the labeled sample complexity of a given private learner, while\nroughly maintaining its unlabeled sample complexity. In addition, we show that\nin some settings the labeled sample complexity does not depend on the privacy\nparameters of the learner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:55:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2014 03:39:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 20:28:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Beimel", "Amos", ""], ["Nissim", "Kobbi", ""], ["Stemmer", "Uri", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.2674", "submitter": "Kobbi Nissim", "authors": "Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer", "title": "Private Learning and Sanitization: Pure vs. Approximate Differential\n  Privacy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We compare the sample complexity of private learning [Kasiviswanathan et al.\n2008] and sanitization~[Blum et al. 2008] under pure $\\epsilon$-differential\nprivacy [Dwork et al.

The $2^t$-ary method is\nthe most popular and widely used algorithm to speed up the RSA signature\nprocess. Developers can realize the fastest signature process by choosing\noptimum $t$. For example, $t=6$ is optimum for a 1536-bit classical RSA\nimplementation. The $2^t$-ary method requires precomputation to generate small\nexponentials of message. Conventional fault attack research has paid little\nattention to precomputation, even though precomputation could be a target of a\nfault attack. The proposed DCA induces faults in precomputation by using\ninstruction skip technique, which is equivalent to replacing an instruction\nwith a no operation in assembly language. This paper also presents a useful\n\"position checker\" tool to determine the position of the $2^t$-ary coefficients\nof the secret exponent from signatures based on faulted precomputations. The\nDCA is demonstrated to be an effective attack method for some widely used\nparameters. DCA can reconstruct an entire secret exponent using the position\nchecker with $63(=2^6-1)$ faulted signatures in a short time for a 1536-bit RSA\nimplementation using the $2^6$-ary method. The DCA process can be accelerated\nfor a small public exponent (e.g., 65537). The the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed DCA is the first fault attack against classical RSA precomputation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 23:23:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kaminaga", "Masahiro", ""], ["Yoshikawa", "Hideki", ""], ["Suzuki", "Toshinori", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7693", "submitter": "Marco Baldi", "authors": "Emanuele Frontoni, Marco Baldi, Primo Zingaretti, Vincenzo Landro,\n  Paolo Misericordia", "title": "Security issues for data sharing and service interoperability in eHealth\n  systems: the Nu.Sa. test bed", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure, to be presented at the International Carnahan\n  Conference on Security Technology, Rome, Italy, 13-16 October 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of the Nu.Sa. project is the definition of national level data\nstandards to collect data coming from General Practitioners' Electronic Health\nRecords and to allow secure data sharing between them.
