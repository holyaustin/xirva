However, the risks of revealing customers' privacy during\nthe process of filtering have attracted noticeable public concern recently.\nSpecifically, $k$NN attack discloses the target user's sensitive information by\ncreating $k$ fake nearest neighbours by non-sensitive information. Among the\ncurrent solutions against $k$NN attack, the probabilistic methods showed a\npowerful privacy preserving effect. However, the existing probabilistic methods\nneither guarantee enough prediction accuracy due to the global randomness, nor\nprovide assured security enforcement against $k$NN attack. To overcome the\nproblems of current probabilistic methods, we propose a novel approach,\nPartitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required security\nguarantee while achieving the optimal prediction accuracy against $k$NN attack.\nIn this paper, we define the sum of $k$ neighbours' similarity as the accuracy\nmetric $\\alpha$, the number of user partitions, across which we select the $k$\nneighbours, as the security metric $\\beta$. Differing from the present methods\nthat globally selected neighbours, our method selects neighbours from each\ngroup with exponential differential privacy to decrease the magnitude of noise.\nTheoretical and experimental analysis show that to achieve the same security\nguarantee against $k$NN attack, our approach ensures the optimal prediction\naccuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 01:20:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 01:00:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Zhigang", ""], ["Shen", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.00022", "submitter": "Xiaohan Zhao", "authors": "Xiaohan Zhao, Qingyun Liu, Lin Zhou, Haitao Zheng and Ben Y.

A significant challenge facing\nowners of these datasets is how to share sensitive graphs with collaborators\nand authorized users, e.g. network topologies with network equipment vendors or\nFacebook's social graphs with academic collaborators. Current tools can provide\nlimited node or edge privacy, but require modifications to the graph that\nsignificantly reduce its utility.\n  In this work, we propose a new alternative in the form of graph watermarks.\nGraph watermarks are small graphs tailor-made for a given graph dataset, a\nsecure graph key, and a secure user key. To share a sensitive graph G with a\ncollaborator C, the owner generates a watermark graph W using G, the graph key,\nand C's key as input, and embeds W into G to form G'. If G' is leaked by C,its\nowner can reliably determine if the watermark W generated for C does in fact\nreside inside G', thereby proving C is responsible for the leak. Graph\nwatermarks serve both as a deterrent against data leakage and a method of\nrecourse after a leak. We provide robust schemes for creating, embedding and\nextracting watermarks, and use analysis and experiments on large, real graphs\nto show that they are unique and difficult to forge.

Up until a few years back password based\nauthentication was the most common form of authentication to any secure\nnetwork. But with the advent of more sophisticated technologies this form of\nauthentication although still widely used has become insecure. Furthermore,\nwith the rise of 'Internet of Things' where the number of devices would grow\nmanifold it would be infeasible for user to remember innumerable passwords.\nTherefore, it's important to address this concern by devising ways in which\nmultiple forms of authentication would be required to gain access to any smart\ndevices and at the same time its usability would be high. In this paper, a\nmethodology is discussed as to what kind of authentication mechanisms could be\ndeployed in internet of things (IOT).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 17:38:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2015 04:14:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Udit", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03774", "submitter": "Oliver Kosut", "authors": "Jingwen Liang, Lalitha Sankar, Oliver Kosut", "title": "Vulnerability Analysis and Consequences of False Data Injection Attack\n  on Power System State Estimation", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures.

Recent standardization of TEE interfaces by\nGlobalPlatform (GP) promises to partially address this problem by enabling\nGP-compliant trusted applications to run on TEEs from different vendors.\nNevertheless ordinary developers wishing to develop trusted applications face\nsignificant challenges. Access to hardware TEE interfaces are difficult to\nobtain without support from vendors. Tools and software needed to develop and\ndebug trusted applications may be expensive or non-existent.\n  In this paper, we describe Open-TEE, a virtual, hardware-independent TEE\nimplemented in software. Open-TEE conforms to GP specifications. It allows\ndevelopers to develop and debug trusted applications with the same tools they\nuse for developing software in general. Once a trusted application is fully\ndebugged, it can be compiled for any actual hardware TEE. Through performance\nmeasurements and a user study we demonstrate that Open-TEE is efficient and\neasy to use.

Since most of the\ntarget WSN applications are very sensitive, security issue is one of the major\nchallenges in the deployment of WSN. One of the important building blocks in\nsecuring WSN is key management. Traditional key management solutions developed\nfor other networks are not suitable for WSN since WSN networks are resource\n(e.g. memory, computation, energy) limited. Key pre-distribution algorithms\nhave recently evolved as efficient alternatives of key management in these\nnetworks. In the key pre-distribution systems, secure communication is achieved\nbetween a pair of nodes either by the existence of a key allowing for direct\ncommunication or by a chain of keys forming a key-path between the pair. In\nthis paper, we propose methods which bring prior knowledge of network\ncharacteristics and application constraints into the design of key\npre-distribution schemes, in order to provide better security and connectivity\nwhile requiring less resources. Our methods are based on casting the prior\ninformation as a graph. Motivated by this idea, we also propose a class of\nquasi-symmetric designs referred here to as g-designs.
