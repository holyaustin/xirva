Unfortunately, known methods for endowing such proofs with\nzero knowledge guarantees do not retain this rich algebraic structure.\n  In this work, we develop algebraic techniques for obtaining zero knowledge\nvariants of proof protocols in a way that leverages and preserves their\nalgebraic structure. Our constructions achieve unconditional (perfect) zero\nknowledge in the Interactive Probabilistically Checkable Proof (IPCP) model of\nKalai and Raz [KR08] (the prover first sends a PCP oracle, then the prover and\nverifier engage in an Interactive Proof in which the verifier may query the\nPCP).\n  Our main result is a zero knowledge variant of the sumcheck protocol [LFKN92]\nin the IPCP model. The sumcheck protocol is a key building block in many IPs,\nincluding the protocol for polynomial-space computation due to Shamir [Sha92],\nand the protocol for parallel computation due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and\nRothblum [GKR15]. A core component of our result is an algebraic commitment\nscheme, whose hiding property is guaranteed by algebraic query complexity lower\nbounds [AW09,JKRS09]. This commitment scheme can then be used to considerably\nstrengthen our previous work [BCFGRS16] that gives a sumcheck protocol with\nmuch weaker zero knowledge guarantees, itself using algebraic techniques based\non algorithms for polynomial identity testing [RS05,BW04].\n  We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by deriving zero knowledge\nvariants of well-known protocols based on algebraic techniques, including the\nprotocols of Shamir and of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, as well as the\nprotocol of Babai, Fortnow, and Lund [BFL91].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 03:54:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chiesa", "Alessandro", ""], ["Forbes", "Michael A.", ""], ["Spooner", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.02203", "submitter": "Ryo Yonetani", "authors": "Ryo Yonetani, Vishnu Naresh Boddeti, Kris M.

Centralized networks\nhave single points of failure by definition, leading to a growing popularity in\ndecentralized architectures and protocols for greater fault-tolerance.

The underlying challenges to group key\nagreement are scalability, efficiency, and security. In a dynamic group\nenvironment, the rekeying process is more frequent; therefore, it is more\ncrucial to design an efficient group key agreement protocol. Moreover, with the\nemergence of various group-based services, it is becoming common for several\nmulticast groups to coexist in the same network. These multicast groups may\nhave several shared users; a join or leave request by a single user can trigger\nregeneration of multiple group keys. Under the given circumstances the rekeying\nprocess becomes a challenging task. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethodology for group key agreement which exploits the state vectors of group\nmembers. The state vector is a set of randomly generated nonce instances which\ndetermine the logical link between group members and which empowers the group\nmember to generate multiple cryptographic keys independently. Using local\nknowledge of a secret nonce, each member can generate and share a large number\nof secure keys, indicating that SGRS inherently provides a considerable amount\nof secure subgroup multicast communication using subgroup multicasting keys\nderived from local state vectors. The resulting protocol is secure and\nefficient in terms of both communication and computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 01:35:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bilal", "Muhammad", ""], ["Kang", "Shin-Gak", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.02698", "submitter": "Umamaheswari Ganesh", "authors": "G.Umamaheswari, Dr.C.P.Sumathi", "title": "A New Steganographic Technique Matching the Secret Message and Cover\n  image Binary Value", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, January 2017", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Steganography involves hiding a secret message or image inside another cover\nimage.

However, this approach\nposes privacy concerns. Especially with popular cloud services, the control\nover the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not\nshared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not\nnecessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers,\nand cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end\nthe relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a\nspecial kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any\nthird party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance.\nAlthough this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over\n30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\nscheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data,\nwas introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major\nachievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs\nto be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. First, we\npresent the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially\nHomomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which\nare important pillars of achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have\nbecome the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes are presented. Furthermore,\nthe implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also\nsurveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed.

They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for\nexample the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield\nsubcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the\nunderlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages\nof these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the\ndecoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we\npropose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing\nthe notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of\ncodes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the\ndimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach\ngives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield\nsubcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the\nsubfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of\npuncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces\nis greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite\nfield, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as\nefficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In\naddition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet\nhaving parameters previously inaccessible. As an application, we give some\nexamples that can be used in public key cryptosystems such as McEliece.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 19:41:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Berger", "Thierry P.", ""], ["Gueye", "Cheikh Thi\u00e9coumba", ""], ["Klamti", "Jean Belo", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08006", "submitter": "Hongcheng Li", "authors": "Bin Liang and Hongcheng Li and Miaoqiang Su and Pan Bian and Xirong Li\n  and Wenchang Shi", "title": "Deep Text Classification Can be Fooled", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": "https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/585", "doi": "10.24963/ijcai.2018/585", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present an effective method to craft text adversarial\nsamples, revealing one important yet underestimated fact that DNN-based text\nclassifiers are also prone to adversarial sample attack.
