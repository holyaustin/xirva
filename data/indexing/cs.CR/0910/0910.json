The complexity associated with a richly scattering\nenvironment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to\npredict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in\nspace, time and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state\nbetween a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for\nbuilding practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We\nbegin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process,\nwhich is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with\na richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and\nincorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial\nmanipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing\nalgorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their\nunderlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is\nsuited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is\nmotivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but\nexploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic\nlog likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation\nrate. We validate both proposed protocols through experimentations using a\ncustomized 802.11a platform, and show for the typical WiFi channel that\nreliable secret key establishment can be accomplished at rates on the order of\n10 bits/second.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 02:01:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ye", "Chunxuan", ""], ["Mathur", "Suhas", ""], ["Reznik", "Alex", ""], ["Shah", "Yogendra", ""], ["Trappe", "Wade", ""], ["Mandayam", "Narayan", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.5261", "submitter": "M.
