This offline attacker is\nlimited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password.\nKey-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making\neach password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However,\nkey-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication\nserver. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the\nessential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline\nattacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized\nkey-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be\ncracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized\nauthentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is\nmotivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will\ntypically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while\nan offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using\nrandomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a\ncorrect password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an\nincorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the\nquality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the\nfraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide\nan efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the\ndefender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale\npassword frequency datasets. Our analysis shows that CASH can significantly\nreduce (up to $50\\%$) the fraction of password cracked by a rational offline\nadversary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 11:45:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 22:05:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Blocki", "Jeremiah", ""], ["Datta", "Anupam", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00279", "submitter": "Daniel Augot", "authors": "Daniel Augot (GRACE), Fran\\c{c}oise Levy-Dit-Vehel (ENSTA ParisTech\n  UMA), Man Cuong Ng\\^o (GRACE)", "title": "Information Sets of Multiplicity Codes", "comments": "International Symposium on Information Theory, Jun 2015, Hong-Kong,\n  China.

We prove that every\nclient complying with RCF can access the server in bounded time, even under a\nflash crowd incident or a DDoS attack. Our large-scale simulations confirm that\nRCF provides a small and predictable maximum waiting time while existing\nschemes cannot.

The audio and video\ncomponents of the source separately undergo two layers of encryption to ensure\na reasonable level of security.

Combining these techniques, an efficient\nsystem, invulnerable to security breaches and attacks with favorable values of\nparameters such as encryption/decryption speed, encryption/decryption ratio and\nvisual degradation; has been put forth. For applications requiring encryption\nof sensitive data wherein stringent security requirements are of prime concern,\nthe system is found to yield negligible similarities in visual perception\nbetween the original and the encrypted video sequence. For applications wherein\nvisual similarity is not of major concern, we limit the encryption task to a\nsingle level of encryption which is accomplished by using RSA, thereby\nquickening the encryption process.

The majority of published SCA-WSN\nschemes use only lightweight cryptographic techniques (rather than public-key\ncryptographic techniques) for the sake of efficiency, and have been\ndemonstrated to suffer from the inability to provide user anonymity.

The reason for discussing it\nnow is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN\nkey exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein\nsecurity was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN\nsecure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are\ncontinuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme\ncan prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing\nsecurity is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the\nFluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and\ntemperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the\nother end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and\npower-flow data in the wire.
