This\npaper focuses on the performance analysis (through simulation) and modification\nof a well known MAC protocol CSMA/CD. The existing protocol does not consider\nthe wastage of bandwidth due to unutilized periods of the channel. By\nconsidering this fact, performance of MAC protocol can be enhanced. The purpose\nof this work is to modify the existing protocol by enabling it to adapt\naccording to state of the network. The modified protocol takes appropriate\naction whenever unutilized periods detected. In this way, to increase the\neffective bandwidth utilization and determine how it behaves under increasing\nload, and varying packet sizes. It will also include effects of attacks i.e.\nDenial of service attacks, Replay Attack, Continuous Channel Access or\nExhaustion attack, Flooding attack, Jamming (Radio interference) attack,\nSelective forwarding attack which degrade performance of MAC protocol. In\nContinuous Channel Access or Exhaustion attack, a malicious node disrupts the\nMAC protocol, by continuously requesting or transmitting over the channel. This\neventually leads a starvation for other nodes in the network w.r.t channel\naccess. remedy may be the network ignores excessive requests without sending\nexpensive radio transmissions. This limit however cannot drop below the\nexpected maximum data rate the network has to support. This limit is usually\ncoded into the protocol during the design phase and requires additional logic\nalso.

A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint\nExtraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the\nuse of onboard RAM as the source of \"true\" randomness. Unfortunately, practical\nconsiderations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First,\nthis method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory.\nThus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness\ngenerator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence;\nthere is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains\nintact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for\nentropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time\nwithout power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security\napplication, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to\nunacceptably high delays.\n  In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based\nrandom number generation.

Soft Input Decryption is a novel method which uses L values (soft\noutput) of a SISO channel decoder for the correction of input of Soft Input\nDecryption (SID blocks) which have been modified during the transmission over a\nnoisy channel. The method is based on the combination of cryptography and\nchannel coding improving characteristics of both of them. The algorithm,\nstrategies and scenarios of Soft Input Decryption are described.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2009 10:41:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 07:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zivic", "Natasa", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4743", "submitter": "Ersin Uzun", "authors": "Arun Kumar, Nitesh Saxena, Ersin Uzun", "title": "Alice Meets Bob: A Comparative Usability Study of Wireless Device\n  Pairing Methods for a \"Two-User\" Setting", "comments": "16 pages manuscript.

To prevent any malicious\ncontrol of or eavesdropping over the communication, the channel is desired to\nbe authenticated and confidential. The process of setting up a secure\ncommunication channel between two previously unassociated devices is referred\nto as \"Secure Device Pairing\". When there is no prior security context, e.g.,\nshared secrets, common key servers or public key certificates, device pairing\nrequires user involvement into the process. The idea usually involves\nleveraging an auxiliary human-perceptible channel to authenticate the data\nexchanged over the insecure wireless channel.\n  We observe that the focus of prior research has mostly been limited to\npairing scenarios where a single user controls both the devices. In this paper,\nwe consider more general and emerging \"two-user\" scenarios, where two different\nusers establish pairing between their respective devices. Although a number of\npairing methods exists in the literature, only a handful of those are\napplicable to the two-user setting. We present the first study to identify the\nmethods practical for two-user pairing scenarios, and comparatively evaluate\nthe usability of these methods. Our results identify methods best-suited for\nusers, in terms of efficiency, error-tolerance and of course, usability. Our\nwork sheds light on the applicability and usability of pairing methods for\nemerging two-user scenarios, a topic largely ignored so far.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:34:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Arun", ""], ["Saxena", "Nitesh", ""], ["Uzun", "Ersin", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4764", "submitter": "Farbod Shokrieh", "authors": "Farbod Shokrieh", "title": "The monodromy pairing and discrete logarithm on the Jacobian of finite\n  graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.
