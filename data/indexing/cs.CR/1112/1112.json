A non-malleable\nextractor is a much stronger version of a strong extractor. Previously, there\nare only two known constructions of non-malleable extractors. Both\nconstructions only work for (n, k)-sources with k>n/2. Interestingly, both\nconstructions are also two-source extractors.\n  In this paper, we present a strong connection between non-malleable\nextractors and two-source extractors. The first part of the connection shows\nthat non-malleable extractors can be used to construct two-source extractors.\nWith appropriate parameters the resulted two-source extractor beats the best\nknown construction of two-source extractors. This partially explains why\nprevious constructions of non-malleable extractors only work for sources with\nentropy rate >1/2, and why explicit non-malleable extractors for small\nmin-entropy may be hard to get. The second part of the connection shows that\ncertain two-source extractors can be used to construct non-malleable\nextractors. Using this connection, we obtain the first construction of\nnon-malleable extractors for k < n/2. Specifically, we give an unconditional\nconstruction for min-entropy k=(1/2-\\delta)n for some constant \\delta>0, and a\nconditional (semi-explicit) construction that can potentially achieve k=\\alpha\nn for any constant \\alpha>0.\n  Finally, despite the lack of explicit non-malleable extractors for\narbitrarily linear entropy, we give the first 2-round privacy amplification\nprotocol with asymptotically optimal entropy loss and communication complexity\nfor (n, k) sources with k=\\alpha n for any constant \\alpha>0.

This\nrewriting enables us to avoid the overhead of view materialization and\nmaintenance. A major concern here is that query rewriting for recursive XML\nviews is still an open problem. To overcome this problem, some works have been\nproposed to translate XPath queries into non-standard ones, called Regular\nXPath queries.

In this paper,\nwe show that query rewriting is always possible for recursive XML views using\nonly the expressive power of the standard XPath.

This can be characterized in the form of preferences. Players\nwould prefer to get the secret than to not get it and secondly with lesser\npreference, they would like as few other players to get the secret as possible.\nSeveral positive results have already been published to efficiently solve the\nproblem of rational secret sharing but only a handful of papers have touched\nupon the use of an asynchronous broadcast channel. [2] used cryptographic\nprimitives, [3] used an interactive dealer, and [4] used an honest minority of\nplayers in order to handle an asynchronous broadcast channel.\n  In our paper, we propose an m-out-of-n rational secret sharing scheme which\ncan function over an asynchronous broadcast channel without the use of\ncryptographic primitives and with a non-interactive dealer. This is possible\nbecause our scheme uses a small number, k+1, of honest players. The protocol is\nresilient to coalitions of size up to k and furthermore it is\n{\\epsilon}-resilient to coalitions of size up to and including m-1. The\nprotocol will have a strict Nash equilibrium with probability Pr((k+1)/n) and\nan {\\epsilon}-Nash equilibrium with probability Pr((n-k-1)/n) . Furthermore,\nour protocol is immune to backward induction.\n  Later on in the paper, we extend our results to include malicious players as\nwell.\n  We also show that our protocol handles the possibility of a player deviating\nin order to force another player to get a wrong value in what we believe to be\na more time efficient manner than was done in Asharov and Lindell [5].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Dec 2011 07:03:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Moses", "William K.", "Jr."], ["Rangan", "C.

We describe the structure of d-vectorial FCSRs\nand we develop an analysis to obtain basic properties like periodicity and the\nexistence of maximal length sequences. To illustrate these vectorial d-FCSRs,\nwe present simple examples and we compare with those of Goresky, Klapper and\nXu.

The\ncryptanalysis of several modern ciphers reduces to this problem. Up to now, the\nbest complexity bound was reached by an exhaustive search in $4\\log_2 n\\,2^n$\noperations. We give an algorithm that reduces the problem to a combination of\nexhaustive search and sparse linear algebra. This algorithm has several\nvariants depending on the method used for the linear algebra step. Under\nprecise algebraic assumptions on the input system, we show that the\ndeterministic variant of our algorithm has complexity bounded by\n$O(2^{0.841n})$ when $m=n$, while a probabilistic variant of the Las Vegas type\nhas expected complexity $O(2^{0.792n})$. Experiments on random systems show\nthat the algebraic assumptions are satisfied with probability very close to~1.\nWe also give a rough estimate for the actual threshold between our method and\nexhaustive search, which is as low as~200, and thus very relevant for\ncryptographic applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 10:05:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 11:59:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bardet", "Magali", ""], ["Faug\u00e8re", "Jean-Charles", ""], ["Salvy", "Bruno", ""], ["Spaenlehauer", "Pierre-Jean", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.6326", "submitter": "Odemir Bruno PhD", "authors": "Marina Jeaneth Machicao, Anderson G.
