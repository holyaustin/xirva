The vulnerable cryptosystems\ninclude the Even-Mansour block cipher, the three-round Feistel network, the\nEncrypted-CBC-MAC, and many others. In this work, we study simple algebraic\nadaptations of such schemes that replace $(\\mathbb Z/2)^n$ addition with\noperations over alternate finite groups--such as $\\mathbb Z/{2^n}$--and provide\nevidence that these adaptations are qCPA-secure.

We observe that this\nproblem has a number of attractive features in this cryptographic context,\nincluding random self-reducibility, hardness amplification, and--in many cases\nof interest--a reduction from the \"search version\" to the \"decisional version.\"\nWe then establish, under this assumption, the qCPA-security of several such\nHidden Shift adaptations of symmetric-key constructions.

IoT is envisioned as\nmultitude of heterogeneous devices densely interconnected and communicating\nwith the objective of accomplishing a diverse range of objectives, often\ncollaboratively. One can argue that in the relatively near future, the IoT\nconstruct will subsume industrial plants, infrastructures, housing and other\nsystems that today are controlled by ICS and SCADA systems. In the IoT\nenvironments, cybersecurity will derive largely from system agility,\nmoving-target defenses, cybermaneuvering, and other autonomous or\nsemi-autonomous behaviors. Cyber security of IoT may also benefit from new\ndesign methods for mixed-trusted systems; and from big data analytics --\npredictive and autonomous.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 17:10:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Blowers", "Misty", ""], ["Iribarne", "Jose", ""], ["Colbert", "Edward", ""], ["Kott", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.01955", "submitter": "Krzysztof Szczypiorski", "authors": "Krzysztof Szczypiorski and Tomasz Tyl", "title": "MoveSteg: A Method of Network Steganography Detection", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article presents a new method for detecting a source point of time based\nnetwork steganography - MoveSteg.

While there are many methods\nto pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and\ngenerating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible\nmeans to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA\ndetection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce\nnames of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat\nblind to new DGA variants.\n  In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to\nconstruct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a\ndeep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator\nlearns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect.\nIn turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the\nadversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether\nadversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order\nto harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We\ndetail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN). In particular, our deep learning\narchitecture begins as a domain name auto-encoder (encoder + decoder) trained\non domains in the Alexa one million. Then the encoder and decoder are\nreassembled competitively in a generative adversarial network (detector +\ngenerator), with novel neural architectures and training strategies to improve\nconvergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 17:50:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Anderson", "Hyrum S.", ""], ["Woodbridge", "Jonathan", ""], ["Filar", "Bobby", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.02065", "submitter": "Nguyen Phong Hoang", "authors": "Nguyen Phong Hoang", "title": "Towards an Autonomous System Monitor for Mitigating Correlation Attacks\n  in the Tor Network", "comments": "Master's thesis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  After carefully considering the scalability problem in Tor and exhaustively\nevaluating related works on AS-level adversaries, the author proposes\nASmoniTor, which is an autonomous system monitor for mitigating correlation\nattacks in the Tor network.
