Sensor node authentication\nensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node,\nwhereas user authentication guarantees that only legitimate users can access\nthe sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network\nand exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication\nprocess multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT)\nbrings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security\nrequirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish\nmultiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the\nfrequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the\nnumber of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more\nchallenging.

However, recent research showed that DNNs can be highly vulnerable\nto adversarially generated instances, which look seemingly normal to human\nobservers, but completely confuse DNNs. These adversarial samples are crafted\nby adding small perturbations to normal, benign images. Such perturbations,\nwhile imperceptible to the human eye, are picked up by DNNs and cause them to\nmisclassify the manipulated instances with high confidence. In this work, we\nexplore and demonstrate how systematic JPEG compression can work as an\neffective pre-processing step in the classification pipeline to counter\nadversarial attacks and dramatically reduce their effects (e.g., Fast Gradient\nSign Method, DeepFool). An important component of JPEG compression is its\nability to remove high frequency signal components, inside square blocks of an\nimage. Such an operation is equivalent to selective blurring of the image,\nhelping remove additive perturbations. Further, we propose an ensemble-based\ntechnique that can be constructed quickly from a given well-performing DNN, and\nempirically show how such an ensemble that leverages JPEG compression can\nprotect a model from multiple types of adversarial attacks, without requiring\nknowledge about the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 May 2017 14:55:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Nilaksh", ""], ["Shanbhogue", "Madhuri", ""], ["Chen", "Shang-Tse", ""], ["Hohman", "Fred", ""], ["Chen", "Li", ""], ["Kounavis", "Michael E.", ""], ["Chau", "Duen Horng", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03042", "submitter": "Mohsen Moradi", "authors": "Mohsen Moradi", "title": "Polar codes for secret sharing", "comments": "5 pages, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A secret can be an encrypted message or a private key to decrypt the\nciphertext.

In this paper we extend the formulation of the\nunderlying splicing problem to consider two input images, a query image and a\npotential donor image. Here the task is to estimate the probability that the\ndonor image has been used to splice the query image, and obtain the splicing\nmasks for both the query and donor images. We introduce a novel deep\nconvolutional neural network architecture, called Deep Matching and Validation\nNetwork (DMVN), which simultaneously localizes and detects image splicing. The\nproposed approach does not depend on handcrafted features and uses raw input\nimages to create deep learned representations. Furthermore, the DMVN is\nend-to-end op- timized to produce the probability estimates and the\nsegmentation masks.

Once the\npassword file is compromised, an adversary obtains both the login credentials.\nWith the advancement of technology, even if a password is maintained in hashed\nformat, then also the adversary can invert the hashed password to get the\noriginal one. To mitigate this threat, most of the systems nowadays store some\nsystem generated fake passwords (also known as honeywords) along with the\noriginal password of a user. This type of setup confuses an adversary while\nselecting the original password.

A large number of significant work have been done on designing\nmethodologies (identified as $\\text{M}^{\\text{DS}}_{\\text{OA}}$) that can\nprotect password against observation or, shoulder surfing attack. Under this\nattack scenario, an adversary observes (or records) the login information\nentered by a user and later uses those credentials to impersonate the genuine\nuser.
