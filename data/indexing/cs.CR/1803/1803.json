In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic\nauthentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning\nframework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT\ndevices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated\nsignal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method\nenables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively\nauthenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT\nscenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due\nto computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve\nthe cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the\nuniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive\nIoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown\nthat analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning\nalgorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with\nthe incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of\nthe unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed\nto dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud\nto decide on which IoTDs to authenticate.

A particular difficulty is how to fairly\ncapture the notion of \"predicting an unqueried value\" when the adversary can\nquery in quantum superposition. In this work, we uncover serious shortcomings\nin existing approaches, and propose a new definition. We then support its\nviability by a number of constructions and characterizations. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate a function which is secure according to the existing definition by\nBoneh and Zhandry, but is clearly vulnerable to a quantum forgery attack,\nwhereby a query supported only on inputs that start with 0 divulges the value\nof the function on an input that starts with 1. We then propose a new\ndefinition, which we call \"blind-unforgeability\" (or BU.) This notion matches\n\"intuitive unpredictability\" in all examples studied thus far. It defines a\nfunction to be predictable if there exists an adversary which can use\n\"partially blinded\" oracle access to predict values in the blinded region. Our\ndefinition (BU) coincides with standard unpredictability (EUF-CMA) in the\nclassical-query setting. We show that quantum-secure pseudorandom functions are\nBU-secure MACs. In addition, we show that BU satisfies a composition property\n(Hash-and-MAC) using \"Bernoulli-preserving\" hash functions, a new notion which\nmay be of independent interest.

The performance reduction caused by it is\nonly few percent, most of which is due to the memory encryption layer that is\ncommonly used in many secure architectures.\n  We also developed SeM-Prepare, a software tool that automatically instruments\nexisting applications (binaries) with additional instructions so they can be\nsecurely executed on our architecture without requiring any programming efforts\nor the availability of the desired program`s source code.\n  To enable secure data sharing in shared memory environments, we developed\nSecure Distributed Shared Memory (SDSM), an efficient (time and memory)\nalgorithm for allowing thousands of compute nodes to share data securely while\nrunning on an untrusted computing environment. SDSM shows a negligible\nreduction in performance, and it requires negligible and hardware resources. We\ndeveloped Distributed Memory Integrity Trees, a method for enhancing single\nnode integrity trees for preserving the integrity of a distributed application\nrunning on an untrusted computing environment. We show that our method is\napplicable to existing single node integrity trees such as Merkle Tree, Bonsai\nMerkle Tree, and Intel`s SGX memory integrity engine. All these building blocks\nmay be used together to form a practical secure system, and some can be used in\nconjunction with other secure systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Mar 2018 12:09:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Shwartz", "Ofir", ""], ["Birk", "Yitzhak", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03965", "submitter": "Pan Li", "authors": "Pan Li and Qiang Liu and Wentao Zhao and Dongxu Wang and Siqi Wang", "title": "BEBP: An Poisoning Method Against Machine Learning Based IDSs", "comments": "7 pages,5figures, conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In big data era, machine learning is one of fundamental techniques in\nintrusion detection systems (IDSs).

Poisoning attack, which is one of the most recognized\nsecurity threats towards machine learning-based IDSs, injects some adversarial\nsamples into the training phase, inducing data drifting of training data and a\nsignificant performance decrease of target IDSs over testing data. In this\npaper, we adopt the Edge Pattern Detection (EPD) algorithm to design a novel\npoisoning method that attack against several machine learning algorithms used\nin IDSs.

A series of defending\nmethods, either proactive defence or reactive defence, have been proposed in\nthe recent years. However, most of the methods can only handle specific\nattacks. For example, proactive defending methods are invalid against grey-box\nor white-box attacks, while reactive defending methods are challenged by\nlow-distortion adversarial examples or transferring adversarial examples. This\nbecomes a critical problem since a defender usually does not have the type of\nthe attack as a priori knowledge. Moreover, existing two-pronged defences\n(e.g., MagNet), which take advantages of both proactive and reactive methods,\nhave been reported as broken under transferring attacks. To address this\nproblem, this paper proposed a novel defensive framework based on collaborative\nmulti-task training, aiming at providing defence for different types of\nattacks. The proposed defence first encodes training labels into label pairs\nand counters black-box attacks leveraging adversarial training supervised by\nthe encoded label pairs. The defence further constructs a detector to identify\nand reject high-confidence adversarial examples that bypass the black-box\ndefence. In addition, the proposed collaborative architecture can prevent\nadversaries from finding valid adversarial examples when the defence strategy\nis exposed. In the experiments, we evaluated our defence against four\nstate-of-the-art attacks on $MNIST$ and $CIFAR10$ datasets. The results showed\nthat our defending method achieved up to $96.3\\%$ classification accuracy on\nblack-box adversarial examples, and detected up to $98.7\\%$ of the high\nconfidence adversarial examples.

This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nattacker.

We consider various kinds of leakage games, depending on\nwhether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the\nchoices of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential\ngames, the choice of the second player is generally a function of the choice of\nthe first player, and his/her probabilistic choice can be either over the\npossible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function\n(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a\nsequential game with a hidden choice, then behavioral strategies are more\nadvantageous for the defender than mixed strategies. This contrasts with the\nstandard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.\nFinally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information\nleakage and provide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of\nequilibrium) for both attacker and defender in the various cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:36:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2018 04:24:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", ""], ["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Kawamoto", "Yusuke", ""], ["Palamidessi", "Catuscia", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.10099", "submitter": "Aleksandra Korolova", "authors": "Irfan Faizullabhoy, Aleksandra Korolova", "title": "Facebook's Advertising Platform: New Attack Vectors and the Need for\n  Interventions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Workshop on Technology and Consumer Protection (ConPro 2018)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ad targeting is getting more powerful with introduction of new tools, such as\nCustom Audiences, behavioral targeting, and Audience Insights.

We experimentally confirm the benefits of our\napproach compared to conventional hand-crafted anonymization methods including\nmasking, blurring, and noise adding.
