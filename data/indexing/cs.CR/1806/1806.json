Our theoretical analysis as\nwell as the extensive experiments on an embedded computing platform demonstrate\nthat DKSAP-IoT is able to reduce the computational overhead by at least 50%\nwhen compared to the state-of-the-art scheme, thereby paving the way for its\napplication to blockchain-based IoT systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2018 04:49:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "Xinxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.00981", "submitter": "Franz Pernkopf", "authors": "Tobias Schrank and Franz Pernkopf", "title": "Automatic Clustering of a Network Protocol with Weakly-Supervised\n  Clustering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Abstraction is a fundamental part when learning behavioral models of systems.\nUsually the process of abstraction is manually defined by domain experts.

Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme\nfor matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely\ndelegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX\nor Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate\nSlalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates\nwork to an untrusted GPU. For canonical DNNs (VGG16, MobileNet and ResNet\nvariants) we obtain 6x to 20x increases in throughput for verifiable inference,\nand 4x to 11x for verifiable and private inference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jun 2018 17:34:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:17:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tram\u00e8r", "Florian", ""], ["Boneh", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.03384", "submitter": "Mahmoud Mohammadi", "authors": "Noseong Park, Mahmoud Mohammadi, Kshitij Gorde, Sushil Jajodia,\n  Hongkyu Park, Youngmin Kim", "title": "Data Synthesis based on Generative Adversarial Networks", "comments": "Full Version - VLDB 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.14778/3231751.3231757", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Privacy is an important concern for our society where sharing data with\npartners or releasing data to the public is a frequent occurrence.

To efficiently train such a graph convolutional network, we\npropose a batch training scheme that allows multiple heterogeneous graphs to be\ninput as a batch.

The recent\nMeltdown and Spectre attacks have shown that this behavior can be exploited to\nexpose privileged information to an unprivileged attacker. In particular, the\nattack forces the speculative execution of a code gadget that will carry out\nthe illegal read, which eventually gets squashed, but which leaves a\nside-channel trail that can be used by the attacker to infer the value. Several\nattack variations are possible, allowing arbitrary exposure of the full kernel\nmemory to an unprivileged attacker. In this paper, we introduce a new model\n(SafeSpec) for supporting speculation in a way that is immune to side-channel\nleakage necessary for attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre. In particular,\nSafeSpec stores side effects of speculation in a way that is not visible to the\nattacker while the instructions are speculative. The speculative state is then\neither committed to the main CPU structures if the branch commits, or squashed\nif it does not, making all direct side effects of speculative code invisible.\nThe solution must also address the possibility of a covert channel from\nspeculative instructions to committed instructions before these instructions\nare committed.

The emerging blockchain and\nsmart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT\nand edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and\nprototype an edge-IoT framework named \"EdgeChain\" based on blockchain and smart\ncontracts.

EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control\nhow much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on\npre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart\ncontracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device\nbehavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and\ntransactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing.\nWe implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the ideas.

Adopting testing techniques could help to evaluate the\nrobustness of a DL system and therefore detect vulnerabilities at an early\nstage. The main challenge of testing such systems is that its runtime state\nspace is too large: if we view each neuron as a runtime state for DL, then a DL\nsystem often contains massive states, rendering testing each state almost\nimpossible.

Designing\nand training a well-performing model is generally expensive. However, when\nreleasing them, attackers may reverse engineer the models and pirate their\ndesign. This paper, therefore, proposes deep learning obfuscation, aiming at\nobstructing attackers from pirating a deep learning model. In particular, we\nfocus on obfuscating convolutional neural networks (CNN), a widely employed\ntype of deep learning architectures for image recognition. Our approach\nobfuscates a CNN model eventually by simulating its feature extractor with a\nshallow and sequential convolutional block. To this end, we employ a recursive\nsimulation method and a joint training method to train the simulation network.\nThe joint training method leverages both the intermediate knowledge generated\nby a feature extractor and data labels to train a simulation network. In this\nway, we can obtain an obfuscated model without accuracy loss. We have verified\nthe feasibility of our approach with three prevalent CNNs, i.e., GoogLeNet,\nResNet, and DenseNet. Although these networks are very deep with tens or\nhundreds of layers, we can simulate them in a shallow network including only\nfive or seven convolutional layers. The obfuscated models are even more\nefficient than the original models. Our obfuscation approach is very effective\nto protect the critical structure of a deep learning model from being exposed\nto attackers. Moreover, it can also thwart attackers from pirating the model\nwith transfer learning or incremental learning techniques because the shallow\nsimulation network bears poor learning ability.

These end-to-end learning models are powered by two\ncommonly used structures - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Previously proposed sequential malware\nclassification models process no more than 200 events. Attackers can evade\ndetection by delaying any malicious activity beyond the beginning of the file.\nWe present specialized models that can handle extremely long sequences while\nsuccessfully performing malware detection in an efficient way. We present an\nimplementation of the Convoluted Partitioning of Long Sequences approach in\norder to tackle this vulnerability and operate on long sequences. We present\nour results on a large dataset consisting of 634,249 file sequences, with\nextremely long file sequences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 02:28:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Agrawal", "Rakshit", ""], ["Stokes", "Jack W.", ""], ["Marinescu", "Mady", ""], ["Selvaraj", "Karthik", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.10812", "submitter": "David Pozo", "authors": "Irina Lukicheva, David Pozo, Alexander Kulikov", "title": "Cyberattack Detection in Intelligent Grids Using Non-linear Filtering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR math.OC stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electric power grids are evolving towards intellectualization such as Smart\nGrids or active-adaptive networks.

Recently, it has been proven that False Data\nInjection Attacks (FDIA) could corrupt results of State Estimation (SE) without\nnoticing, therefore, leading to a possible mis-operation of the whole power\nsystem. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for detecting cyberattacks\nbased on non-linear filtering by using cyber-physical information from\nKirchhoff laws. The proposed algorithm only needs data from adjacent nodes,\ntherefore can be locally and distributed implemented. Also, it requires very\nlow computational effort so that it can be run online, and it is suitable for\nimplementation in existing or new ad-hoc low-cost devices. The proposed\nalgorithm could be helpful to increase power system awareness against FDIA\ncomplementing the current SE implementations. The efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm has been proved by mathematical simulations and computer modeling in\nPSCAD software.

The use of asymmetric cryptography is not a\npractical solution for IMDs due to the scarce computational and power\nresources, symmetric key cryptography is preferred. One of the factors in\nsecurity of a symmetric cryptographic system is to use a strong key for\nencryption. A solution without using extensive resources in an IMD, is to\nextract it from the body physiological signals. To have a strong enough key,\nthe physiological signal must be a strong source of randomness and InterPulse\nInterval (IPI) has been advised to be such that. A strong randomness source\nshould have five conditions: Universality, Liveness, Robustness Permanence and\nUniqueness. Nevertheless, for current proposed random extraction methods from\nIPI these conditions (mainly last three conditions) were not examined. In this\nstudy, firstly, we proposed a methodology to measure the last three conditions.\nThen, using a huge dataset of IPI values, we showed that IPI does not have\nconditions of Robustness and Permanence. Thus, extraction of a strong uniform\nrandom number from IPI value, mathematically, is impossible. Thirdly, rather\nthan using the value of IPI, we proposed the trend of IPI as a source for a new\nrandomness extraction method named as Martingale Randomness Extraction from IPI\n(MRE-IPI). MRE-IPI satisfies the Robustness condition completely and Permanence\nto some level. We, also, used randomness test suites and showed that MRE-IPI is\nable to outperform all recent randomness extraction methods from IPIs and its\nquality is half of the AES random number.
