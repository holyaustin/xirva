The expected cost of the test\nfor binary fields is a single point-halving on an associated elliptic curve,\nwhile for ternary fields the expected cost is one half of a point-thirding on\nan associated elliptic curve. For binary fields of practical interest, this\nrepresents an O(n) speedup over the previous fastest test.

Unfortunately, recent\nresearch has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk\nmounted by a running machine\\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the\ncold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using\nstate-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an\nattacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is\napplicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily\nsupposed to defend: an adversary with physical access. To our knowledge, no\neffective software-based countermeasure to this attack supporting multiple\nencryption keys has yet been articulated in the literature. Moreover, since no\nproposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all\ngeneral-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present\nLoop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel\ntechnique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer\ntheoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack,\nverify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present\nmeasurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is\nlimited to a slowdown of approximately 2x.
