Most often,\nmobile devices obtain their own location with the help of Global Navigation\nSatellite Systems (GNSS), integrating, for example, a Global Positioning System\n(GPS) receiver. Nonetheless, an adversary can compromise location-aware\napplications by attacking the GNSS-based positioning: It can forge navigation\nmessages and mislead the receiver into calculating a fake location. In this\npaper, we analyze this vulnerability and propose and evaluate the effectiveness\nof countermeasures. First, we consider replay attacks, which can be effective\neven in the presence of future cryptographic GNSS protection mechanisms. Then,\nwe propose and analyze methods that allow GNSS receivers to detect the\nreception of signals generated by an adversary, and then reject fake locations\ncalculated because of the attack. We consider three diverse defense mechanisms,\nall based on knowledge, in particular, own location, time, and Doppler shift,\nreceivers can obtain prior to the onset of an attack. We find that inertial\nmechanisms that estimate location can be defeated relatively easy. This is\nequally true for the mechanism that relies on clock readings from off-the-shelf\ndevices; as a result, highly stable clocks could be needed. On the other hand,\nour Doppler Shift Test can be effective without any specialized hardware, and\nit can be applied to existing devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 22:13:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Papadimitratos", "P.", ""], ["Jovanovic", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0054", "submitter": "Thomas Meyer Mr", "authors": "Thomas Kellam Meyer", "title": "Cryptographic Implications for Artificially Mediated Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  There is currently an intersection in the research of game theory and\ncryptography. Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.\nFirst there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose\nof this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the\napplication of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of\nnon-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.\nThese equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The\nprimary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator\nwithin the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is\nthe role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles\nto all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately\nprovides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds\nprivately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a\nmultitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling\nthese sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,\nif these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational\nto construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine\nwould need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player\nand itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input\nor strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme.

The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for\nAlice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in\nterms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security\nis measured in terms of Eve's equivocation ratio. Wyner showed that the\nsituation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy\ncapacity, which has the following meaning: for all $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist\ncoding schemes of rate $R \\ge C_s - \\epsilon$ that asymptotically achieve both\nthe reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result\nis based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a\nconsiderable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct\ncoding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an\nerasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.\n  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of\nsymmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and\ndecoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme\nthat achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our\nconstruction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long\nas both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with\nrespect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to\nprovide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating\nat a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot\nguarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main\nchannel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in\npractice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2010 05:30:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Apr 2011 00:48:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Mahdavifar", "Hessam", ""], ["Vardy", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0278", "submitter": "Xi Li", "authors": "Xi Li", "title": "How to retrieve priced data", "comments": "10 pages, 0 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Databases are an indispensable resource for retrieving up-to-date\ninformation.

In this work, we attempt to\nquantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key\ncharacteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the\nnumber of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree.\nSpecifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential\ngrowth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We\nanalytically and empirically find that the number of children has\nasymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on\naverage half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98%\nof infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of\ninfected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the\ngeneration follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length\nof the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with\nthe total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection\nstructure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the\nabove observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply\nour findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential\ncountermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer\ndiscovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that\ntargeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of\nchildren is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows\nthat when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots.\nHowever, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of\nchildren to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed\nof worm infection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jan 2010 03:27:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 Jul 2010 05:51:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qian", ""], ["Chen", "Zesheng", ""], ["Chen", "Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.1197", "submitter": "Ryutaroh Matsumoto", "authors": "Masahito Hayashi and Ryutaroh Matsumoto", "title": "Construction of wiretap codes from ordinary channel codes", "comments": "5 pages, no figure, IEEEtran.cls.

We posited that popular email clients are deficient in the\nprovision of effective mechanisms that can aid users in identifying fraud mails\nand protect them against phishing attacks. We demonstrate, using state of the\nart techniques, how users can detect and avoid fraudulent emails and conclude\nby making appropriate recommendations based on our findings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2010 19:49:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Longe", "O.
