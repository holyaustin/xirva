Message Inspection, is a technique that\ndelimits the branching of the state space due to the intruder model without\nexcluding possible attacks. In a preliminary simulation, the intruder model\ntags the eavesdropped messages with specific metadata that enable validation of\nfeasibility of possible attack actions. The Message Inspection algorithm then\ndecides based on these metadata, which attacks will certainly fail according to\nknown security principles. Thus, it is a priori known that i.e. an encryption\nscheme attack cannot succeed if the intruder does not posses the right key in\nhis knowledge.

In these relatively\nsimpler applications of cryptography, asymmetric cryptography is difficult to\njustify on account of the computational and implementation complexities\nassociated with asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric schemes make use of a single\nshared key known only between the two communicating hosts. This shared key is\nused both for the encryption as well as the decryption of data. This key has to\nbe small in size besides being a subset of a potentially large keyspace making\nit convenient for the communicating hosts while at the same time making\ncryptanalysis difficult for the potential attackers. In the present work, an\nabstract Rossler nonlinear dynamical machine has been described first. The\nRossler system exhibits chaotic dynamics for certain values of system\nparameters and initial conditions. The chaotic dynamics of the Rossler system\nwith its apparently erratic and irregular characteristics and extreme\nsensitivity to the initial conditions has been used for the design of the\ncryptographic key in an attempt to increase the confusion and the challenge for\nthe potential attackers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 08:42:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Pandey", "Sunil", ""], ["Kaushik", "Praveen", ""], ["Shrivastava", "Dr. S.

In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret\nsharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.\nWe do so with two main contributions.\n  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access\nwhich information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct\ngraphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph\ntheory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to\npresent new secret sharing protocols.\n  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,\ni.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to\ninclude vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence\nconsidered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits\nin terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns\nto secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is\nbelieved also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based\nschemes, for example in constructing fault tolerant MBQC schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2009 15:25:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 00:06:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kashefi", "Elham", ""], ["Markham", "Damian", ""], ["Mhalla", "Mehdi", ""], ["Perdrix", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4516", "submitter": "Jos\\'e I.

In this paper, we provide a new\nprovably-secure, private-key steganographic encryption protocol secure in the\nframework of Hopper et al. We first present a \"one-time stegosystem\" that\nallows two parties to transmit messages of length at most that of the shared\nkey with information-theoretic security guarantees. The employment of a\npseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of longer messages in\nthe same way that such a generator allows the use of one-time pad encryption\nfor messages longer than the key in symmetric encryption. The advantage of our\nconstruction, compared to all previous work is randomness efficiency: in the\ninformation theoretic setting our protocol embeds a message of length n bits\nusing a shared secret key of length (1+o(1))n bits while achieving security\n2^{-n/log^{O(1)}n}; simply put this gives a rate of key over message that is 1\nas n tends to infinity (the previous best result achieved a constant rate\ngreater than 1 regardless of the security offered). In this sense, our protocol\nis the first truly randomness efficient steganographic system. Furthermore, in\nour protocol, we can permit a portion of the shared secret key to be public\nwhile retaining precisely n private key bits. In this setting, by separating\nthe public and the private randomness of the shared key, we achieve security of\n2^{-n}. Our result comes as an effect of the application of randomness\nextractors to stegosystem design. To the best of our knowledge this is the\nfirst time extractors have been applied in steganography.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2009 23:47:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 17:43:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kiayias", "Aggelos", ""], ["Russell", "Alexander", ""], ["Shashidhar", "Narasimha", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4860", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Y.
