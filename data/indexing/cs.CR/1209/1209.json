With\nthese two methods in place, the XML-AD framework makes it possible to utilize\ngeneral learning algorithms for anomaly detection. Central to the functioning\nof the framework is a novel multi-univariate anomaly detection algorithm,\nADIFA. The framework was evaluated on four XML transactions datasets, captured\nfrom real information systems, in which it achieved over 89% true positive\ndetection rate with less than a 0.2% false positive rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Sep 2012 13:02:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2012 05:48:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 13:19:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Menahem", "Eitan", ""], ["Schclar", "Alon", ""], ["Rokach", "Lior", ""], ["Elovici", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1803", "submitter": "Jaydip Sen", "authors": "Jaydip Sen", "title": "Secure and Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocols for Wireless Mesh\n  Networks", "comments": "32 pages, 10 figures.

As WMNs become an increasingly popular\nreplacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking,\ncommunity and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and\nsecure communication protocols for these networks. However, several\nvulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security\nloopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The\nabsence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more\nchallenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the\nintermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security\nvulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in\nnature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users\nof the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and\nreplay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network\nresources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes\nthat are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node\ndropping packets which it was supposed to forward. This chapter presents a\ncomprehensive discussion on the current authentication and privacy protection\nschemes for WMN. In addition, it proposes a novel security protocol for node\nauthentication and message confidentiality and an anonymization scheme for\nprivacy protection of users in WMNs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Sep 2012 14:33:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1949", "submitter": "Mehdi Khalili", "authors": "Atefeh Elahian, Mehdi Khalili, Shahriar Baradaran Shokouhi", "title": "Improved Robust DWT-Watermarking in YCbCr Color Space", "comments": "5 Pages, 4 Figures, 3 Tables", "journal-ref": "Global journal of Computer Application and Technology (GJCAT),\n  Vol.1, No.3, 2011, Pages 300-304", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.MM cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Digital watermarking is an effective way to protect copyright.

It includes processes that synchronize to exchange data\nwith each other along with executing certain delays between these\nsynchronizations. In existing Tiny Two Way Buffer System, both generators\nproduce packets in half duplex manner in no time, deterministic time, and non\ndeterministic time. Analysis of the model for above time options leads the\nmodel in deadlock. The model can be out of the deadlock if timings in the model\nis incorporated in alternative fashion. The generators produce packets after a\ndelay of 10 seconds. However, generator one has an initial shift of 5 seconds\nafter which it begins sending a packet every 10 seconds. Hence, initial delay\nfor generator one is 15 seconds and for generator two it is 10 seconds. Due to\nthis initial shift, both generators produce packets alternatively and is\ndeadlock free as the packets do not meet at the same time instant. Moreover,\nthe existing system model is not concurrent and hence takes more time for\npacket transfer in every iteration. In this paper we have proposed a model of\nbuffer system using an additional dummy buffer for transfer of data packets, we\nthus checking the model with various time models as no time, deterministic time\nand non deterministic time.

It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be\nintroduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can\nexecute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS)\nterminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for\neach transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered that some EMV\nimplementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to\nsupply this number. This exposes them to a \"pre-play\" attack which is\nindistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available\nto the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to\nclone a card physically (in the sense of extracting the key material and\nloading it into another card). Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV\nwas supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a\nsurvey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence\nfrom ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of\nproof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest\nmanufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of\nfrauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards\ncannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be\nmistaken or complicit.

This paper investigates two aspects of the problem of\nmemoryless near-collisions. Firstly, we give a full treatment of the trade-off\nbetween the number of truncated bits and the success-probability of the\ntruncation based approach. Secondly, we demonstrate the limits of cycle-finding\nmethods for finding near-collisions by showing that, opposed to the collision\ncase, a memoryless variant cannot match the query-complexity of the\n\"memory-full\" birthday-like near-collision finding method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2012 14:26:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2012 07:06:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lamberger", "Mario", ""], ["Teufl", "Elmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4621", "submitter": "Krishnama Raju Kanchu", "authors": "Krishnama Raju Kanchu and Subhash Kak", "title": "Goldbach Circles and Balloons and Their Cross Correlation", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Goldbach partitions can be used in creation of ellipses and circles on the\nnumber line.

Resistance against illegal tracking,\ncloning, timing, and replay attacks are necessary for a secure RFID\nauthentication scheme.

With an objective to design a secure and\nlow-cost RFID authentication protocol, Gene Tsudik proposed a timestamp-based\nprotocol using symmetric keys, named YA-TRAP*. Although YA-TRAP* achieves its\ntarget security properties, it is susceptible to timing attacks, where the\ntimestamp to be sent by the reader to the tag can be freely selected by an\nadversary.

The viability of SLA as another performance metric is\nalso investigated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 16:12:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tanha", "Maryam", ""], ["Hashima", "Fazirulhisyam", ""], ["Shamalab", "S.", ""], ["Samsudin", "Khairulmizam", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6337", "submitter": "Mohammad Eftekhari", "authors": "Mohammad Eftekhari (LAMFA), Herish Abdullah", "title": "Cryptanalysis and Improvements on Some Graph-based Authentication\n  Schemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "cryptanalysis and improvements on some graph-based authentication\n  schemes (2012) 7", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In 2010, Grigoriev and Shpilrain, introduced some graph-based authentication\nschemes.
