We also show a complexity\ntheoretic gap with non-interference by proving that, for loop-free boolean\nprograms whose non-interference is coNP-complete, the comparison problem is\n#P-hard for all of the definitions.\n  For positive results, we show that universally quantifying the distribution\nin the comparison problem, that is, comparing two programs according to the\nentropy based definitions on which has the larger flow for all distributions,\nis a 2-safety problem in general and is coNP-complete when restricted for\nloop-free boolean programs. We prove this by showing that the problem is\nequivalent to a simple relation naturally expressing the fact that one program\nis more secure than the other.

No secret is revealed with fewer than k\nshares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality\nof the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original\nsecret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is\nprinted on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment\nor the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that\nin the original secret, could be troublesome.

[4] has noticed this\nalignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may\nstill be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the\nhorizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to\nconstruct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks\nfor the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of\nredundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme\nthat allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and\nvertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the\nreconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a\nshift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the\ntraditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very\nlittle shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method\ninvolves a larger pixel expansion.

There are simple solutions for\nthis (e.g. Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and its improvement by\nBoyarsky (CCS 1999)). In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of\nprotocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to\ncryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\\em\nquickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,\none should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary\nattack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key\nexchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high\nentropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer\nfrom this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.\nHowever, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only\nconsider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study\nefficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new\nthreat.

With the rapid growth in hardware, software and\nnetworking technology there is outstanding growth in the amount data\ncollection. Organizations collect huge volumes of data from heterogeneous\ndatabases which also contain sensitive and private information about and\nindividual .The data mining extracts novel patterns from such data which can be\nused in various domains for decision making .The problem with data mining\noutput is that it also reveals some information, which are considered to be\nprivate and personal. Easy access to such personal data poses a threat to\nindividual privacy. There has been growing concern about the chance of misusing\npersonal information behind the scene without the knowledge of actual data\nowner. Privacy is becoming an increasingly important issue in many data mining\napplications in distributed environment. Privacy preserving data mining\ntechnique gives new direction to solve this problem. PPDM gives valid data\nmining results without learning the underlying data values .The benefits of\ndata mining can be enjoyed, without compromising the privacy of concerned\nindividuals. The original data is modified or a process is used in such a way\nthat private data and private knowledge remain private even after the mining\nprocess. In this paper we have proposed a framework that allows systemic\ntransformation of original data using randomized data perturbation technique\nand the modified data is then submitted as result of client's query through\ncryptographic approach. Using this approach we can achieve confidentiality at\nclient as well as data owner sites. This model gives valid data mining results\nfor analysis purpose but the actual or true data is not revealed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 10:55:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kamakshi", "P.", ""], ["Babu", "A.
