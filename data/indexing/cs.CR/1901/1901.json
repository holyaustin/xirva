Different from the majority of the existing literature, which\nconsiders the case of replicated databases where all databases store the same\ncontent in the form of all $K$ messages, here, we consider the case of\nnon-replicated databases under a special non-replication structure where each\ndatabase stores $M$ out of $K$ messages and each message is stored across $R$\ndifferent databases. This generates an $R$-regular graph structure for the\nstorage system where the vertices of the graph are the messages and the edges\nare the databases. We derive a general upper bound for $M=2$ that depends on\nthe graph structure. We then specialize the problem to storage systems\ndescribed by two special types of graph structures: cyclic graphs and\n\\emph{fully-connected graphs}. We prove that the PIR capacity for the case of\ncyclic graphs is $\\frac{2}{K+1}$, and the PIR capacity for the case of\nfully-connected graphs is $\\min\\{\\frac{2}{K},\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. To that end, we\npropose novel achievable schemes for both graph structures that are\ncapacity-achieving. The central insight in both schemes is to introduce\ndependency in the queries submitted to databases that do not contain the\ndesired message, such that the requests can be compressed. In both cases, the\nresults show severe degradation in PIR capacity due to non-replication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 18:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Banawan", "Karim", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00240", "submitter": "Khoa Nguyen", "authors": "San Ling, Khoa Nguyen, Huaxiong Wang, Yanhong Xu", "title": "Accountable Tracing Signatures from Lattices", "comments": "CT-RSA 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Group signatures allow users of a group to sign messages anonymously in the\nname of the group, while incorporating a tracing mechanism to revoke anonymity\nand identify the signer of any message. Since its introduction by Chaum and van\nHeyst (EUROCRYPT 1991), numerous proposals have been put forward, yielding\nvarious improvements on security, efficiency and functionality. However, a\ndrawback of traditional group signatures is that the opening authority is given\ntoo much power, i.e., he can indiscriminately revoke anonymity and there is no\nmechanism to keep him accountable. To overcome this problem, Kohlweiss and\nMiers (PoPET 2015) introduced the notion of accountable tracing signatures\n(ATS) - an enhanced group signature variant in which the opening authority is\nkept accountable for his actions. Kohlweiss and Miers demonstrated a generic\nconstruction of ATS and put forward a concrete instantiation based on\nnumber-theoretic assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, no other ATS scheme\nhas been known, and the problem of instantiating ATS under post-quantum\nassumptions, e.g., lattices, remains open to date.\n  In this work, we provide the first lattice-based accountable tracing\nsignature scheme.

To bridge the gap between security and persistence,\nthis paper proposes SecPM, a Secure and Persistent Memory system, which\nconsists of a counter cache write-through (CWT) scheme and a locality-aware\ncounter write reduction (CWR) scheme. Specifically, SecPM leverages the CWT\nscheme to guarantee the crash consistency via ensuring both the data and its\ncounter are durable before the data flush completes, and leverages the CWR\nscheme to improve the system performance via exploiting the spatial locality of\ncounter storage, log and data writes. We have implemented SecPM in gem5 with\nNVMain and evaluated it using five widely-used workloads. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SecPM reduces up to half of write\nrequests and speeds up the transaction execution by 1.3-2.0 times via using the\nCWR scheme, and achieves the performance close to an un-encrypted persistent\nmemory system for large transactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2019 06:05:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zuo", "Pengfei", ""], ["Hua", "Yu", ""], ["Xie", "Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00716", "submitter": "Marmar Orooji", "authors": "Marmar Orooji, Gerald M.

These antecedents of behaviour\nchange are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review\nthe suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear\nappeals'.

To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces\noriginated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware,\ncurrently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones.\nWe tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces.\nThe results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the\npresence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the\ncurrent state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii)\ndiscriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced\nupper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level\nof assurance. The effectiveness of PiNcH has been also evaluated in the\npresence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case,\nthe adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC\nlink to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying\na remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art\nsolution confirms the superior performance of PiNcH in several scenarios. Note\nthat all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as\nopen-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality\nand viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be\nsuccessfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 10:03:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 Dec 2019 13:36:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sciancalepore", "Savio", ""], ["Ibrahim", "Omar Adel", ""], ["Oligeri", "Gabriele", ""], ["Di Pietro", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03538", "submitter": "Xiaoxuan Lou", "authors": "Xiaoxuan Lou, Fan Zhang, Zheng Leong Chua, Zhenkai Liang, Yueqiang\n  Cheng, Yajin Zhou", "title": "Understanding Rowhammer Attacks through the Lens of a Unified Reference\n  Framework", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rowhammer is a hardware-based bug that allows the attacker to modify the data\nin the memory without accessing it, just repeatedly and frequently accessing\n(or hammering) physically adjacent memory rows.

These platforms\nshare a common design: the adoption of hardware-independent intermediate\nrepresentations, a mechanism to translate architecture dependent code to this\nrepresentation, and a set of architecture independent analyses that process the\nintermediate representation. The usage of these platforms to verify software\nintroduces the need for trusting both the correctness of the translation from\nbinary code to intermediate language (called transpilation) and the correctness\nof the analyses.

To\ncompare systems whose performance is not readily commensurable (e.g., the\nelectrical grid vs. the water-distribution network, both of which are critical,\nbut which provide distinct types of services), we defined defensibility as a\ndimensionless index. After defining defensibility quantitatively, we illustrate\nhow the defensibility of a system depends on factors such as the defender and\nattacker asset valuations, the nature of the threat (whether intelligent and\nadaptive, or random), and the levels of attack and defense strengths and\nprovide analytical results that support the observations arising from the above\nillustrations.

(2) relaxes the\n\"all-or-nothing\" property to a more realistic setting, where the ciphertext is\ntransformed into a number of shares, such that the adversary can't access one\nof them. (1) asks that, unless the user's key is disclosed, noone else than the\nuser can retrieve information about the plaintext. Second, it introduces a new\ncomputationally secure encryption-then-sharing scheme, that protects the data\nin the previously defined attacker model.

It emphasizes that the\nsecurity of our scheme relies only on a simple cryptanalysis resilience\nassumption for blockciphers in public key mode: indistinguishability from\nrandom, of the sequence of diferentials of a random value.

The attacker can act\nindependently without colluding with any nodes, and succeed even if all nodes\nare honest; most of the attacks can also exhibit themselves as faults under\nperiods of asynchrony. These attacks are effective against both shard-led and\nclient-led cross-shard consensus approaches.

Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based\nsystem may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of\nmulti-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of\ndata and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not\nbe able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher\nworkload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second,\nmulti-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each\nindividual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant\nblockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data\nprivacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant\nhas an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart\ncontracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that\nminimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been\nimplemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID\nPty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of\nthe identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives,\nand quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed\narchitecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy,\nconfiguration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 05:51:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Ingo", ""], ["Lu", "Qinghua", ""], ["Tran", "An Binh", ""], ["Deshmukh", "Amit", ""], ["Gorski", "Marek", ""], ["Strazds", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.11308", "submitter": "Laltu Sardar", "authors": "Laltu Sardar and Sushmita Ruj", "title": "The Secure Link Prediction Problem", "comments": "This has been accepted for publication in Advances in Mathematics of\n  Communications (AMC) journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Link Prediction is an important and well-studied problem for social networks.\nGiven a snapshot of a graph, the link prediction problem predicts which new\ninteractions between members are most likely to occur in the near future.

Storing or sharing the personal medical data is thus often risky.\nFor example, a short DNA sequence can provide information that can not only\nidentify an individual, but also his or her relatives.

This stems from the fact that medical data, including genomic data, are\nan indispensable resource for further research and development regarding\ndisease prevention and treatment. To prevent personal medical data from being\nmisused, techniques to reliably preserve sensitive information should be\ndeveloped for real world application.

By using these so-called Open Banking APIs, third-party\ncompanies, such as FinTechs, are able to read information about and initiate\npayments from their users' bank accounts.\n  One of the most promising standards in this segment is the OpenID\nFinancial-grade API (FAPI), currently under development in an open process by\nthe OpenID Foundation and backed by large industry partners. The FAPI is a\nprofile of OAuth 2.0 designed for high-risk scenarios and aiming to be secure\nagainst very strong attackers. To achieve this level of security, the FAPI\nemploys a range of mechanisms that have been developed to harden OAuth 2.0.\n  In this paper, we perform a rigorous, systematic formal analysis of the\nsecurity of the FAPI, based on the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM) proposed by\nFett, Kuesters, and Schmitz. To this end, we first develop a precise model of\nthe FAPI in the WIM, including different profiles and combinations of security\nfeatures. We then use our model of the FAPI to precisely define central\nsecurity properties. In an attempt to prove these properties, we uncover partly\nsevere attacks, breaking authentication, authorization, and session integrity\nproperties. We develop mitigations against these attacks and finally are able\nto formally prove the security of a fixed version of the FAPI.\n  This analysis is an important contribution to the development of the FAPI\nsince it helps to define exact security properties and attacker models, and to\navoid severe security risks.\n  Of independent interest, we also uncover weaknesses in the aforementioned\nsecurity mechanisms for hardening OAuth 2.0.
