To achieve a\ngood balance therein, we design an efficient incentive mechanism to REconcile\nFC's Aggregation accuracy and individual PU's data Privacy (REAP).\nSpecifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to measure\nPUs' PPLs and quantify their impacts on FC's aggregation accuracy. Then,\nappealing to Contract Theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC's\naggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism\noffers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which\nFC can directly control PUs. It can further overcome the information asymmetry,\ni.e., the FC typically does not know each PU's precise privacy preference.

We also propose possible countermeasures to\nmitigate this threat in the expense of reduction in the accuracy (or utility)\nof the attributes shared by the users. We formulate the tradeoff between the\nprivacy and profile utility of the users as an optimization problem and show\nhow slight changes in the profiles of the users would reduce the success of the\nattack.

Majority of existing works on PIR assume the\npresence of replicated databases, each storing all the $K$ messages. In this\nwork, we consider the problem of PIR from storage constrained databases. Each\ndatabase has a storage capacity of $\\mu KL$ bits, where $K$ is the number of\nmessages, $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $\\mu \\in [1/N, 1]$ is\nthe normalized storage. In the storage constrained PIR problem, there are two\nkey design questions: a) how to store content across each database under\nstorage constraints; and b) construction of schemes that allow efficient PIR\nthrough storage constrained databases. The main contribution of this work is a\ngeneral achievable scheme for PIR from storage constrained databases for any\nvalue of storage. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, with normalized storage $\\mu=\nt/N$, where the parameter $t$ can take integer values $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots,\nN\\}$, we show that our proposed PIR scheme achieves a download cost of\n$\\left(1+ \\frac{1}{t}+ \\frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \\cdots + \\frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\\right)$.

In this work, we put forward\nAndroVault, a framework for the Android research composing of data collection,\nknowledge representation and knowledge extraction. It has started with a\nlong-running web crawler for data collection (both apps and description) since\n2013, which guarantees the timeliness of data; With static analysis and dynamic\nanalysis of the collected data, we compute a variety of attributes to\ncharacterize Android apps. After that, we employ a knowledge graph to connect\nall these apps by computing their correlation in terms of attributes; Last, we\nleverage multiple technologies such as logical inference, machine learning, and\ncorrelation analysis to extract facts (more accurate and demanding, either high\nlevel or not, data) that are beneficial for a specific research problem. With\nthe produced data of high quality, we have successfully conducted many research\nworks including malware detection, code generation, and Android testing. We\nwould like to release our data to the research community in an authenticated\nmanner, and encourage them to conduct productive research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Nov 2017 18:26:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Nov 2017 13:03:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Guozhu", ""], ["Xue", "Yinxing", ""], ["Siow", "Jing Kai", ""], ["Su", "Ting", ""], ["Narayanan", "Annamalai", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.07477", "submitter": "Emiliano De Cristofaro", "authors": "Lucky Onwuzurike, Enrico Mariconti, Panagiotis Andriotis, Emiliano De\n  Cristofaro, Gordon Ross, and Gianluca Stringhini", "title": "MaMaDroid: Detecting Android Malware by Building Markov Chains of\n  Behavioral Models (Extended Version)", "comments": "A preliminary version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of the\n  24th Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2017)\n  [arXiv:1612.04433].

Aiming to\naddress this issue, we set to detect malware from a behavioral point of view,\nmodeled as the sequence of abstracted API calls. We introduce MaMaDroid, a\nstatic-analysis based system that abstracts the API calls performed by an app\nto their class, package, or family, and builds a model from their sequences\nobtained from the call graph of an app as Markov chains. This ensures that the\nmodel is more resilient to API changes and the features set is of manageable\nsize. We evaluate MaMaDroid using a dataset of 8.5K benign and 35.5K malicious\napps collected over a period of six years, showing that it effectively detects\nmalware (with up to 0.99 F-measure) and keeps its detection capabilities for\nlong periods of time (up to 0.87 F-measure two years after training).

Senx uses symbolic execution to\nextract expressions from the source code of a target application to synthesize\npatches. To reduce the runtime overhead of patches, it uses loop cloning and\naccess range analysis to analyze loops involved in these vulnerabilities and\nelevate patches outside of loops. For vulnerabilities that span multiple\nfunctions, Senx uses expression translation to translate expressions and place\nthem in a function scope where all values are available to create the patch.\nThis enables Senx to patch vulnerabilities with complex loops and\ninterprocedural dependencies that previous semantics-based patch generation\nsystems cannot handle.\n  We have implemented a prototype using this approach.
