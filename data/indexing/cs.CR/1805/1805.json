Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on\nCPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or\ncode-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks).\nUnfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime\ndata-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics\nchecking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for\ndefending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution\nsemantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical\nexecution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the\nphysical context and program control flows), including the event identification\nand dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new\nprogram behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA).\neFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and\nincorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented\nexploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding\nevent dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by\nconducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can\nsuccessfully detect different runtime attacks.

To\nreduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches)\nfor their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to\nthe issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than\nvendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless\nand decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver\nsecurity updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network.\nHowever, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the\nnetwork, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space,\nbandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndecentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes\nreferred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency\nfor delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a\nvendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that\ndeliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart\ncontracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart\ncontract promises compensation to any distributor that provides\nproof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was\ndelivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution\nby exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge\nContingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the\nneed for trust between the security update distributor and the security\nconsumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly\nincrease the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2018 09:02:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Leiba", "Oded", ""], ["Yitzchak", "Yechiav", ""], ["Bitton", "Ron", ""], ["Nadler", "Asaf", ""], ["Shabtai", "Asaf", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.04494", "submitter": "Carmela Troncoso", "authors": "Rebekah Overdorf, Carmela Troncoso, Rachel Greenstadt, Damon McCoy", "title": "Under the Underground: Predicting Private Interactions in Underground\n  Forums", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Underground forums where users discuss, buy, and sell illicit services and\ngoods facilitate a better understanding of the economy and organization of\ncybercriminals.

Our attack\nleverages the widely adopted user-blocking mechanism, abusing its inherent\nproperty that certain pages return different web content depending on whether a\nuser is blocked from another user. Our key insight is that an account prepared\nby an attacker can hold an attacker-controllable binary state of\nblocking/non-blocking with respect to an arbitrary user on the same service;\nprovided that the user is logged in to the service, this state can be retrieved\nas one-bit data through the conventional cross-site timing attack when a user\nvisits the attacker's website. We generalize and refer to such a property as\nvisibility control, which we consider as the fundamental assumption of our\nattack. Building on this primitive, we show that an attacker with a set of\ncontrolled accounts can gain a complete and flexible control over the data\nleaked through the side channel. Using this mechanism, we show that it is\npossible to design and implement a robust, large-scale user identification\nattack on a wide variety of social web services. To verify the feasibility of\nour attack, we perform an extensive empirical study using 16 popular social web\nservices and demonstrate that at least 12 of these are vulnerable to our\nattack.

Due to its superior\nperformance, DL-based models have a wide range of application in many areas,\nsome of which are extremely safety-critical, e.g. intelligent surveillance and\nautonomous driving. Due to the latency and privacy problem of cloud computing,\nembedded accelerators are popular in these safety-critical areas. However, the\nrobustness of the embedded DL system might be harmed by inserting\nhardware/software Trojans into the accelerator and the neural network model,\nsince the accelerator and deploy tool (or neural network model) are usually\nprovided by third-party companies. Fortunately, inserting hardware Trojans can\nonly achieve inflexible attack, which means that hardware Trojans can easily\nbreak down the whole system or exchange two outputs, but can't make CNN\nrecognize unknown pictures as targets. Though inserting software Trojans has\nmore freedom of attack, it often requires tampering input images, which is not\neasy for attackers. So, in this paper, we propose a hardware-software\ncollaborative attack framework to inject hidden neural network Trojans, which\nworks as a back-door without requiring manipulating input images and is\nflexible for different scenarios. We test our attack framework for image\nclassification and face recognition tasks, and get attack success rate of 92.6%\nand 100% on CIFAR10 and YouTube Faces, respectively, while keeping almost the\nsame accuracy as the unattacked model in the normal mode.

We are the first to exploit this system and have identified various\nattacks that can fully control all the cameras from the manufacturer. Our\nreal-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered attacks\nand raise the alarms again for the IoT manufacturers. Third, such\nvulnerabilities found in the exploit of Edimax cameras and our previous exploit\nof Edimax smartplugs can lead to another wave of Mirai attacks, which can be\neither botnets or worm attacks. To systematically understand the damage of the\nMirai malware, we model propagation of the Mirai and use the simulations to\nvalidate the modeling. The work in this paper raises the alarm again for the\nIoT device manufacturers to better secure their products in order to prevent\nmalware attacks like Mirai.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2018 15:36:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Zhen", ""], ["Liu", "Kaizheng", ""], ["Xu", "Yiling", ""], ["Gao", "Chao", ""], ["Jin", "Yier", ""], ["Zou", "Cliff", ""], ["Fu", "Xinwen", ""], ["Zhao", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.05887", "submitter": "Julian Sch\\\"utte", "authors": "Julian Sch\\\"utte, Gerd Stefan Brost", "title": "LUCON: Data Flow Control for Message-Based IoT Systems", "comments": "data flow control, information flow control, trustcom, 11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Today's emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios are\ncharacterized by the exchange of data between services across enterprises.\nTraditional access and usage control mechanisms are only able to determine if\ndata may be used by a subject, but lack an understanding of how it may be used.\nThe ability to control the way how data is processed is however crucial for\nenterprises to guarantee (and provide evidence of) compliant processing of\ncritical data, as well as for users who need to control if their private data\nmay be analyzed or linked with additional information - a major concern in IoT\napplications processing personal information.

Although the entropy extractor can be lightweight,\nthe overhead of the secure sketch responsible correcting naturally noisy PUF\nresponses is usually costly. We observe that, in general, response\nunreliability with respect to a enrolled reference measurement increases with\nincreasing differences between the in-the-field PUF operating condition and the\noperating condition used in evaluating the enrolled reference response.

Overall, MRR greatly reduces the demand for the expected\nnumber of erroneous bits for correction and, subsequently, achieve a\nsignificant reduction in the error correction overhead.

To remedy this problem, it has been\nsuggested to combine blockchains with trusted execution environments (TEEs),\nsuch as Intel SGX, for executing applications that demand privacy. Untrusted\nblockchain nodes cannot get access to the data and computations inside the TEE.\n  This paper first explores some pitfalls that arise from the combination of\nTEEs with blockchains. Since TEEs are, in principle, stateless they are\nsusceptible to rollback attacks, which should be prevented to maintain privacy\nfor the application. However, in blockchains with non-final consensus\nprotocols, such as the proof-of-work in Ethereum and others, the contract\nexecution must handle rollbacks by design. This implies that TEEs for securing\nblockchain execution cannot be directly used for such blockchains; this\napproach works only when the consensus decisions are final.\n  Second, this work introduces an architecture and a prototype for\nsmart-contract execution within Intel SGX technology for Hyperledger Fabric, a\nprominent platform for enterprise blockchain applications.

To this end,\nthis work first considers an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) UWA channel,\nand proposes a novel, multiple-features based, two-step method at the sink node\nto thwart the potential impersonation attack by Eve. Specifically, the sink\nnode exploits the noisy estimates of the distance, the angle of arrival, and\nthe location of the transmit node as device fingerprints to carry out a number\nof binary hypothesis tests (for impersonation detection) as well as a number of\nmaximum likelihood hypothesis tests (for transmitter identification when no\nimpersonation is detected).

This study supplies an initial description of user accu- racy in\nperforming this authentication behavior with PIN and pattern passcodes, with\nvarying lengths and visual characteristics. Additionally, we inquire if\ntactile-only feedback can provide assistive spatialization, finding that\norientation cues prior to unlocking do not help. Measure- ments of edit\ndistance and dynamic time warping accuracy were collected, using a\nwithin-group, randomized study of 26 participants. 1,021 passcode entry\ngestures were collected and classified, identifying six user strategies for\nusing the pre-entry tactile feedback, and ten codes for types of events and\nerrors that occurred during entry. We found that users who focused on orienting\nthemselves to position the first digit of the passcode using the tactile\nfeedback performed better in the task. These results could be applied to better\ndefine eyes-free behavior in further research, and to design better and more\nsecure methods for eyes-free authentication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 16:20:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wolf", "Flynn", ""], ["Aviv", "Adam J.", ""], ["Kuber", "Ravi", ""]]}]
