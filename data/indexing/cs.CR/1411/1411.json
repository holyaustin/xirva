When highly sensitive data is involved, an\norganization may resort to air-gap isolation, in which there is no networking\nconnection between the inner network and the external world. While infiltrating\nan air-gapped network has been proven feasible in recent years (e.g., Stuxnet),\ndata exfiltration from an air-gapped network is still considered to be one of\nthe most challenging phases of an advanced cyber-attack. In this paper we\npresent \"AirHopper\", a bifurcated malware that bridges the air-gap between an\nisolated network and nearby infected mobile phones using FM signals. While it\nis known that software can intentionally create radio emissions from a video\ndisplay unit, this is the first time that mobile phones are considered in an\nattack model as the intended receivers of maliciously crafted radio signals. We\nexamine the attack model and its limitations, and discuss implementation\nconsiderations such as stealth and modulation methods. Finally, we evaluate\nAirHopper and demonstrate how textual and binary data can be exfiltrated from\nphysically isolated computer to mobile phones at a distance of 1-7 meters, with\neffective bandwidth of 13-60 Bps (Bytes per second).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Nov 2014 10:20:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Guri", "Mordechai", ""], ["Kedma", "Gabi", ""], ["Kachlon", "Assaf", ""], ["Elovici", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.0654", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Gustavo Gonzalez-Granadillo (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom\n  SudParis, France), Christophe Ponchel (Cassidian CyberSecurity, France),\n  Gregory Blanc (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom SudParis, France),\n  Herv\\'e Debar (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom SudParis, France)", "title": "Combining Technical and Financial Impacts for Countermeasure Selection", "comments": "In Proceedings AIDP 2014, arXiv:1410.3226", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 165, 2014, pp. 1-14", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.165.1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Research in information security has generally focused on providing a\ncomprehensive interpretation of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks, in\nparticular to evaluate their danger and prioritize responses accordingly.

When the training dataset consists of private information, it\nis natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has\nbeen the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni\n2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss\nfunction and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value\nof the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error\nbounds are fairly well understood \\cite{BassilyST14}.

Password authentication is one of the widely\nused methods to achieve authentication for legal users and defense against\nintruders. There have been many password cracking methods developed during the\npast years, and people have been designing the countermeasures against password\ncracking all the time. However, we find that the survey work on the password\ncracking research has not been done very much. This paper is mainly to give a\nbrief review of the password cracking methods, import technologies of password\ncracking, and the countermeasures against password cracking that are usually\ndesigned at two stages including the password design stage (e.g. user\neducation, dynamic password, use of tokens, computer generations) and after the\ndesign (e.g. reactive password checking, proactive password checking, password\nencryption, access control). The main objective of this work is offering the\nabecedarian IT security professionals and the common audiences with some\nknowledge about the computer security and password cracking, and promoting the\ndevelopment of this area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 10:30:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:30:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Aaron L. -F.", ""], ["Wong", "Derek F.", ""], ["Chao", "Lidia S.", ""]]}]
