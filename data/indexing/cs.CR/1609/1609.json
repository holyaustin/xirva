Although it brings the benefits such as functionality\nreuse and data sharing, a threat called component hijacking is also introduced.\nBy hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate\nits privilege for originally prohibited operations. Many prior studies have\nbeen performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking\nremains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective\ndefense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on\npractically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we\nargue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from\nthe previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging\nvulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version\nthat aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in\nthe first place. To this end, we propose to embed into apps a secure component\nlibrary (SecComp), which performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of\napp components. An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find\nit is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component\nhijacking. Furthermore, we allow developers design custom policies, beyond our\nby-default generic policies, to support more fine-grained access control. We\nhave overcome challenges to implement a preliminary SecComp prototype, which\nstops component hijacking with very low performance overhead.

In Function-based Access Control (FBAC),\napplications do not give blind folded execution right and can only invoke\ncommands that have been authorized for data segments. In other words, one might\nbe authorized to use a certain command on one object, while being forbidden to\nuse exactly the same command on another object. The theoretical foundations of\nFBAC are presented along with Policy, Enforcement and Implementation (PEI)\nrequirements of it. A critical analysis of the advantages of deploying FBAC,\nhow it will result in developing a new generation of applications, and\ncompatibility with existing models and systems is also included. Finally, a\nproof of concept implementation of FBAC is presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 05:17:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Desmedt", "Yvo", ""], ["Shaghaghi", "Arash", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.04718", "submitter": "Paul Irolla", "authors": "Paul Irolla and Eric Filiol", "title": "Glassbox: Dynamic Analysis Platform for Malware Android Applications on\n  Real Devices", "comments": "11 pages, 4 figures.

The aim is to\ndesign schemes that minimise communication between the user and the servers.\nMore recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where\nthe total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be\nminimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the\ndatabase is divided into $R$-bit records with $R>1$, and the user wishes to\nretrieve one record rather than one bit.

To deal with this\nissue, several location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs) have been\nproposed in the past years. However, each of these mechanisms comes with\ndifferent configuration parameters that have a direct impact both on the\nprivacy guarantees offered to the users and on the resulting utility of the\nprotected data. In this context, it can be difficult for non-expert system\ndesigners to choose the appropriate configuration to use. Moreover, these\nmechanisms are generally configured once for all, which results in the same\nconfiguration for every protected piece of information. However, not all users\nhave the same behaviour, and even the behaviour of a single user is likely to\nchange over time. To address this issue, we present in this paper ALP, a new\nframework enabling the dynamic configuration of LPPMs. ALP can be used in two\nscenarios: (1) offline, where ALP enables a system designer to choose and\nautomatically tune the most appropriate LPPM for the protection of a given\ndataset; (2) online, where ALP enables the user of a crowd sensing application\nto protect consecutive batches of her geolocated data by automatically tuning\nan existing LPPM to fulfil a set of privacy and utility objectives. We evaluate\nALP on both scenarios with two real-life mobility datasets and two\nstate-of-the-art LPPMs. Our experiments show that the adaptive LPPM\nconfigurations found by ALP outperform both in terms of privacy and utility a\nset of static configurations manually fixed by a system designer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 13:19:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Primault", "Vincent", "", "INSA Lyon, DRIM"], ["Boutet", "Antoine", "", "DRIM, INSA Lyon"], ["Mokhtar", "Sonia Ben", "", "DRIM, INSA Lyon"], ["Brunie", "Lionel", "", "DRIM, INSA Lyon"]]}, {"id": "1609.07499", "submitter": "Joshua Brandon Holden", "authors": "Mitchell Orzech", "title": "Statistical Analysis of Binary Functional Graphs of the Discrete\n  Logarithm", "comments": "15 pages, 4 figures; Senior Thesis, Rose-Hulman Institute of\n  Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "MSTR 16-02", "categories": "cs.CR math.CO math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The increased use of cryptography to protect our personal information makes\nus want to understand the security of cryptosystems.

This paper quantifies how\nDNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We\ninvestigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks\nmore powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about\nanonymous communication.

First, we find that there\nexist adversaries who can mount DefecTor attacks: for example, Google's DNS\nresolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network. We\nalso find that DNS requests often traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP\nconnections do not transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about\nTor users' traffic.

We show that one\nvery popular VoIP software (Skype) conveys enough audio information to\nreconstruct the victim's input -- keystrokes typed on the remote keyboard. Our\nresults demonstrate that, given some knowledge on the victim's typing style and\nkeyboard model, the attacker attains top-5 accuracy of 91.7% in guessing a\nrandom key pressed by the victim.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate that S&T is robust to various VoIP issues (e.g.,\nInternet bandwidth fluctuations and presence of voice over keystrokes), thus\nconfirming feasibility of this attack. Finally, it applies to other popular\nVoIP software, such as Google Hangouts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 14:24:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Mar 2017 18:35:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Compagno", "Alberto", ""], ["Conti", "Mauro", ""], ["Lain", "Daniele", ""], ["Tsudik", "Gene", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09537", "submitter": "Alan S\\'a", "authors": "A.

Many existing\nfamilies of hash functions are universal: given two data objects, the\nprobability that they have the same hash value is low given that we pick hash\nfunctions at random. However, universality fails to ensure that all hash\nfunctions are well behaved. We further require regularity: when picking data\nobjects at random they should have a low probability of having the same hash\nvalue, for any fixed hash function. We present the efficient implementation of\na family of non-cryptographic hash functions (PM+) offering good running times,\ngood memory usage as well as distinguishing theoretical guarantees: almost\nuniversality and component-wise regularity. On a variety of platforms, our\nimplementations are comparable to the state of the art in performance. On\nrecent Intel processors, PM+ achieves a speed of 4.7 bytes per cycle for 32-bit\noutputs and 3.3 bytes per cycle for 64-bit outputs.
