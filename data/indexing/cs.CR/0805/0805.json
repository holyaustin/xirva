We first study five large data sets and observe\nconsistent clustered vulnerable-host distributions.

We\ncapture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \\emph{White-Box\nProperty (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the\nWBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a\n\\emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an\nobfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak\nsome ``useless'' non-black-box information.\n  Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an\nobfuscation (under \\emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every\nspecification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a\n\\emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply\nthat under \\emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We\nthen show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist\n(contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.\n  On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a\nnon-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain\nspecification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but\napproximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.\n  Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between\n``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2008 00:49:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Jun 2008 01:37:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Saxena", "Amitabh", ""], ["Wyseur", "Brecht", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4665", "submitter": "Avik Chaudhuri", "authors": "Avik Chaudhuri", "title": "On Secure Distributed Implementations of Dynamic Access Control", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distributed implementations of access control abound in distributed storage\nprotocols.
