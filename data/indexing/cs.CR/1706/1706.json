In the PIR problem with Byzantine\ndatabases (BPIR), a user wishes to retrieve a specific message from a set of\n$M$ messages with zero-error, irrespective of the actions performed by the\nByzantine databases. We consider the $T$-privacy constraint in this paper,\nwhere any $T$ databases can collude, and exchange the queries submitted by the\nuser. We derive the information-theoretic capacity of this problem, which is\nthe maximum number of \\emph{correct symbols} that can be retrieved privately\n(under the $T$-privacy constraint) for every symbol of the downloaded data. We\ndetermine the exact BPIR capacity to be\n$C=\\frac{N-2B}{N}\\cdot\\frac{1-\\frac{T}{N-2B}}{1-(\\frac{T}{N-2B})^M}$, if $2B+T\n< N$. This capacity expression shows that the effect of Byzantine databases on\nthe retrieval rate is equivalent to removing $2B$ databases from the system,\nwith a penalty factor of $\\frac{N-2B}{N}$, which signifies that even though the\nnumber of databases needed for PIR is effectively $N-2B$, the user still needs\nto access the entire $N$ databases.

According to the standard ORAM\ndefinition presented by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, two ORAM access sequences must\nbe computationally indistinguishable if the lengths of these sequences are\nidentically distributed. An artifact of this definition is that it does not\napply to modern ORAM implementations adapted in current secure processors\ntechnology because of their arbitrary lengths of memory access sequences\ndepending on programs' behaviors (their termination times). As a result, the\nORAM definition does not directly apply; the theoretical foundations of ORAM do\nnot clearly argue about the timing and termination channels.\n  This paper conducts a first rigorous study of the standard\nGoldreich-Ostrovsky ORAM definition in view of modern practical ORAMs (e.g.,\nPath ORAM) and demonstrates the gap between theoretical foundations and real\nimplementations. A new ORAM formulation which clearly separates out termination\nchannel leakage is proposed. It is shown how this definition implies the\nstandard ORAM definition (for finite length input access sequences) and better\nfits the modern practical ORAM implementations. The proposed definition relaxes\nthe constraints around the stash size and overflow probability for Path ORAM,\nand essentially transforms its security argument into a performance\nconsideration problem.\n  Finally, a `strong' ORAM formulation which clearly includes obfuscation of\ntermination leakage is shown to imply our new ORAM formulation and applies to\nORAM for outsourced disk storage.

In this paper, we\nhighlight our progress to date in developing the CCI.\n  The CATS project provides infrastructure for a rigorous evidence-based\nimprovement of cybersecurity education. The CCI permits comparisons of\ndifferent instructional methods by assessing how well students learned the core\nconcepts of the field (especially adversarial thinking), where instructional\nmethods refer to how material is taught (e.g., lab-based, case-studies,\ncollaborative, competitions, gaming). Specifically, the CCI is a tool that will\nenable researchers to scientifically quantify and measure the effect of their\napproaches to, and interventions in, cybersecurity education.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 21:10:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sherman", "Alan T.", ""], ["Oliva", "Linda", ""], ["DeLatte", "David", ""], ["Golaszewski", "Enis", ""], ["Neary", "Michael", ""], ["Patsourakos", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Phatak", "Dhananjay", ""], ["Scheponik", "Travis", ""], ["Herman", "Geoffrey L.", ""], ["Thompson", "Julia", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05367", "submitter": "Megumi Ando", "authors": "Megumi Ando and Anna Lysyanskaya and Eli Upfal", "title": "Practical and Provably Secure Onion Routing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an onion routing protocol, messages travel through several intermediaries\nbefore arriving at their destinations, they are wrapped in layers of encryption\n(hence they are called \"onions\").

To address these issues,\nHayes and Danezis proposed the use of guard sets, in which the Tor system\ngroups all guards into sets, and each client picks one of these sets and uses\nits guards. Unfortunately, guard sets frequently need nodes added or they are\nbroken up due to fluctuations in network bandwidth. In this paper, we first\nshow that these breakups create opportunities for malicious guards to join many\nguard sets by merely tuning the bandwidth they make available to Tor, and this\ngreatly increases the number of clients exposed to malicious guards. To address\nthis problem, we propose a new method for forming guard sets based on Internet\nlocation. We construct a hierarchy that keeps clients and guards together more\nreliably and prevents guards from easily joining arbitrary guard sets. This\napproach also has the advantage of confining an attacker with access to limited\nlocations on the Internet to a small number of guard sets. We simulate this\nguard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level\nadversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is\ngood at confining the adversary into few guard sets and thus limiting the\nimpact of attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Jun 2017 23:36:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Imani", "Mohsen", ""], ["Barton", "Armon", ""], ["Wright", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05715", "submitter": "Thomas Nyman", "authors": "Thomas Nyman, Jan-Erik Ekberg, Lucas Davi, N.

The\nmain purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a\nset of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of\n\"rational trust modeling\" is introduced by bridging trust management and game\ntheory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory\n(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been\nutilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty\nof our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust\nmodel assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are\nrational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy\nbased on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are\nincentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of\ntrust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and\nsolution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be\nbuilt-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of\nrational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will\nresult in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model\ncan incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper\nparameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish\nplayers in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).\nFurthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known\nattacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict\nbehavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 17:18:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nojoumian", "Mehrdad", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10040", "submitter": "Wataru Takase", "authors": "Wataru Takase, Tomoaki Nakamura, Yoshiyuki Watase, Takashi Sasaki", "title": "A solution for secure use of Kibana and Elasticsearch in multi-user\n  environment", "comments": "International Symposium on Grids and Clouds 2017 (ISGC 2017)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Monitoring is indispensable to check status, activities, or resource usage of\nIT services.
