This will make it infeasible to assess and compare the relevant\nresearch work which is vital for this research community. In this study, we\ntarget to develop a fully automated latent matcher for adaptive detection of\nthe region of interest and robust matching of latent prints. Unlike the\nmanually conducted matching procedure, the proposed latent matcher can run like\na sealed black box without any manual intervention. This matcher consists of\nthe following two modules: (i) the dictionary learning-based region of interest\n(ROI) segmentation scheme; and (ii) the genetic algorithm-based minutiae set\nmatching unit. Experimental results on NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database\ndemonstrates that the proposed matcher outperforms the currently public\nstate-of-art latent fingerprint matcher.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 11:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Jinwei", ""], ["Hu", "Jiankun", ""], ["Jia", "Xiuping", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.7061", "submitter": "Sanjay Sahay", "authors": "Ashu Sharma and S.K.

To generate a prime $p$ less than $x$,\nthe basic idea is to fix a constant $q\\propto x^{1-\\varepsilon}$, pick a\nuniformly random $a<q$ coprime to $q$, and choose $p$ of the form $a+t\\cdot q$,\nwhere only $t$ is updated if the primality test fails. We prove that variants\nof this approach provide prime generation algorithms requiring few random bits\nand whose output distribution is close to uniform, under less and less\nexpensive assumptions: first a relatively strong conjecture by H.L. Montgomery,\nmade precise by Friedlander and Granville; then the Extended Riemann\nHypothesis; and finally fully unconditionally using the\nBarban-Davenport-Halberstam theorem. We argue that this approach has a number\nof desirable properties compared to previous algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 06:12:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Fouque", "Pierre-Alain", ""], ["Tibouchi", "Mehdi", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.7377", "submitter": "Morteza Yousefi Kharaji", "authors": "Morteza Yousefi Kharaji, Fatemeh Salehi Rizi, Mohammad Reza\n  Khayyambashi", "title": "A New Approach for Finding Cloned Profiles in Online Social Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Today, Online Social Networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter are the\nmost popular platforms on the Internet, on which millions of users register to\nshare personal information with their friends. A large amount of data, social\nlinks and statistics about users are collected by Online Social Networks\nservices and they create big digital mines of various statistical data. Leakage\nof personal information is a significant concern for social network users.\nBesides information propagation, some new attacks on Online Social Networks\nsuch as Identity Clone attack (ICA) have been identified. ICA attempts to\ncreate a fake online identity of a victim to fool their friends into believing\nthe authenticity of the fake identity to establish social links in order to\nreap the private information of the victims friends which is not shared in\ntheir public profiles. There are some identity validation services that perform\nusers identity validation, but they are passive services and they only protect\nusers who are informed on privacy concerns and online identity issues. This\npaper starts with an explanation of two types of profile cloning attacks are\nexplained and a new approach for detecting clone identities is proposed by\ndefining profile similarity and strength of relationship measures. According to\nsimilar attributes and strength of relationship among users which are computed\nin detection steps, it will be decided which profile is clone and which one is\ngenuine by a predetermined threshold. Finally, the experimental results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 09:32:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kharaji", "Morteza Yousefi", ""], ["Rizi", "Fatemeh Salehi", ""], ["Khayyambashi", "Mohammad Reza", ""]]}]
