Agentless periodic filesystem monitors are optimal\nsolutions to protect cloud virtual machines because of the secure and\nlow-overhead features. However, most of the periodic monitors usually scan all\nof the virtual machine filesystem or protected files in every scanning poll, so\nlots of secure files are scanned again and again even though they are not\ncorrupted. In this paper, we propose a novel agentless periodic filesystem\nmonitor framework for virtual machines with different image formats to improve\nthe performance of agentless periodic monitors. Our core idea is to minimize\nthe scope of the scanning files in both file integrity checking and virus\ndetection. In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be\nscanned when it has not been modified. Since our monitor only scans the newly\ncreated and modified files, it can check fewer files than other filesystem\nmonitors. To that end, we propose two monitor methods for different types of\nvirtual machine disks to reduce the number of scanning files. For virtual\nmachine with single disk image, we hook the backend driver to capture the disk\nmodification information. For virtual machine with multiple copy-onwrite\nimages, we leverage the copy-on-write feature of QCOW2 images to achieve the\ndisk modification analysis.

Firstly, by applying sparse coding in\nthis algorithm, a behavior signature dictionary is created from the aggregated\nenergy consumption data in fog. Then, we add noise into the behavior signature\ndictionary by classical randomized response techniques and achieve the\ndifferential privacy after data re-aggregation. Through the security analysis\nwith the principle of differential privacy and experimental results\nverification, we find that our Algorithm can preserve consumer's privacy\nwith-out comprising utility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2018 00:54:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Hui", ""], ["Liu", "Shubo", ""], ["Guan", "Zhitao", ""], ["Wu", "Longfei", ""], ["Deng", "Haonan", ""], ["Du", "Xiaojiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02834", "submitter": "Yong Yu", "authors": "Yong Yu, Liang Xue, Yannan Li, Xiaojiang Du, Mohsen Guizani, and Bo\n  Yang", "title": "Assured Data Deletion with Fine-grained Access Control for Fog-based\n  Industrial Applications", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The advances of cloud computing, fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT)\nmake the industries more prosperous than ever.

Instead of focusing\non hosts and their locations, CCN emphasizes addressable named content. By\ndecoupling content from its location, CCN allows opportunistic in-network\ncontent caching, thus enabling better network utilization, at least for\nscalable content distribution. However, in order to be considered seriously,\nCCN must support basic security services, including content authenticity,\nintegrity, confidentiality, authorization and access control.

By doing so, KRB-CCN obviates the need for producers to make\nconsumer authentication and access control decisions. KRB-CCN preserves\nconsumer privacy since producers are unaware of consumer identities.

Moreover, we also conduct an\nexploitation of the ADB privilege in one app, and therefore we prove the\nexistence of vulnerabilities in ADB workaround.

While using clinical data that needs to be identifiable to\nobtain meaningful information, it is essential to ensure that data is\nde-identified and unnecessary clinical information is minimized to protect\npersonal information. This process requires criteria and an appropriate method\nas there are clear identifiers as well as quasi-identifiers that are not\nreadily identifiable. Methods; To formulate such a method, first, primary\nquasi-identifiers were selected by classifying information in 20 clinical\npersonal information database tables into Direct-Identifier (DID),\nQuasi-Identifier (QI), Sensitive Attribute (SA), and Non-Sensitive Attribute\n(NSA) according to its type. Secondary QIs were then selected by assessing the\nrisk for outliers by measuring uniqueness values of the selected data and\nscoring re-identification by calculating equivalence class of the influence on\nother data on QI removal. Third, the risk of re-identification of data users\nwas numeralized and classified. Lastly, the final QI according to user class\nwas determined by comparing the calculated re-identification scores to the\nthreshold values of user classes. Results; Eventually, final QIs ranging from a\nminimum of 18 to a maximum of 28 were selected by making an assumption about\nuser classes and using it as criteria. Conclusions; The QI selection method\npresented by the current investigators can be used by researchers at the final\ncheckup stage before they de-identify the selected QIs.

The proposed approach uses a distributed diagnosis system for\nclassifying the context at the central service provider as well as at the local\nuser site. Once a potential zero-day attack is identified, a critical data\nsharing protocol is used to transmit alert messages and reestablish the trust\nbetween the network entities and the IoT devices. The results show that the\ndistributed approach is capable of mitigating the zero-day threats efficiently\nwith 33% and 21% improvements in terms of cost of operation and communication\noverheads, respectively, in comparison with the centralized diagnosis system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2018 08:45:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Vishal", ""], ["Kim", "Jiyoon", ""], ["Kwon", "Soonhyun", ""], ["You", "Ilsun", ""], ["Lee", "Kyungroul", ""], ["Yim", "Kangbin", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.05713", "submitter": "Joshua Guttman", "authors": "Moses D.

ATM\nsystems rely on the interconnectivity of components made possible by wired\nand/or wireless networks. Unfortunately, this connectivity that supports ATM\nsystems also provides potential system access points that results in\nvulnerability to cyberattacks. This is becoming more pronounced as ATM systems\nbegin to integrate internet of things (IoT) devices. Hence, there is a need to\nrigorously evaluate ATM systems for cyberattack vulnerabilities, and explore\ndesign concepts that provide stability and graceful degradation in the face of\ncyberattacks. In this research, a prototype ATM system along with a real-time\ncyberattack monitoring system were developed for a 1.5-mile section of I-66 in\nNorthern Virginia. The monitoring system detects deviation from expected\noperation of an ATM system by comparing lane control states generated by the\nATM system with lane control states deemed most likely by the monitoring\nsystem. In case of any deviation between two sets of states, the monitoring\nsystem displays the lane control states generated by the back-up data source.\nIn a simulation experiment, the prototype ATM system and cyberattack monitoring\nsystem were subject to emulated cyberattacks. The evaluation results showed\nthat when subject to cyberattack, the mean speed reduced by 15% compared to the\ncase with the ATM system and was similar to the baseline case. This illustrates\nthat the effectiveness of the ATM system was negated by cyberattacks. The\nmonitoring system however, allowed the ATM system to revert to an expected safe\nstate and reduced the negative impact of cyberattacks. These results illustrate\nthe need to revisit ATM system design concepts as a means to protect against\ncyberattacks in addition to traditional system intrusion prevention approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2018 19:23:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Khattak", "Zulqarnain H.", ""], ["Park", "Hyungjun", ""], ["Hong", "Seongah", ""], ["Boateng", "Richard Atta", ""], ["Smith", "Brian L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.05979", "submitter": "Matt Visser", "authors": "Del Rajan (Victoria University of Wellington) and Matt Visser\n  (Victoria University of Wellington)", "title": "Quantum Blockchain using entanglement in time", "comments": "V1:5 pages; V2: now 7 pages; more discussion; more references; no\n  changes in physics conclusions", "journal-ref": "Quantum Reports 1 # 1 (2019) 3--11", "doi": "10.3390/quantum1010002", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a conceptual design for a quantum blockchain.

The situation differs\ndramatically when quantum miners use Grover's algorithm, which repeatedly\napplies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block\ngrow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a\nminer does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose\nAlice receives Bob's new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and\nmeasure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob's)\nwill become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the\nminers' actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same\ntime may lead to more forks -- which is known to be a security risk for\nBitcoin.

Experiments show that (1) our proposed methods\ndeliver bounds close to (the gap is 2-3X) exact minimum distortion found by\nReluplex in small MNIST networks while our algorithms are more than 10,000\ntimes faster; (2) our methods deliver similar quality of bounds (the gap is\nwithin 35% and usually around 10%; sometimes our bounds are even better) for\nlarger networks compared to the methods based on solving linear programming\nproblems but our algorithms are 33-14,000 times faster; (3) our method is\ncapable of solving large MNIST and CIFAR networks up to 7 layers with more than\n10,000 neurons within tens of seconds on a single CPU core.\n  In addition, we show that, in fact, there is no polynomial time algorithm\nthat can approximately find the minimum $\\ell_1$ adversarial distortion of a\nReLU network with a $0.99\\ln n$ approximation ratio unless\n$\\mathsf{NP}$=$\\mathsf{P}$, where $n$ is the number of neurons in the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2018 17:47:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 20:50:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Jun 2018 21:48:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 08:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Weng", "Tsui-Wei", ""], ["Zhang", "Huan", ""], ["Chen", "Hongge", ""], ["Song", "Zhao", ""], ["Hsieh", "Cho-Jui", ""], ["Boning", "Duane", ""], ["Dhillon", "Inderjit S.", ""], ["Daniel", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09882", "submitter": "Guillaume Jourjon", "authors": "Jathushan Rajasegaran and Suranga Seneviratne and Guillaume Jourjon", "title": "A Neural Embeddings Approach for Detecting Mobile Counterfeit Apps", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Counterfeit apps impersonate existing popular apps in attempts to misguide\nusers to install them for various reasons such as collecting personal\ninformation, spreading malware, or simply to increase their advertisement\nrevenue.

The ETPIR problem is\ncomprised of $K$ messages, $N$ servers where each server stores all $K$\nmessages, a user who wants to retrieve one of the $K$ messages without\nrevealing the desired message index to any set of $T$ colluding servers, and an\neavesdropper who can listen to the queries and answers of any $E$ servers but\nis prevented from learning any information about the messages. The information\ntheoretic capacity of ETPIR is defined to be the maximum number of desired\nmessage symbols retrieved privately per information symbol downloaded. We show\nthat the capacity of ETPIR is $C = \\left( 1- \\frac{E}{N} \\right) \\left(1 +\n\\frac{T-E}{N-E} + \\cdots + \\left( \\frac{T-E}{N-E} \\right)^{K-1} \\right)^{-1}$\nwhen $E < T$, and $C = \\left( 1 - \\frac{E}{N} \\right)$ when $E \\geq T$.

When $E < T$, the capacity equals the inverse\nof a sum of a geometric series with $K$ terms and decreases with $K$; this form\nis typical for capacity expressions of PIR.

The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider\nalso purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from\nthe potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts\nthe insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain\nservice. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we\nmodel the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the\ncyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider\nand the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then\nthe users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service.\nSpecifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a\nseries of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market\ngame.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:31:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 12 May 2019 03:14:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Shaohan", ""], ["Wang", "Wenbo", ""], ["Xiong", "Zehui", ""], ["Niyato", "Dusit", ""], ["Wang", "Ping", ""], ["Wang", "Shaun Shuxun", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10491", "submitter": "Xin Wang", "authors": "Xin Wang, Jie Cui and Lijun Ji", "title": "Linear $(2,p,p)$-AONTs do Exist", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1702.06612 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A $(t,s,v)$-all-or-nothing transform (AONT) is a bijective mapping defined on\n$s$-tuples over an alphabet of size $v$, which satisfies that if any $s-t$ of\nthe $s$ outputs are given, then the values of any $t$ inputs are completely\nundetermined.

We, first, illustrate the\neffectiveness of several key features that make the LUT-based obfuscation more\nresilient against SAT attacks and then we embed the proposed key features into\nour proposed LUT-Lock algorithm. We illustrates that LUT-Lock maximizes the\nresiliency of the LUT-based obfuscation against SAT attacks by forcing a near\nexponential increase in the execution time of a SAT solver with respect to the\nnumber of obfuscated gates. Hence, by adopting LUT-Lock algorithm, SAT attack\nexecution time could be made unreasonably long by increasing the number of\nutilized LUTs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:32:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 May 2018 16:29:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kamali", "Hadi Mardani", ""], ["Azar", "Kimia Zamiri", ""], ["Gaj", "Kris", ""], ["Homayoun", "Houman", ""], ["Sasan", "Avesta", ""]]}]
