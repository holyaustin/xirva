While\nbenefits of cloud computing are numerous, security concerns arising when data\nand computation are outsourced to a third party still hinder the complete\nmovement to the cloud. In this paper, we focus on the problem of data privacy\non the cloud, particularly on access controls over stream data. The nature of\nstream data and the complexity of sharing data make access control a more\nchallenging issue than in traditional archival databases. We present\nStreamforce - a system allowing data owners to securely outsource their data to\nthe cloud. The owner specifies fine-grained policies which are enforced by the\ncloud. The latter performs most of the heavy computations, while learning\nnothing about the data. To this end, we employ a number of encryption schemes,\nincluding deterministic encryption, proxy-based attribute based encryption and\nsliding-window encryption. In Streamforce, access control policies are modeled\nas secure continuous queries, which entails minimal changes to existing stream\nprocessing engines, and allows for easy expression of a wide-range of policies.\nIn particular, Streamforce comes with a number of secure query operators\nincluding Map, Filter, Join and Aggregate.

For example, it is\ntime-consuming for users to log in CHC [4] and there are complex text memory\nrequirements in scheme proposed by Hong [5]. With respect to the scheme\nproposed by Weinshall [6], not only is it intricate to log in, but also the\nmain claim of resisting shoulder-surfing is proven false [7]. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new graphical password scheme which provides a good resistance to\nshouldersurfing and preserves a desirable usability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 16:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Xiyang", ""], ["Ren", "Zhongjie", ""], ["Chang", "Xiuling", ""], ["Gao", "Haichang", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7485", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Liming Wang, Xiuling Chang, Zhongjie Ren, Haichang Gao, Xiyang Liu,\n  Uwe Aickelin", "title": "Against Spyware Using CAPTCHA in Graphical Password Scheme", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "The 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information\n  Networking and Applications, Perth, Australia, 760-767, 2010", "doi": "10.1109/AINA.2010.46", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Text-based password schemes have inherent security and usability problems,\nleading to the development of graphical password schemes.

However,\nwhen considering cloud computing, government entities must address a host of\nsecurity issues (such as malicious insiders) beyond those of service cost and\nflexibility. The scope and objective of this paper is to analyze, evaluate and\ninvestigate the insider threat in cloud security in sensitive infrastructures\nas well as to propose two proactive socio-technical solutions for securing\ncommercial and governmental cloud infrastructures. Firstly, it proposes\nactionable framework, techniques and practices in order to ensure that such\ndisruptions through human threats are infrequent, of minimal duration,\nmanageable, and cause the least damage possible. Secondly, it aims for extreme\nsecurity measures to analyze and evaluate human threats related assessment\nmethods for employee screening in certain high-risk situations using cognitive\nanalysis technology, in particular functional magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI). The significance of this research is also to counter human rights and\nethical dilemmas by presenting a set of ethical and professional guidelines.\nThe main objective of this work is to analyze related risks, identify\ncountermeasures and present recommendations to develop a security awareness\nculture that will allow cloud providers to utilize effectively the benefits of\nthis advanced techniques without sacrificing system security.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 16:59:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sahito", "Farhan Hyder", ""], ["Slany", "Wolfgang", ""]]}]
