The tasks of\n\"programming\" global behaviors through local constraints belong to the area of\nsecurity. The \"program particles\" that assure that a system of local\ninteractions leads towards some desired global goals are called security\nprotocols. As computation spreads beyond cyberspace, into physical and social\nspaces, new security tasks and problems arise. As networks are extended by\nphysical sensors and controllers, including the humans, and interlaced with\nsocial networks, the engineering concepts and techniques of computer security\nblend with the social processes of security. These new connectors for\ncomputational and social software require a new \"discipline of programming\" of\nglobal behaviors through local constraints. Since the new discipline seems to\nbe emerging from a combination of established models of security protocols with\nolder methods of procedural programming, we use the name procedures for these\nnew connectors, that generalize protocols. In the present paper we propose\nactor-networks as a formal model of computation in heterogenous networks of\ncomputers, humans and their devices; and we introduce Procedure Derivation\nLogic (PDL) as a framework for reasoning about security in actor-networks. On\nthe way, we survey the guiding ideas of Protocol Derivation Logic (also PDL)\nthat evolved through our work in security in last 10 years. Both formalisms are\ngeared towards graphic reasoning and tool support. We illustrate their workings\nby analysing a popular form of two-factor authentication, and a multi-channel\ndevice pairing procedure, devised for this occasion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 16:34:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:20:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""], ["Meadows", "Catherine", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0853", "submitter": "Wajeb Gharibi", "authors": "Wajeb Gharibi", "title": "Studying and Classification of the Most Significant Malicious Software", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As the cost of information processing and Internet accessibility falls, most\norganizations are becoming increasingly vulnerable to potential cyber threats\nwhich its rate has been dramatically increasing every year in recent times.

Though the practice of tricking users in order to steal passwords\nor information possibly goes back to the earliest days of computer networking,\nAOHell's phishing system was the first automated tool made publicly available\nfor this purpose. The program influenced the creation of many other automated\nphishing systems that were made over a number of years. These tools were\navailable to amateurs who used them to engage in a countless number of phishing\nattacks. By the later part of the decade, the activity moved from AOL to other\nnetworks and eventually grew to involve professional criminals on the internet.\nWhat began as a scheme by rebellious teenagers to steal passwords evolved into\none of the top computer security threats affecting people, corporations, and\ngovernments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 12:17:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Rekouche", "Koceilah", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4908", "submitter": "Tzonelih Hwang", "authors": "Jason Lin, Chun-Wei Yang, Chia-Wei Tsai, and Tzonelih Hwang", "title": "Comment on \"Semiquantum secret sharing using entangled states\"", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Li et al.

However, this\nstudy points out that a security pitfall exists in the eavesdropping check\nphase of both schemes that could mount to an Intercept-resend attack and a\nTrojan horse attack on the two schemes, respectively, to disclose the other\nagent's shadow, and further to reveal the master key of the SQSS, which\ncontradicts to the security requirement of a QSS.

The main ingredients in\nour protocol are two novel secure multi-party algorithms --- one that computes\nthe union of private subsets that each of the interacting players hold, and\nanother that tests the inclusion of an element held by one player in a subset\nheld by another.

We consider (in the framework of algorithmic\ninformation theory) questions of the following type: construct a message that\ncontains different amounts of information for recipients that have (or do not\nhave) certain a priori information. Assume, for example, that the recipient\nknows some string $a$, and we want to send her some information that allows her\nto reconstruct some string $b$ (using $a$). On the other hand, this information\nalone should not allow the eavesdropper (who does not know $a$) to reconstruct\n$b$. It is indeed possible (if the strings $a$ and $b$ are not too simple).\nThen we consider more complicated versions of this question. What if the\neavesdropper knows some string $c$? How long should be our message? We provide\nsome conditions that guarantee the existence of a polynomial-size message; we\nshow then that without these conditions this is not always possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 16:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Muchnik", "Andrej A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6242", "submitter": "Sandeep Katta", "authors": "Sandeep Katta", "title": "Visual Secret Sharing Scheme using Grayscale Images", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pixel expansion and the quality of the reconstructed secret image has been a\nmajor issue of visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes.
