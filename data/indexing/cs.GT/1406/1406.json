These good\nactions may not maximise the actor's payoff, but they maximise the other's\npayoff. Consequently, their existence is puzzling for evolutionary theories.\nWhy should you make an effort to help others, even when no reward seems to be\nat stake? Indeed, experiments typically show that humans are heterogeneous:\nsome may help others, while others may not. With the aim of favouring the\nemergence of 'successful cultures', a number of studies has recently\ninvestigated what mechanisms promote the evolution of a particular good action.\nBut still little is known about if and how good actions can spread from person\nto person. For instance, does being recipient of an altruistic act increase\nyour probability of being cooperative with others? Plato's quote, 'Good actions\ngive strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others', suggests that\nis possible. We have conducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test\nthis mechanism using economic games. We have measured willingness to be\ncooperative through a standard Prisoner's dilemma and willingness to act\naltruistically using a binary Dictator game. In the baseline treatments, the\nendowments needed to play were given by the experimenters, as usual; in the\ncontrol treatments, they came from a good action made by someone else. Across\nfour different comparisons and a total of 572 subjects, we have never found a\nsignificant increase of cooperation or altruism when the endowment came from a\ngood action.
