We present an N-player\nK-stage game with an asymmetric information structure where each robot's\nprivate information is modeled as a random variable or its type. The deception\nis persistent as each robot's private type remains unknown to other robots for\nall stages. The deception is rational as robots aim to achieve their deception\ngoals at minimum cost. Each robot forms a dynamic belief of others' types based\non intrinsic or extrinsic information. Perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium (PBNE)\nis a natural solution concept for dynamic games of incomplete information. Due\nto its requirements of sequential rationality and belief consistency, PBNE\nprovides a reliable prediction of players' actions, beliefs, and expected\ncumulative costs over the entire K stages. The contribution of this work is\nfourfold. First, we identify the PBNE computation as a nonlinear stochastic\ncontrol problem and characterize the structures of players' actions and costs\nunder PBNE. We further derive a set of extended Riccati equations with\ncognitive coupling under the linear-quadratic (LQ) setting and extrinsic belief\ndynamics. Second, we develop a receding-horizon algorithm with low temporal and\nspatial complexity to compute PBNE under intrinsic belief dynamics. Third, we\ninvestigate a deceptive pursuit-evasion game as a case study and use numerical\nexperiments to corroborate the results. Finally, we propose metrics, such as\ndeceivability, reachability, and the price of deception (PoD), to evaluate the\nstrategy design and the system performance under deception.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 21:03:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 02:02:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 01:12:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Linan", ""], ["Zhu", "Quanyan", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.00484", "submitter": "Yangguang Shi", "authors": "Yuval Emek, Shay Kutten, Ron Lavi, Yangguang Shi", "title": "Bayesian Generalized Network Design", "comments": "25 pages, 0 figure.

Fault Tolerance in Neural Networks is crucial in\nreal-time safety critical applications requiring computation for long\ndurations. Neural Networks with high regularisation exhibit superior fault\ntolerance, however, at the cost of classification accuracy. In the view of\ndifference in functionality, a Neural Network is modelled as two separate\nnetworks, i.e, the Feature Extractor with unsupervised learning objective and\nthe Classifier with a supervised learning objective. Traditional approaches of\ntraining the entire network using a single supervised learning objective is\ninsufficient to achieve the objectives of the individual components optimally.\nIn this work, a novel multi-criteria objective function, combining unsupervised\ntraining of the Feature Extractor followed by supervised tuning with Classifier\nNetwork is proposed. The unsupervised training solves two games simultaneously\nin the presence of adversary neural networks with conflicting objectives to the\nFeature Extractor. The first game minimises the loss in reconstructing the\ninput image for indistinguishability given the features from the Extractor, in\nthe presence of a generative decoder. The second game solves a minimax\nconstraint optimisation for distributional smoothening of feature space to\nmatch a prior distribution, in the presence of a Discriminator network. The\nresultant strongly regularised Feature Extractor is combined with the\nClassifier Network for supervised fine-tuning.

It is well known that a proportional allocation among $n$ agents\ncan be found efficiently via simple protocols [16]. For envy-freeness, in a\nrecent breakthrough, Aziz and Mackenzie [5] proposed a discrete and bounded\nenvy-free protocol for any number of players. However, the protocol suffers\nfrom high multiple-exponential query complexity and it remains open to find\nsimpler and more efficient envy-free protocols.\n  In this paper we consider a variation of the cake cutting problem by assuming\nan underlying graph over the agents whose edges describe their acquaintance\nrelationships, and agents evaluate their shares relatively to those of their\nneighbors. An allocation is called locally proportional if each agent thinks\nshe receives at least the average value over her neighbors. Local\nproportionality generalizes proportionality and is in an interesting middle\nground between proportionality and envy-freeness: its existence is guaranteed\nby that of an envy-free allocation, but no simple protocol is known to produce\nsuch a locally proportional allocation for general graphs. Previous works\nshowed locally proportional protocols for special classes of graphs, and it is\nlisted in both [1] and [8] as an open question to design simple locally\nproportional protocols for more general classes of graphs. In this paper we\ncompletely resolved this open question by presenting a discrete and bounded\nlocally proportional protocol for any given graphs. Our protocol has a query\ncomplexity of only single exponential, which is significantly smaller than the\nsix towers of $n$ query complexity of the envy-free protocol given in [5].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 10:05:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bei", "Xiaohui", ""], ["Sun", "Xiaoming", ""], ["Wu", "Hao", ""], ["Zhang", "Jialin", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhijie", ""], ["Zi", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.05128", "submitter": "St\\'ephane Le Roux", "authors": "St\\'ephane Le Roux", "title": "Time-aware uniformization of winning strategies", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two-player win/lose games of infinite duration are involved in several\ndisciplines including computer science and logic.

The cards are randomly\nplaced on $n$ consecutive positions on a table, and for each card, the visible\nside is also selected at random. The player sees the visible side of all cards\nand wants to select the card with the maximum hidden value.

We show that this can be done with probability at\nleast $0.45292$. In the second one, similar to the prophet inequality, the\nplayer maximizes the expectation of the selected hidden value. We show a\nguarantee of at least $0.63518$ with respect to the expected maximum hidden\nvalue.\n  Our algorithms result from combining three basic strategies.

If the values are chosen by an adaptive adversary\nit is known that the algorithm that minimizes maximum pairwise envy simply\nallocates each item uniformly at random; the maximum pairwise envy is then\nsublinear in T. If the values are independently and identically drawn from an\nadversarially chosen distribution D, it is also known that, under some mild\nconditions on D, allocating to the agent with the highest value -- a Pareto\nefficient allocation -- is envy-free with high probability.\n  In this paper we study fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in this setting and\nprovide matching upper and lower bounds under a spectrum of progressively\nstronger adversaries. On one hand we show that, even against a non-adaptive\nadversary, there is no algorithm with sublinear maximum pairwise envy that\nPareto dominates the simple algorithm that allocates each item uniformly at\nrandom. On the other hand, under a slightly weaker adversary regime where item\nvalues are drawn from a known distribution and are independent with respect to\ntime, i.e. v_{it} is independent of v_{it'} but possibly correlated with\nv_{i't}, optimal (in isolation) efficiency is compatible with optimal (in\nisolation) fairness.
