Viewing this as a multi-objective optimization problem,\nwe want information about the \"trade-off curve\" or Pareto curve for maximizing\nthe probabilities of different properties. We show that one can compute an\napproximate Pareto curve with respect to a set of \\omega -regular properties in\ntime polynomial in the size of the MDP.\n  Our quantitative upper bounds use LP methods. We also study qualitative\nmulti-objective model checking problems, and we show that these can be analysed\nby purely graph-theoretic methods, even though the strategies may still require\nboth randomization and memory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2008 16:18:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2008 23:50:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Etessami", "Kousha", ""], ["Kwiatkowska", "Marta", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""], ["Yannakakis", "Mihalis", ""]]}]
