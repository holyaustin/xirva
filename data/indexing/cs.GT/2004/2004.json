In this paper, we study the multiple-principal, multiple-agent\nproblem with non-rivalrous goods. Under the assumption that the principal's\npayoff is quasilinear in the payments given to agents, we show that there is a\nfundamental degeneracy in the market of non-rivalrous goods. Specifically, for\na general class of payment contracts, there will be an infinite set of\ngeneralized Nash equilibria. This multiplicity of equilibria also affects\ncommon refinements of equilibrium definitions intended to uniquely select an\nequilibrium: both variational equilibria and normalized equilibria will be\nnon-unique in general. This implies that most existing equilibrium concepts\ncannot provide predictions on the outcomes of data markets emerging today. The\nresults support the idea that modifications to payment contracts themselves are\nunlikely to yield a unique equilibrium, and either changes to the models of\nstudy or new equilibrium concepts will be required to determine unique\nequilibria in settings with multiple principals and a non-rivalrous good.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 02:07:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wadhwa", "Samir", ""], ["Dong", "Roy", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00603", "submitter": "Andrea Celli", "authors": "Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Gabriele Farina, Nicola Gatti", "title": "No-Regret Learning Dynamics for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The existence of simple, uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to\ncorrelated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory\nof multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years\nthat when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated\nnormal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form\ncorrelated equilibrium. Extensive-form (that is, tree-form) games generalize\nnormal-form games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well\nas private information. Because of the sequential nature and presence of\npartial information in the game, extensive-form correlation has significantly\ndifferent properties than the normal-form counterpart, many of which are still\nopen research directions. Extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) has been\nproposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart to normal-form correlated\nequilibrium. However, it was currently unknown whether EFCE emerges as the\nresult of uncoupled agent dynamics. In this paper, we give the first uncoupled\nno-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in $n$-player general-sum\nextensive-form games with perfect recall. First, we introduce a notion of\ntrigger regret in extensive-form games, which extends that of internal regret\nin normal-form games. When each player has low trigger regret, the empirical\nfrequency of play is close to an EFCE. Then, we give an efficient\nno-trigger-regret algorithm. Our algorithm decomposes trigger regret into local\nsubproblems at each decision point for the player, and constructs a global\nstrategy of the player from the local solutions at each decision point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 17:39:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 08:54:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2020 16:00:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 09:32:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Celli", "Andrea", ""], ["Marchesi", "Alberto", ""], ["Farina", "Gabriele", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00669", "submitter": "Simone Tonin Dr", "authors": "Monica Anna Giovanniello and Simone Tonin", "title": "A Note on the Provision of a Public Service of Different Quality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN cs.GT q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study how the quality dimension affects the social optimum in a model of\nspatial differentiation where two facilities provide a public service.

We characterize analytically\nrisk-neutral and risk-averse equilibrium in terms of existence and uniqueness ,\nrelying on Generalized Nash Equilibrium and Variational Equilibrium as solution\nconcepts. To hedge their risk towards uncertainty and complete the market,\nprosumers can trade financial contracts. We provide closed form\ncharacterisations of the risk-adjusted probabilities under different market\nregimes and a distributed algorithm for risk trading mechanism relying on the\nGeneralized potential game structure of the problem. The impact of risk\nheterogeneity and financial contracts on the prosumers' expected costs are\nanalysed numerically in a three node network and the IEEE 14-bus network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2020 08:20:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Shilov", "Ilia", "", "DYOGENE"], ["Cadre", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Le", "", "DYOGENE"], ["Busic", "Ana", "", "DYOGENE"]]}, {"id": "2004.02554", "submitter": "Haris Aziz", "authors": "Haris Aziz", "title": "Simultaneously Achieving Ex-ante and Ex-post Fairness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an ex-ante envy-free\nlottery over envy-free up to one item (EF1) deterministic allocations.

In this setting, a single supplier allocates\ncapacity-limited resources to requests that arrive in a sequential and\narbitrary manner. Each request is associated with an agent who may act\nselfishly to misreport the requirement and valuation of her request. The\nsupplier charges payment from agents whose requests are satisfied, but incurs a\nload-dependent supply cost. The goal is to design an incentive compatible\nonline mechanism, which determines not only the resource allocation of each\nrequest, but also the payment of each agent, so as to (approximately) maximize\nthe social welfare (i.e., aggregate valuations minus supply cost). We study\nthis problem under the framework of competitive analysis. The major\ncontribution of this paper is the development of a unified approach that\nachieves the best-possible competitive ratios for setups with different supply\ncosts. Specifically, we show that when there is no supply cost or the supply\ncost function is linear, our model is essentially a standard 0-1 knapsack\nproblem, for which our approach achieves logarithmic competitive ratios that\nmatch the state-of-the-art (which is optimal). For the more challenging setup\nwhen the supply cost is strictly-convex, we provide online mechanisms, for the\nfirst time, that lead to the optimal competitive ratios as well.

Current clinical\npractice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although\nthat may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its\ninteraction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled.\n(Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a\ntarget is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally\ninvasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and\nneedle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often\nbe computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed\ngames to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in\ntissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which\nabstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears\nto be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the\nmodel, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise\nmotion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those\nstrategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable\nbehavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to\nimplement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the\nreal system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle\ntip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We\nhave implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a\nflexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in\nmedical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments\nshow that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle\nmotions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 04:24:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Rogalla", "Antje", "", "TUHH"], ["Lehmann", "Sascha", "", "TUHH"], ["Neidhardt", "Maximilian", "", "TUHH"], ["Sprenger", "Johanna", "", "TUHH"], ["Bengs", "Marcel", "", "TUHH"], ["Schlaefer", "Alexander", "", "TUHH"], ["Schupp", "Sibylle", "", "TUHH"]]}, {"id": "2004.13397", "submitter": "Ayumi Igarashi", "authors": "Hadi Hosseini and Ayumi Igarashi and Andrew Searns", "title": "Fair Division of Time: Multi-layered Cake Cutting", "comments": "Extended version of accepted IJCAI-20 paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We initiate the study of multi-layered cake cutting with the goal of fairly\nallocating multiple divisible resources (layers of a cake) among a set of\nagents.
