Our characterization is based on a closed-form\nsolution we derive for the dynamics, while our results also reveal several\nsurprising properties. Indeed, our main algorithmic contribution is founded on\na geometric feature of OGDA we discovered; namely, the limit points of the\ndynamics are the orthogonal projection of the initial state to the space of\nattractors.\n  Motivated by this property, we show that the equilibria for a natural class\nof \\emph{constrained} bilinear games are the intersection of the unconstrained\nstationary points with the corresponding probability simplexes. Thus, we employ\nOGDA to implement an Alternating Projections procedure, converging to an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium in\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log^2(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations.

If agents\nare drawing their data from different distributions, though, federated learning\nmight produce a biased global model that is not optimal for each agent. This\nmeans that agents face a fundamental question: should they choose the global\nmodel or their local model? We show how this situation can be naturally\nanalyzed through the framework of coalitional game theory.\n  We propose the following game: there are heterogeneous players with different\nmodel parameters governing their data distribution and different amounts of\ndata they have noisily drawn from their own distribution. Each player's goal is\nto obtain a model with minimal expected mean squared error (MSE) on their own\ndistribution. They have a choice of fitting a model based solely on their own\ndata, or combining their learned parameters with those of some subset of the\nother players. Combining models reduces the variance component of their error\nthrough access to more data, but increases the bias because of the\nheterogeneity of distributions.\n  Here, we derive exact expected MSE values for problems in linear regression\nand mean estimation. We then analyze the resulting game in the framework of\nhedonic game theory; we study how players might divide into coalitions, where\neach set of players within a coalition jointly construct model(s). We analyze\nthree methods of federation, modeling differing degrees of customization. In\nuniform federation, the agents collectively produce a single model. In\ncoarse-grained federation, each agent can weight the global model together with\ntheir local model.

In this work, we combine the concepts\nof delegation and stochastic probing into a single mechanism design framework\nwhich we term delegated stochastic probing. We study how much a principal loses\nby delegating a stochastic probing problem, compared to their utility in the\nnon-delegated solution. Our model and results are heavily inspired by the work\nof Kleinberg and Kleinberg in \"Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search.\"\nBuilding on their work, we show that there exists a connection between\ndelegated stochastic probing and generalized prophet inequalities, which\nprovides us with constant-factor deterministic mechanisms for a large class of\ndelegated stochastic probing problems. We also explore randomized mechanisms in\na simple delegated probing setting, and show that they outperform deterministic\nmechanisms in some instances but not in the worst case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:57:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 14:58:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bechtel", "Curtis", ""], ["Dughmi", "Shaddin", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15008", "submitter": "Ankur Kulkarni", "authors": "Anuj S.

To maximize the economic benefits, we\njointly consider the ES sizing, operation, and cost allocation via a coalition\ngame formulation. Particularly, we study a fair ex-post cost allocation based\non nucleolus which addresses fairness by minimizing the minimal dissatisfaction\nof all the players. To overcome the exponential computation burden caused by\nthe implicit characteristic function, we employ a constraint generation\ntechnique to gradually approach the unique nucleolus by leveraging the sparse\nproblem structure. We demonstrate both the fairness and computational\nefficiency of the method through case studies, which are not provided by the\nexisting Shapley approach or proportional method. Particularly, only a small\nfraction of characteristic function (less than 1% for 20 buildings) is required\nto achieve the cost allocation versus the exponential information required by\nShapley approach. Though there exists a minor increase of computation over the\nproportional method, the proposed method can ensure fairness while the latter\nfails in some cases. Further, we demonstrate both the building-wise and\ncommunity-wise economic benefits are enhanced with the ES sharing model over\nthe individual ES (IES) model. Accordingly, the overall value of ES is\nconsiderably improved (about 1.83 times).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 09:57:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 12:05:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2020 05:22:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2021 12:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2021 12:03:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yu", ""], ["Hu", "Guoqiang", ""], ["Spanos", "Costas J.", ""]]}]
