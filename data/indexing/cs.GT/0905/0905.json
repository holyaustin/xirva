In this paper, we study the impact of this trade off on the\ntopology and the dynamics of a network of SUs seeking to reduce the\ninterference on the PU through collaborative sensing. Moreover, while existing\nliterature mainly focused on centralized solutions for collaborative sensing,\nwe propose distributed collaboration strategies through game theory. We model\nthe problem as a non-transferable coalitional game, and propose a distributed\nalgorithm for coalition formation through simple merge and split rules. Through\nthe proposed algorithm, SUs can autonomously collaborate and self-organize into\ndisjoint independent coalitions, while maximizing their detection probability\ntaking into account the cooperation costs (in terms of false alarm). We study\nthe stability of the resulting network structure, and show that a maximum\nnumber of SUs per formed coalition exists for the proposed utility model.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows a reduction of up to\n86.6% of the average missing probability per SU (probability of missing the\ndetection of the PU) relative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a\ncertain false alarm level. In addition, through simulations, we compare the\nperformance of the proposed distributed solution with respect to an optimal\ncentralized solution that minimizes the average missing probability per SU.\nFinally, the results also show how the proposed algorithm autonomously adapts\nthe network topology to environmental changes such as mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 May 2009 07:12:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Debbah", "Merouane", ""], ["Hj\u00f8rungnes", "Are", ""], ["Ba\u015far", "Tamer", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3012", "submitter": "Ye Du", "authors": "Ye Du", "title": "On the Complexity of Deciding Degeneracy in Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that it is NP-Complete to decide whether a bimatrix game is\ndegenerate and it is Co-NP-Complete to decide whether a bimatrix game is\nnondegenerate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2009 01:40:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Du", "Ye", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3191", "submitter": "Tanmoy Chakraborty", "authors": "Tanmoy Chakraborty, Zhiyi Huang, Sanjeev Khanna", "title": "Dynamic and Non-Uniform Pricing Strategies for Revenue Maximization", "comments": "23 pages, 0 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the Item Pricing problem for revenue maximization in the limited\nsupply setting, where a single seller with $n$ items caters to $m$ buyers with\nunknown subadditive valuation functions who arrive in a sequence.

Our goal is to design pricing strategies that\nguarantee an expected revenue that is within a small factor $\\alpha$ of the\nmaximum possible social welfare -- an upper bound on the maximum revenue that\ncan be generated. Most earlier work has focused on the unlimited supply\nsetting, where selling items to some buyer does not affect their availability\nto the future buyers. Balcan et. al. (EC 2008) studied the limited supply\nsetting, giving a randomized strategy that assigns a single price to all items\n(uniform strategy), and never changes it (static strategy), that gives an\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n \\log \\log n})}$-approximation, and moreover, no static\nuniform pricing strategy can give better than $2^{\\Omega(\\log^{1/4} n)}$-\napproximation. We improve this lower bound to $2^{\\Omega(sqrt{\\log n})}$.\n  We consider dynamic uniform strategies, which can change the price upon the\narrival of each buyer but the price on all unsold items is the same at all\ntimes, and static non-uniform strategies, which can assign different prices to\ndifferent items but can never change it after setting it initially. We design\nsuch pricing strategies that give a poly-logarithmic approximation to maximum\nrevenue.
