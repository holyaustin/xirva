In our model there\nare $n$ agents and each agent strategically chooses when to join a\nfirst-come-first-served observable queue. Agents dislike standing in line and\nthey take actions in discrete time steps: we assume that each agent has a cost\nof $1$ for every time step he waits before joining the queue and a cost of\n$w>1$ for every time step he waits in the queue. At each time step a single\nagent can be processed. Before each time step, every agent observes the queue\nand strategically decides whether or not to join, with the goal of minimizing\nhis expected cost.\n  In this paper we focus on symmetric strategies which are arguably more\nnatural as they require less coordination. This brings up the following twist\nto the usual price of anarchy question: what is the main source for the\ninefficiency of symmetric equilibria? is it the players' strategic behavior or\nthe lack of coordination?\n  We present results for two different parameter regimes that are qualitatively\nvery different: (i) when $w$ is fixed and $n$ grows, we prove a tight bound of\n$2$ and show that the entire loss is due to the players' selfish behavior (ii)\nwhen $n$ is fixed and $w$ grows, we prove a tight bound of $\\Theta\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{w}{n}}\\right)$ and show that it is mainly due to lack of\ncoordination: the same order of magnitude of loss is suffered by any symmetric\nprofile.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 19:15:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 07:28:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2018 07:30:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Babaioff", "Moshe", ""], ["Oren", "Sigal", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.00165", "submitter": "Adilson Enio Motter", "authors": "Adilson E.

While simply rephrasing the traditional solution\nconcept for standard coalitional games, this leads to distribute the surplus\ngenerated by partitions across the edges of the network, as the atoms among\npartitions are unordered pairs of players. These shares of edges are further\ndivided between nodes, but the corresponding Shapley value is very different\nfrom the traditional one and leads to two alternative forms, obtained by\nfocusing either on marginal contributions along maximal chains, or else on the\nuniform division of Harsanyi dividends.

The\ncritical question is how to design the optimal dynamic pricing scheme, with\nprospects for maximizing the expected long-term revenue. In this paper, we\nstudy the sequential dynamic pricing scheme of a monopoly mobile network\noperator in the social data market. In the market, the operator, i.e., the\nseller, individually offers each mobile user, i.e., the buyer, a certain price\nin multiple time periods dynamically and repeatedly. The proposed scheme\nexploits the network effects in the mobile users' behaviors that boost the\nsocial data demand. Furthermore, due to limited radio resource, the impact of\nwireless network congestion is taken into account in the pricing scheme.\nThereafter, we propose a modified sequential pricing policy in order to ensure\nsocial fairness among mobile users in terms of their individual utilities. We\nanalytically demonstrate that the proposed sequential dynamic pricing scheme\ncan help the operator gain greater revenue and mobile users achieve higher\ntotal utilities than those of the baseline static pricing scheme. To gain more\ninsights, we further study a simultaneous dynamic pricing scheme in which the\noperator determines the pricing strategy at the beginning of each time period.\nMobile users decide on their individual data demand in each time period\nsimultaneously, considering the network effects in the social domain and the\ncongestion effects in the network domain.

In the classical model, each player selects a path connecting her\nsource and target vertices. The cost of traversing an edge depends on the {\\em\nload}; namely, number of players that traverse it. Thus, it abstracts the fact\nthat different users may use a resource at different times and for different\ndurations, which plays an important role in determining the costs of the users\nin reality. For example, when transmitting packets in a communication network,\nrouting traffic in a road network, or processing a task in a production system,\nactual sharing and congestion of resources crucially depends on time.\n  In \\cite{AGK17}, we introduced {\\em timed network games}, which add a time\ncomponent to network games. Each vertex $v$ in the network is associated with a\ncost function, mapping the load on $v$ to the price that a player pays for\nstaying in $v$ for one time unit with this load. Each edge in the network is\nguarded by the time intervals in which it can be traversed, which forces the\nplayers to spend time in the vertices. In this work we significantly extend the\nway time can be referred to in timed network games. In the model we study, the\nnetwork is equipped with {\\em clocks}, and, as in timed automata, edges are\nguarded by constraints on the values of the clocks, and their traversal may\ninvolve a reset of some clocks.

For the case of two agents, we completely characterize the\nclass of graphs $G$ that guarantee the existence of EF1 allocations as the\nclass of graphs whose biconnected components are arranged in a path. This class\nis strictly larger than the class of traceable graphs; one can be check in\nlinear time whether a graph belongs to this class, and if so return an EF1\nallocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:57:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bil\u00f2", "Vittorio", ""], ["Caragiannis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Flammini", "Michele", ""], ["Igarashi", "Ayumi", ""], ["Monaco", "Gianpiero", ""], ["Peters", "Dominik", ""], ["Vinci", "Cosimo", ""], ["Zwicker", "William S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10120", "submitter": "Andy Kitchen BSc", "authors": "Andy Kitchen and Michela Benedetti", "title": "ExIt-OOS: Towards Learning from Planning in Imperfect Information Games", "comments": "8 pages. 1 figure, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The current state of the art in playing many important perfect information\ngames, including Chess and Go, combines planning and deep reinforcement\nlearning with self-play.

We show that,\nin the case where the players have different action spaces, the cost the leader\nincurs in a Stackelberg equilibrium cannot be approximated in polynomial time\nup to within any polynomial factor in the size of the game unless P = NP,\nindependently of the cost functions being monotonic or not. We show that a\nsimilar result also holds when the players have nonmonotonic cost functions,\neven if their action spaces are the same. Differently, we prove that the case\nwith identical action spaces and monotonic cost functions is easy, and propose\npolynomial-time algorithm for it. We also improve an algorithm for the\ncomputation of a socially optimal equilibrium in singleton congestion games\nwith the same action spaces without leadership, and extend it to the\ncomputation of a Stackelberg equilibrium for the case where the leader is\nrestricted to pure strategies. For the cases in which the problem of finding an\nequilibrium is hard, we show how, in the optimistic setting where the followers\nbreak ties in favor of the leader, the problem can be formulated via\nmixed-integer linear programming techniques, which computational experiments\nshow to scale quite well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2018 10:17:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Castiglioni", "Matteo", ""], ["Marchesi", "Alberto", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""], ["Coniglio", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10569", "submitter": "Zhiyuan Wang", "authors": "Zhiyuan Wang and Lin Gao and Jianwei Huang", "title": "Exploring Time Flexibility in Wireless Data Plans", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, the mobile network operators (MNOs) are exploring more time\nflexibility with the rollover data plan, which allows the unused data from the\nprevious month to be used in the current month.
