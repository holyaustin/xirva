On arrival of a left vertex, its edge\nutilities (or weights) to all the right vertices and a corresponding cost (or\nbid) are revealed. If a left vertex is matched to any of the right vertices,\nthen it has to be paid at least as much as its cost. The problem is to match\neach left vertex instantaneously and irrevocably to any one of the right\nvertices, if at all, to find the maximum weight matching that is truthful,\nunder a payment budget constraint. Truthfulness condition requires that no left\nvertex has any incentive of misreporting its cost. Assuming that the vertices\narrive in an uniformly random order (secretary model) with arbitrary utilities,\na truthful algorithm is proposed that is $24\\beta$-competitive (where $\\beta$\nis the ratio of the maximum and the minimum utility) and satisfies the payment\nbudget constraint.

We\nfocus on the fundamental setting of bilateral trade, which in its simplest form\ninvolves a seller with a single item to price, a buyer whose value for the item\nis drawn from a common prior distribution over $n$ different possible values,\nand a take-it-or-leave-it-offer protocol. A mediator with access to the buyer's\ntype may partially reveal such information to the seller in order to further\nsome objective such as the social welfare or the seller's revenue.\n  In the setting of maximizing welfare under bilateral trade, we show that\n$O(\\log(n) \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ signals suffice for a $1-\\epsilon$\napproximation to the optimal welfare, and this bound is tight. As our main\nresult, we exhibit an efficient algorithm for computing a $\\frac{M-1}{M} \\cdot\n(1-1/e)$-approximation to the welfare-maximizing scheme with at most M signals.\n  For the revenue objective, we show that $\\Omega(n)$ signals are needed for a\nconstant factor approximation to the revenue of a fully informed seller. From a\ncomputational perspective, however, the problem gets easier: we show that a\nsimple dynamic program computes the signaling scheme with M signals maximizing\nthe seller's revenue.\n  Observing that the signaling problem in bilateral trade is a special case of\nthe fundamental Bayesian Persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow, we also\nexamine the question of communication-constrained signaling more generally. In\nthis model there is a sender (the mediator), a receiver (the seller) looking to\ntake an action (setting the price), and a state of nature (the buyer's type)\ndrawn from a common prior. We show that it is NP-hard to approximate the\noptimal sender's utility to within any constant factor in the presence of\ncommunication constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 22:08:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2020 22:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Dughmi", "Shaddin", ""], ["Kempe", "David", ""], ["Qiang", "Ruixin", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.07904", "submitter": "Hajar Elhammouti", "authors": "Hajar El Hammouti, Essaid Sabir, Hamidou Tembine", "title": "A Satisfactory Power Control for 5G Self-Organizing Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  SmallCells are deployed in order to enhance the network performance by\nbringing the network closer to the user.

Our goal is to maximize\nthe number of customers who finally adopt the target product. We investigate\nthis problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings.

In the latter case, the decision process is performed\nin a sequential manner, and each seed user that is picked provides the feedback\non the discount, or, in other words, reveals whether or not she will adopt the\ndiscount.

Second, over the mmW\nband, the scheduling problem is formulated as a 0-1 Knapsack problem and a\nnovel algorithm is proposed to solve it. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nproposed framework can find an effective scheduling solution, over both $\\mu$W\nand mmW, in polynomial time.
