To obtain enough spectrum resources\nto meet its customer demands, the virtual operator can either sense for the\ntemporarily unused spectrum in a licensed band, or lease spectrum from a\nspectrum owner. Sensing is usually cheaper than leasing, but the amount of\navailable spectrum obtained by sensing is uncertain due to the primary users'\nactivities in the licensed band. Previous studies on spectrum investment\nproblems mainly considered the expected profit maximization problem of a\nrisk-neutral operator based on the expected utility theory (EUT). In reality,\nhowever, an operator's decision is influenced by not only the consideration of\nexpected profit maximization, but also the level of its risk preference. To\ncapture this tradeoff between these two considerations, we analyze the\noperator's optimal decision problem using the prospect theory from behavioral\neconomics, which includes EUT as a special case. The sensing and leasing\noptimal problem under prospect theory is non-convex and challenging to solve.\nNevertheless, by exploiting the unimodal structure of the problem, we are able\nto compute the unique global optimal solution. We show that comparing to an EUT\noperator, both the risk-averse and risk-seeking operator achieve a smaller\nexpected profit. On the other hand, a risk-averse operator can guarantee a\nlarger minimum possible profit, while a risk-seeking operator can achieve a\nlarger maximum possible profit. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the expected\nprofit and the minimum possible profit for a risk-averse operator is better\nwhen the sensing cost increases, while the tradeoff between the expected profit\nand the maximum possible profit for a risk-seeking operator is better when the\nsensing cost decreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 13:25:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Junlin", ""], ["Cheung", "Man Hon", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08484", "submitter": "Alonso Silva", "authors": "Alonso Silva (LINCS)", "title": "Opinion Manipulation in Social Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we are interested in finding the most efficient use of a budget\nto promote an opinion by paying agents within a group to supplant their true\nopinions.

Serious efforts are being pursued to address\nlegal, technical and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable\noption for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and\neffort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control\nalgorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving\nexperience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to\nachieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an\nautonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where multiple\ninteractions between vehicles and drivers simultaneously occur. Traffic\nsimulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with\nreasonable fidelity can help decrease the time and effort necessary for the\ndevelopment of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue\nwhere acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and\nsafely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic\ntraffic model that can be used to 1) test and compare various autonomous\nvehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an\nexisting control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the\nfirst case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control\nsystems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we\noptimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the\nproposed traffic model and simulation environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:25:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Nan", ""], ["Oyler", "Dave", ""], ["Zhang", "Mengxuan", ""], ["Yildiz", "Yildiray", ""], ["Kolmanovsky", "Ilya", ""], ["Girard", "Anouck", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08744", "submitter": "Lin Gao", "authors": "Qian Ma, Lin Gao, Ya-Feng Liu, Jianwei Huang", "title": "Economic Analysis of Crowdsourced Wireless Community Networks", "comments": "This manuscript serves as the online technical report for the article\n  published in the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMC.2016.2606390", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Crowdsourced wireless community networks can effectively alleviate the\nlimited coverage issue of Wi-Fi access points (APs), by encouraging individuals\n(users) to share their private residential Wi-Fi APs with others. In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive economic analysis for such a crowdsourced\nnetwork, with the particular focus on the users' behavior analysis and the\ncommunity network operator's pricing design. Specifically, we formulate the\ninteractions between the network operator and users as a two-layer Stackelberg\nmodel, where the operator determining the pricing scheme in Layer I, and then\nusers determining their Wi-Fi sharing schemes in Layer II. First, we analyze\nthe user behavior in Layer II via a two-stage membership selection and network\naccess game, for both small-scale networks and large-scale networks. Then, we\ndesign a partial price differentiation scheme for the operator in Layer I,\nwhich generalizes both the complete price differentiation scheme and the single\npricing scheme (i.e., no price differentiation). We show that the proposed\npartial pricing scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between the revenue and the\nimplementation complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that when using the\npartial pricing scheme with only two prices, we can increase the operator's\nrevenue up to 124.44% comparing with the single pricing scheme, and can achieve\nan average of 80% of the maximum operator revenue under the complete price\ndifferentiation scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 06:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Qian", ""], ["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Liu", "Ya-Feng", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08859", "submitter": "Mikhail Raskin", "authors": "M.
