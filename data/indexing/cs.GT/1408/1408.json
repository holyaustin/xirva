The cost to serve a location is an\nallocated portion of the cost of an optimal tour. The Shapley value is one of\nthe most important normative division schemes in cooperative games, giving a\nprincipled and fair allocation both for the TSG and more generally. We consider\na number of direct and sampling-based procedures for calculating the Shapley\nvalue, and present the first proof that approximating the Shapley value of the\nTSG within a constant factor is NP-hard. Treating the Shapley value as an ideal\nbaseline allocation, we then develop six proxies for that value which are\nrelatively easy to compute. We perform an experimental evaluation using\nSynthetic Euclidean games as well as games derived from real-world tours\ncalculated for fast-moving consumer goods scenarios. Our experiments show that\nseveral computationally tractable allocation techniques correspond to good\nproxies for the Shapley value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2014 06:59:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Aziz", "Haris", ""], ["Cahan", "Casey", ""], ["Gretton", "Charles", ""], ["Kilby", "Phillip", ""], ["Mattei", "Nicholas", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4925", "submitter": "Scott Deeann Chen", "authors": "Scott Deeann Chen", "title": "A Crude Analysis of Twitch Plays Pokemon", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We model and study the game mechanisms and human behavior of the anarchy mode\nin Twitch Plays Pokemon with a pure-jump continuous-time Markov process.

Recent works have revealed a new set of \"zero-determinant (ZD)\"\nstrategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy\nplayer can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular\nhe can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear\nrelationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an\nadvantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD\nstrategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when\nthe game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general\nmodel of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies\nhave high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy\nunder noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's\nexpected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability\ndeclines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by\nnoise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the\nopponent's, which implies strong extortions do not exist even under low noise.\nWhile we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of\nextortions, named weak extortions, where any increase of his own payoff always\nexceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under\nwhich the weak extortions can be realized are more stringent as the noise\nbecomes stronger.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 06:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 10:35:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2015 02:30:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hao", "Dong", ""], ["Rong", "Zhihai", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5366", "submitter": "Carlos Barreto", "authors": "Carlos Barreto, Eduardo Mojica-Nava, Nicanor Quijano", "title": "Incentives-Based Mechanism for Efficient Demand Response Programs", "comments": "38 pages, 9 figures, submitted to journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we investigate the inefficiency of the electricity system with\nstrategic agents.
