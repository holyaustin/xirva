We show that parity games with bounded DAG width can be\nsolved in O(n^(k+3) k^(k + 2) (d + 1)^(3k + 2)) time, where n, k, and d are the\nsize, treewidth, and number of priorities in the parity game.

We also show that, if a tree decomposition is provided,\nthen parity games with bounded treewidth can be solved in O(n k^(k + 5) (d +\n1)^(3k + 5)) time. This improves over previous best algorithm, given by\nObdrzalek, which runs in O(n d^(2(k+1)^2)) time. Our techniques can also be\nadapted to show that the problem of solving parity games with bounded treewidth\nlies in the complexity class NC^2, which is the class of problems that can be\nefficiently parallelized.

Under this formulation, the\nnotion of equilibrium corresponds to the situation where all players can\nsimultaneously satisfy their individual constraints.

A learning method that allows radio devices to achieve a SE in\npure strategies in finite time and requiring only one-bit feedback is also\npresented.
