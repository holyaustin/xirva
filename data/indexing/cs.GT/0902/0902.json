We show that restricting the search space to\nequilibria whose payoffs fall into a certain interval may lead to\nundecidability. In particular, we prove that the following problem is\nundecidable: Given a game G, does there exist a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium\nof G where player 0 wins with probability 1. Moreover, this problem remains\nundecidable if it is restricted to strategies with (unbounded) finite memory.\nHowever, if mixed strategies are allowed, decidability remains an open problem.\nOne way to obtain a provably decidable variant of the problem is restricting\nthe strategies to be positional or stationary. For the complexity of these two\nproblems, we obtain a common lower bound of NP and upper bounds of NP and\nPSPACE respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 16:09:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2009 19:54:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2009 20:12:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ummels", "Michael", ""], ["Wojtczak", "Dominik", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0382", "submitter": "Vahab Mirrokni", "authors": "Vahab Mirrokni and Alexander Skopalik", "title": "On the complexity of Nash dynamics and Sink Equilibria", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Studying Nash dynamics is an important approach for analyzing the outcome of\ngames with repeated selfish behavior of self-interested agents. Sink equilibria\nhas been introduced by Goemans, Mirrokni, and Vetta for studying social cost on\nNash dynamics over pure strategies in games. However, they do not address the\ncomplexity of sink equilibria in these games. Recently, Fabrikant and\nPapadimitriou initiated the study of the complexity of Nash dynamics in two\nclasses of games. In order to completely understand the complexity of Nash\ndynamics in a variety of games, we study the following three questions for\nvarious games: (i) given a state in game, can we verify if this state is in a\nsink equilibrium or not? (ii) given an instance of a game, can we verify if\nthere exists any sink equilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria? and (iii)\ngiven an instance of a game, can we verify if there exists a pure Nash\nequilibrium (i.e, a sink equilibrium with one state)?\n  In this paper, we almost answer all of the above questions for a variety of\nclasses of games with succinct representation, including anonymous games,\nplayer-specific and weighted congestion games, valid-utility games, and\ntwo-sided market games. In particular, for most of these problems, we show that\n(i) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if a given state is in a sink equilibrium,\n(ii) it is NP-hard to verify if there exists a pure Nash equilibrium in the\ngame or not, (iii) it is PSPACE-complete to verify if there exists any sink\nequilibrium other than pure Nash equilibria. To solve these problems, we\nillustrate general techniques that could be used to answer similar questions in\nother classes of games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 21:37:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mirrokni", "Vahab", ""], ["Skopalik", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0524", "submitter": "Sujit Gujar Mr", "authors": "Sujit Gujar and Y Narahari", "title": "An Optimal Multi-Unit Combinatorial Procurement Auction with Single\n  Minded Bidders", "comments": "8 Pages, Managing Complexity in Distributed World, MCDES 2008: IISc\n  Centenary Conference of Division of Electrical Sciences Added 2 references in\n  newer version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The current art in optimal combinatorial auctions is limited to handling the\ncase of single units of multiple items, with each bidder bidding on exactly one\nbundle (single minded bidders).

Despite intense\nefforts in the past, it is still an open question whether there is a\n\\emph{finite bounded} envy-free cake-cutting protocol for an arbitrary number\nof players, and even for four players. We introduce the notion of degree of\nguaranteed envy-freeness (DGEF) as a measure of how good a cake-cutting\nprotocol can approximate the ideal of envy-freeness while keeping the protocol\nfinite bounded (trading being disregarded). We propose a new finite bounded\nproportional protocol for any number n \\geq 3 of players, and show that this\nprotocol has a DGEF of 1 + \\lceil (n^2)/2 \\rceil. This is the currently best\nDGEF among known finite bounded cake-cutting protocols for an arbitrary number\nof players.

Together the agents create a network (a subgraph of the host graph)\nwhile selfishly minimizing the link creation costs plus the sum of the\ndistances to all other players (usage cost). In this paper, we pursue two\nimportant facets of the network creation game. First, we study extensively a\nnatural version of the game, called the cooperative model, where nodes can\ncollaborate and share the cost of creating any edge in the host graph. We prove\nthe first nontrivial bounds in this model, establishing that the price of\nanarchy is polylogarithmic in n for all values of &#945; in complete host\ngraphs. This bound is the first result of this type for any version of the\nnetwork creation game; most previous general upper bounds are polynomial in n.\nInterestingly, we also show that equilibrium graphs have polylogarithmic\ndiameter for the most natural range of \\alpha (at most n polylg n). Second, we\nstudy the impact of the natural assumption that the host graph is a general\ngraph, not necessarily complete. This model is a simple example of nonuniform\ncreation costs among the edges (effectively allowing weights of \\alpha and\n\\infty). We prove the first assemblage of upper and lower bounds for this\ncontext, stablishing nontrivial tight bounds for many ranges of \\alpha, for\nboth the unilateral and cooperative versions of network creation. In\nparticular, we establish polynomial lower bounds for both versions and many\nranges of \\alpha, even for this simple nonuniform cost model, which sharply\ncontrasts the conjectured constant bounds for these games in complete (uniform)\ngraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 10:31:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Demaine", "Erik D.", "", "MIT"], ["Hajiaghayi", "Mohammadtaghi", "", "MIT"], ["Mahini", "Hamid", ""], ["Zadimoghaddam", "Morteza", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2108", "submitter": "Olivier Serre", "authors": "Vincent Gripon (LIAFA), Olivier Serre (LIAFA)", "title": "Qualitative Concurrent Stochastic Games with Imperfect Information", "comments": "Automata, Languages and Programming, 36th International Colloquium,\n  ICALP 2009, Rhodes: Greece (2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.GT cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a model of games that combines concurrency, imperfect information\nand stochastic aspects.
