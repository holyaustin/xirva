We\nstudy the case where m indivisible items need to be divided among n agents with\nadditive valuations using the popular fairness notion of maximin share (MMS).\nAn MMS allocation provides each agent a bundle worth at least her maximin\nshare. While it is known that such an allocation need not exist, a series of\nwork provided approximation algorithms for a 2/3-MMS allocation in which each\nagent receives a bundle worth at least 2/3 times her maximin share. More\nrecently, Ghodsi et al. [EC'2018] showed the existence of a 3/4-MMS allocation\nand a PTAS to find a (3/4-\\epsilon)-MMS allocation for an \\epsilon > 0. Most of\nthe previous works utilize intricate algorithms and require agents' approximate\nMMS values, which are computationally expensive to obtain.\n  In this paper, we develop a new approach that gives a simple algorithm for\nshowing the existence of a 3/4-MMS allocation. Furthermore, our approach is\npowerful enough to be easily extended in two directions: First, we get a\nstrongly polynomial-time algorithm to find a 3/4-MMS allocation, where we do\nnot need to approximate the MMS values at all. Second, we show that there\nalways exists a (3/4 + 1/(12n))-MMS allocation, improving the best previous\nfactor. This improves the approximation guarantee, most notably for small n. We\nnote that 3/4 was the best factor known for n> 4.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 19:08:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Feb 2020 17:24:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2021 20:32:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Garg", "Jugal", ""], ["Taki", "Setareh", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.00111", "submitter": "Zahra Zahedi", "authors": "Sailik Sengupta, Zahra Zahedi, Subbarao Kambhampati", "title": "To Monitor Or Not: Observing Robot's Behavior based on a Game-Theoretic\n  Model of Trust", "comments": "First two authors contributed equally and names are ordered based on\n  a coin flip", "journal-ref": "21st International Workshop on Trust in Agent Societies, 2019", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In scenarios where a robot generates and executes a plan, there may be\ninstances where this generated plan is less costly for the robot to execute but\nincomprehensible to the human.

The ascent variables\nmove in the direction of the gradient, while the descent variables move in the\nopposite direction. Dynamical systems of this form or very similar forms have\nbeen studied in diverse fields such as game theory, optimization, neural\nnetworks, and population biology. Gradient descent-ascent is approximated as a\nNewtonian dynamical system that conserves total energy, defined as the sum of\nthe kinetic energy and a potential energy that is proportional to the payoff\nfunction. The error of the approximation is a residual force that violates\nenergy conservation. If the residual force is purely dissipative, then the\nenergy serves as a Lyapunov function, and convergence of bounded trajectories\nto steady states is guaranteed. A previous convergence theorem due to Kose and\nUzawa required the payoff function to be convex in the descent variables, and\nconcave in the ascent variables. Here the assumption is relaxed, so that the\npayoff function need only be globally `less convex' or `more concave' in the\nascent variables than in the descent variables. Such relative convexity\nconditions allow the existence of multiple steady states, unlike the\nconvex-concave assumption. When combined with sufficient conditions that imply\nthe existence of a minimax equilibrium, boundedness of trajectories is also\nassured.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Mar 2019 03:09:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Seung", "H.

In the context of Stackelberg games, various approaches have been\nproposed to deal with the leader's incomplete knowledge about the follower's\npayoffs, typically by gathering information from the leader's interaction with\nthe follower. Unfortunately, these approaches rely crucially on the assumption\nthat the follower will not strategically exploit this information asymmetry,\ni.e., the follower behaves truthfully during the interaction according to their\nactual payoffs. As we show in this paper, the follower may have strong\nincentives to deceitfully imitate the behavior of a different follower type\nand, in doing this, benefit significantly from inducing the leader into\nchoosing a highly suboptimal strategy. This raises a fundamental question: how\nto design a leader strategy in the presence of a deceitful follower? To answer\nthis question, we put forward a basic model of Stackelberg games with\n(imitative) follower deception and show that the leader is indeed able to\nreduce the loss due to follower deception with carefully designed policies. We\nthen provide a systematic study of the problem of computing the optimal leader\npolicy and draw a relatively complete picture of the complexity landscape;\nessentially matching positive and negative complexity results are provided for\nnatural variants of the model. Our intractability results are in sharp contrast\nto the situation with no deception, where the leader's optimal strategy can be\ncomputed in polynomial time, and thus illustrate the intrinsic difficulty of\nhandling follower deception.

Under the general convex-concave\nassumption, most first-order methods only guarantee an ergodic convergence\nrate, that is, the uniform averages of the iterates converge at a $O(1/T)$ rate\nin terms of the saddle-point residual. However, numerically, the iterates\nthemselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This\nobservation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on\nlater iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such\nincreasing averaging schemes, applied to various first-order methods, are able\nto preserve the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate with no additional assumptions or\ncomputational overhead. Extensive numerical experiments on zero-sum game\nsolving, market equilibrium computation and image denoising demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed schemes. In particular, the increasing averages\nconsistently outperform the uniform averages in all test problems by orders of\nmagnitude. When solving matrix and extensive-form games, increasing averages\nconsistently outperform the last iterates as well.
