The game is played by\nmoving a token throughout a graph to produce an infinite path.

If so,\nthen by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the\nmetric space?\n  We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice\nsetting: a population of voters, two independently drawn candidates, and a\nmajority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the\npopulation, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be\nthrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one. We examine how\nthis ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population\nof voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio\nimproves from $3$ to $4-2\\sqrt{2}$, roughly $1.1716$; this bound is tight. When\nthe metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of $1.5$ and a constant upper\nbound strictly better than $2$ on the approximation ratio of the majority rule.\n  The positive result depends in part on the assumption that candidates are\nindependent and identically distributed.

We model such settings in both classical and\ncontextual bandit models in which the myopic agents maximize rewards according\nto current empirical averages, but are also amenable to exogenous payments that\nmay cause them to alter their choices. Our notion of fairness asks that more\nqualified individuals are never (probabilistically) preferred over less\nqualified ones [Joseph et al].\n  We investigate whether it is possible to design inexpensive {subsidy} or\npayment schemes for a principal to motivate myopic agents to play fairly in all\nor almost all rounds. When the principal has full information about the state\nof the myopic agents, we show it is possible to induce fair play on every round\nwith a subsidy scheme of total cost $o(T)$ (for the classic setting with $k$\narms, $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k^3T})$, and for the $d$-dimensional linear contextual\nsetting $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{k^3 T})$). If the principal has much more limited\ninformation (as might often be the case for an external regulator or watchdog),\nand only observes the number of rounds in which members from each of the $k$\ngroups were selected, but not the empirical estimates maintained by the myopic\nagent, the design of such a scheme becomes more complex. We show both positive\nand negative results in the classic and linear bandit settings by upper and\nlower bounding the cost of fair subsidy schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 17:43:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kannan", "Sampath", ""], ["Kearns", "Michael", ""], ["Morgenstern", "Jamie", ""], ["Pai", "Mallesh", ""], ["Roth", "Aaron", ""], ["Vohra", "Rakesh", ""], ["Wu", "Z.

SD is a very\nconservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while\nmany allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on\nthe underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference\nbetween two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at\nthe bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call\ndiminishing differences (DD), where X is preferred over Y if its score is\nbetter according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption.\nWe give a full characterization of allocations that are\nnecessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption.\nBased on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for\nfinding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation if it exists. Using\nsimulations, we show that with high probability, a necessarily-proportional\nallocation does not exist but a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation exists,\nand moreover, that allocation is proportional according to the underlying\ncardinal utilities. We also consider chore allocation under the analogous\ncondition --- increasing-differences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 May 2017 20:46:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Mar 2019 09:10:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 08:04:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Segal-Halevi", "Erel", ""], ["Aziz", "Haris", ""], ["Hassidim", "Avinatan", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.08033", "submitter": "Josue Ortega", "authors": "Josue Ortega", "title": "Social Integration in Two-Sided Matching Markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematical Economics, 78 (2002) 119-126", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmateco.2018.08.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When several two-sided matching markets merge into one, it is inevitable that\nsome agents will become worse off if the matching mechanism used is stable.

This is also called \\emph{real-time\nbidding} (RTB) and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher's\nbenefit is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However, the\nbenefits of the other two stakeholders -- the advertiser and the user -- have\nbeen rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a two-stage computational\nframework that selects a banner ad based on the optimized trade-offs among all\nstakeholders. The first stage is still auction based and the second stage\nre-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric\nvariables are: the publisher's revenue, the advertiser's utility, the ad\nmemorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and\nthe visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\noptimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by incorporating multimedia\nmetrics. An algorithm is also proposed to determine the optimal weights of the\nmetric variables. We use both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to\nvalidate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the\npublisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders' benefits by\nslightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run, advertisers\nand users will be more engaged, the increased demand of advertising and the\nincreased supply of page views can then boost the publisher's revenue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 May 2017 13:48:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 10:06:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 11:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xiang", ""], ["Chen", "Bowei", ""], ["Kankanhalli", "Mohan", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.10706", "submitter": "Georgios Amanatidis", "authors": "Georgios Amanatidis, Georgios Birmpas, George Christodoulou, Evangelos\n  Markakis", "title": "Truthful Allocation Mechanisms Without Payments: Characterization and\n  Implications on Fairness", "comments": "To appear in the 18th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation\n  (ACM EC '17)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3033274.3085147", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the mechanism design problem of allocating a set of indivisible\nitems without monetary transfers.

First, our main result provides a complete characterization\nof truthful mechanisms that allocate all the items to the players. Our\ncharacterization reveals an interesting structure underlying all truthful\nmechanisms, showing that they can be decomposed into two components: a\nselection part where players pick their best subset among prespecified choices\ndetermined by the mechanism, and an exchange part where players are offered the\nchance to exchange certain subsets if it is favorable to do so.
