Previous works address this challenge with explicit\nreward shaping, which requires the strong assumption that agents can be forced\nto be prosocial. We propose using a less restrictive peer-rewarding mechanism,\ngifting, that guides the agents toward more socially desirable equilibria while\nallowing agents to remain selfish and decentralized. Gifting allows each agent\nto give some of their reward to other agents. We employ a theoretical framework\nthat captures the benefit of gifting in converging to the prosocial equilibrium\nby characterizing the equilibria's basins of attraction in a dynamical system.\nWith gifting, we demonstrate increased convergence of high risk, general-sum\ncoordination games to the prosocial equilibrium both via numerical analysis and\nexperiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 May 2021 23:28:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Woodrow Z.", ""], ["Beliaev", "Mark", ""], ["B\u0131y\u0131k", "Erdem", ""], ["Lazar", "Daniel A.", ""], ["Pedarsani", "Ramtin", ""], ["Sadigh", "Dorsa", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.06669", "submitter": "Warut Suksompong", "authors": "Edith Elkind, Erel Segal-Halevi, Warut Suksompong", "title": "Keep Your Distance: Land Division With Separation", "comments": "Appears in the 30th International Joint Conference on Artificial\n  Intelligence (IJCAI), 2021", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is part of an ongoing endeavor to bring the theory of fair\ndivision closer to practice by handling requirements from real-life\napplications.

In this work we build this connection by specifying a (competitive) packet\nrouting model, which is discrete in terms of flow and time, and by proving its\nconvergence to the intensively studied model of flows over time with\ndeterministic queuing. More precisely, we prove that the limit of the\nconvergence process, when decreasing the packet size and time step length in\nthe packet routing model, constitutes a flow over time with multiple\ncommodities. In addition, we show that the convergence result implies the\nexistence of approximate equilibria in the competitive version of the packet\nrouting model. This is of significant interest as exact pure Nash equilibria,\nsimilar to almost all other competitive models, cannot be guaranteed in the\nmulti-commodity setting. Moreover, the introduced packet routing model with\ndeterministic queuing is very application-oriented as it is based on the\nnetwork loading module of the agent-based transport simulation MATSim.

We measure performance of signaling schemes via\nthe notion of (additive) regret: the difference between Sender's hypothetically\noptimal utility had she known Receiver's utility function and her actual\nutility induced by the given scheme.\n  On the negative side, we show that if Sender has no knowledge at all about\nReceiver's utility, then Sender has no signaling scheme that performs robustly\nwell.

In\nfact, we exactly pin down the minimum regret value that Sender can guarantee in\nthis case, which turns out to be at most 1/e.
