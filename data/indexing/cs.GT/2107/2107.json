The rewards\nare unknown from the outset, but they are drawn from a known probability\ndistribution. In the standard prophet setting, a single agent makes selection\ndecisions in an attempt to maximize her expected reward. The novelty of our\nmodel is the introduction of a competition setting, where multiple agents\ncompete over the arriving rewards, and make online selection decisions\nsimultaneously, as rewards arrive. If a given reward is selected by more than a\nsingle agent, ties are broken either randomly or by a fixed ranking of the\nagents. The consideration of competition turns the prophet setting from an\nonline decision making scenario to a multi-agent game.\n  For both random and ranked tie-breaking rules, we present simple threshold\nstrategies for the agents that give them high guarantees, independent of the\nstrategies taken by others. In particular, for random tie-breaking, every agent\ncan guarantee herself at least $\\frac{1}{k+1}$ of the highest reward, and at\nleast $\\frac{1}{2k}$ of the optimal social welfare. For ranked tie-breaking,\nthe $i$th ranked agent can guarantee herself at least a half of the $i$th\nhighest reward. We complement these results by matching upper bounds, even with\nrespect to equilibrium profiles. For ranked tie-breaking rule, we also show a\ncorrespondence between the equilibrium of the $k$-agent game and the optimal\nstrategy of a single decision maker who can select up to $k$ rewards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 10:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ezra", "Tomer", ""], ["Feldman", "Michal", ""], ["Kupfer", "Ron", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.00464", "submitter": "Junchi Li", "authors": "Chris Junchi Li, Yaodong Yu, Nicolas Loizou, Gauthier Gidel, Yi Ma,\n  Nicolas Le Roux, Michael I.

Our primary contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we consider mechanisms which perform a sequence of pairwise comparisons\nbetween candidates. We show that a widely-popular deterministic mechanism\nemployed in most knockout phases yields distortion $\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$ while\neliciting only $m-1$ out of $\\Theta(m^2)$ possible pairwise comparisons, where\n$m$ represents the number of candidates. Our analysis for this mechanism\nleverages a powerful technical lemma recently developed by Kempe\n\\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a}. We also provide a matching lower bound on its\ndistortion. In contrast, we prove that any mechanism which performs fewer than\n$m-1$ pairwise comparisons is destined to have unbounded distortion. Moreover,\nwe study the power of deterministic mechanisms under incomplete rankings. Most\nnotably, when every agent provides her $k$-top preferences we show an upper\nbound of $6 m/k + 1$ on the distortion, for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThus, we substantially improve over the previous bound of $12 m/k$ recently\nestablished by Kempe \\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/000120a,DBLP:conf/aaai/000120b}, and\nwe come closer to matching the best-known lower bound. Finally, we are\nconcerned with the sample complexity required to ensure near-optimal distortion\nwith high probability. Our main contribution is to show that a random sample of\n$\\Theta(m/\\epsilon^2)$ voters suffices to guarantee distortion $3 + \\epsilon$\nwith high probability, for any sufficiently small $\\epsilon > 0$.
