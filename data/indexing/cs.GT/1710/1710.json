We\nshow that the underlying game has a unique equilibrium at which the companies\nmaximize their revenues while the consumers maximize their utilities subject to\ntheir local constraints. Closed-form expressions are provided for the optimal\nstrategies of all players. Based on these solutions, a power allocation game\nhas been formulated, which is shown to admit a unique pure-strategy Nash\nequilibrium, for which closed-form expressions are also provided. This\nequilibrium is found under the assumption that companies can freely allocate\ntheir power across the time horizon, but we also demonstrate that it is\npossible to relax this assumption. We further provide a fast distributed\nalgorithm for the computation of all optimal strategies using only local\ninformation. We also study the effect of variations in the number of periods\n(subdivisions of the time horizon) and the number of consumers. As a\nconsequence, we are able to find an appropriate company-to-consumer ratio when\nthe number of consumers participating in demand response exceeds some\nthreshold.

In\nthis process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are\nassociated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen\nuniformly at random is a mutant, with fitness $r > 0$, while all other\nindividuals are residents, with fitness $1$. In every step, an individual is\nchosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or\nresident) is passed on to a neighbor which is chosen uniformly at random. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a generalization of the model of Lieberman\net al. by assuming that different types of individuals perceive the population\nthrough different graphs, namely $G_R(V,E_R)$ for residents and $G_M(V,E_M)$\nfor mutants. In this model, we study the fixation probability, i.e. the\nprobability that eventually only mutants remain in the population, for various\npairs of graphs. First, we transfer known results from the original\nsingle-graph model of Lieberman et al. to our 2-graph model. Among them, we\nprovide a generalization of the Isothermal Theorem of Lieberman et al., that\ngives sufficient conditions for a pair of graphs to have the same fixation\nprobability as a pair of cliques. Next, we give a 2-player strategic game view\nof the process where player payoffs correspond to fixation and/or extinction\nprobabilities. In this setting, we attempt to identify best responses for each\nplayer and give evidence that the clique is the most beneficial graph for both\nplayers.

On the one hand,\ncontext-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong\nprivacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On\nthe other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic\nprivacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data\nholder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by\nintroducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative\nadversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization\nschemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is\nformulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that\nsanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the\nindividuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the\nprivate variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we\ninvestigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the\nbinary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models,\nwe derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that\nthe privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion)\nmatch the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can\nbe easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Oct 2017 05:36:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 16:40:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 3 Dec 2017 00:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Chong", ""], ["Kairouz", "Peter", ""], ["Chen", "Xiao", ""], ["Sankar", "Lalitha", ""], ["Rajagopal", "Ram", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.10117", "submitter": "Ehud Shapiro", "authors": "Ehud Shapiro and Nimrod Talmon", "title": "Reality-Aware Social Choice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Earlier version in the Proceedings of the 17th International\n  Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS '18).\n  International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,\n  Richland, SC, 1188-1192. 2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social Choice theory generalizes voting on one proposal to ranking multiple\nproposals.

For\nsuch a random arrival model, we improve upon the $1/2$-approximation and obtain\n$(1-1/e)$-approximation prophet inequalities for both matroids and\ncombinatorial auctions.
