This representation allows us to develop a canonical direct sum\ndecomposition of an arbitrary game into three components, which we refer to as\nthe potential, harmonic and nonstrategic components. We analyze natural classes\nof games that are induced by this decomposition, and in particular, focus on\ngames with no harmonic component and games with no potential component. We show\nthat the first class corresponds to the well-known potential games. We refer to\nthe second class of games as harmonic games, and study the structural and\nequilibrium properties of this new class of games. Intuitively, the potential\ncomponent of a game captures interactions that can equivalently be represented\nas a common interest game, while the harmonic part represents the conflicts\nbetween the interests of the players. We make this intuition precise, by\nstudying the properties of these two classes, and show that indeed they have\nquite distinct and remarkable characteristics. For instance, while finite\npotential games always have pure Nash equilibria, harmonic games generically\nnever do. Moreover, we show that the nonstrategic component does not affect the\nequilibria of a game, but plays a fundamental role in their efficiency\nproperties, thus decoupling the location of equilibria and their payoff-related\nproperties. Exploiting the properties of the decomposition framework, we obtain\nexplicit expressions for the projections of games onto the subspaces of\npotential and harmonic games. This enables an extension of the properties of\npotential and harmonic games to \"nearby\" games. We exemplify this point by\nshowing that the set of approximate equilibria of an arbitrary game can be\ncharacterized through the equilibria of its projection onto the set of\npotential games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 May 2010 19:55:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Jun 2010 03:22:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Candogan", "Ozan", ""], ["Menache", "Ishai", ""], ["Ozdaglar", "Asuman", ""], ["Parrilo", "Pablo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3045", "submitter": "Noah Stein", "authors": "Noah D.
