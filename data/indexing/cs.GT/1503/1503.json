By exploring the inherent features, some fundamental\nchallenges for self-organizing optimization in CSCs are presented and\ndiscussed. Specifically, the dense and random deployment of CSCs brings about\nsome new challenges in terms of scalability and adaptation; furthermore, the\nuncertain, dynamic and incomplete information constraints also impose some new\nchallenges in terms of convergence and robustness. For providing better service\nto the users and improving the resource utilization, four requirements for\nself-organizing optimization in CSCs are presented and discussed. Following the\nattractive fact that the decisions in game-theoretic models are exactly\ncoincident with those in self-organizing optimization, i.e., distributed and\nautonomous, we establish a framework of game-theoretic solutions for\nself-organizing optimization in CSCs, and propose some featured game models.\nSpecifically, their basic models are presented, some examples are discussed and\nfuture research directions are given.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 02:10:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 08:24:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Yuhua", ""], ["Wang", "Jinlong", ""], ["Wu", "Qihui", ""], ["Du", "Zhiyong", ""], ["Shen", "Liang", ""], ["Anpalagan", "Alagan", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00255", "submitter": "Nahum Shimkin", "authors": "Nahum Shimkin", "title": "An Online Convex Optimization Approach to Blackwell's Approachability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The notion of approachability in repeated games with vector payoffs was\nintroduced by Blackwell in the 1950s, along with geometric conditions for\napproachability and corresponding strategies that rely on computing {\\em\nsteering directions} as projections from the current average payoff vector to\nthe (convex) target set.

We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium of the game\nbetween firms and study the effect of the budgets as well as the network\nstructure on the optimal allocation. We show that at the equilibrium, firms\ninvest more budget on quality when their budgets are close to each other.\nHowever, as the gap between budgets widens, competition in qualities becomes\nless effective and firms spend more of their budget on seeding. We also show\nthat given equal budget of firms, if seeding budget is nonzero for a balanced\ngraph, it will also be nonzero for any other graph, and if seeding budget is\nzero for a star graph it will be zero for any other graph as well. As a\npractical extension, we then consider a case where products have some preset\nqualities that can be only improved marginally. At some point in time, firms\nlearn about the network structure and decide to utilize a limited budget to\nmount their market share by either improving the quality or new seeding some\nagents to incline consumers towards their products.

In this paper, we provide a framework for designing optimal\nmechanisms using optimal transport theory and duality theory. We instantiate\nour framework to obtain conditions under which only pricing the grand bundle is\noptimal in multi-item settings (complementing the work of [Manelli and Vincent\n2006], as well as to characterize optimal two-item mechanisms. We use our\nresults to derive closed-form descriptions of the optimal mechanism in several\ntwo-item settings, exhibiting also a setting where a continuum of lotteries is\nnecessary for revenue optimization but a closed-form representation of the\nmechanism can still be found efficiently using our framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 14:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Daskalakis", "Constantinos", ""], ["Deckelbaum", "Alan", ""], ["Tzamos", "Christos", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02200", "submitter": "Diodato Ferraioli", "authors": "Marek Adamczyk and Allan Borodin and Diodato Ferraioli and Bart de\n  Keijzer and Stefano Leonardi", "title": "Sequential Posted Price Mechanisms with Correlated Valuations", "comments": "29 pages, To appear in WINE 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the revenue performance of sequential posted price mechanisms and\nsome natural extensions, for a general setting where the valuations of the\nbuyers are drawn from a correlated distribution. Sequential posted price\nmechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a\ntake-it-or-leave-it offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted price\nmechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands\nonly one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the\nbuyers. For standard sequential posted price mechanisms, we prove that with the\nvaluation distribution having finite support, no sequential posted price\nmechanism can extract a constant fraction of the optimal expected revenue, even\nwith unlimited supply. We extend this result to the the case of a continuous\nvaluation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously.\nIn fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is\nextractable by a sequential posted price mechanism is proportional to ratio of\nthe highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple\ngeneralizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be\nachieved: if the sequential posted price mechanism has for each buyer the\noption of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then\na Omega(1/max{1,d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d\ndenotes the degree of dependence of the valuations, ranging from complete\nindependence (d=0) to arbitrary dependence (d=n-1). Moreover, when we\ngeneralize the sequential posted price mechanisms further, such that the\nmechanism has the ability to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the i-th buyer\nthat depends on the valuations of all buyers except i's, we prove that a\nconstant fraction (2-sqrt{e})/4~0.088 of the optimal revenue can be always be\nextracted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Mar 2015 19:02:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2015 16:40:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 07:24:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Adamczyk", "Marek", ""], ["Borodin", "Allan", ""], ["Ferraioli", "Diodato", ""], ["de Keijzer", "Bart", ""], ["Leonardi", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02240", "submitter": "Abhinav  Sinha", "authors": "Abhinav Sinha and Achilleas Anastasopoulos", "title": "A General Mechanism Design Methodology for Social Utility Maximization\n  with Linear Constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, Volume 42 Issue 3,\n  December 2014, pages 12-15", "doi": "10.1145/2695533.2695538", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social utility maximization refers to the process of allocating resources in\nsuch a way that the sum of agents' utilities is maximized under the system\nconstraints.

The main question we address is: to what extent\ncan prior knowledge of the underlying metric help in the design? We first\ndemonstrate that there exist graphs (outerplanar) where knowledge of the\nunderlying metric can dramatically improve the performance of good network\ndesign.

Evolutionary stability of a strategy is\na dynamic equilibrium, in which any competing mutated strategy would be wiped\nout from a population.

Understanding the\nnetwork-related factors that affect the evolutionary stability of a strategy\nwould be critical in making accurate predictions about the behaviour of a\nstrategy in a real-world strategic decision making environment. In this work,\nwe evaluate the effect of network topology on the evolutionary stability of a\nstrategy. We focus on two well-known strategies known as the Zero-determinant\nstrategy and the Pavlov strategy. Zero-determinant strategies have been shown\nto be evolutionarily unstable in a well-mixed population of players. We\nidentify that the Zero-determinant strategy may survive, and may even dominate\nin a population of players connected through a non-homogeneous network. We\nintroduce the concept of `topological stability' to denote this phenomenon. We\nargue that not only the network topology, but also the evolutionary process\napplied and the initial distribution of strategies are critical in determining\nthe evolutionary stability of strategies. Further, we observe that topological\nstability could affect other well-known strategies as well, such as the general\ncooperator strategy and the cooperator strategy.
