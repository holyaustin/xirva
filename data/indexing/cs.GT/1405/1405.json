Each firm tries to maximize\nits utility---a function of the production cost as well as market price of the\nproduct---by deciding on the amount of production. In today's dynamic and\ndiverse economy, many firms often compete in more than one market\nsimultaneously, i.e., each market might be shared among a subset of these\nfirms. In this situation, a bipartite graph models the access restriction where\nfirms are on one side, markets are on the other side, and edges demonstrate\nwhether a firm has access to a market or not. We call this game \\emph{Network\nCournot Competition} (NCC). In this paper, we propose algorithms for finding\npure Nash equilibria of NCC games in different situations. First, we carefully\ndesign a potential function for NCC, when the price functions for markets are\nlinear functions of the production in that market. However, for nonlinear price\nfunctions, this approach is not feasible. We model the problem as a nonlinear\ncomplementarity problem in this case, and design a polynomial-time algorithm\nthat finds an equilibrium of the game for strongly convex cost functions and\nstrongly monotone revenue functions. We also explore the class of price\nfunctions that ensures strong monotonicity of the revenue function, and show it\nconsists of a broad class of functions. Moreover, we discuss the uniqueness of\nequilibria in both of these cases which means our algorithms find the unique\nequilibria of the games. Last but not least, when the cost of production in one\nmarket is independent from the cost of production in other markets for all\nfirms, the problem can be separated into several independent classical\n\\emph{Cournot Oligopoly} problems.

In mechanism design, auctions are usually designed\nto incentivize advertisers to bid their truthful valuations and to assure both\nthe advertisers and the auctioneer a non-negative utility. Nonetheless, in\nsponsored search auctions, the click-through-rates (CTRs) of the advertisers\nare often unknown to the auctioneer and thus standard truthful mechanisms\ncannot be directly applied and must be paired with an effective learning\nalgorithm for the estimation of the CTRs. This introduces the critical problem\nof designing a learning mechanism able to estimate the CTRs at the same time as\nimplementing a truthful mechanism with a revenue loss as small as possible\ncompared to an optimal mechanism designed with the true CTRs. Previous work\nshowed that, when dominant-strategy truthfulness is adopted, in single-slot\nauctions the problem can be solved using suitable exploration-exploitation\nmechanisms able to achieve a per-step regret (over the auctioneer's revenue) of\norder $O(T^{-1/3})$ (where T is the number of times the auction is repeated).\nIt is also known that, when truthfulness in expectation is adopted, a per-step\nregret (over the social welfare) of order $O(T^{-1/2})$ can be obtained. In\nthis paper we extend the results known in the literature to the case of\nmulti-slot auctions. In this case, a model of the user is needed to\ncharacterize how the advertisers' valuations change over the slots. We adopt\nthe cascade model that is the most famous model in the literature for sponsored\nsearch auctions. We prove a number of novel upper bounds and lower bounds both\non the auctioneer's revenue loss and social welfare w.r.t. to the VCG auction\nand we report numerical simulations investigating the accuracy of the bounds in\npredicting the dependency of the regret on the auction parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 01:11:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gatti", "Nicola", ""], ["Lazaric", "Alessandro", ""], ["Rocco", "Marco", ""], ["Trov\u00f2", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2826", "submitter": "Jannik Matuschke", "authors": "Jos\\'e R.

To model the\nfollowers' behavior we study both a non-adaptive variant, in which passengers\nselect a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an\nadaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to\nupdate their route.

Data offloading through\nthird-party WiFi or femtocell access points (APs) can effectively alleviate the\ncellular network congestion in a low operational and capital expenditure. This\nsolution requires the cooperation and agreement of mobile cellular network\noperators (MNOs) and AP owners (APOs). In this paper, we model and analyze the\ninteraction among one MNO and multiple APOs (for the amount of MNO's offloading\ndata and the respective APOs' compensations) by using the Nash bargaining\ntheory. Specifically, we introduce a one-to-many bargaining game among the MNO\nand APOs, and analyze the bargaining solution (game equilibrium) systematically\nunder two different bargaining protocols: (i) sequential bargaining, where the\nMNO bargains with APOs sequentially, with one APO at a time, in a given order,\nand (ii) concurrent bargaining, where the MNO bargains with all APOs\nconcurrently. We quantify the benefits for APOs when bargaining sequentially\nand earlier with the MNO, and the losses for APOs when bargaining concurrently\nwith the MNO. We further study the group bargaining scenario where multiple\nAPOs form a group bargaining with the MNO jointly, and quantify the benefits\nfor APOs when forming such a group. Interesting, our analysis indicates that\ngrouping of APOs not only benefits the APOs in the group, but may also benefit\nsome APOs not in the group. Our results shed light on the economic aspects and\nthe possible outcomes of the MNO/APOs interactions, and can be used as a\nroadmap for designing policies for this promising data offloading solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2014 07:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2014 17:47:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 May 2014 04:04:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Iosifidis", "George", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""], ["Tassiulas", "Leandros", ""], ["Li", "Duozhe", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5827", "submitter": "Edward Lui", "authors": "Samantha Leung, Edward Lui, Rafael Pass", "title": "Voting with Coarse Beliefs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The classic Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem says that every strategy-proof\nvoting rule with at least three possible candidates must be dictatorial.\nSimilar impossibility results hold even if we consider a weaker notion of\nstrategy-proofness where voters believe that the other voters' preferences are\ni.i.d.~(independent and identically distributed).

Behavioural economists and psychologists, on the\nother hand, have demonstrated that humans consistently violate the EU postulate\nby switching from risk-averse to risk-taking behaviour. This paradox has led to\nthe development of descriptive theories of decisions, such as the celebrated\nprospect theory, which uses an $S$-shaped value function with concave and\nconvex branches explaining the observed asymmetry. Although successful in\nmodelling human behaviour, these theories appear to contradict the natural set\nof axioms behind the EU postulate. Here we show that the observed asymmetry in\nbehaviour can be explained if, apart from utilities of the outcomes, rational\nagents also value information communicated by random events. We review the main\nideas of the classical value of information theory and its generalizations.\nThen we prove that the value of information is an $S$-shaped function, and that\nits asymmetry does not depend on how the concept of information is defined, but\nfollows only from linearity of the expected utility. Thus, unlike many\ndescriptive and `non-expected' utility theories that abandon the linearity\n(i.e. the `independence' axiom), we formulate a rigorous argument that the von\nNeumann and Morgenstern rational agents should be both risk-averse and\nrisk-taking if they are not indifferent to information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 May 2014 12:57:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Belavkin", "Roman V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5940", "submitter": "Matt Weinberg", "authors": "Constantinos Daskalakis, S.
