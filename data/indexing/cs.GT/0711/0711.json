We report a 3-fold diversification\ntriggered by two inherent features of the sponsored search market, namely,\ncapacity constraints and collusion-vulnerability of current mechanisms. In the\nfirst scenario, we present a comparative study of two models motivated by\ncapacity constraints - one where the additional capacity is provided by\nfor-profit agents, who compete for slots in the original auction, draw traffic,\nand run their own sub-auctions, and the other, where the additional capacity is\nprovided by the auctioneer herself, by essentially acting as a mediator and\nrunning a single combined auction. This study was initiated by us in\n\\cite{SRGR07}, where the mediator-based model was studied. In the present work,\nwe study the auctioneer-based model and show that this model seems inferior to\nthe mediator-based model in terms of revenue or efficiency guarantee due to\nadded capacity. In the second scenario, we initiate a game theoretic study of\ncurrent sponsored search auctions, involving incentive driven mediators who\nexploit the fact that these mechanisms are not collusion-resistant. In\nparticular, we show that advertisers can improve their payoffs by using the\nservices of the mediator compared to directly participating in the auction, and\nthat the mediator can also obtain monetary benefit, without violating incentive\nconstraints from the advertisers who do not use its services. We also point out\nthat the auctioneer can not do very much via mechanism design to avoid such\nfor-profit mediation without losing badly in terms of revenue, and therefore,\nthe mediators are likely to prevail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 08:38:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sudhir Kumar", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Vwani P.", ""], ["Gunadhi", "Himawan", ""], ["Rezaei", "Behnam A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.1055", "submitter": "Klas Olof Daniel Andersson", "authors": "Daniel Andersson, Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen, Peter Bro Miltersen,\n  Troels Bjerre Sorensen", "title": "Simple Recursive Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": null, "abstract": "  We define the class of \"simple recursive games\".

However,\nscenarios where the {\\it capacity}, which we define as \\textit{``the number of\nbidders the auctioneer wants to have a positive probability of getting the\nitem''}, is a fundamental concern are ubiquitous in the information economy.\nFor instance, in sponsored search auctions (SSA's) or in online ad-exchanges,\nthe true value of an ad-slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the\nconversion-rate, which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually\nobtained the ad-slot or not; thus, unless the capacity of the underlying\nauction is large, key parameters, such as true valuations and\nadvertiser-specific conversion rates, will remain unknown or uncertain leading\nto inherent inefficiencies in the system. In general, the same holds true for\nall information goods/digital goods. We initiate a study of mechanisms, which\ntake capacity as a yardstick, in addition to revenue/efficiency.
