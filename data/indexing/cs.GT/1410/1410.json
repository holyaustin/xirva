We prove\na taxonomy theorem that provides a structural characterization of the family of\ncommunity rules that satisfies all eight axioms. The structure is actually\nquite beautiful: these community rules form a bounded lattice under the natural\nintersection and union operations. Our structural theorem is complemented with\na complexity result: while identifying a community by the most selective rule\nof the lattice is in P, deciding if a subset is a community by the most\ncomprehensive rule of the lattice is coNP-complete. Our studies also shed light\non the limitations of defining community rules solely based on preference\naggregation: any aggregation function satisfying Arrow's IIA axiom, or based on\ncommonly used aggregation schemes like the Borda count or generalizations\nthereof, lead to communities which violate at least one of our community\naxioms.

First, we apply, for the first\ntime, a framework borrowed from economics to a problem in the smart grid\nnamely, the design of signaling schemes between a consumer and an electricity\naggregator when these have non-aligned objectives. The consumer's objective is\nto meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the\naggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The\naggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also\nwants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution\nnetwork. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and\nthe quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions\nfor the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract\ninsights of practical interest from the analysis conducted.

By using graph\ntheory and matrix theory, we formulate this conflict as a standard two-player\nzero-sum game and give some properties about it.

We design an algorithm that seeks to form\ncoalitions that will meet both of these requirements: a minimum energy level\nfor the coalitions and a steady production level which leads to finding\nuncorrelated sources of energy to form a coalition. We propose an algorithm\nthat uses graph tools such as correlation graphs or clique percolation to form\ncoalitions that meet such complex constraints. We validate the algorithm\nagainst a random procedure and show that, it not only performs better in term\nof social welfare for the power grid, but also that it is more robust against\nunforeseen production variations due to changing weather conditions for\ninstance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 15:32:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gensollen", "Nicolas", ""], ["Gauthier", "Vincent", ""], ["Marot", "Michel", ""], ["Becker", "Monique", ""]]}]
