On one hand, the advantage of\ngame-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according\nto their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role\nplayed by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is\nthat the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally\nchallenging.

It is shown that the game possesses a\nsocially optimal, and hence also Pareto optimal, solution. Further, an\nalgorithm that can be implemented by each EU in a distributed manner to reach\nthe optimal solution is proposed. Numerical case studies are given that\ndemonstrate beneficial properties of the scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 23:40:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Tushar", "Wayes", ""], ["Yuen", "Chau", ""], ["Smith", "David", ""], ["Poor", "H.

We give results for\none-player and two-player games, and establish complexity bounds and memory\nrequirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Dec 2015 12:52:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2016 10:33:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 15:13:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bouyer", "Patricia", ""], ["Markey", "Nicolas", ""], ["Randour", "Mickael", ""], ["Larsen", "Kim G.", ""], ["Laursen", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08427", "submitter": "Li Han", "authors": "Li Han, David Kempe, Ruixin Qiang", "title": "Incentivizing Exploration with Heterogeneous Value of Money", "comments": "WINE 2015", "journal-ref": "LNCS 9470 (2015) 370-383", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-662-48995-6_27", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Frazier et al. proposed a natural model for crowdsourced\nexploration of different a priori unknown options: a principal is interested in\nthe long-term welfare of a population of agents who arrive one by one in a\nmulti-armed bandit setting. However, each agent is myopic, so in order to\nincentivize him to explore options with better long-term prospects, the\nprincipal must offer the agent money. Frazier et al. showed that a simple class\nof policies called time-expanded are optimal in the worst case, and\ncharacterized their budget-reward tradeoff.\n  The previous work assumed that all agents are equally and uniformly\nsusceptible to financial incentives. In reality, agents may have different\nutility for money. We therefore extend the model of Frazier et al. to allow\nagents that have heterogeneous and non-linear utilities for money. The\nprincipal is informed of the agent's tradeoff via a signal that could be more\nor less informative.\n  Our main result is to show that a convex program can be used to derive a\nsignal-dependent time-expanded policy which achieves the best possible\nLagrangian reward in the worst case. The worst-case guarantee is matched by\nso-called \"Diamonds in the Rough\" instances; the proof that the guarantees\nmatch is based on showing that two different convex programs have the same\noptimal solution for these specific instances. These results also extend to the\nbudgeted case as in Frazier et al. We also show that the optimal policy is\nmonotone with respect to information, i.e., the approximation ratio of the\noptimal policy improves as the signals become more informative.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 14:50:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Li", ""], ["Kempe", "David", ""], ["Qiang", "Ruixin", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09239", "submitter": "Corinne Touati", "authors": "Eitan Altman (MAESTRO), Corinne Touati", "title": "Load Balancing Congestion Games and their Asymptotic Behavior", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A central question in routing games has been to establish conditions for the\nuniqueness of the equilibrium, either in terms of network topology or in terms\nof costs. This question is well understood in two classes of routing games.

In this paper, we study two other frameworks of\nrouting games in which each of several players has an integer number of\nconnections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a\nconstraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a\nsimple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties\nof games within these frameworks. We show in particular that equilibria are non\nunique even in the potential game setting of Rosenthal with strictly convex\nlink costs. We further show that non-symmetric equilibria arise in symmetric\nnetworks. I. INTRODUCTION A central question in routing games has been to\nestablish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of\nthe network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is\ngiven in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two\ndifferent frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing\nintroduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each\nplayer (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on\nthe congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary\ntopology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a\nunique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable\natomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a\npopulation of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the\ncontext of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in\nthe telecom community to model routing decisions of Internet Service Providers\nthat can decide how to split the traffic of their subscribers among various\nroutes so as to minimize network congestion [4]. In this paper we study\nproperties of equilibria in two other frameworks of routing games which exhibit\nsurprising\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 08:21:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Altman", "Eitan", "", "MAESTRO"], ["Touati", "Corinne", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09335", "submitter": "Mathieu Dahan", "authors": "Mathieu Dahan and Saurabh Amin", "title": "Network Flow Routing under Strategic Link Disruptions", "comments": "8 pages, 6 figures, Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Allerton\n  Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Urbana, IL, October 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ALLERTON.2015.7447026", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers a 2-player strategic game for network routing under link\ndisruptions. Player 1 (defender) routes flow through a network to maximize her\nvalue of effective flow while facing transportation costs. Player 2 (attacker)\nsimultaneously disrupts one or more links to maximize her value of lost flow\nbut also faces cost of disrupting links. This game is strategically equivalent\nto a zero-sum game. Linear programming duality and the max-flow min-cut theorem\nare applied to obtain properties that are satisfied in any mixed Nash\nequilibrium. In any equilibrium, both players achieve identical payoffs. While\nthe defender's expected transportation cost decreases in attacker's marginal\nvalue of lost flow, the attacker's expected cost of attack increases in\ndefender's marginal value of effective flow. Interestingly, the expected amount\nof effective flow decreases in both these parameters. These results can be\nviewed as a generalization of the classical max-flow with minimum\ntransportation cost problem to adversarial environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 18:36:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:55:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dahan", "Mathieu", ""], ["Amin", "Saurabh", ""]]}]
