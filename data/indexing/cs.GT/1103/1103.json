When the channels are static, we find that this game\nadmits an exact potential function and this allows us to show that it has a\nunique equilibrium almost surely. Furthermore, using the game's potential\nproperty, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of\nevolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show\nthat if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these\ndynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other\nhand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but\nfluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process. In\nthat case, the associated ergodic game still admits a unique equilibrium, but\nthe learning analysis becomes much more complicated because the replicator\ndynamics are no longer deterministic. Nonetheless, by employing results from\nthe theory of stochastic approximation, we show that users still converge to\nthe game's unique equilibrium.\n  Our analysis hinges on a game-theoretical result which is of independent\ninterest: in finite player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex\npotential function, the replicator dynamics (suitably modified to account for\nnonlinear payoffs) converge to an eps-neighborhood of an equilibrium at time of\norder O(log(1/eps)).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2011 00:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Nov 2011 13:34:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mertikopoulos", "Panayotis", ""], ["Belmega", "Elena V.", ""], ["Moustakas", "Aris L.", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3782", "submitter": "Xingqin Lin", "authors": "Xingqin Lin and Tat-Ming Lok", "title": "Learning Equilibrium Play for Stochastic Parallel Gaussian Interference\n  Channels", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distributed power control for parallel Gaussian interference channels\nrecently draws great interests.
