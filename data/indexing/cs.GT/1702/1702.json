However, the real-world deployment\nof such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges.\nIn this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the\nsecurity of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum\nnetwork interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone\ndelivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to\nfind the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from\nthe vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time.\nMeanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the\npotential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it,\nthus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this\ngame is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the\nvendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the\ngame. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective\nperception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective\nvaluations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery\ntime.

An advertising option is a contract which\ngives its buyer a right but not obligation to enter into transactions to\npurchase page views or link clicks at one or multiple pre-specified prices in a\nspecific future period. Different from typical guaranteed contracts, the option\nbuyer pays a lower upfront fee but can have greater flexibility and more\ncontrol of advertising. Many studies on advertising options so far have been\nrestricted to the situations where the option payoff is determined by the\nunderlying spot market price at a specific time point and the price evolution\nover time is assumed to be continuous. The former leads to a biased calculation\nof option payoff and the latter is invalid empirically for many online\nadvertising slots. This paper addresses these two limitations by proposing a\nnew advertising option pricing framework. First, the option payoff is\ncalculated based on an average price over a specific future period. Therefore,\nthe option becomes path-dependent. The average price is measured by the power\nmean, which contains several existing option payoff functions as its special\ncases. Second, jump-diffusion stochastic models are used to describe the\nmovement of the underlying spot market price, which incorporate several\nimportant statistical properties including jumps and spikes, non-normality, and\nabsence of autocorrelations. A general option pricing algorithm is obtained\nbased on Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, an explicit pricing formula is\nderived for the case when the option payoff is based on the geometric mean.\nThis pricing formula is also a generalized version of several other option\npricing models discussed in related studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:26:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 23:52:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2018 21:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Bowei", ""], ["Kankanhalli", "Mohan", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.06858", "submitter": "Hugo Gimbert", "authors": "Mikolaj Boja\\'nczyk, Hugo Gimbert (LaBRI), Edon Kelmendi (LaBRI)", "title": "Emptiness of zero automata is decidable", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Zero automata are a probabilistic extension of parity automata on infinite\ntrees.

On the other hand, the possibility to execute controlled quantum\noperations allows catching the Robber on almost all classical cop-win graphs.\nBy this, we demonstrate that it is necessary to enrich the structure of\ncorrelations between the players' systems to provide a non-trivial quantized\nCop and Robber game.
