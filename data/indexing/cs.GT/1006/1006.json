The Pareto rate region of the MCO problem is characterized. It is\nshown that for the convexity of the Pareto rate region it is sufficient that\nthe interference-plus-noise covariance matrices (INCMs) of multiple users with\nconflicting objectives approach identity matrix. The latter can be achieved by\nusing either orthogonal signaling, time-sharing, or interference cancellation\nstrategies. In the case of high interference, the interference cancellation is\npreferable in order to increase the Pareto boundary and guarantee the convexity\nof the Pareto rate region. The Nash bargaining (NB) is applied to transform the\nMCO problem into a single-objective one. The characteristics of the NB over\nMIMO interference systems such as the uniqueness, existence of the NB solution,\nand feasibility of the NB set are investigated. When the NB solution exists,\nthe sufficient condition for the corresponding single-objective problem to have\na unique solution is that the INCMs of users approach identity matrix. A simple\nmulti-stage interference cancellation scheme, which leads to a larger convex\nPareto rate region and, correspondingly, a unique NB solution with larger user\nrates compared to the orthogonal and time-sharing signaling schemes, is\nproposed. The convexity of the rate region, effectiveness of the proposed\ninterference cancellation technique, and existence of the NB solution for MIMO\ninterference systems are examined by means of numerical studies. The fairness\nof the NB solution is also demonstrated.

Subsets of the channels are occupied in each of the local\nenvironments surrounding Alice and Bob, as well as in the global environment\nbetween them (Eve). In the absence of a common clock for the two parties, the\ngoal is to devise time-invariant (stationary) strategies minimizing the\nsynchronization time. This emerged from recent applications in discovery of\nwireless devices.\n  We model the problem as follows. There are $N$ channels, each of which is\nopen (unoccupied) with probability $p_1,p_2,q$ independently for Alice, Bob and\nEve respectively. Further assume that $N \\gg 1/(p_1 p_2 q)$ to allow for\nsufficiently many open channels. Both Alice and Bob can detect which channels\nare locally open and every time-slot each of them chooses one such channel for\nan attempted sync. One aims for strategies that, with high probability over the\nenvironments, guarantee a shortest possible expected sync time depending only\non the $p_i$'s and $q$.\n  Here we provide a stationary strategy for Alice and Bob with a guaranteed\nexpected sync time of $O(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$ given that each party also has\nknowledge of $p_1,p_2,q$. When the parties are oblivious of these\nprobabilities, analogous strategies incur a cost of a poly-log factor, i.e.\\\n$\\tilde{O}(1 / (p_1 p_2 q^2))$. Furthermore, this performance guarantee is\nessentially optimal as we show that any stationary strategies of Alice and Bob\nhave an expected sync time of at least $\\Omega(1/(p_1 p_2 q^2))$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jun 2010 22:23:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Azar", "Yossi", ""], ["Gurel-Gurevich", "Ori", ""], ["Lubetzky", "Eyal", ""], ["Moscibroda", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.3417", "submitter": "Kien Nguyen", "authors": "Kien C.
