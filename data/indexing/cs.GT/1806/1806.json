In this paper, we propose a novel inference aided\nreinforcement mechanism that learns to incentivize high-quality data\nsequentially and requires no such prior assumptions. Specifically, we first\ndesign a Gibbs sampling augmented Bayesian inference algorithm to estimate\nworkers' labeling strategies from the collected labels at each step. Then we\npropose a reinforcement incentive learning (RIL) method, building on top of the\nabove estimates, to uncover how workers respond to different payments. RIL\ndynamically determines the payment without accessing any ground-truth labels.\nWe theoretically prove that RIL is able to incentivize rational workers to\nprovide high-quality labels. Empirical results show that our mechanism performs\nconsistently well under both rational and non-fully rational (adaptive\nlearning) worker models. Besides, the payments offered by RIL are more robust\nand have lower variances compared to the existing one-shot mechanisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2018 06:00:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Zehong", ""], ["Liang", "Yitao", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Zhang", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.00218", "submitter": "Warut Suksompong", "authors": "Warut Suksompong", "title": "Asymptotic Existence of Proportionally Fair Allocations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mathematical Social Sciences, 81:62-65 (2016)", "doi": "10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2016.03.007", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fair division has long been an important problem in the economics literature.\nIn this note, we consider the existence of proportionally fair allocations of\nindivisible goods, i.e., allocations of indivisible goods in which every agent\ngets at least her proportionally fair share according to her own utility\nfunction.

A fundamental tension underlying delegation is the fact that the\nagent's interests will typically differ -- potentially significantly -- from\nthe interests of the principal, and as a result the agent may propose solutions\nbased on their own incentives that are inefficient for the principal. A basic\nproblem, therefore, is to design mechanisms by which the principal can\nconstrain the set of proposals they are willing to accept from the agent, to\nensure a certain level of quality for the principal from the proposed solution.\n  In this work, we investigate how much the principal loses -- quantitatively,\nin terms of the objective they are trying to optimize -- when they delegate to\nan agent. We develop a methodology for bounding this loss of efficiency, and\nshow that in a very general model of delegation, there is a family of\nmechanisms achieving a universal bound on the ratio between the quality of the\nsolution obtained through delegation and the quality the principal could obtain\nin an idealized benchmark where they searched for a solution themself.\nMoreover, it is possible to achieve such bounds through mechanisms with a\nnatural threshold structure, which are thus structurally simpler than the\noptimal mechanisms typically considered in the literature on delegation.

In this paper, we consider the data plan design problem for a single\nSP, who provides data plans with different lengths of period for consumers with\ndifferent characteristics of data demands.

In the latter model, the consumers are first categorized into a\nfinite number of groups, and each group of consumers (possibly with different\ntypes) are assigned with a specific period-price combination. We systematically\nanalyze the incentive compatibility (IC) constraint and individual rationality\n(IR) constraint, which ensure each consumer to choose the data plan with the\nperiod-price combination intended for his type.

Five\nvariants of MIRL are considered: uCS-MIRL, advE-MIRL, cooE-MIRL, uCE-MIRL, and\nuNE-MIRL, each distinguished by its solution concept. Problem uCS-MIRL is a\ncooperative game in which the agents employ cooperative strategies that aim to\nmaximize the total game value. In problem uCE-MIRL, agents are assumed to\nfollow strategies that constitute a correlated equilibrium while maximizing\ntotal game value. Problem uNE-MIRL is similar to uCE-MIRL in total game value\nmaximization, but it is assumed that the agents are playing a Nash equilibrium.\nProblems advE-MIRL and cooE-MIRL assume agents are playing an adversarial\nequilibrium and a coordination equilibrium, respectively. We propose novel\napproaches to address these five problems under the assumption that the game\nobserver either knows or is able to accurate estimate the policies and solution\nconcepts for players. For uCS-MIRL, we first develop a characteristic set of\nsolutions ensuring that the observed bi-policy is a uCS and then apply a\nBayesian inverse learning method. For uCE-MIRL, we develop a linear programming\nproblem subject to constraints that define necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the observed policies to be correlated equilibria. The objective is to\nchoose a solution that not only minimizes the total game value difference\nbetween the observed bi-policy and a local uCS, but also maximizes the scale of\nthe solution.

Given the\nexponential nature of these preferences, compact representations are needed and\n($m$)CP-nets are among the most studied ones. Sequential and global voting are\ntwo ways to aggregate preferences over CP-nets. In the former, preferences are\naggregated feature-by-feature. Hence, when preferences have specific feature\ndependencies, sequential voting may exhibit voting paradoxes, i.e., it might\nselect sub-optimal outcomes. To avoid paradoxes in sequential voting, one has\noften assumed the $\\mathcal{O}$-legality restriction, which imposes a shared\ntopological order among all the CP-nets. On the contrary, in global voting,\nCP-nets are considered as a whole during preference aggregation. For this\nreason, global voting is immune from paradoxes, and there is no need to impose\nrestrictions over the CP-nets' topological structure. Sequential voting over\n$\\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has extensively been investigated. On the other\nhand, global voting over non-$\\mathcal{O}$-legal CP-nets has not carefully been\nanalyzed, despite it was stated in the literature that a theoretical comparison\nbetween global and sequential voting was promising and a precise complexity\nanalysis for global voting has been asked for multiple times.

In three environments from the literature - traffic,\ncommunication, and team coordination - we observe that augmenting MARL with a\nsmall amount of imitation learning greatly increases the probability that the\nstrategy found by MARL fits well with the existing social convention.

It is assumed that no RF spectrum is preallocated to\nthe FSO link and only when the link availability is severely impaired by the\ninfrequent adverse weather conditions, i.e. fog, etc., the source can borrow a\nportion of licensed RF spectrum from one of the surrounding RF nodes. Using the\nleased spectrum, the source establishes a dual-hop RF/FSO hybrid link to\nmaintain its throughout to the destination. The proposed system is considered\nto be both spectrum- and power-efficient. A market-equilibrium-based pricing\nprocess is proposed for the spectrum trading between the source and RF nodes.\nThrough extensive performance analysis, it is demonstrated that the proposed\nscheme can significantly improve the average capacity of the system, especially\nwhen the surrounding RF nodes are with low traffic loads. In addition, the\nsystem benefits from involving more RF nodes into the spectrum trading process\nby means of diversity, particularly when the surrounding RF nodes have high\nprobability of being in heavy traffic loads. Furthermore, the application of\nthe proposed system in a realistic scenario is presented based on the weather\nstatistics in the city of Edinburgh, UK.

In order to combat dynamic topology and varying interference of UAV\nnetworks, a robust and distributed learning scheme is proposed. Rather than the\nperfect channel state information (CSI), we introduce uncertainties to\ncharacterize the dynamic channel gains among UAV nodes, which are then\ninterpreted with fuzzy numbers. Instead of the traditional observation space\nwhere the channel capacity is a crisp reward, we implement the learning and\ndecision process in a mapped fuzzy space. This allows the system to achieve a\nsmoother and more robust performance by optimizing in an alternate space. To\nthis end, we design a fuzzy payoffs function (FPF) to describe the fluctuated\nutility, and the problem of POCs assignment is formulated as a fuzzy payoffs\ngame (FPG). Assisted by an attractive property of fuzzy bi-matrix games, the\nexistence of fuzzy Nash equilibrium (FNE) for our formulated FPG is proved.
