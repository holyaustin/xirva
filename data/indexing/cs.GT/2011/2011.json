In the former the input is produced by\nan adversary, while in the latter the algorithm has full distributional\nknowledge of the input. In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in\nbridging these two models by considering data-driven or sample-based versions\nof optimal stopping problems. In this paper, we study such a version of the\nclassic single selection optimal stopping problem, as introduced by Kaplan et\nal. [2020]. In this problem a collection of arbitrary non-negative numbers is\nshuffled in uniform random order. A decision maker gets to observe a fraction\n$p\\in [0,1)$ of the numbers and the remaining are revealed sequentially. Upon\nseeing a number, she must decide whether to take that number and stop the\nsequence, or to drop it and continue with the next number. Her goal is to\nmaximize the expected value with which she stops.\n  On one end of the spectrum, when $p=0$, the problem is essentially equivalent\nto the secretary problem and thus the optimal algorithm guarantees a reward\nwithin a factor $1/e$ of the expected maximum value. We develop an approach,\nbased on the continuous limit of a factor revealing LP, that allows us to\nobtain the best possible rank-based (ordinal) algorithm for any value of $p$.\nNotably, we prove that as $p$ approaches 1, our guarantee approaches 0.745,\nmatching the best possible guarantee for the i.i.d. prophet inequality. This\nimplies that there is no loss by considering this more general combinatorial\nversion without full distributional knowledge. Furthermore, we prove that this\nconvergence is very fast.

In this model, a\nqueue gets to send a packet each step to one of the servers, which will attempt\nto serve the oldest arriving packet, and unprocessed packets are returned to\neach queue. We model this as a repeated game where queues compete for the\ncapacity of the servers, but where the state of the game evolves as the length\nof each queue varies, resulting in a highly dependent random process. Earlier\nwork by the authors [EC'20] shows that with no-regret learners, the system\nneeds twice the capacity as would be required in the coordinated setting to\nensure queue lengths remain stable despite the selfish behavior of the queues.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that this way of evaluating outcomes is myopic:\nif more patient queues choose strategies that selfishly maximize their long-run\nsuccess rate, stability can be ensured with just $\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 1.58$\ntimes extra capacity, better than what is possible assuming the no-regret\nproperty.\n  As these systems induce highly dependent processes, our analysis draws\nheavily on techniques from probability theory. Though these systems are random\nunder any fixed policies by the queues, we show that, surprisingly, these\nsystems have deterministic and explicit asymptotic behavior. We show that the\nasymptotic growth rates of queues can be written as a ratio of a submodular and\nmodular function, which provides significant game-theoretic properties. Our\nequilibrium analysis then relies on a novel deformation argument towards a more\nanalyzable solution that differs significantly from previous price of anarchy\nresults.

In one-dimensional space, the output must be one agent's\nlocation, which is easy to prove in any $n$ agents. However, in $m$-dimensional\nspace ($m\\ge 2$), the situation will be much more complex, with only 2-agent\ncase finished. We show that the output of such a mechanism must satisfy a set\nof equations, and when $p=2$ the output must locate at a sphere with the\nsegment between the two agents as the diameter. Further more, for $n$-agent\nsituations, we find that the simple extension of this the 2-agent situation\ncannot hold when dimension $m>2$ and prove that the well-known general median\nmechanism will give an counter-example. Particularly, in $L_2$ (i.e.,\nEuclidean) space with 2 agents, such a mechanism is rotation-invariant iff it\nis dictatorial; and such a mechanism is anonymous iff it is one of the three\nmechanisms in Section 4. And our tool implies that any such a mechanism has a\ntight lower bound of 2-approximation for maximum cost in any multi-dimensional\nspace.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2020 05:36:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Jianan", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.13163", "submitter": "Gabriel Istrate", "authors": "Gabriel Istrate and Cosmin Bonchi\\c{s}", "title": "Being Central on the Cheap: Stability in Heterogeneous Multiagent\n  Centrality Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cond-mat.dis-nn cs.AI cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study strategic network formation games in which agents attempt to form\n(costly) links in order to maximize their network centrality.
