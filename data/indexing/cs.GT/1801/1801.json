In this paper, we further analyse the second algorithm due to\nJurdzi\\'nski and Lazi\\'c and called the succinct progress measure algorithm. It\nwas presented as an improvement over a previous algorithm called the small\nprogress measure algorithm, using a better data structure.\n  The starting point of this paper is the observation that the underlying data\nstructure for both progress measure algorithms are (subgraph-)universal trees.\nWe show that in fact any universal tree gives rise to a value iteration\nalgorithm \\`a la succinct progress measure, and the complexity of the algorithm\nis proportional to the size of the chosen universal tree. We then show that\nboth algorithms are instances of this generic algorithm for two constructions\nof universal trees, the first of exponential size (for small progress measure)\nand the second of quasipolynomial size (for succinct progress measure).\n  The technical result of this paper is to show that the latter construction is\nasymptotically tight: universal trees have at least quasipolynomial size. This\nsuggests that the succinct progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi\\'nski and\nLazi\\'c is in this framework optimal, and that the polynomial time algorithm\nfor parity games is hiding someplace else.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 16:47:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Fijalkow", "Nathana\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10110", "submitter": "Swaprava Nath", "authors": "Palash Dey, Pravesh K.

This is particularly important for the elections in which\nresults affect the economy of a sizable population. A better prediction of the\ntrue outcome helps reduce the surprise and keeps the voters prepared. This\npaper starts from the basic observation that individuals in the underlying\npopulation build estimates of the distribution of preferences of the whole\npopulation based on their local neighborhoods. The outcome of the election\nleads to a surprise if these local estimates contradict the outcome of the\nelection for some fixed voting rule. To get a quantitative understanding, we\npropose a simple mathematical model of the setting where the individuals in the\npopulation and their connections (through geographical proximity, social\nnetworks etc.) are described by a random graph with connection probabilities\nthat are biased based on the preferences of the individuals. Each individual\nalso has some estimate of the bias in their connections.\n  We show that the election outcome leads to a surprise if the discrepancy\nbetween the estimated bias and the true bias in the local connections exceeds a\ncertain threshold, and confirm the phenomenon that surprising outcomes are\nassociated only with {\\em closely contested elections}. We compare standard\nvoting rules based on their performance on surprise and show that they have\ndifferent behavior for different parts of the population. It also hints at an\nimpossibility that a single voting rule will be less surprising for {\\em all}\nparts of a population. Finally, we experiment with the UK-EU referendum\n(a.k.a.\\ Brexit) dataset that attest some of our theoretical predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jan 2018 17:29:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Palash", ""], ["Kothari", "Pravesh K.", ""], ["Nath", "Swaprava", ""]]}]
