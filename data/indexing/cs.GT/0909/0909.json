We use this characterization to\nderive existence, efficiency and fairness properties of strong Nash equilibria.\nWe then study a class of games that generalizes congestion games with\nbottleneck objectives that we call bottleneck congestion games. We show that\nthese games possess the LIP and thus the above mentioned properties. For\nbottleneck congestion games in networks, we identify cases in which the\npotential function associated with the LIP leads to polynomial time algorithms\ncomputing a strong Nash equilibrium. Finally, we investigate the LIP for\ninfinite games. We show that the LIP does not imply the existence of a\ngeneralized strong ordinal potential, thus, the existence of SNE does not\nfollow. Assuming that the function associated with the LIP is continuous,\nhowever, we prove existence of SNE. As a consequence, we prove that bottleneck\ncongestion games with infinite strategy spaces and continuous cost functions\npossess a strong Nash equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2009 08:45:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Harks", "Tobias", ""], ["Klimm", "Max", ""], ["Moehring", "Rolf H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.0892", "submitter": "Brendan Lucier", "authors": "Brendan Lucier (1) and Allan Borodin (1) ((1) University of Toronto)", "title": "Price of Anarchy for Greedy Auctions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider auctions in which greedy algorithms, paired with first-price or\ncritical-price payment rules, are used to resolve multi-parameter combinatorial\nallocation problems.
