Extensive research into this problem generally\naddresses important issues such as uncertainty and, in crowdsourcing,\nincentives.

Intuitively, one would expect that\n$REV(v, G)\\geq REV(v, F)$ if distribution $G$ stochastically dominates $F$.\nSurprisingly, Hart and Reny (2012) showed that this is not always true even for\nthe simple case when $v$ is additive. A natural question arises: Are these\ndeviations contained within bounds? To what extent may the monotonicity\nintuition still be valid? We present an {approximate monotonicity} theorem for\nthe class of fractionally subadditive (XOS) valuation functions $v$, showing\nthat $REV(v, G)\\geq c\\,REV(v, F)$ if $G$ stochastically dominates $F$ under $v$\nwhere $c>0$ is a universal constant. Previously, approximate monotonicity was\nknown only for the case $n=1$: Babaioff et al.

We further provide a methodology for computing the\ninvariant probability measure in positive-utility games, together with an\nillustration in the context of coordination games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 10:52:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 15:12:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2018 11:42:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2019 10:05:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chasparis", "Georgios C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06071", "submitter": "S.

The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower\nStackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this\ngame, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy\nthat maximizes its profits, while the prosumers act as followers who react by\nchoosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as to optimize their current\nand future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective\ndecision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random\nfuture price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect\ntheory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's valuation of its gains and\nlosses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference\npoint changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future\naspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a\nunique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory (CGT)\nwhich is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended\nto account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an\nNE under certain conditions.

A\nclassic result from auction theory by Bulow and Klemperer [9], states that the\nCompetition Complexity of VCG, in the case of n i.i.d. buyers and a single\nitem, is 1, i.e., it is better to recruit one extra buyer and run a second\nprice auction than to learn exactly the buyers' underlying distribution and run\nthe revenue-maximizing auction tailored to this distribution.\n  In this paper we study the Competition Complexity of dynamic auctions.\nConsider the following setting: a monopolist is auctioning off m items in m\nconsecutive stages to n interested buyers. A buyer realizes her value for item\nk in the beginning of stage k. We prove that the Competition Complexity of\ndynamic auctions is at most 3n, and at least linear in n, even when the buyers'\nvalues are correlated across stages, under a monotone hazard rate assumption on\nthe stage (marginal) distributions. We also prove results on the number of\nadditional buyers necessary for VCG at every stage to be an\n{\\alpha}-approximation of the optimal revenue; we term this number the\n{\\alpha}-approximate Competition Complexity. As a corollary we provide the\nfirst results on prior-independent dynamic auctions. This is, to the best of\nour knowledge, the first non-trivial positive guarantees for simple ex-post IR\ndynamic auctions for correlated stages.\n  A key step towards proving bounds on the Competition Complexity is getting a\ngood benchmark/upper bound to the optimal revenue. To this end, we extend the\nrecent duality framework of Cai et al. [12] to dynamic settings.

Existing methods requires full payment\nfrom SU, which blocked many potential \"buyers\", and thus limited the PU's\nexpected income. To better improve PUs' revenue from spectrum trading in a CRN,\nwe introduce a financing contract, which is similar to a sealed non-cash\nauction that allows SU to do a financing. Unlike previous mechanism designs in\nCRN, the financing contract allows the SU to only pay part of the total amount\nwhen the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the\nspectrum is released and utilized, the SU pays the rest of payment, known as\nthe installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum.\nThe way the financing contract carries out and the sealed non-cash auction\nworks similarly. Thus, contract theory is employed here as the mathematical\nframework to solve the non-cash auction problem and form mutually beneficial\nrelationships between PUs and SUs. As the PU may not have the full\nacknowledgement of the SU's financial status, nor the SU's capability in making\nrevenue, the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arise in the two\nscenarios, respectively.

In\nturn, existing theoretical models often reason about the response of optimal\nprices to changing market characteristics without exploiting all available\ninformation about the demand distribution. Our aim is to develop a theory for\nthe optimization and systematic comparison of prices between different\ninstances of the same market under various forms of knowledge about the\ncorresponding demand distributions. We revisit the classic problem of monopoly\npricing under demand uncertainty in a vertical market with an upstream supplier\nand multiple forms of downstream competition between arbitrary symmetric\nretailers. In all cases, demand uncertainty falls to the supplier who acts\nfirst and sets a uniform price before the retailers observe the realized demand\nand place their orders. Our main methodological contribution is that we express\nthe price elasticity of expected demand in terms of the mean residual demand\n(MRD) function of the demand distribution. This leads to a closed form\ncharacterization of the points of unitary elasticity that maximize the\nsupplier's profits and the derivation of a mild unimodality condition for the\nsupplier's objective function that generalizes the widely used increasing\ngeneralized failure rate (IGFR) condition. A direct implication is that optimal\nprices between different markets can be ordered if the markets can be\nstochastically ordered according to their MRD functions or equivalently, their\nelasticities. Using the above, we develop a systematic framework to compare\noptimal prices between different market instances via the rich theory of\nstochastic orders. This leads to comparative statics that challenge previously\nestablished economic insights about the effects of market size, demand\ntransformations and demand variability on monopolistic prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:49:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Oct 2017 13:22:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 11:05:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2018 15:30:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2019 11:27:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 28 Mar 2020 14:49:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:17:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Leonardos", "Stefanos", ""], ["Melolidakis", "Costis", ""], ["Koki", "Constandina", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.09768", "submitter": "Aidin Ferdowsi", "authors": "Aidin Ferdowsi, Walid Saad, Narayan B.

Spatial facility location models have successfully predicted the\noutcome of competition in a variety of scenarios. In a typical facility\nlocation game, users/customers/voters are mapped to a metric space representing\ntheir preferences, and each player picks a point (facility) in that space. In\nmost facility location games considered in the literature, users are assumed to\nact deterministically: given the facilities chosen by the players, users are\nattracted to their nearest facility. This paper introduces facility location\ngames with probabilistic attraction, dubbed Shapley facility location games,\ndue to a surprising connection to the Shapley value. The specific attraction\nfunction we adopt in this model is aligned with the recent findings of the\nbehavioral economics literature on choice prediction. Given this model, our\nfirst main result is that Shapley facility location games are potential games;\nhence, they possess pure Nash equilibrium. Moreover, the latter is true for any\ncompact user space, any user distribution over that space, and any number of\nplayers. Note that this is in sharp contrast to Hotelling facility location\ngames. In our second main result we show that under the assumption that players\ncan compute an approximate best response, approximate equilibrium profiles can\nbe learned efficiently by the players via dynamics. Our third main result is a\nbound on the Price of Anarchy of this class of games, as well as showing the\nbound is tight.
