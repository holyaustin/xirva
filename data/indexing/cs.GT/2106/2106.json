With\nincreasing data volumes in emerging cloud workloads, it is critical to factor\nin the network costs for transferring workloads across data centers.

However, prior work does not comprehensively and\nsimultaneously consider data center energy costs, data transfer costs, and data\ncenter queueing delay. In this paper, we propose a novel game theory-based\nworkload management framework that takes a holistic approach to the cloud\noperating cost minimization problem by making intelligent scheduling decisions\naware of data transfer costs and the data center queueing delay. Our framework\nperforms intelligent workload management that considers heterogeneity in data\ncenter compute capability, cooling power, interference effects from task\nco-location in servers, time-of-use electricity pricing, renewable energy, net\nmetering, peak demand pricing distribution, and network pricing.

A recent line of research shows that\nenvy-freeness can be achieved if a small quantity of a homogeneous divisible\ngood (money) is introduced into the system, or equivalently, if transfer\npayments are allowed between the agents. A natural question to explore, then,\nis whether transfer payments can be used to provide high welfare in addition to\nenvy-freeness, and if so, how much money is needed to be transferred.\n  We show that for general monotone valuations, there always exists an\nallocation with transfers that is envy-free and whose Nash social welfare (NSW)\nis at least an $e^{-1/e}$-fraction of the optimal Nash social welfare.\nAdditionally, when the agents have additive valuations, an envy-free allocation\nwith negligible transfers and whose NSW is within a constant factor of optimal\ncan be found in polynomial time. Consequently, we demonstrate that the\nseemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved\nsimultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the\nwelfare objective is NSW.

The N-FPN architecture fuses data-driven\nmodeling with provided constraints. Given equilibrium observations of a\ncontextual game, N-FPN parameters are learnt to predict equilibria outcomes\ngiven only the context. We present an end-to-end training scheme for N-FPNs\nthat is simple and memory efficient to implement with existing\nautodifferentiation tools. N-FPNs also exploit a novel constraint decoupling\nscheme to avoid costly projections. Provided numerical examples show the\nefficacy of N-FPNs on atomic and non-atomic games (e.g. traffic routing).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2021 02:55:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Heaton", "Howard", ""], ["McKenzie", "Daniel", ""], ["Li", "Qiuwei", ""], ["Fung", "Samy Wu", ""], ["Osher", "Stanley", ""], ["Yin", "Wotao", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.01019", "submitter": "Avi Cohen", "authors": "Amir Ban, Avi Cohen, Shahar Dobzinski, Itai Ashlagi", "title": "Simple Economies are Almost Optimal", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a seller that intends to auction some item.

We consider a designer\nwho has certain knowledge about the underlying information structure and wants\nto elicit certain information from a group of participants. Our goal is to\ninfer the possibility of having a desirable mechanism based on the primitives\nof the problem.\n  Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a characterization of the\nelicitable multi-task peer prediction problems, assuming that the designer only\nuses scoring mechanisms. Scoring mechanisms are the mechanisms that reward\nparticipants' reports for different tasks separately. The characterization uses\na geometric approach based on the power diagram characterization in the\nsingle-task setting ([Lambert and Shoham, 2009, Frongillo and Witkowski,\n2017]). For general mechanisms, we also give a necessary condition for a\nmulti-task problem to be elicitable.\n  Second, we consider the case when the designer aims to elicit some properties\nthat are linear in the participant's posterior about the state of the world. We\nfirst show that in some cases, the designer basically can only elicit the\nposterior itself. We then look into the case when the designer aims to elicit\nthe participants' posteriors. We give a necessary condition for the posterior\nto be elicitable. This condition implies that the mechanisms proposed by Kong\nand Schoenebeck are already the best we can hope for in their setting, in the\nsense that their mechanisms can solve any problem instance that can possibly be\nelicitable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Jun 2021 16:48:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Shuran", ""], ["Yu", "Fang-Yi", ""], ["Chen", "Yiling", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.03215", "submitter": "Neehar Peri", "authors": "Neehar Peri, Michael J.

If there were no budgetary\nconstraints, bidding truthfully would be an optimal choice for the advertiser.\nHowever, since their budget is limited, the advertiser may want to shade their\nbid downwards in order to preserve their budget for future opportunities, and\nto spread expenditures evenly over time. The literature on online pacing\nproblems mostly focuses on the setting in which the bidder optimizes an\nadditive separable objective, such as the total click-through rate or the\nrevenue of the allocation. In many settings, however, bidders may also care\nabout other objectives which oftentimes are non-separable, and therefore not\namenable to traditional online learning techniques. Building on recent work, we\nstudy the frequent case in which advertisers seek to reach a certain\ndistribution of impressions over a target population of users. We introduce a\nnovel regularizer to achieve this desideratum, and show how to integrate it\ninto an online mirror descent scheme attaining the optimal order of sub-linear\nregret compared to the optimal allocation in hindsight when inputs are drawn\nindependently, from an unknown distribution. Moreover, we show that our\napproach can easily be incorporated in standard existing pacing systems that\nare not usually built for this objective. The effectiveness of our algorithm in\ninternet advertising applications is confirmed by numerical experiments on\nreal-world data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Jun 2021 13:52:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Celli", "Andrea", ""], ["Colini-Baldeschi", "Riccardo", ""], ["Kroer", "Christian", ""], ["Sodomka", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.09580", "submitter": "Kate Donahue", "authors": "Kate Donahue and Jon Kleinberg", "title": "Optimality and Stability in Federated Learning: A Game-theoretic\n  Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CY cs.DC cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm where multiple agents,\neach only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model.

This issue has spurred interest in the design of equitable\nmechanisms that aim to refund the collected toll revenues as lump-sum transfers\nto users. Although revenue refunding has been extensively studied, there has\nbeen no thorough characterization of how such schemes can be designed to\nsimultaneously achieve system efficiency and equity objectives.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap through the study of congestion pricing and\nrevenue refunding (CPRR) schemes in non-atomic congestion games. We first\ndevelop CPRR schemes, which in comparison to the untolled case, simultaneously\n(i) increase system efficiency and (ii) decrease wealth inequality, while being\n(iii) user-favorable: irrespective of their initial wealth or values-of-time\n(which may differ across users) users would experience a lower travel cost\nafter the implementation of the proposed scheme. We then characterize the set\nof optimal user-favorable CPRR schemes that simultaneously maximize system\nefficiency and minimize wealth inequality. These results assume a well-studied\nbehavior model of users minimizing a linear function of their travel times and\ntolls, without considering refunds. We also study a more complex behavior model\nwherein users are influenced by and react to the amount of refund that they\nreceive. Although, in general, the two models can result in different outcomes\nin terms of system efficiency and wealth inequality, we establish that those\noutcomes coincide when the aforementioned optimal CPRR scheme is implemented.\nOverall, our work demonstrates that through appropriate refunding policies we\ncan achieve system efficiency while reducing wealth inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:12:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jalota", "Devansh", ""], ["Solovey", "Kiril", ""], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Karthik", ""], ["Zoepf", "Stephen", ""], ["Balakrishnan", "Hamsa", ""], ["Pavone", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.10412", "submitter": "Devansh Jalota", "authors": "Devansh Jalota, Marco Pavone, Qi Qi, Yinyu Ye", "title": "Fisher Markets with Linear Constraints: Equilibrium Properties and\n  Efficient Distributed Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The Fisher market is one of the most fundamental models for resource\nallocation problems in economic theory, wherein agents spend a budget of\ncurrency to buy goods that maximize their utilities, while producers sell\ncapacity constrained goods in exchange for currency.

Our model\nstructures this problem as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking,\nthe agent traverses a directed acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions,\npaying costs for its actions as it tries to reach a target node containing a\nspecified reward. The agent's sunk cost bias is modeled by a cost that it\nincurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent decides to stop traversing\nthe graph, it incurs a cost of $\\lambda \\cdot C_{sunk}$, where ${\\lambda \\geq\n0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and $C_{sunk}$ is the\nsum of costs already invested.\n  We analyze the behavior of two types of agents: naive agents that are unaware\nof their bias, and sophisticated agents that are aware of it.

We consider the probability (under\ndifferent probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly\ndrawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different\nsizes). We argue that in order to choose between a voting method that satisfies\nPI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation\nconditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also\nrelativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the\nprobability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute\nfrequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and\nrelativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much\nof a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their\ndesire to see their favorite candidate elected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2021 02:46:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Holliday", "Wesley H.", "", "University of California, Berkeley"], ["Pacuit", "Eric", "", "University of Maryland"]]}, {"id": "2106.11503", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Gabriel Istrate (West University of Timisoara, Romania)", "title": "Game-Theoretic Models of Moral and Other-Regarding Agents (extended\n  abstract)", "comments": "In Proceedings TARK 2021, arXiv:2106.10886.

Now, the\nindividual scaled Vickrey Payments (ISV) are computed by maximizing the scaling\nfactors lexicographically. In this paper we show that the ISV payments are in\nfact identical to a weighted EA, thus exhibiting an interesting connection\nbetween EA and VP. With this, we conclude the uniqueness of the ISV payments\nand provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing a special weighted EA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 07:51:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gr\u00e4f", "N.", ""], ["Heller", "T.", ""], ["Krumke", "S.
