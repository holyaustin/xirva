Specifically, it has been known for more than 20\nyears that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a\nrepeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a\nnormal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form\ngames by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect\ninformation. Because of the sequential nature and presence of private\ninformation in the game, correlation in extensive-form games possesses\nsignificantly different properties than its counterpart in normal-form games,\nmany of which are still open research directions. Extensive-form correlated\nequilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form counterpart\nto the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games.\nCompared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are\nsignificantly more complex, as the correlation device must keep into account\nthe evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout\nthe game. Due to that significant added complexity, the existence of uncoupled\nlearning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research\nquestion for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving\nthe first uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge to the set of EFCEs in\nn-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that\neach iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree,\nand that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics,\nthe empirical frequency of play is proven to be a O(T^-0.5)-approximate EFCE\nwith high probability after T game repetitions, and an EFCE almost surely in\nthe limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Apr 2021 02:26:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 06:03:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Farina", "Gabriele", ""], ["Celli", "Andrea", ""], ["Marchesi", "Alberto", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.01828", "submitter": "Esmaeil Delfarazpahlevanloo", "authors": "Ruben Becker, Gianlorenzo D'Angelo, Esmaeil Delfaraz and Hugo Gilbert", "title": "When Can Liquid Democracy Unveil the Truth?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.SI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate the so-called ODP-problem that has been\nformulated by Caragiannis and Micha [10].

A Shapley value based scheme is presented to\nredistribute the benefit of reordering among the transactions efficiently and\nfairly. In the latter, we model the waiting time of a strategic transaction on\na single payment channel as the first passage time problem in queueing theory\nwhen the transaction value is higher than the edge capacity upon its arrival.\nBy capturing the capacity dynamics, we are able to calculate the recursive\nexpression of waiting for time distribution that is useful to gauge a user's\ncost of patience.

Moreover, we show that there\nis no negative example in which the difference between the number of items and\nthe number of agents is smaller than six, and that the gap (of $\\frac{1}{40}$)\nof our example is worst possible among all instances with nine items.\n  For $n \\ge 4$ agents, we show examples in which at least one agent does not\nget more than a $1 - \\frac{1}{n^4}$ fraction of her maximin share. In the\ninstances designed by Kurokawa, Procaccia and Wang, the gap is exponentially\nsmall in $n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Apr 2021 10:01:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Feige", "Uriel", ""], ["Sapir", "Ariel", ""], ["Tauber", "Laliv", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.05069", "submitter": "Satpreet Harcharan Singh", "authors": "Satpreet H.

Here,\nwe investigate the effect of threshold nonlinearities on the possibilities of\nexerting unilateral control in finitely repeated n-player public goods games\nand snowdrift games. These models can describe situations in which a collective\neffort is necessary in order for a benefit to be created. We identify\nconditions in terms of a cooperator threshold for the existence of generous,\nextortionate and equalizing zero-determinant (ZD) strategies. Our results show\nthat, for both games, the thresholds prevent equalizing ZD strategies from\nexisting. In the snowdrift game, introducing a cooperator threshold has no\neffect on the region of feasible extortionate ZD strategies. For extortionate\nstrategies in the public goods game, the threshold only restricts the region of\nenforceable strategies for small values of the public goods multiplier.\nGenerous ZD strategies exist for both games, but introducing a cooperator\nthreshold forces the slope more towards the value of a fair strategy, where the\nplayer has approximately the same payoff as the average payoff of his\nopponents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Feb 2021 09:56:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Frieswijk", "Kathinka", ""], ["Govaert", "Alain", ""], ["Cao", "Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11275", "submitter": "Junyao Zhao", "authors": "Aviad Rubinstein and Junyao Zhao", "title": "The Randomized Communication Complexity of Randomized Auctions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the communication complexity of incentive compatible\nauction-protocols between a monopolist seller and a single buyer with a\ncombinatorial valuation function over $n$ items.

The behavior of agents in these games depends\non a time-homogeneous type and a time-varying state, which are private to each\nagent and characterize their available actions and motifs. We consider finite\ntype, state, and action spaces. On the individual agent level, the state\nevolves in discrete-time as the agent participates in interactions, in which\nthe state transitions are affected by the agent's individual action and the\ndistribution of other agents' states and actions. On the societal level, we\nconsider that the agents form a continuum of mass and that interactions occur\neither synchronously or asynchronously, and derive models for the evolution of\nthe agents' state distribution. We characterize the stationary equilibrium as\nthe solution concept in our games, which is a condition where all agents are\nplaying their best response and the state distribution is stationary. At least\none stationary equilibrium is guaranteed to exist in every dynamic population\ngame. Our approach intersects with previous works on anonymous sequential\ngames, mean-field games, and Markov decision evolutionary games, but it is\nnovel in how we relate the dynamic setting to a classical, static population\ngame setting. In particular, stationary equilibria can be reduced to standard\nNash equilibria in classical population games. This simplifies the analysis of\nthese games and inspires the formulation of an evolutionary model for the\ncoupled dynamics of both the agents' actions and states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2021 21:13:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Elokda", "Ezzat", ""], ["Censi", "Andrea", ""], ["Bolognani", "Saverio", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.14740", "submitter": "Daniel Freund", "authors": "Hao Yi Ong, Daniel Freund, Davide Crapis", "title": "Driver Positioning and Incentive Budgeting with an Escrow Mechanism for\n  Ridesharing Platforms", "comments": "Forthcoming in INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Drivers on the Lyft rideshare platform do not always know where the areas of\nsupply shortage are in real time. This lack of information hurts both riders\ntrying to find a ride and drivers trying to determine how to maximize their\nearnings opportunity. Lyft's Personal Power Zone (PPZ) product helps the\ncompany to maintain high levels of service on the platform by influencing the\nspatial distribution of drivers in real time via monetary incentives that\nencourage them to reposition their vehicles. The underlying system that powers\nthe product has two main components: (1) a novel 'escrow mechanism' that tracks\navailable incentive budgets tied to locations within a city in real time, and\n(2) an algorithm that solves the stochastic driver positioning problem to\nmaximize short-run revenue from riders' fares. The optimization problem is a\nmultiagent dynamic program that is too complicated to solve optimally for our\nlarge-scale application. Our approach is to decompose it into two subproblems.\nThe first determines the set of drivers to incentivize and where to incentivize\nthem to position themselves. The second determines how to fund each incentive\nusing the escrow budget. By formulating it as two convex programs, we are able\nto use commercial solvers that find the optimal solution in a matter of\nseconds.
