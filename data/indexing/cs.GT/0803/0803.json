A simple game or a\nyes-no voting system is a set of rules that specifies exactly which collections\nof ``yea'' votes yield passage of the issue at hand. A collection of ``yea''\nvoters forms a winning coalition.\n  We are interested on performing a complexity analysis of problems on such\ngames depending on the game representation. We consider four natural explicit\nrepresentations, winning, loosing, minimal winning, and maximal loosing. We\nfirst analyze the computational complexity of obtaining a particular\nrepresentation of a simple game from a different one. We show that some cases\nthis transformation can be done in polynomial time while the others require\nexponential time. The second question is classifying the complexity for testing\nwhether a game is simple or weighted. We show that for the four types of\nrepresentation both problem can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we\nprovide results on the complexity of testing whether a simple game or a\nweighted game is of a special type. In this way, we analyze strongness,\nproperness, decisiveness and homogeneity, which are desirable properties to be\nfulfilled for a simple game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 10:20:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Freixas", "Josep", ""], ["Molinero", "Xavier", ""], ["Olsen", "Martin", ""], ["Serna", "Maria", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0412", "submitter": "Alex Feigel", "authors": "A.

Our goal\nin this paper is to carefully model and quantify the impact of such\nexternalities on the investment in, and deployment of, security features and\nprotocols in a network.\n  Specifically, we study a network of interconnected agents, which are subject\nto epidemic risks such as those caused by propagating viruses and worms, and\nwhich can decide whether or not to invest some amount to self-protect and\ndeploy security solutions. We make three contributions in the paper. First, we\nintroduce a general model which combines an epidemic propagation model with an\neconomic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities.\nSecond, borrowing ideas and techniques used in statistical physics, we\nintroduce a Local Mean Field (LMF) model, which extends the standard mean-field\napproximation to take into account the correlation structure on local\nneighborhoods. Third, we solve the LMF model in a network with externalities,\nand we derive analytic solutions for sparse random graphs, for which we obtain\nasymptotic results. We explicitly identify the impact of network externalities\non the decision to invest in and deploy security features. In other words, we\nidentify both the economic and network properties that determine the adoption\nof security technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 18:29:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2008 09:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lelarge", "Marc", ""], ["Bolot", "Jean", ""]]}]
