There are n agents located on\nthat interval, divided into two types: type 1 agents, who wish for the facility\nto be as far from them as possible, and type 2 agents, who wish for the\nfacility to be as close to them as possible. Our goal is to maximize a form of\naggregated social benefit: maxisum- the sum of the agents' utilities, or the\negalitarian objective- the minimal agent utility. The strategic aspect of the\nproblem is that the agents' locations are not known to us, but rather reported\nto us by the agents- an agent might misreport his location in an attempt to\nmove the facility away from or towards to his true location. We therefore\nrequire the facility-locating mechanism to be strategyproof, namely that\nreporting truthfully is a dominant strategy for each agent. As simply\nmaximizing the social benefit is generally not strategyproof, our goal is to\ndesign strategyproof mechanisms with good approximation ratios.\n  For the maxisum objective, in the deterministic setting, we provide a\nbest-possible 3- approximate strategyproof mechanism; in the randomized\nsetting, we provide a 23/13- approximate strategyproof mechanism and a lower\nbound of \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}.

To the best of our knowledge,\nthat is the sharpest bound for the termination time of such dynamics that\nremoves dependency of the termination time from the dimension of the ambient\nspace. This answers an open question in [1] on how to obtain a tighter upper\nbound for the termination time. Furthermore, we study the asynchronous\nHegselmann-Krause model from a novel game-theoretic approach and show that the\nevolution of an asynchronous Hegselmann-Krause model is equivalent to a\nsequence of best response updates in a well-designed potential game. We then\nprovide a polynomial upper bound for the expected time and expected number of\nswitching topologies until the dynamic reaches an arbitrarily small\nneighborhood of its equilibrium points, provided that the agents update\nuniformly at random. This is a step toward analysis of heterogeneous\nHegselmann-Krause dynamics. Finally, we consider the heterogeneous\nHegselmann-Krause dynamics and provide a necessary condition for the finite\ntermination time of such dynamics. In particular, we sketch some future\ndirections toward more detailed analysis of the heterogeneous Hegselmann-Krause\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 22:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Etesami", "Seyed Rasoul", ""], ["Basar", "Tamer", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.6565", "submitter": "Panayotis Mertikopoulos", "authors": "Mario Bravo and Panayotis Mertikopoulos", "title": "On the robustness of learning in games with stochastically perturbed\n  payoff observations", "comments": "36 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.GT math.PR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the scarcity of accurate payoff feedback in practical\napplications of game theory, we examine a class of learning dynamics where\nplayers adjust their choices based on past payoff observations that are subject\nto noise and random disturbances.

For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma, people often\ncooperate. Are there rules underlying cooperative behavior? In an effort to\nanswer this question, we propose a new equilibrium concept: perfect cooperative\nequilibrium (PCE), and two related variants: max-PCE and cooperative\nequilibrium. PCE may help explain players' behavior in games where cooperation\nis observed in practice. A player's payoff in a PCE is at least as high as in\nany NE. However, a PCE does not always exist. We thus consider {\\alpha}-PCE,\nwhere {\\alpha} takes into account the degree of cooperation; a PCE is a 0-PCE.\nEvery game has a Pareto-optimal max-PCE (M-PCE); that is, an {\\alpha}-PCE for a\nmaximum {\\alpha}. We show that M-PCE does well at predicting behavior in quite\na few games of interest. We also consider cooperative equilibrium (CE), another\ngeneralization of PCE that takes punishment into account. Interestingly, all\nPareto-optimal M-PCE are CE. We prove that, in 2-player games, a PCE (if it\nexists), a M-PCE, and a CE can all be found in polynomial time using bilinear\nprogramming. This is a contrast to Nash equilibrium, which is PPAD complete\neven in 2-player games [Chen, Deng, and Teng 2009].
