Pricing mechanisms are used as a design tool\nto ensure that the Nash equilibrium of a fairly general class of noncooperative\ngames satisfies certain global objectives such as welfare maximization or\nachieving a certain level of quality-of-service (QoS). The class of games\nconsidered provide a theoretical basis for decentralized resource allocation\nand control problems including network congestion control, wireless uplink\npower control, and optical power control. The game design problem is analyzed\nunder different knowledge assumptions (full versus limited information) and\ndesign objectives (QoS versus utility maximization) for separable and\nnon-separable utility functions. The ``price of anarchy'' is shown not to be an\ninherent feature of full-information games that incorporate pricing mechanisms.\nMoreover, a simple linear pricing is shown to be sufficient for design of Nash\nequilibrium according to a chosen global objective for a fairly general class\nof games. Stability properties of the game and pricing dynamics are studied\nunder the assumption of time-scale separation and in two separate time-scales.\nThus, sufficient conditions are derived, which allow the designer to place the\nNash equilibrium solution or to guide the system trajectory to a desired region\nor point. The obtained results are illustrated with a number of examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 12:17:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alpcan", "Tansu", ""], ["Pavel", "Lacra", ""], ["Stefanovic", "Nem", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0484", "submitter": "Blaine Nelson", "authors": "Blaine Nelson and Benjamin I.

This allows the network to serve as\na decentralized payment infrastructure---arbitrary payments can be routed\nthrough the network by passing IOUs between trusting nodes in their respective\ncurrencies---and obviates the need for a common currency. Nodes can repeatedly\ntransact with each other and pay for the transaction using trusted currency. A\nnatural question to ask in this setting is: how long can the network sustain\nliquidity, i.e., how long can the network support the routing of payments\nbefore credit dries up? We answer this question in terms of the long term\nfailure probability of transactions for various network topologies and credit\nvalues.\n  We prove that the transaction failure probability is independent of the path\nalong which transactions are routed. We show that under symmetric transaction\nrates, the transaction failure probability in a number of well-known graph\nfamilies goes to zero as the size, density or credit capacity of the network\nincreases. We also show via simulations that even networks of small size and\ncredit capacity can route transactions with high probability if they are\nwell-connected.

We postulate that any such\nprobability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function\nbased on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic\nmappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique\nconversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information).\nMoreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational\nprinciple: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure\nmaximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures\ncan then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new\nconstraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a\ncriterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a\ntarget utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference\ndistribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive\ncontrol problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When\nresource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered.

In order for the\nquantum game to reduce properly to the classical game, we require legal quantum\nmoves to be orthogonal to all previous moves. We also admit interference\neffects, by squaring the sum of amplitudes over all moves by a player to\ncompute his or her occupation level of a given site. A player wins when the\nsums of occupations along any of the eight straight lines we can draw in the $3\n\\times 3$ grid is greater than three. We play the quantum tic-tac-toe first\nrandomly, and then deterministically, to explore the impact different opening\nmoves, end games, and different combinations of offensive and defensive\nstrategies have on the outcome of the game. In contrast to the classical\ntic-tac-toe, the deterministic quantum game does not always end in a draw. In\ncontrast also to most classical two-player games of no chance, it is possible\nfor Player 2 to win. More interestingly, we find that Player 1 enjoys an\noverwhelming quantum advantage when he opens with a quantum move, but loses\nthis advantage when he opens with a classical move. We also find the quantum\nblocking move, which consists of a weighted superposition of moves that the\nopponent could use to win the game, to be very effective in denying the\nopponent his or her victory. We then speculate what implications these results\nmight have on quantum information transfer and portfolio optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:50:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Leaw", "J.
