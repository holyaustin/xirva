Using game theoretic tools,\na useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power\nallocation when users know only their own channel (while perfect channel state\ninformation is assumed at the base station). We consider the realistic case of\nfrequency selective channels for uplink CDMA. This scenario illustrates the\ncase of decentralized schemes, where limited information on the network is\navailable at the terminal. Various receivers are considered, namely the Matched\nfilter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to\nderive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the\nnumber of mobiles becomes large and the spreading length increases. To that end\ntwo asymptotic methodologies are combined. The first is asymptotic random\nmatrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions of the impact of\nall other mobiles on any given tagged mobile. The second is the theory of\nnon-atomic games which computes good approximations of the Nash equilibrium as\nthe number of mobiles grows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2007 09:53:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bonneau", "Nicolas", ""], ["Debbah", "M\u00e9rouane", ""], ["Altman", "Eitan", ""], ["Hj\u00f8rungnes", "Are", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0568", "submitter": "Gesualdo Scutari", "authors": "Gesualdo Scutari, D.P.

In particular, the estimations\nof the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to\nlower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine\nto potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new\nadvertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction.\nBoth these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary\nfor the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy\ncan be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer.\nWe compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism\nat their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of\nuncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per\nimpression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user\nexperience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus\nthe proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while\nincorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish\nand are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is\nessentially achieved via mechanism design.
