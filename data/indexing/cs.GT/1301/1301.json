Compared to other game-theoretic representations, such as\nstrategic or extensive forms, G nets are more structured and more compact; more\nfundamentally, G nets constitute a computationally advantageous framework for\nstrategic inference, as both probability and utility independencies are\ncaptured in the structure of the network and can be exploited in order to\nsimplify the inference process. An important aspect of multi-agent reasoning is\nthe identification of some or all of the strategic equilibria in a game; we\npresent original convergence methods for strategic equilibrium which can take\nadvantage of strategic separabilities in the G net structure in order to\nsimplify the computations. Specifically, we describe a method which identifies\na unique equilibrium as a function of the game payoffs, and one which\nidentifies all equilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["La Mura", "Pierfrancesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3886", "submitter": "David M Pennock", "authors": "David M.

In particular,\nwhen following the suggestion of Machina and McClennen of giving up\nseparability (also known as consequentialism), which requires the choice of a\nsubstrategy in a subtree to depend only on data relevant to that subtree, one\nmust renounce to the use of dynamic programming, since Bellman's principle is\nno longer valid. An interpretation of McClennen's resolute choice, based on\ncooperation between the successive Selves of the decision maker, is proposed.\nImplementations of resolute choice which prevent Money Pumps negative prices of\ninformation or, more generally, choices of dominated strategies, while\nremaining computationally tractable, are proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jaffray", "Jean-Yves", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7592", "submitter": "Krzysztof R.

We identify and analyze\nhere four types of paradoxes that can arise in these networks. To this end, we\nuse social network games that we recently introduced in arxiv:1202.2209. These\nparadoxes shed light on possible inefficiencies arising when one modifies the\nsets of products available to the agents forming a social network. One of the\nparadoxes corresponds to the well-known Braess paradox in congestion games and\nshows that by adding more choices to a node, the network may end up in a\nsituation that is worse for everybody. We exhibit a dual version of this, where\nremoving available choices from someone can eventually make everybody better\noff. The other paradoxes that we identify show that by adding or removing a\nproduct from the choice set of some node may lead to permanent instability.\nFinally, we also identify conditions under which some of these paradoxes cannot\narise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 12:31:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2013 12:11:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Apt", "Krzysztof R.", ""], ["Markakis", "Evangelos", ""], ["Simon", "Sunil", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7700", "submitter": "Julien Reichert", "authors": "Arjun Arul, Julien Reichert", "title": "The Complexity of Robot Games on the Integer Line", "comments": "In Proceedings QAPL 2013, arXiv:1306.2413", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 117, 2013, pp. 132-148", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.117.9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In robot games on Z, two players add integers to a counter.
