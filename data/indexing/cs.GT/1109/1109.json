This approximation ratio is the best possible even\nfor non-truthful algorithms, assuming $P \\neq NP$.

Our contention is that in fact the airlines themselves\nare the best judge of how to achieve efficiency and our market-based solution\ngives them the ability to pay, at the going rate, to buy away the desired\namount of delay on a per flight basis.\n  The issue of fairness is simply finessed away by our solution -- whoever pays\ngets smaller delays. We show how our solution has the potential of enabling\ntravelers from a large spectrum of affordability and punctuality requirements\nto achieve an end that is most desirable to them.\n  Our market model is particularly simple, requiring only one parameter per\nflight from the airline company. Furthermore, we show that it admits a\ncombinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithm for computing an equilibrium\nlanding schedule and prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 22:54:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Vazirani", "Vijay V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5542", "submitter": "Dusko Pavlovic", "authors": "Dusko Pavlovic", "title": "Gaming security by obscurity", "comments": "15 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables; final version appeared in the\n  Proceedings of New Security Paradigms Workshop 2011 (ACM 2011); typos\n  corrected", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.GT cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Shannon sought security against the attacker with unlimited computational\npowers: *if an information source conveys some information, then Shannon's\nattacker will surely extract that information*.

This idea became one of the greatest new\nparadigms in computer science, and led to modern cryptography.\n  Shannon also sought security against the attacker with unlimited logical and\nobservational powers, expressed through the maxim that \"the enemy knows the\nsystem\". This view is still endorsed in cryptography. The popular formulation,\ngoing back to Kerckhoffs, is that \"there is no security by obscurity\", meaning\nthat the algorithms cannot be kept obscured from the attacker, and that\nsecurity should only rely upon the secret keys. In fact, modern cryptography\ngoes even further than Shannon or Kerckhoffs in tacitly assuming that *if there\nis an algorithm that can break the system, then the attacker will surely find\nthat algorithm*. The attacker is not viewed as an omnipotent computer any more,\nbut he is still construed as an omnipotent programmer.\n  So the Diffie-Hellman step from unlimited to limited computational powers has\nnot been extended into a step from unlimited to limited logical or programming\npowers. Is the assumption that all feasible algorithms will eventually be\ndiscovered and implemented really different from the assumption that everything\nthat is computable will eventually be computed? The present paper explores some\nways to refine the current models of the attacker, and of the defender, by\ntaking into account their limited logical and programming powers.
