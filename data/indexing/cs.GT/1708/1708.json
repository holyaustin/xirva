In our\nsettings, buyers arrive online and purchase bundles of items; buyers' values\nfor the bundles are drawn from known distributions. This problem is closely\nrelated to the so-called prophet-inequality of Krengel and Sucheston and its\nextensions in recent literature. Motivated by applications to cloud economics,\nwe consider two kinds of buyer preferences. In the first, items correspond to\ndifferent units of time at which a resource is available; the items are\narranged in a total order and buyers desire intervals of items. The second\ncorresponds to bandwidth allocation over a tree network; the items are edges in\nthe network and buyers desire paths.\n  Because buyers' preferences have complementarities in the settings we\nconsider, recent constant-factor approximations via item prices do not apply,\nand indeed strong negative results are known. We develop static, anonymous\nbundle pricing mechanisms.\n  For the interval preferences setting, we show that static, anonymous bundle\npricings achieve a sublogarithmic competitive ratio, which is optimal (within\nconstant factors) over the class of all online allocation algorithms, truthful\nor not. For the path preferences setting, we obtain a nearly-tight logarithmic\ncompetitive ratio. Both of these results exhibit an exponential improvement\nover item pricings for these settings. Our results extend to settings where the\nseller has multiple copies of each item, with the competitive ratio decreasing\nlinearly with supply. Such a gradual tradeoff between supply and the\ncompetitive ratio for welfare was previously known only for the single item\nprophet inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:12:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2018 17:55:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2018 02:46:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chawla", "Shuchi", ""], ["Miller", "J.

Interactive proofs are increasingly used as a\nframework to design protocols for computation outsourcing.\n  Existing interactive-proof games largely fall into two categories: either as\ngames of cooperation such as multi-prover interactive proofs and cooperative\nrational proofs, where the provers work together as a team; or as games of\nconflict such as refereed games, where the provers directly compete with each\nother in a zero-sum game. Neither of these extremes truly capture the strategic\nnature of service providers in outsourcing applications.

We define a strong notion of backwards induction as our solution\nconcept to analyze the resulting extensive-form game with imperfect\ninformation.\n  Our protocols provide utility gap guarantees, which are analogous to\nsoundness gap in classic interactive proofs.

We propose a\nrelaxation of the EF condition where only winners are envy-free, and further\nrelax the MC condition so that unallocated goods are priced at least at the\nreserve. We call this new solution concept Restricted Envy-Free Pricing (REFP).\nWe investigate what REFP entails for single-minded bidders, and show that for\nsize-interchangeable bidders (a generalization of single-minded introduced in\nthis paper) we can compute a REFP in polynomial time, given a fixed allocation.\nAs in the study of EFP, we remain interested in maximizing seller revenue.\nInstead of computing an outcome that simultaneously yields an allocation and\ncorresponding prices, one could first solve for an allocation that respects a\nreserve price, and then solve for a corresponding set of supporting prices,\neach one at least the reserve. This two-step process fails in the case of EFP\nsince, given a fixed allocation, envy-free prices need not exist. However,\nrestricted envy-free prices always exist...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 06:53:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Viqueira", "Enrique Areyan", ""], ["Greenwald", "Amy", ""], ["Naroditskiy", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.03200", "submitter": "Lin Gao", "authors": "Lin Gao, Jianwei Huang", "title": "Achieving an Efficient and Fair Equilibrium Through Taxation", "comments": "This manuscript serves as the technical report for the paper with the\n  same title published in APCC 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is well known that a game equilibrium can be far from efficient or fair,\ndue to the misalignment between individual and social objectives. The focus of\nthis paper is to design a new mechanism framework that induces an efficient and\nfair equilibrium in a general class of games. To achieve this goal, we propose\na taxation framework, which first imposes a tax on each player based on the\nperceived payoff (income), and then redistributes the collected tax to other\nplayers properly. By turning the tax rate, this framework spans the continuum\nspace between strategic interactions (of selfish players) and altruistic\ninteractions (of unselfish players), hence provides rich modeling\npossibilities. The key challenge in the design of this framework is the proper\ntaxing rule (i.e., the tax exemption and tax rate) that induces the desired\nequilibrium in a wide range of games. First, we propose a flat tax rate (i.e.,\na single tax rate for all players), which is necessary and sufficient for\nachieving an efficient equilibrium in any static strategic game with common\nknowledge. Then, we provide several tax exemption rules that achieve some\ntypical fairness criterions (such as the Max-min fairness) at the equilibrium.\nWe further illustrate the implementation of the framework in the game of\nPrisoners' Dilemma.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 13:13:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.03259", "submitter": "Yiru Zhang", "authors": "Yiru Zhang (1), Tassadit Bouadi (1), Arnaud Martin (1) ((1) DRUID,\n  UR1)", "title": "Preference fusion and Condorcet's Paradox under uncertainty", "comments": "International Conference on Information Fusion, Jul 2017, Xi'an,\n  China", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Facing an unknown situation, a person may not be able to firmly elicit\nhis/her preferences over different alternatives, so he/she tends to express\nuncertain preferences.

In the\nformer case, we formulate the assignment problem as a generalized Knapsack\nproblem and solve the problem by using classic algorithms. In the latter case,\nwe propose a truthful and optimal double auction mechanism, built upon the\nabove Knapsack assignment problem, to elicit the private information of both\nusers and tasks and meanwhile achieve the same optimal assignment as under\ninformation symmetry. Simulation results show by allowing data reuse among\ntasks, the social welfare can be increased up to 100~380%, comparing with those\nwithout data reuse. We further show that the proposed double auction is not\nbudget balance for the auctioneer, mainly due to the data reuse among tasks. To\nthis end, we further introduce a reserve price into the double auction (for\neach data item) to achieve a desired tradeoff between the budget balance and\nthe social efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 11:34:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xiaoru", ""], ["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Cao", "Bin", ""], ["Li", "Zhang", ""], ["Wang", "Mengjing", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08819", "submitter": "Thomas Unterthiner", "authors": "Thomas Unterthiner, Bernhard Nessler, Calvin Seward, G\\\"unter\n  Klambauer, Martin Heusel, Hubert Ramsauer, Sepp Hochreiter", "title": "Coulomb GANs: Provably Optimal Nash Equilibria via Potential Fields", "comments": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR (International Conference on\n  Learning Representations) 2018.

We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on a\nvariety of image datasets.
