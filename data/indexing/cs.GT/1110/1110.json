When\napplying this method to complex problems such as combinatorial auctions, a\ndifficulty arises: VCG mechanisms are required to compute optimal outcomes and\nare, therefore, computationally infeasible. However, if the optimal outcome is\nreplaced by the results of a sub-optimal algorithm, the resulting mechanism\n(termed VCG-based) is no longer necessarily truthful. The first part of this\npaper studies this phenomenon in depth and shows that it is near universal.\nSpecifically, we prove that essentially all reasonable approximations or\nheuristics for combinatorial auctions as well as a wide class of cost\nminimization problems yield non-truthful VCG-based mechanisms. We generalize\nthese results for affine maximizers.\n  The second part of this paper proposes a general method for circumventing the\nabove problem. We introduce a modification of VCG-based mechanisms in which the\nagents are given a chance to improve the output of the underlying algorithm.\nWhen the agents behave truthfully, the welfare obtained by the mechanism is at\nleast as good as the one obtained by the algorithms output. We provide a strong\nrationale for truth-telling behavior. Our method satisfies individual\nrationality as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 20:55:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nisan", "N.", ""], ["Ronen", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0645", "submitter": "Puya Sharif", "authors": "Puya Sharif and Hoshang Heydari", "title": "Strategies and payoffs in quantum minority games", "comments": "5 pages, 6 figures; Proceedings of the International Conference on\n  Advances in Quantum Theory, Volume 1327, AIP,(2011)", "journal-ref": "Proc.

This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet\nJury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want\nto reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the\navailable evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve\nthe company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different\noptions.\n  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a\n{\\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option\nis best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,\nwhich tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to\narrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough\nto achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for\noptions in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct\noption receives the greatest number of votes with high probability.
