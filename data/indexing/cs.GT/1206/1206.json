The GCGWE unifies and significantly\ngeneralizes several simpler models considered in the previous literature, and\nis well suited for modeling a wide range of networking scenarios. One good\nexample is to use the GCGWE to model spectrum sharing in wireless networks,\nwhere we can properly define the edge weights and payoff functions to capture\nthe rather complicated interference relationship between wireless nodes. By\nidentifying which GCGWEs possess pure Nash equilibria and the very desirable\nfinite improvement property, we gain insight into when spatially distributed\nwireless nodes will be able to self-organize into a mutually acceptable\nresource allocation.

The resulting\nequilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints is complicated by nonconvex\nagent problems and therefore providing tractable conditions for existence of\nglobal or even local equilibria for it has proved challenging. Consequently,\nmuch of the extant research on this topic is either model specific or relies on\nweaker notions of equilibria. We consider a modified formulation in which every\nleader is cognizant of the equilibrium constraints of all leaders. Equilibria\nof this modified game contain the equilibria, if any, of the original game. The\nnew formulation has a constraint structure called shared constraints, and our\nmain result shows that if the leader objectives admit a potential function, the\nglobal minimizers of the potential function over the shared constraint are\nequilibria of the modified formulation. We provide another existence result\nusing fixed point theory that does not require potentiality. Additionally,\nlocal minima, B-stationary, and strong-stationary points of this minimization\nare shown to be local Nash equilibria, Nash B-stationary, and Nash\nstrong-stationary points of the corresponding multi-leader multi-follower game.\nWe demonstrate the relationship between variational equilibria associated with\nthis modified shared-constraint game and equilibria of the original game from\nthe standpoint of the multiplier sets and show how equilibria of the original\nformulation may be recovered. We note through several examples that such\npotential multi-leader multi-follower games capture a breadth of application\nproblems of interest and demonstrate our findings on a multi-leader\nmulti-follower Cournot game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 23:26:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:15:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 16:30:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kulkarni", "Ankur A.", ""], ["Shanbhag", "Uday V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.3235", "submitter": "Dimitrios Antos", "authors": "Dimitrios Antos, Avi Pfeffer", "title": "Identifying reasoning patterns in games", "comments": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2008-PG-9-17", "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an algorithm that identifies the reasoning patterns of agents in a\ngame, by iteratively examining the graph structure of its Multi-Agent Influence\nDiagram (MAID) representation.

We focus on two environments, both studied in the\nfull information model in Paes Leme et al. 2012, matching markets and matroid\nauctions. In the full information environment, a sequential first price cut\nauction for matroid settings is efficient. In Bayesian environments this is no\nlonger the case, as we show using a simple example with three players. Our main\nresult is a bound of $1+\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 2.58$ on the price of anarchy in\nboth matroid auctions and single-value matching markets (even with correlated\ntypes) and a bound of $2\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 3.16$ for general matching markets\nwith independent types. To bound the price of anarchy we need to consider\npossible deviations at an equilibrium.

The idea of learning equilibrium is\nthat learning algorithms in multi-agent systems should themselves be in\nequilibrium rather than only lead to equilibrium.

For example, if for a\ncertain period of time there is a failure in the monitoring devices (e.g., the\ncorrect input does not reach the agents), then it may not be in equilibrium to\nfollow the algorithm after the devices are corrected. A robust learning\nequilibrium is immune also to such non-strategic mistakes. The existence of\n(robust) learning equilibrium is especially challenging when the monitoring\ndevices are 'weak'.
