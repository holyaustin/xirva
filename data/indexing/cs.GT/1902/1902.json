An approach is to provide\nboth on-demand and spot services on shared servers. The former allows users to\naccess servers on demand at a fixed price and users occupy different periods of\nservers. The latter allows users to bid for the remaining unoccupied periods\nvia dynamic pricing; however, without appropriate design, such periods may be\narbitrarily small since on-demand users arrive randomly. This is also the\ncurrent service model adopted by Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute. In this paper,\nwe provide the first integral framework for sharing the time of servers between\non-demand and spot services while optimally pricing spot instances. It\nguarantees that on-demand users can get served quickly while spot users can\nstably utilize servers for a properly long period once accepted, which is a key\nfeature to make both on-demand and spot services accessible. Simulation results\nshow that, by complementing the on-demand market with a spot market, a cloud\nprovider can improve revenue by up to 464.7%. The framework is designed under\nassumptions which are met in real environments. It is a new tool that cloud\noperators can use to quantify the advantage of a hybrid spot and on-demand\nservice, eventually making the case for operating such service model in their\nown infrastructures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2019 17:18:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Sep 2019 15:38:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Xiaohu", ""], ["De Pellegrini", "Francesco", ""], ["Gao", "Guanyu", ""], ["Casale", "Giuliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01461", "submitter": "Goran \\v{Z}u\\v{z}i\\'c", "authors": "Domagoj Bradac and Sahil Singla and Goran Zuzic", "title": "(Near) Optimal Adaptivity Gaps for Stochastic Multi-Value Probing", "comments": "Added the hyperlinks (they got removed for some reason in the last\n  submission)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a kidney-exchange application where we want to find a max-matching\nin a random graph.

Given a budget on the total cost of the tests,\nour goal is to find a testing strategy that maximizes the expected maximum\nmatching size.\n  The above application is an example of the stochastic probing problem. In\ngeneral the optimal stochastic probing strategy is difficult to find because it\nis \\emph{adaptive}---decides on the next edge to probe based on the outcomes of\nthe probed edges. An alternate approach is to show the \\emph{adaptivity gap} is\nsmall, i.e., the best \\emph{non-adaptive} strategy always has a value close to\nthe best adaptive strategy. This allows us to focus on designing non-adaptive\nstrategies that are much simpler. Previous works, however, have focused on\nBernoulli random variables that can only capture whether an edge appears or\nnot. In this work we introduce a multi-value stochastic probing problem, which\ncan also model situations where the weight of an edge has a probability\ndistribution over multiple values.\n  Our main technical contribution is to obtain (near) optimal bounds for the\n(worst-case) adaptivity gaps for multi-value stochastic probing over\nprefix-closed constraints.

One of the well-known stable mechanisms\nis the man-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm (MGS). MGS has a good property that\nit is strategy-proof to the men's side, i.e., no man can obtain a better\noutcome by falsifying a preference list. We call such a mechanism a\nman-strategy-proof mechanism. Unfortunately, MGS is not a woman-strategy-proof\nmechanism. Roth has shown that there is no stable mechanism that is\nsimultaneously man-strategy-proof and woman-strategy-proof, which is known as\nRoth's impossibility theorem.\n  In this paper, we extend these results to the stable marriage problem with\nties and incomplete lists (SMTI). Since SMTI is an extension of SM, Roth's\nimpossibility theorem takes over to SMTI. Therefore, we focus on the\none-sided-strategy-proofness. In SMTI, one instance can have stable matchings\nof different sizes, and it is natural to consider the problem of finding a\nlargest stable matching, known as MAX SMTI. Thus we incorporate the notion of\napproximation ratio used in the theory of approximation algorithms. We say that\na stable-mechanism is $c$-approximate-stable mechanism if it always returns a\nstable matching of size at least $1/c$ of a largest one. We also consider a\nrestricted variant of MAX SMTI, which we call MAX SMTI-1TM, where only men's\nlists can contain ties.\n  Our results are summarized as follows: (i) MAX SMTI admits both a\nman-strategy-proof 2-approximate-stable mechanism and a woman-strategy-proof\n2-approximate-stable mechanism. (ii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a woman-strategy-proof\n2-approximate-stable mechanism. (iii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a man-strategy-proof\n1.5-approximate-stable mechanism. All these results are tight in terms of\napproximation ratios.

A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game\nis that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an\noptimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special\nattention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize\nthe maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational\nintractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two\nsubproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We\npropose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate\nnucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a\nnon-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed\nonly when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual\nnucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is\nclose to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm\nneeds to generate only a small fraction (1.6%) of the total coalition\nconstraints to compute the approximate nucleolus.

Therefore, they can\nfreely choose which coin to mine for higher profit, where the profitability\ndepends on both the coin price and mining difficulty. Some miners can\nimmediately switch the coin to mine only when mining difficulty changes because\nthe difficulty changes are more predictable than that for the coin price, and\nwe call this behavior fickle mining.\n  In this paper, we study the effects of fickle mining by modeling a game\nbetween two coins.

In this model, we show that fickle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in\nwhich only a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to\nthe less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those who conduct\nmining even after coin mining difficulty increases. This situation would cause\nsevere centralization, weakening the security of the coin system.\n  To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems (e.g., BTC vs. BCH)\nare moving toward, we traced the historical changes of mining power for BTC and\nBCH.
