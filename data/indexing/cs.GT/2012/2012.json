In addition, the\ninconsistencies of the primary quantization matrices across different image\nregions can be used to localize splicing in double JPEG tampered images.\nTraditional model-based approaches work under specific assumptions on the\nrelationship between the first and second compression qualities and on the\nalignment of the JPEG grid. Recently, a deep learning-based estimator capable\nto work under a wide variety of conditions has been proposed, that outperforms\ntailored existing methods in most of the cases. The method is based on a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained to solve the estimation as a\nstandard regression problem. By exploiting the integer nature of the\nquantization coefficients, in this paper, we propose a deep learning technique\nthat performs the estimation by resorting to a simil-classification\narchitecture. The CNN is trained with a loss function that takes into account\nboth the accuracy and the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the estimation. Results\nconfirm the superior performance of the proposed technique, compared to the\nstate-of-the art methods based on statistical analysis and, in particular, deep\nlearning regression. Moreover, the capability of the method to work under\ngeneral operative conditions, regarding the alignment of the second compression\ngrid with the one of first compression and the combinations of the JPEG\nqualities of former and second compression, is very relevant in practical\napplications, where these information are unknown a priori.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 13:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Mar 2021 19:54:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Tondi", "Benedetta", ""], ["Costranzo", "Andrea", ""], ["Huang", "Dequ", ""], ["Li", "Bin", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.00689", "submitter": "Brendan Lucier", "authors": "Natalie Collina, Nicole Immorlica, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Brendan Lucier,\n  Neil Newman", "title": "Dynamic Weighted Matching with Heterogeneous Arrival and Departure Rates", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study a dynamic non-bipartite matching problem.

Since users' utilities are their private information, which they\nmay not be willing to share, a mediator, known as the planner, is introduced to\nhelp optimize the overall satisfaction of the community (total utility minus\ntotal payments) by mechanism design.

This paper addresses the\nuse of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the\ndecisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the\nprediction of these decisions. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated\ninteraction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert\naims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her\na review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several\nscored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the\nexpert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw\nfrom the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert's\npayoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the\nhotel.

However, cache nodes may belong to different\nentities and behave selfishly to maximize their own benefits, which often lead\nto performance degradation for the overall network. While there has been\nextensive literature on allocating contents to caches to maximize the social\nwelfare, the analysis of selfish caching behaviors remains largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, we model the selfish behaviors of cache nodes as selfish caching\ngames on arbitrary directed graphs with heterogeneous content popularity. We\nstudy the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in selfish\ncaching games, and analyze its efficiency in terms of social welfare. We show\nthat a PSNE does not always exist in arbitrary-topology caching networks.\nHowever, if the network does not have a mixed request loop, i.e., a directed\nloop in which each edge is traversed by at least one content request, we show\nthat a PSNE always exists and can be found in polynomial time. Furthermore, we\ncan avoid mixed request loops by properly choosing request forwarding paths. We\nthen show that the efficiency of Nash equilibria, captured by the price of\nanarchy (PoA), can be arbitrarily poor if we allow arbitrary content request\npatterns, and adding extra cache nodes can make the PoA worse, i.e., cache\nparadox happens. However, when cache nodes have homogeneous request patterns,\nwe show that the PoA is bounded even allowing arbitrary topologies. We further\nanalyze the selfish caching games for cache nodes with limited computational\ncapabilities, and show that an approximate PSNE exists with bounded PoA in\ncertain cases of interest. Simulation results show that increasing the cache\ncapacity in the network improves the efficiency of Nash equilibria, while\nadding extra cache nodes can degrade the efficiency of Nash equilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2020 08:44:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Qian", ""], ["Yeh", "Edmund", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.14195", "submitter": "Sebastian Enqvist", "authors": "Sebastian Enqvist and Valentin Goranko", "title": "The temporal logic of coalitional goal assignments in concurrent\n  multi-player games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce and study a natural extension of the Alternating time temporal\nlogic ATL, called Temporal Logic of Coalitional Goal Assignments (TLCGA).

In many important settings,\n$f$ uniquely determines $P$ (up to a constant) and therefore a common approach\nis to focus on the design of $f$ and neglect the role of the payment function.\nFadel and Segal [JET, 2009] question this approach by taking the lenses of\ncommunication complexity: can it be that the communication complexity of an\nincentive compatible mechanism that implements $f$ (that is, computes both the\noutput and the payments) is much larger than the communication complexity of\ncomputing the output? I.e., can it be that $cc_{IC}(f)>>cc(f)$? Fadel and Segal\nshow that for every $f$, $cc_{IC}(f)\\leq exp(cc(f))$. They also show that fully\ncomputing the incentive compatible mechanism is strictly harder than computing\nonly the output: there exists a social choice function $f$ such that\n$cc_{IC}(f)=cc(f)+1$. In a follow-up work, Babaioff, Blumrosen, Naor, and\nSchapira [EC'08] provide a social choice function $f$ such that\n$cc_{IC}(f)=\\Theta(n\\cdot cc(f))$, where $n$ is the number of players.
