It converges to an equilibrium by\niteratively traversing the game tree. In order to deal with extremely large\ngames, abstraction is typically applied before running CFR. The abstracted game\nis solved with tabular CFR, and its solution is mapped back to the full game.\nThis process can be problematic because aspects of abstraction are often manual\nand domain specific, abstraction algorithms may miss important strategic\nnuances of the game, and there is a chicken-and-egg problem because determining\na good abstraction requires knowledge of the equilibrium of the game. This\npaper introduces Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization, a form of CFR that\nobviates the need for abstraction by instead using deep neural networks to\napproximate the behavior of CFR in the full game. We show that Deep CFR is\nprincipled and achieves strong performance in large poker games. This is the\nfirst non-tabular variant of CFR to be successful in large games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2018 00:07:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 18:44:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 17:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "Noam", ""], ["Lerer", "Adam", ""], ["Gross", "Sam", ""], ["Sandholm", "Tuomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.00226", "submitter": "Shih-Tang Su", "authors": "Grant Schoenebeck, Shih-Tang Su, Vijay Subramanian", "title": "Social Learning with Questions", "comments": "27 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work studies sequential social learning (also known as Bayesian\nobservational learning), and how private communication can enable agents to\navoid herding to the wrong action/state.

This\nworkshop bring together researchers applying compositional approaches to\nphysics, NLP, cognitive science, and game theory. Within NLP, a long-standing\naim is to represent how words can combine to form phrases and sentences. Within\nthe framework of distributional semantics, words are represented as vectors in\nvector spaces. The categorical model of Coecke et al. [2010], inspired by\nquantum protocols, has provided a convincing account of compositionality in\nvector space models of NLP. There is furthermore a history of vector space\nmodels in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed\nby Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al. [1988] utilise notions of distance between\nfeature vectors. More recently G\\\"ardenfors [2004, 2014] has developed a model\nof concepts in which conceptual spaces provide geometric structures, and\ninformation is represented by points, vectors and regions in vector spaces. The\nsame compositional approach has been applied to this formalism, giving\nconceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously\n[Bolt et al., 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the\nstudy of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game\ntheory, where games are studied monolithically as one global object,\ncompositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games\nfrom smaller components. Such an approach is inherently difficult since the\ninteraction between games has to be considered. Research into categorical\ncompositional methods for this field have recently begun [Ghani et al., 2018].\nMoreover, the interaction between the three disciplines of cognitive science,\nlinguistics and game theory is a fertile ground for research. Game theory in\ncognitive science is a well-established area [Camerer, 2011]. Similarly game\ntheoretic approaches have been applied in linguistics [J\\\"ager, 2008]. Lastly,\nthe study of linguistics and cognitive science is intimately intertwined\n[Smolensky and Legendre, 2006, Jackendoff, 2007].

Here, we\nshow that such strategies do exist. Under the conventional repeated public\ngoods game, we novelly identify them and find that, when confronted with such\nstrategies, a single opponent can maximize his utility only via global\ncooperation and any colluding alliance cannot get the upper hand. Since a full\ncooperation is individually optimal for any single opponent, a stable\ncooperation among all players can be achieved. Moreover, we experimentally show\nthat these strategies can still promote cooperation even when the opponents are\nboth self-learning and collusive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2018 00:36:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Kai", ""], ["Hao", "Dong", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06503", "submitter": "Anup Aprem", "authors": "Anup Aprem, Stephen J.

In particular, (a) When costs are asymmetric, if\nminer $i$ chooses to invest, then miner $j$ has market share at least\n$1-\\frac{c_j}{c_i}$. That is, if miner $j$ has costs that are (e.g.) $20\\%$\nlower than those of miner $i$, then miner $j$ must control at least $20\\%$ of\nthe \\emph{total} mining power. (b) In the presence of economies of scale\n($\\alpha > 1$), every market participant has a market share of at least\n$1-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$, implying that the market features at most\n$\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha - 1}$ miners in total.\n  We discuss the implications of our results for the future design of\ncryptocurrencies.

In the special case of a 1-uniform\nmatroid, i.e., only one winner can be selected, we give an efficient algorithm\nthat constructs winner-selecting dice for any feasible interim rule.\nFurthermore, when the types of the candidates are drawn in an i.i.d.~manner and\nthe interim rule is symmetric across candidates, unsurprisingly, an algorithm\ncan efficiently construct symmetric dice that only depend on the type but not\nthe identity of the candidate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2018 07:27:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dughmi", "Shaddin", ""], ["Kempe", "David", ""], ["Qiang", "Ruixin", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.11578", "submitter": "Indu Yadav", "authors": "Indu Yadav, Prasanna Chaporkar, Abhay Karandikar", "title": "GOSPAL: An Efficient Strategy-Proof mechanism for Constrained Resource\n  Allocation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider allocation of a resource to multiple interested users with a\nconstraint that if the resource is allocated to user $i$ then it can not be\nallocated simultaneously to a predefined set of users $\\cS_i$ .

However, the learning process of the existing federated\nlearning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner,\ne.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the\nmodel update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even\nunavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the\nrelay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting\nmodel update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate\nmodel updates based on their training data. The model updates are then\nforwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model\nowner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return,\nthe mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled\ninterference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the\nsame relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes\nas well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a\nStackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices\nand that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg\nequilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method.\nMoreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on\nthe equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 11:51:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Shaohan", ""], ["Niyato", "Dusit", ""], ["Wang", "Ping", ""], ["Kim", "Dong In", ""], ["Liang", "Ying-Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12253", "submitter": "Anshuka Rangi", "authors": "Anshuka Rangi, Massimo Franceschetti and Long Tran-Thanh", "title": "Unifying the stochastic and the adversarial Bandits with Knapsack", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the adversarial Bandits with Knapsack (BwK) online\nlearning problem, where a player repeatedly chooses to perform an action, pays\nthe corresponding cost, and receives a reward associated with the action.

We show that when the\nperturbation has magnitude $\\delta$, pricing only the grand bundle guarantees\nan $O(1/\\delta)$-approximation to the optimal revenue. That is, no matter the\n(worst-case) initially correlated distribution, these tiny perturbations\nsuffice to bring the gap down from infinite to finite. We further show that the\nsame guarantees hold when $n$ buyers have values drawn from an arbitrarily\ncorrelated $mn$-dimensional distribution (without any dependence on $n$).\n  Taken together, these analyses further pin down key properties of correlated\ndistributions that result in large gaps between simplicity and optimality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Psomas", "Christos-Alexandros", ""], ["Schvartzman", "Ariel", ""], ["Weinberg", "S.
