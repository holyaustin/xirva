On the other hand, inspired by this\nformalism, we state and prove a {\\it multilinear minimax theorem}, a\ngeneralization of von Neumann's bilinear minimax theorem. As in the bilinear\ncase, the proof is based on relating the underlying optimizations to a\nprimal-dual pair of linear programming problems, albeit more complicated LPs.\nThe theorem together with its proof is of independent interest. Next, we use\nthe theorem to associate to a multilinear form in NE a {\\it multilinear minimax\nrelaxation} (MMR), where the primal-dual pair of solutions induce an\napproximate equilibrium point that provides a nontrivial upper bound on a\nconvex combination of {\\it expected payoffs} in any NE solution. In fact we\nshow any positive probability vector associated to the players induces a\ncorresponding {\\it diagonally-scaled} MMR approximate equilibrium with its\nassociated upper bound. By virtue of the proof of the multilinear minimax\ntheorem, MMR solution can be computed in polynomial-time. On the other hand, it\nis known that even in bimatrix games NE is {\\it PPAD-complete}, a complexity\nclass in NP not known to be in P. The quality of MMR solution and the\nefficiency of solving the underlying LPs are the subject of further\ninvestigation. However, as shown in a separate article, for a large set of test\nproblems in bimatrix games, not only the MMR payoffs for both players are\nbetter than any NE payoffs, so is the computing time of MMR in contrast with\nthat of Lemke-Howsen algorithm. In large size problems the latter algorithm\neven fails to produce a Nash equilibrium. In summary, solving MMR provides a\nworthy approximation even if Nash equilibrium is shown to be computable in\npolynomial-time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Apr 2016 21:07:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 17:47:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kalantari", "Bahman", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.00306", "submitter": "Doha Hamza", "authors": "Doha Hamza, Jeff S.

This game is a zero-sum game, and thus any Nash equilibrium of the\ngame can be described by minimax strategies.

We assume that the customers\ndiffer in their cost for unit delay and this is modeled as a continuous random\nvariable with a distribution $F.$ We also assume that each server charges an\nadmission price to each customer that decide to join its queue. We first\nconsider the monopoly problem where both the servers belong to a single\noperator. The heterogeneity of the customer makes the analysis of the problem\ndifficult. The difficulty lies in the inability to characterize the equilibrium\nqueue arrival rates as a function of the admission prices. We provide an\nequivalent formulation with the queue arrival rates as the optimization\nvariable simplifying the analysis for revenue rate maximization for the\nmonopoly. We then consider the duopoly problem where each server competes with\nthe other server to maximize its revenue rate. For the duopoly problem, the\ninterest is to obtain the set of admission prices satisfying the Nash\nequilibrium conditions. While the problem is in general difficult to analyze,\nwe consider the special case when the two servers are identical. For such a\nduopoly system, we obtain the necessary condition for existence of symmetric\nNash equilibrium of the admission prices. The knowledge of the distribution $F$\ncharacterizing the heterogeneity of the customers is necessary to solve the\nmonopoly and the duopoly problem. However, for most practical scenarios, the\nfunctional form of $F$ may not be known to the system operator and in such\ncases, the revenue maximizing prices cannot be determined.

At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can\nonly appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a\nmulti-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at\nthat stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.\n  In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account\nmechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any\nstage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank\naccount, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We\nfirst establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this\nsetting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple\ncharacterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually\nrational bank account mechanisms. Based on these characterizations, we then\ninvestigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank account\nmechanisms. We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank account\nmechanism that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result\nis general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot\nmulti-dimensional mechanism design.
