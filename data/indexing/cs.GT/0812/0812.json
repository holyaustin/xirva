In the clustering\nalgorithms, data points for clustering are regarded as players who can make\ndecisions in games. On the network describing relationships among data points,\nan edge-removing-and-rewiring (ERR) function is employed to explore in a\nneighborhood of a data point, which removes edges connecting to neighbors with\nsmall payoffs, and creates new edges to neighbors with larger payoffs. As such,\nthe connections among data points vary over time. During the evolution of\nnetwork, some strategies are spread in the network. As a consequence, clusters\nare formed automatically, in which data points with the same evolutionarily\nstable strategy are collected as a cluster, so the number of evolutionarily\nstable strategies indicates the number of clusters. Moreover, the experimental\nresults have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably\nand efficiently, and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an\nindication of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 13:22:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 13:30:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Qiang", ""], ["Chen", "Zhuo", ""], ["He", "Yan", ""], ["Jiang", "Jing-ping", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.5101", "submitter": "Katarzyna Paluch", "authors": "Katarzyna Paluch, Marcin Mucha, Aleksander Madry", "title": "A 7/9 - Approximation Algorithm for the Maximum Traveling Salesman\n  Problem", "comments": "6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-03685-9_23", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a 7/9 - Approximation Algorithm for the Maximum Traveling Salesman\nProblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 19:11:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Paluch", "Katarzyna", ""], ["Mucha", "Marcin", ""], ["Madry", "Aleksander", ""]]}]
