We model the network system using a probabilistic attack graph--a\ngraphical security model. Given a network system with a proactive defense\nstrategy, an intelligent attacker needs to perform reconnaissance repeatedly to\nlearn about the locations of intrusion detection systems and re-plan optimally\nto reach the target while avoiding detection. To compute the attacker's\nstrategy for security evaluation, we develop a receding-horizon planning\nalgorithm using a risk-sensitive Markov decision process with a time-varying\nreward function. Finally, we implement both defense and attack strategies in a\nsynthetic network and analyze how the frequency of network randomization and\nthe number of detection systems can influence the success rate of the attacker.\nThis study provides insights for designing proactive defense strategies against\nonline and multi-stage attacks by a resourceful attacker.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2020 20:56:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Jun 2020 05:45:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2020 03:42:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Zhentian", ""], ["Fu", "Jie", ""], ["Zhu", "Quanyan", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.05156", "submitter": "Matteo Castiglioni", "authors": "Matteo Castiglioni, Andrea Celli, Nicola Gatti", "title": "Public Bayesian Persuasion: Being Almost Optimal and Almost Persuasive", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Persuasion studies how an informed principal may influence the behavior of\nagents by the strategic provision of payoff-relevant information.

Previous\nhardness results were known only for the special case of exact equilibria and\narbitrary cost functions.\n  The circuit gadget is of independent interest and it allows us to also prove\nhardness for a variety of problems related to the complexity of PNE in\ncongestion games. For example, we demonstrate that the question of existence of\n$\\alpha$-PNE in which a certain set of players plays a specific strategy\nprofile is NP-hard for any $\\alpha < 3^{d/2}$, even for unweighted congestion\ngames.\n  Finally, we study the existence of approximate equilibria in weighted\ncongestion games with general (nondecreasing) costs, as a function of the\nnumber of players $n$. We show that $n$-PNE always exist, matched by an almost\ntight nonexistence bound of $\\tilde\\Theta(n)$ which we can again transform into\nan NP-completeness proof for the decision problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Feb 2020 10:06:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 11:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Christodoulou", "George", ""], ["Gairing", "Martin", ""], ["Giannakopoulos", "Yiannis", ""], ["Po\u00e7as", "Diogo", ""], ["Waldmann", "Clara", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.07545", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "B\\'eatrice B\\'erard (Sorbonne Universit\\'e, CNRS, LIP6, Paris,\n  France), Benedikt Bollig (CNRS & LSV, ENS Paris-Saclay, Universit\\'e\n  Paris-Saclay, France), Patricia Bouyer (CNRS & LSV, ENS Paris-Saclay,\n  Universit\\'e Paris-Saclay, France), Matthias F\\\"ugger (CNRS & LSV, ENS\n  Paris-Saclay, Universit\\'e Paris-Saclay, Inria, France), Nathalie Sznajder\n  (Sorbonne Universit\\'e, CNRS, LIP6, Paris, France)", "title": "Synthesis in Presence of Dynamic Links", "comments": "In Proceedings GandALF 2020, arXiv:2009.09360", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 326, 2020, pp. 33-49", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.326.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DC cs.GT cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of distributed synthesis is to automatically generate a\ndistributed algorithm, given a target communication network and a specification\nof the algorithm's correct behavior.\n  Previous work has focused on static networks with an a priori fixed message\nsize.

To protect a system,\na defender proactively changes the system configurations to limit the exposure\nof security vulnerabilities to potential attackers. In doing so, the defender\ncreates asymmetric uncertainty and complexity for the attackers, making it much\nharder for them to compromise the system. In practice, the defender incurs a\nswitching cost for each migration of the system configurations. The switching\ncost usually depends on both the current configuration and the following\nconfiguration. Besides, different system configurations typically require a\ndifferent amount of time for an attacker to exploit and attack. Therefore, a\ndefender must simultaneously decide both the optimal sequences of system\nconfigurations and the optimal timing for switching.
