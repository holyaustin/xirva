We prove\nthat Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game,\nis complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed\nversion) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.\n  This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash\nequilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:\n  Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless\nevery problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity\nof the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for\nBimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in\nrandomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest\nform of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are\npolynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have\ntwo broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations\nresearch: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix\nLinear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming\nunless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xi", ""], ["Deng", "Xiaotie", ""], ["Teng", "Shang-Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1768", "submitter": "Enrique ter Horst A", "authors": "Henryk Gzyl, German Molina, Enrique ter Horst", "title": "Assessment and Propagation of Input Uncertainty in Tree-based Option\n  Pricing Models", "comments": "39 pages, 21 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.GT", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment and\npropagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based\nmethods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting\nthat option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option\npricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close\nthe model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,\nand those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative\nframeworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter\nuncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods\nwith classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options\nmarket established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for\nwhich there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to\naccount for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 14:48:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gzyl", "Henryk", ""], ["Molina", "German", ""], ["ter Horst", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.2014", "submitter": "Leandro R\\^ego", "authors": "Joseph Y.

We\nprovide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with\nawareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results\nto games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a\nplayer j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where\npayers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs\nare incompatible with a common prior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2007 13:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Halpern", "Joseph Y.", ""], ["R\u00eago", "Leandro C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.2017", "submitter": "Giacomo Bacci", "authors": "G.
