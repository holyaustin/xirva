We call such a Bayesian\ngame type-regular. We then show that an m-dimensional n-agent Bayesian game\nwhose utilities are linearly dependent on the types of the agents is\nequivalent, following a normalisation of the type space of each agent into the\n(m-1)-simplex, to a simultaneous competition in nm so-called basic n-agent\ngames. If the game is own-type-linear, i.e., the utility of each player only\ndepends linearly on its own type, then the Bayesian game is equivalent to a\nsimultaneous competition in m basic n-agent games, called a multi-game. We then\nprove that an own-type-linear Bayesian game is type-regular if it is\ntype-regular on the vertices of the (m-1)-simplex, a result which provides a\nlarge class of type-regular Bayesian maps. The class of m-dimensional\nown-type-linear Bayesian games can model, via their equivalence with\nmulti-games, simultaneous decision-making in m different environments. We show\nthat a two dimensional own-type-linear Bayesian game can be used to give a new\nmodel of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) in which the prosocial tendencies of the\nagents are considered as their types and the two agents play simultaneously in\nthe PD as well as in a prosocial game. This Bayesian game addresses the\nmaterialistic and the prosocial tendencies of the agents. Similarly, we present\na new two dimensional Bayesian model of the Trust game in which the type of the\ntwo agents reflect their prosocial tendency or trustfulness, which leads to\nmore reasonable Nash equilibria. We finally consider an example of such\nmulti-environment decision making in production by several companies in\nmulti-markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2018 03:52:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Edalat", "Abbas", ""], ["Ghorban", "Samira Hossein", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02973", "submitter": "Markus Schulze", "authors": "Markus Schulze", "title": "The Schulze Method of Voting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new single-winner election method (\"Schulze method\") and prove\nthat it satisfies many academic criteria (e.g. monotonicity, reversal symmetry,\nresolvability, independence of clones, Condorcet criterion, k-consistency,\npolynomial runtime).

Intuitively, the players enter the game sequentially and choose an\noptimal action under the assumption that the $k-1$ subsequent players play\nsubgame-perfectly. Our model naturally interpolates between outcomes of greedy\nbest-response ($k=1$) and subgame-perfect outcomes ($k=n$, the number of\nplayers). We study the impact of limited lookahead (parameterized by $k$) on\nthe stability and inefficiency of the resulting outcomes. As our results\nreveal, increased lookahead does not necessarily lead to better outcomes; in\nfact, its effect crucially depends on the existence of ties and the type of\ngame under consideration.\n  More specifically, already for very simple network congestion games we show\nthat subgame-perfect outcomes (full lookahead) can be unstable, whereas greedy\nbest-response outcomes (no lookahead) are known to be stable. We show that this\ninstability is due to player indifferences (ties). If the game is generic (no\nties exist) then all outcomes are stable, independent of the lookahead $k$. In\nparticular, this implies that the price of anarchy of $k$-lookahead outcomes\n(for arbitrary $k$) equals the standard price of anarchy. For special cases of\ncost-sharing games and consensus games we show that no lookahead leads to\nstable outcomes. Again this can be resolved by removing ties, though for\ncost-sharing games only full lookahead provides stable outcomes.

The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider\nalso purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from\nthe potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts\nthe insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain\nservice. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we\nmodel the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the\ncyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider\nand the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then\nthe users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service.\nSpecifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a\nseries of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market\ngame.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:31:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 12 May 2019 03:14:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Shaohan", ""], ["Wang", "Wenbo", ""], ["Xiong", "Zehui", ""], ["Niyato", "Dusit", ""], ["Wang", "Ping", ""], ["Wang", "Shaun Shuxun", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10512", "submitter": "Diodato Ferraioli", "authors": "Diodato Ferraioli and Carmine Ventre", "title": "Probabilistic Verification for Obviously Strategyproof Mechanisms", "comments": "Accepted at IJCAI 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Obviously strategyproof (OSP) mechanisms maintain the incentive compatibility\nof agents that are not fully rational.
