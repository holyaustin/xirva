We study the emergence of diversification in the\nadword market triggered by such capacity constraints in the sense that new\nmarket mechanisms, as well as, new for-profit agents are likely to emerge to\ncombat or to make profit from the opportunities created by shortages in\nad-space inventory. We propose a model where the additional capacity is\nprovided by for-profit agents (or, mediators), who compete for slots in the\noriginal auction, draw traffic, and run their own sub-auctions. The quality of\nthe additional capacity provided by a mediator is measured by its {\\it fitness}\nfactor. We compute revenues and payoffs for all the different parties at a {\\it\nsymmetric Nash equilibrium} (SNE) when the mediator-based model is operated by\na mechanism currently being used by Google and Yahoo!, and then compare these\nnumbers with those obtained at a corresponding SNE for the same mechanism, but\nwithout any mediators involved in the auctions. Such calculations allow us to\ndetermine the value of the additional capacity. Our results show that the\nrevenue of the auctioneer, as well as the social value (i.e. efficiency),\nalways increase when mediators are involved; moreover even the payoffs of {\\em\nall} the bidders will increase if the mediator has a high enough fitness. Thus,\nour analysis indicates that there are significant opportunities for\ndiversification in the internet economy and we should expect it to continue to\ndevelop richer structure, with room for different types of agents and\nmechanisms to coexist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 12:09:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sudhir Kumar", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Vwani P.", ""], ["Gunadhi", "Himawan", ""], ["Rezaei", "Behnam A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0435", "submitter": "Andreas Witzel", "authors": "Krzysztof R.

We model such interactions as Bayesian interference\ngames. Each wireless device selects a power profile over the entire available\nbandwidth to maximize its data rate. Such competitive models represent\nsituations in which several wireless devices share spectrum without any central\nauthority or coordinated protocol.\n  In contrast to games where devices have complete information about their\nopponents, we consider scenarios where the devices are unaware of the\ninterference they cause to other devices. Such games, which are modeled as\nBayesian games, can exhibit significantly different equilibria. We first\nconsider a simple scenario of simultaneous move games, where we show that the\nunique Bayes-Nash equilibrium is where both devices spread their power equally\nacross the entire bandwidth. We then extend this model to a two-tiered spectrum\nsharing case where users act sequentially. Here one of the devices, called the\nprimary user, is the owner of the spectrum and it selects its power profile\nfirst. The second device (called the secondary user) then responds by choosing\na power profile to maximize its Shannon capacity. In such sequential move\ngames, we show that there exist equilibria in which the primary user obtains a\nhigher data rate by using only a part of the bandwidth.\n  In a repeated Bayesian interference game, we show the existence of reputation\neffects: an informed primary user can bluff to prevent spectrum usage by a\nsecondary user who suffers from lack of information about the channel gains.\nThe resulting equilibrium can be highly inefficient, suggesting that\ncompetitive spectrum sharing is highly suboptimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 19:45:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Adlakha", "Sachin", ""], ["Johari", "Ramesh", ""], ["Goldsmith", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1263", "submitter": "Thorsten Theobald", "authors": "Thorsten Theobald", "title": "Enumerating the Nash equilibria of rank 1-games", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT math.OC", "license": null, "abstract": "  A bimatrix game $(A,B)$ is called a game of rank $k$ if the rank of the\nmatrix $A+B$ is at most $k$.

We\ncategorize these dynamics into two types: one is the disturbance due to the\nenvironment (e.g. wireless channel conditions, source traffic characteristics,\netc.) and the other is the impact caused by competing users. To analyze the\ninteractions among users given the environment disturbance, we propose a\ngeneral stochastic framework for modeling how the competition among users for\nspectrum opportunities evolves over time. At each stage of the dynamic resource\nallocation, a central spectrum moderator auctions the available resources and\nthe users strategically bid for the required resources. The joint bid actions\naffect the resource allocation and hence, the rewards and future strategies of\nall users. Based on the observed resource allocation and corresponding rewards\nfrom previous allocations, we propose a best response learning algorithm that\ncan be deployed by wireless users to improve their bidding policy at each\nstage.
