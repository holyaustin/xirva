In the quantitative framework, an objective assigns a\nvalue to every play, and the goal of player 1 is to minimize the value of the\nobjective. In this framework, there are two relevant synthesis problems to\nconsider: the quantitative analysis problem is to compute the minimal (or\ninfimum) value that player 1 can assure, and the boolean analysis problem asks\nwhether player 1 can assure that the value of the objective is at most $\\nu$\n(for a given threshold $\\nu$). Mean-payoff expression games are played on a\nmultidimensional weighted graph. An atomic mean-payoff expression objective is\nthe mean-payoff value (the long-run average weight) of a certain dimension, and\nthe class of mean-payoff expressions is the closure of atomic mean-payoff\nexpressions under the algebraic operations of $\\MAX,\\MIN$, numerical complement\nand $\\SUM$.

The TD game is a two-person game. Each player can select an integer\nvalue between $R$ and $M$ ($R < M$) as a pure strategy. If both of them select\nthe same value, the payoff to them will be that value. If the players select\ndifferent values, say $i$ and $j$ ($R \\le i < j \\le M$), then the payoff to the\nplayer who chooses the small value will be $i+R$ and the payoff to the other\nplayer will be $i-R$. We term the player who selects a large value as the\ncooperator, and the one who chooses a small value as the defector. The reason\nis that if both of them select large values, it will result in a large total\npayoff. The Nash equilibrium of the TD game is to choose the smallest value\n$R$. However, in previous behavioral studies, players in TD game typically\nselect values that are much larger than $R$, and the average selected value\nexhibits an inverse relationship with $R$. To explain such anomalous behavior,\nin this paper, we study the evolution of cooperation in spatial traveler's\ndilemma game where the players are located on a square lattice and each player\nplays TD games with his neighbors. Players in our model can adopt their\nneighbors' strategies following two standard models of spatial game dynamics.\nMonte-Carlo simulation is applied to our model, and the results show that the\ncooperation level of the system, which is proportional to the average value of\nthe strategies, decreases with increasing $R$ until $R$ is greater than the\nthreshold where cooperation vanishes. Our findings indicate that spatial\nreciprocity promotes the evolution of cooperation in TD game and the spatial TD\ngame model can interpret the anomalous behavior observed in previous behavioral\nexperiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Sep 2012 01:57:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Rong-Hua", ""], ["Yu", "Jeffrey Xu", ""], ["Lin", "Jiyuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.3418", "submitter": "Francesco Scarcello", "authors": "Gianluigi Greco and Francesco Scarcello", "title": "Mechanisms for Fair Allocation Problems: No-Punishment Payment Rules in\n  Fully Verifiable Settings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mechanism design is addressed in the context of fair allocations of\nindivisible goods with monetary compensation.

We study the efficiency of Bayesian Nash\nequilibrium (BNE) outcomes of simultaneous first- and second-price auctions\nwhen bidders have complement-free (a.k.a. subadditive) valuations. We show that\nthe expected social welfare of any BNE is at least 1/2 of the optimal social\nwelfare in the case of first-price auctions, and at least 1/4 in the case of\nsecond-price auctions. These results improve upon the previously-known\nlogarithmic bounds, which were established by [Hassidim, Kaplan, Mansour and\nNisan '11] for first-price auctions and by [Bhawalkar and Roughgarden '11] for\nsecond-price auctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2012 05:21:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "Michal", ""], ["Fu", "Hu", ""], ["Gravin", "Nick", ""], ["Lucier", "Brendan", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5013", "submitter": "Ligia Cremene dr", "authors": "Ligia Cremene, Dumitru Dumitrescu", "title": "Analysis of Cognitive Radio Scenes Based on Non-cooperative Game\n  Theoretical Modelling", "comments": "8 double-column pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1209.5387", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1049/iet-com.2011.0712", "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO cs.ET cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A noncooperative game theoretical approach for analysing opportunistic\nspectrum access (OSA) in cognitive radio (CR) environments is proposed. New\nconcepts from game theory are applied to spectrum access analysis in order to\nextract rules of behaviour for an emerging environment. In order to assess OSA\nscenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of\nresource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:\nsimultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and\nasymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access\n(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game\nsolutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter\ncaptures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting\ndifferent types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic\nmodelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium\ndetection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of\nchannels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium\ndescribes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable\nsolutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are\nmaximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new\nentrants are Pareto driven.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2012 18:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 05:32:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Cremene", "Ligia", ""], ["Dumitrescu", "Dumitru", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5348", "submitter": "Christopher Wilkens", "authors": "Kamal Jain and Christopher A.

We show that in a simple model of\nhomophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in either\npolarization, persistent disagreement or consensus depending on how biased\nindividuals are. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation,\nis not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation\nalso provides insight into the following related question: do internet based\nrecommender algorithms that show us personalized content contribute to\npolarization? We make a connection between biased assimilation and the\npolarizing effects of some random-walk based recommender algorithms that are\nsimilar in spirit to some commonly used recommender algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 16:38:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Dandekar", "Pranav", ""], ["Goel", "Ashish", ""], ["Lee", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6448", "submitter": "Paul D\\\"utting", "authors": "Paul Duetting and Monika Henzinger and Martin Starnberger", "title": "Auctions with Heterogeneous Items and Budget Limits", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study individual rational, Pareto optimal, and incentive compatible\nmechanisms for auctions with heterogeneous items and budget limits.
