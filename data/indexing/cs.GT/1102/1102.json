Various models and algorithms\nhave been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence\nmaximization problem. A crucial assumption in all these studies is that the\ninfluence probabilities are known to the social planner. This assumption is\nunrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information\nof the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully.\nMoreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of\nthe information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is\npropagating in the network. In this paper, we use a mechanism design approach\nto elicit influence probabilities truthfully from the agents. We first work\nwith a simple model, the influencer model, where we assume that each user knows\nthe level of influence she has on her neighbors but this is private\ninformation. In the second model, the influencer-influencee model, which is\nmore realistic, we determine influence probabilities by combining the\nprobability values reported by the influencers and influencees. In the context\nof the first model, we present how VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanisms could\nbe used for truthfully eliciting the influence probabilities. Our main\ncontribution is to design a scoring rule based mechanism in the context of the\ninfluencer-influencee model. In particular, we show the incentive compatibility\nof the mechanisms when the scoring rules are proper and propose a reverse\nweighted scoring rule based mechanism as an appropriate mechanism to use.

We prove that any oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with two strategies\nand three player types must have 1/eps^c in the exponent of the running time\nfor some c>1/3, rendering the algorithm in [Daskalakis 2008] essentially\noptimal within oblivious algorithms. In contrast, we devise a poly(n)\n(1/eps)^O(log^2(1/eps)) non-oblivious PTAS for anonymous games with 2\nstrategies and any bounded number of player types.\n  Our algorithm is based on the construction of a sparse (and efficiently\ncomputable) eps-cover of the set of all possible sums of n independent\nindicators, under the total variation distance. The size of the cover is\npoly(n) (1/ eps^{O(log^2 (1/eps))}.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Feb 2011 04:42:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Daskalakis", "Constantinos", ""], ["Papadimitriou", "Christos H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3025", "submitter": "Gerhard Woeginger", "authors": "Rudolf Fleischer and Gerhard J.
