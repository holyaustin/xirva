In theory, auction mechanisms have many desirable\neconomic properties. However, keyword auctions have a number of limitations\nincluding: the uncertainty in payment prices for advertisers; the volatility in\nthe search engine's revenue; and the weak loyalty between advertiser and search\nengine. In this paper we propose a special ad option that alleviates these\nproblems. In our proposal, an advertiser can purchase an option from a search\nengine in advance by paying an upfront fee, known as the option price. He then\nhas the right, but no obligation, to purchase among the pre-specified set of\nkeywords at the fixed cost-per-clicks (CPCs) for a specified number of clicks\nin a specified period of time. The proposed option is closely related to a\nspecial exotic option in finance that contains multiple underlying assets\n(multi-keyword) and is also multi-exercisable (multi-click). This novel\nstructure has many benefits: advertisers can have reduced uncertainty in\nadvertising; the search engine can improve the advertisers' loyalty as well as\nobtain a stable and increased expected revenue over time. Since the proposed ad\noption can be implemented in conjunction with the existing keyword auctions,\nthe option price and corresponding fixed CPCs must be set such that there is no\narbitrage between the two markets. Option pricing methods are discussed and our\nexperimental results validate the development. Compared to keyword auctions, a\nsearch engine can have an increased expected revenue by selling an ad option.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jul 2013 15:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2013 17:42:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 19 Jan 2014 20:48:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 08:27:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 19 Apr 2014 14:04:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 22:52:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 23:23:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Bowei", ""], ["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Cox", "Ingemar J.", ""], ["Kankanhalli", "Mohan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.5004", "submitter": "Julien Reichert", "authors": "Julien Reichert", "title": "On The Complexity of Counter Reachability Games", "comments": "13 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Counter reachability games are played by two players on a graph with labelled\nedges.

Our results show that the coalition\nof all women can strategically force any matching as the unique stable\nmatching, using preference lists in which at most half of the women have\nnonempty blacklists, and in which the average blacklist size is less than 1.\nThis allows the women to manipulate the market in a manner that is far more\ninconspicuous, in a sense, than previously realized. When there are less women\nthan men, we show that in the absence of blacklists for men, the women can\nforce any matching as the unique stable matching without blacklisting anyone,\nwhile when there are more women than men, each to-be-unmatched woman may have\nto blacklist as many as all men.
