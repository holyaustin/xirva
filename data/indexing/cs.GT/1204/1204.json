We first consider the question of learnability for statistical learning\nproblems in the general learning setting. The question of learnability is well\nstudied and fully characterized for binary classification and for real valued\nsupervised learning problems using the theory of uniform convergence. However\nwe show that for the general learning setting uniform convergence theory fails\nto characterize learnability. To fill this void we use stability of learning\nalgorithms to fully characterize statistical learnability in the general\nsetting. Next we consider the problem of online learning. Unlike the\nstatistical learning framework there is a dearth of generic tools that can be\nused to establish learnability and rates for online learning problems in\ngeneral. We provide online analogs to classical tools from statistical learning\ntheory like Rademacher complexity, covering numbers, etc. We further use these\ntools to fully characterize learnability for online supervised learning\nproblems.\n  II. In the second part, for general classes of convex learning problems, we\nprovide appropriate mirror descent (MD) updates for online and statistical\nlearning of these problems. Further, we show that the the MD is near optimal\nfor online convex learning and for most cases, is also near optimal for\nstatistical convex learning. We next consider the problem of convex\noptimization and show that oracle complexity can be lower bounded by the so\ncalled fat-shattering dimension of the associated linear class. Thus we\nestablish a strong connection between offline convex optimization problems and\nstatistical learning problems. We also show that for a large class of high\ndimensional optimization problems, MD is in fact near optimal even for convex\noptimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 17:17:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sridharan", "Karthik", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.4262", "submitter": "Shaolei Ren", "authors": "Shaolei Ren, Jaeok Park, Mihaela van der Schaar", "title": "Entry and Spectrum Sharing Scheme Selection in Femtocell Markets", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1008.5367", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Focusing on a femtocell communications market, we study the entrant network\nservice provider's (NSP's) long-term decision: whether to enter the market and\nwhich spectrum sharing technology to select to maximize its profit.
