If\nthe attacker spends time $t$ at a target $i$ of value $\\alpha_i$, and if he\nleaves before the defender visits the target, his utility is $t \\cdot \\alpha_i\n$; if the defender visits before he leaves, his utility is 0. The defender's\ngoal is to minimize the attacker's utility. The defender's strategy consists of\na schedule for visiting the targets; it takes her unit time to switch between\ntargets. Such games are a simplified model of a number of real-world scenarios\nsuch as protecting computer networks from intruders, crops from thieves, etc.\n  We show that optimal defender play for this continuous time security games\nreduces to the solution of a combinatorial question regarding the existence of\ninfinite sequences over a finite alphabet, with the following properties for\neach symbol $i$: (1) $i$ constitutes a prescribed fraction $p_i$ of the\nsequence. (2) The occurrences of $i$ are spread apart close to evenly, in that\nthe ratio of the longest to shortest interval between consecutive occurrences\nis bounded by a parameter $K$. We call such sequences $K$-quasi-regular.\n  We show that, surprisingly, $2$-quasi-regular sequences suffice for optimal\ndefender play. What is more, even randomized $2$-quasi-regular sequences\nsuffice for optimality. We show that such sequences always exist, and can be\ncalculated efficiently.\n  The question of the least $K$ for which deterministic $K$-quasi-regular\nsequences exist is fascinating. Using an ergodic theoretical approach, we show\nthat deterministic $3$-quasi-regular sequences always exist. For $2 \\leq K < 3$\nwe do not know whether deterministic $K$-quasi-regular sequences always exist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 07:16:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 07:43:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 22:11:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 03:07:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 03:35:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 29 Oct 2017 00:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kempe", "David", ""], ["Schulman", "Leonard J.", ""], ["Tamuz", "Omer", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.07379", "submitter": "Jia Zhang", "authors": "Jia Zhang, Weidong Ma, Tao Qin, Xiaoming Sun and Tie-Yan Liu", "title": "Randomized Mechanisms for Selling Reserved Instances in Cloud", "comments": "Already accepted by AAAI'17", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Selling reserved instances (or virtual machines) is a basic service in cloud\ncomputing.

We did not find\nany natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P\nwhen moving to high-multiplicity representation.

An important concern in this setting is representation:\nlarge groups of voters with cohesive preferences should be adequately\nrepresented by the election winners. Recently, Aziz et al.

First, we\nanswer an open question of Aziz et al., by showing that Reweighted Approval\nVoting satisfies JR for $k=3, 4, 5$, but fails it for $k\\ge 6$. Second, we\nobserve that EJR is incompatible with the Perfect Representation criterion,\nwhich is important for many applications of multi-winner voting, and propose a\nrelaxation of EJR, which we call Proportional Justified Representation (PJR).\nPJR is more demanding than JR, but, unlike EJR, it is compatible with perfect\nrepresentation, and a committee that provides PJR can be computed in polynomial\ntime if the committee size divides the number of voters. Moreover, just like\nEJR, PJR can be used to characterize the classic PAV rule in the class of\nweighted PAV rules. On the other hand, we show that EJR provides stronger\nguarantees with respect to average voter satisfaction than PJR does.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 22:51:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez", "Luis", ""], ["Elkind", "Edith", ""], ["Lackner", "Martin", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez", "Norberto", ""], ["Fisteus", "Jes\u00fas A.", ""], ["Val", "Pablo Basanta", ""], ["Skowron", "Piotr", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.10154", "submitter": "Pietro Speroni di Fenizio Ph.D.", "authors": "Pietro Speroni di Fenizio and Daniele A.
