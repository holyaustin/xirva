In\ntwo-player zero-sum games, the challenge is usually viewed as finding Nash\nequilibrium strategies, safeguarding against exploitation regardless of the\nopponent. While this captures the intricacies of chess or Go, it avoids the\nnotion of cooperation with co-players, a hallmark of the major transitions\nleading from unicellular organisms to human civilization. Beyond two players,\nalliance formation often confers an advantage; however this requires trust,\nnamely the promise of mutual cooperation in the face of incentives to defect.\nSuccessful play therefore requires adaptation to co-players rather than the\npursuit of non-exploitability. Here we argue that a systematic study of\nmany-player zero-sum games is a crucial element of artificial intelligence\nresearch. Using symmetric zero-sum matrix games, we demonstrate formally that\nalliance formation may be seen as a social dilemma, and empirically that\nna\\\"ive multi-agent reinforcement learning therefore fails to form alliances.\nWe introduce a toy model of economic competition, and show how reinforcement\nlearning may be augmented with a peer-to-peer contract mechanism to discover\nand enforce alliances.

Motivated by this reality, we introduce a\nsimple model of network disruption where an adversary can take over a limited\nnumber of user profiles in a social network with the aim of maximizing\ndisagreement and/or polarization in the network.\n  We investigate this model both theoretically and empirically.

Furthermore, we present a detailed empirical study of\nseveral natural algorithms for the adversary on both synthetic networks and\nreal world (Reddit and Twitter) data sets.

In this paper, we consider a smart city\nconsisting of a number of communities (CCHPs) and an agent of power grid (APG),\nwhere CCHPs can sell energy to the APG according to its bid. To study all\nutilities of entities in such a city from energy trading, a noncooperative\nStackelberg game between APG and CCHPs is formulated. Here, the APG gives a bid\nfor buying the energy from CCHPs, then CCHPs respond to the APG with their\noptimal energy supply that maximizing their utilities according to this bid. We\nshow that the maximum profit to the APG and utilities to the CCHPs can be\nobtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium, which is guaranteed to exist and\nunique. Because the complete information about energy supply of each CCHP is\nunknown to the APG in advance, we propose a distributed algorithm that is able\nto find the point of equilibrium through a limited number of iterations. Taking\nprivacy protection and transaction security into consideration, we design a\nblockchain-enabled energy management system. This system is composed of\nInternet of Energy (IoE) sub-system and blockchain sub-system, where the\ninformation interactions as well as energy transactions between APG and CCHPs\ncan be carried out effectively and safely.

The\nstate-of-the-art work either endows the data collector with the responsibility\nof data privacy or reports only a privacy-preserving version of the data. The\nbasic assumption of the former approach that the data collector is trustworthy\ndoes not always hold true in reality, whereas the latter approach reduces the\nvalue of data. In this paper, we investigate the privacy leakage issue from the\nroot source. Specifically, we take a fresh look to reverse the inferior\nposition of the data provider by making her dominate the game with the\ncollector to solve the dilemma in data trading. To that aim, we propose the\nnoisy-sequentially zero-determinant (NSZD) strategies by tailoring the\nclassical zero-determinant strategies, originally designed for the\nsimultaneous-move game, to adapt to the noisy sequential game. NSZD strategies\ncan empower the data provider to unilaterally set the expected payoff of the\ndata collector or enforce a positive relationship between her and the data\ncollector's expected payoffs. Both strategies can stimulate a rational data\ncollector to behave honestly, boosting a healthy data trading market. Numerical\nsimulations are used to examine the impacts of key parameters and the feasible\nregion where the data provider can be an NSZD player. Finally, we prove that\nthe data collector cannot employ NSZD to further dominate the data market for\ndeteriorating privacy leakage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 01:17:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shengling", ""], ["Shi", "Lina", ""], ["Zhang", "Junshan", ""], ["Cheng", "Xiuzhen", ""], ["Yu", "Jiguo", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13966", "submitter": "Meena Jagadeesan", "authors": "Shuchi Chawla, Meena Jagadeesan", "title": "Fairness in ad auctions through inverse proportionality", "comments": "Updated version with revised and expanded content", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the tradeoff between social welfare maximization and fairness in the\ncontext of ad auctions. We study an ad auction setting where users arrive one\nat a time, $k$ advertisers submit values for each user, and the auction assigns\na distribution over ads to each user. Following the works of Dwork and Ilvento\n(2019) and Chawla et al. (2020), our goal is to design a truthful auction that\nsatisfies \"individual fairness\" in its outcomes: informally speaking, users\nthat are similar to each other should obtain similar allocations of ads.\n  We express the fairness constraint as a kind of stability condition: any two\nusers that are assigned multiplicatively similar values by all the advertisers\nmust receive additively similar allocations for each advertiser. This value\nstability constraint is expressed as a function that maps the multiplicative\ndistance between value vectors to the maximum allowable $\\ell_\\infty$ distance\nbetween the corresponding allocations. Standard auctions do not satisfy this\nkind of value stability.\n  Our main contribution is a new class of allocation algorithms called Inverse\nProportional Allocation that achieve value stability with respect to an\nexpressive class of stability conditions. These allocation algorithms are\ntruthful and prior-free, and achieve a constant factor approximation to the\noptimal (unconstrained) social welfare. In particular, the approximation ratio\nis independent of the number of advertisers in the system. In this respect,\nthese allocation algorithms greatly surpass the guarantees achieved in previous\nwork. In fact, our algorithms achieve a near optimal tradeoff between fairness\nand social welfare under a mild assumption on the value stability constraint.\nWe also extend our results to broader notions of fairness that we call subset\nfairness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:10:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2020 19:03:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chawla", "Shuchi", ""], ["Jagadeesan", "Meena", ""]]}]
