We first formulate\nthe DSO traffic assignment problem as a strategic game wherein atomic users\nselect routes that minimise their marginal social costs, called a 'DSO game'.\nBy utilising the fact that the DSO game is a potential game, we prove that a\nglobally optimal state is a stochastically stable state under the logit\nresponse dynamics, and the better/best response dynamics converges to a locally\noptimal state. Furthermore, as an application of DSO assignment, we examine\ncharacteristics of the evolutionary implementation scheme of marginal cost\npricing. Through theoretical comparison with a fixed pricing scheme, we found\nthe following properties of the evolutionary implementation scheme: (i) the\ntotal travel time decreases smoother to an efficient traffic state as\ncongestion externalities are perfectly internalised; (ii) a traffic state would\nreach a more efficient state as the globally optimal state is stabilised.\nNumerical experiments also suggest that these properties make the evolutionary\nscheme robust in the sense that they prevent a traffic state from going to\nworse traffic states with high total travel times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2021 00:02:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2021 05:56:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Satsukawa", "Koki", ""], ["Wada", "Kentaro", ""], ["Watling", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00400", "submitter": "Paul Liu", "authors": "Aram Ebtekar and Paul Liu", "title": "An Elo-like System for Massive Multiplayer Competitions", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.GT cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Rating systems play an important role in competitive sports and games.

Existing resource trading could facilitate this paradigm with\nproper incentives, which, however, may often incur unexpected negotiation\nlatency and energy consumption, trading failures and unfair pricing, due to the\nunpredictable nature of the resource trading process. Motivated by these\nchallenges, an efficient futures-based resource trading mechanism for edge\ncomputing-assisted UAV network is proposed, where a mutually beneficial and\nrisk-tolerable forward contract is devised to promote resource trading between\nan MEC server (seller) and a UAV (buyer).

Unexpected shocks are therefore not needed to\nexpose the risks of monoculture; it can hurt accuracy even under \"normal\"\noperations, and even for algorithms that are more accurate when used by only a\nsingle decision-maker.

The\nalgorithm returns a stable matching in the sense that no unmatched persons\nprefer to be matched together rather than with their current partners (given\ntheir indicated preferences). Roth [1984] gives evidence that only stable\nmatchings are likely to be adhered to over time. Additionally, the matching is\nstudent-optimal. Preferences are constructed based on the rankings each side\ngives to the other side and the overlaps of research fields. We present and\ndiscuss the matchings that the algorithm produces in the ELLIS 2020 PhD\nprogram.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:50:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2021 18:26:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2021 19:07:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mordig", "Maximilian", ""], ["Della Vecchia", "Riccardo", ""], ["Cesa-Bianchi", "Nicol\u00f2", ""], ["Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Bernhard", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12403", "submitter": "Jittat Fakcharoenphol", "authors": "Vacharapat Mettanant, Jittat Fakcharoenphol", "title": "Fair Resource Allocation for Demands with Sharp Lower Tail Inequalities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CY cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a fairness problem in resource allocation where multiple groups\ndemand resources from a common source with the total fixed amount.

Particularly, we first introduce a\nfederated-blockchain system together with a cross-chain transfer protocol to\nfacilitate the secure and decentralized transfer of tokens between chains. We\nthen develop a novel PoS-based consensus mechanism for FedChain, which can\nsatisfy strict security requirements, prevent various blockchain-specific\nattacks, and achieve a more desirable performance compared to those of other\nexisting consensus mechanisms. Moreover, a Stackelberg game model is developed\nto examine and address the problem of centralization in the FedChain system.\nFurthermore, the game model can enhance the security and performance of\nFedChain. By analyzing interactions between the stakeholders and chain\noperators, we can prove the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium and find\nthe exact formula for this equilibrium. These results are especially important\nfor the stakeholders to determine their best investment strategies and for the\nchain operators to design the optimal policy to maximize their benefits and\nsecurity protection for FedChain. Simulations results then clearly show that\nthe FedChain framework can help stakeholders to maximize their profits and the\nchain operators to design appropriate parameters to enhance FedChain's security\nand performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 06:45:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Cong T.", ""], ["Hoang", "Dinh Thai", ""], ["Nguyen", "Diep N.", ""], ["Xiao", "Yong", ""], ["Pham", "Hoang-Anh", ""], ["Dutkiewicz", "Eryk", ""], ["Tuong", "Nguyen Huynh", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12442", "submitter": "AbdelRahman Eldosouky", "authors": "Abdelrahman Eldosouky, Tapadhir Das, Anuraag Kotra, and Shamik\n  Sengupta", "title": "Finding the Sweet Spot for Data Anonymization: A Mechanism Design\n  Perspective", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Data sharing between different organizations is an essential process in\ntoday's connected world. However, recently there were many concerns about data\nsharing as sharing sensitive information can jeopardize users' privacy. To\npreserve the privacy, organizations use anonymization techniques to conceal\nusers' sensitive data. However, these techniques are vulnerable to\nde-anonymization attacks which aim to identify individual records within a\ndataset. In this paper, a two-tier mathematical framework is proposed for\nanalyzing and mitigating the de-anonymization attacks, by studying the\ninteractions between sharing organizations, data collector, and a prospective\nattacker. In the first level, a game-theoretic model is proposed to enable\nsharing organizations to optimally select their anonymization levels for\nk-anonymization under two potential attacks: background-knowledge attack and\nhomogeneity attack. In the second level, a contract-theoretic model is proposed\nto enable the data collector to optimally reward the organizations for their\ndata. The formulated problems are studied under single-time sharing and\nrepeated sharing scenarios. Different Nash equilibria for the proposed game and\nthe optimal solution of the contract-based problem are analytically derived for\nboth scenarios. Simulation results show that the organizations can optimally\nselect their anonymization levels, while the data collector can benefit from\nincentivizing the organizations to share their data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 07:31:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Eldosouky", "Abdelrahman", ""], ["Das", "Tapadhir", ""], ["Kotra", "Anuraag", ""], ["Sengupta", "Shamik", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12522", "submitter": "Haibin Wang", "authors": "Sujoy Sikdar, Xiaoxi Guo, Haibin Wang, Lirong Xia, Yongzhi Cao", "title": "Sequential Mechanisms for Multi-type Resource Allocation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Several resource allocation problems involve multiple types of resources,\nwith a different agency being responsible for \"locally\" allocating the\nresources of each type, while a central planner wishes to provide a guarantee\non the properties of the final allocation given agents' preferences.
