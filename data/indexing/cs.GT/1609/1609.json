This\nis especially true in real world problems such as in social systems, where\nthere is a significant population of players involved in the game, and the\ncomplexity problem is critical. Previous studies in algorithmic game theory\npropose succinct games that enable small descriptions of payoff matrices and\nreduction of complexities. However, some of the suggested compromises lose\ngenerality with strict assumptions such as symmetries in utility functions and\ncannot be applied to the full range of real world problems that may be\npresented. Graphical games are relatively promising, with a good balance\nbetween complexity and generality. However, they assume a given graph structure\nof players' interactions and cannot be applied to games without such known\ngraphs. This study proposes a method to identify an interaction graph between\nplayers and subsequently decompose games into smaller components by cutting out\nweak interactions for the purpose of reducing complexity. At the beginning,\nplayers' mutual dependencies on their utilities are quantified as\nvariance-covariance matrices among players. Then, the interaction graphs among\nplayers are identified by solving eigenvalue problems. Players' interactions\nare further decomposed into linear combinations of games. This helps to find a\nconsistent equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium specified by the\ndecomposition, with reduced computational complexity. Finally, experiments on\nsimple example games are shown to verify the proposed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 07:09:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 08:45:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Iwase", "Tatsuya", ""], ["Shiga", "Takahiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.00804", "submitter": "Battista Biggio", "authors": "Samuel Rota Bul\\`o and Battista Biggio and Ignazio Pillai and Marcello\n  Pelillo and Fabio Roli", "title": "Randomized Prediction Games for Adversarial Machine Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2016", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2593488", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In spam and malware detection, attackers exploit randomization to obfuscate\nmalicious data and increase their chances of evading detection at test time;\ne.g., malware code is typically obfuscated using random strings or byte\nsequences to hide known exploits.

We extend this theory to\n\"generalized quitting games\" , a class of repeated stochastic games in which\neach player may have quitting actions, such as the Big-Match. We provide three\nsimple geometric and strongly related conditions for the weak approachability\nof a convex target set. The first is sufficient: it guarantees that, for any\nfixed horizon, a player has a strategy ensuring that the expected time-average\npayoff vector converges to the target set as horizon goes to infinity. The\nthird is necessary: if it is not satisfied, the opponent can weakly exclude the\ntarget set. In the special case where only the approaching player can quit the\ngame (Big-Match of type I), the three conditions are equivalent and coincide\nwith Blackwell's condition. Consequently, we obtain a full characterization and\nprove that the game is weakly determined-every convex set is either weakly\napproachable or weakly excludable. In games where only the opponent can quit\n(Big-Match of type II), none of our conditions is both sufficient and necessary\nfor weak approachability. We provide a continuous time sufficient condition\nusing techniques coming from differential games, and show its usefulness in\npractice, in the spirit of Vieille's seminal work for weak\napproachability.Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy\nshould not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with\nclassical Blackwell approacha-bility for convex sets, weak approachability does\nnot imply uniform approachability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 11:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Flesch", "J\u00e1nos", "", "LAMSADE, CNRS"], ["Laraki", "Rida", "", "LAMSADE, CNRS"], ["Perchet", "Vianney", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.08923", "submitter": "James Wright", "authors": "James R.

Our own recent\nwork has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as\nthe state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move\ngames (Wright & Leyton-Brown 2012, 2016). Iterative models predict that agents\nreason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of\nnonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to\nchoose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the setting.\nHowever, almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform\ndistribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even\nnonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other\nagents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior\nhas the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since\na substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and\nfurthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in\nresponses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in\nwhich level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given\nan arbitrary game. Using a Bayesian optimization package called SMAC (Hutter,\nHoos, & Leyton-Brown, 2010, 2011, 2012), we systematically evaluated a large\nspace of such models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general\nfeatures that can be computed from any normal form game. In the end, we\nrecommend a model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a\nlinear weighting of features that requires the estimation of four weights. We\nevaluated the effects of combining this new level-0 model with several\niterative models, and observed large improvements in the models' predictive\naccuracies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 14:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Wright", "James R.", ""], ["Leyton-Brown", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.08934", "submitter": "Ioannis Avramopoulos", "authors": "Ioannis Avramopoulos", "title": "Multiplicative weights, equalizers, and P=PPAD", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that, by using multiplicative weights in a game-theoretic thought\nexperiment (and an important convexity result on the composition of\nmultiplicative weights with the relative entropy function), a symmetric\nbimatrix game (that is, a bimatrix matrix wherein the payoff matrix of each\nplayer is the transpose of the payoff matrix of the other) either has an\ninterior symmetric equilibrium or there is a pure strategy that is weakly\ndominated by some mixed strategy.
