It specifies a unique way in which the reward from\ncooperation can be \"fairly\" divided among players. While it has a wide range of\nreal world applications, its use is in many cases hampered by the hardness of\nits computation. A number of researchers have tackled this problem by (i)\nfocusing on classes of games where the Shapley value can be computed\nefficiently, or (ii) proposing representation formalisms that facilitate such\nefficient computation, or (iii) approximating the Shapley value in certain\nclasses of games. For the classical \\textit{characteristic function}\nrepresentation, the only attempt to approximate the Shapley value for the\ngeneral class of games is due to Castro \\textit{et al.} \\cite{castro}. While\nthis algorithm provides a bound on the approximation error, this bound is\n\\textit{asymptotic}, meaning that it only holds when the number of samples\nincreases to infinity. On the other hand, when a finite number of samples is\ndrawn, an unquantifiable error is introduced, meaning that the bound no longer\nholds. With this in mind, we provide non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation\nerror for two cases: where (i) the \\textit{variance}, and (ii) the\n\\textit{range}, of the players' marginal contributions is known. Furthermore,\nfor the second case, we show that when the range is significantly large\nrelative to the Shapley value, the bound can be improved (from $O(\\frac{r}{m})$\nto $O(\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{m}})$).
