It is\nknown that many classic voting rules can be distance rationalized. In this\npaper, we provide new results on distance rationalizability of several\nCondorcet-consistent voting rules.

Here, we show\nthat the CS problem is a potential game (PG) and thus the fictitious play (FP)\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium (NE) either in pure or mixed strategies. Using\na 2-player 2-channel game, it is shown that convergence in mixed strategies\nmight lead to cycles of action profiles which lead to individual spectral\nefficiencies (SE) which are worse than the SE at the worst NE in mixed and pure\nstrategies. Finally, exploiting the fact that the CS problem is a PG and an\naggregation game, we present a method to implement FP with local information\nand minimum feedback.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Sep 2010 19:25:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Perlaza", "S.

Decisions to reject bids are\nirrevocable, whereas decisions to accept bids may be canceled at a cost that is\na fixed fraction of the bid value. Previous to our work, deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms were known when the constraint is a matroid constraint.\nWe extend this and give a deterministic algorithm for the case when the\nconstraint is an intersection of $k$ matroid constraints. We further prove a\nmatching lower bound on the competitive ratio for this problem and extend our\nresults to arbitrary downward closed set systems. This problem has applications\nto banner advertisement, semi-streaming, routing, load balancing and other\nproblems where preemption or cancellation of previous allocations is allowed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Sep 2010 22:05:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 05:59:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ashwinkumar", "B.

We study primarily the termination objective,\nwhere the goal of one player is to maximize the probability of reaching counter\nvalue 0, while the other player wishes to avoid this. Partly motivated by the\ngoal of understanding termination objectives, we also study certain \"limit\" and\n\"long run average\" reward objectives that are closely related to some\nwell-studied objectives for stochastic games with rewards. Examples of problems\nwe address include: does player 1 have a strategy to ensure that the counter\neventually hits 0, i.e., terminates, almost surely, regardless of what player 2\ndoes? Or that the liminf (or limsup) counter value equals infinity with a\ndesired probability? Or that the long run average reward is >0 with desired\nprobability? We show that the qualitative termination problem for OC-SSGs is in\nNP intersection coNP, and is in P-time for 1-player OC-SSGs, or equivalently\nfor one-counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs). Moreover, we show that\nquantitative limit problems for OC-SSGs are in NP intersection coNP, and are in\nP-time for 1-player OC-MDPs. Both qualitative limit problems and qualitative\ntermination problems for OC-SSGs are already at least as hard as Condon's\nquantitative decision problem for finite-state SSGs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Sep 2010 17:28:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e1zdil", "Tom\u00e1\u0161", ""], ["Bro\u017eek", "V\u00e1clav", ""], ["Etessami", "Kousha", ""]]}]
