Behavioral experiments\nhave been largely conducted to shed light into the mechanisms behind\ncooperation and other behavioral traits. However, most of these experiments\nhave been conducted in laboratories with highly controlled experimental\nprotocols but with varied limitations which limits the reproducibility and the\ngeneralization of the results obtained. In an attempt to overcome these\nlimitations, some experimental approaches have moved human behavior\nexperimentation from laboratories to public spaces, where behaviors occur\nnaturally, and have opened the participation to the general public within the\ncitizen science framework. Given the open nature of these environments, it is\ncritical to establish the appropriate protocols to maintain the same data\nquality that one can obtain in the laboratories. Here, we introduce Citizen\nSocial Lab, a software platform designed to be used in the wild using citizen\nscience practices. The platform allows researchers to collect data in a more\nrealistic context while maintaining the scientific rigour, and it is structured\nin a modular and scalable way so it can also be easily adapted for online or\nbrick-and-mortar experimental laboratories. Following citizen science\nguidelines, the platform is designed to motivate a more general population into\nparticipation, but also to promote engaging and learning of the scientific\nresearch process. We also review the main results of the experiments performed\nusing the platform up to now, and the set of games that each experiment\nincludes. Finally, we evaluate some properties of the platform, such as the\nheterogeneity of the samples of the experiments and their satisfaction level,\nand the parameters that demonstrate the robustness of the platform and the\nquality of the data collected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 12:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Vicens", "Juli\u00e1n", ""], ["Perell\u00f3", "Josep", ""], ["Duch", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00170", "submitter": "Artur Pop{\\l}awski Mr.", "authors": "Artur Poplawski", "title": "Self-consistency of voting implies majority vote", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Paper develops axiomatic characterization of the family of majority vote\nrules in the way alternative to characterization of the majority vote given in\npaper of Kenneth O.

Multiple auction\nplatforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of\nthis multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In\nthis setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each\nSSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction,\nbetween SSPs.In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad\nspaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad\nspaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a\nbidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as\npossible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this\nSSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists\nof the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of\nthe internet user or of the ad placement.Using classical multi-armed bandit\nstrategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in\nthis setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very\ncorrelated. In this paper we design and experiment a version of the Thompson\nSampling algorithm that easily takes this correlation into account. We combine\nthis bayesian algorithm with a particle filter, which permits to handle\nnon-stationarity by sequentially estimating the distribution of the highest bid\nto beat in order to win an auction. We apply this methodology on two real\nauction datasets, and show that it significantly outperforms more classical\napproaches.The strategy defined in this paper is being developed to be deployed\non thousands of publishers worldwide.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 08:47:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Jauvion", "Gr\u00e9goire", "", "IMT"], ["Grislain", "Nicolas", "", "IMT"], ["Dkengne", "Pascal Sielenou", "", "IMT"], ["Garivier", "Aur\u00e9lien", "", "IMT"], ["Gerchinovitz", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "IMT"]]}, {"id": "1807.03435", "submitter": "Balasubramanian Sivan", "authors": "Hedyeh Beyhaghi, Negin Golrezaei, Renato Paes Leme, Martin Pal,\n  Balasubramanian Sivan", "title": "Improved Revenue Bounds for Posted-Price and Second-Price Mechanisms", "comments": "Accepted to Operations Research", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study revenue maximization through sequential posted-price (SPP)\nmechanisms in single-dimensional settings with $n$ buyers and independent but\nnot necessarily identical value distributions.

To fit into practical scenarios, we further\nformulate a Bayesian Stackelberg game with incomplete information to analyze\nthe interaction between the crowdsensing service provider and mobile users,\nwhere the social structure information (the social network effects) is\nuncertain. The existence and uniqueness of the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium\nare validated by identifying the best response strategies of the mobile users.\nNumerical results corroborate the fact that the network effects tremendously\nstimulate higher mobile participation level and greater revenue of the\ncrowdsensing service provider.

One of our major contribution is a\npractical convex optimization formulation of the original problem. We devise a\nnovel re-parametrization of auction mechanism with discrete sets of\nrepresentative instances. To construct the optimization problem, we build an\nauction simulation system which estimates the resulted business indicators of\nthe selected parameters by replaying the auctions recorded from real online\nrequests. We summarized the experiments on real search traffics to analyze the\neffects of fidelity of auction simulation, the efficacy under various\nconstraint targets and the influence of regularization. The experiment results\nshow that with proper entropy regularization, we are able to maximize revenue\nwhile constraining other business indicators within given ranges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 12:42:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Gang", ""], ["Xie", "Zhihui", ""], ["Wang", "Liang", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11914", "submitter": "Alberto Marchesi", "authors": "Giuseppe De Nittis, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti", "title": "Computing the Strategy to Commit to in Polymatrix Games (Extended\n  Version)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Leadership games provide a powerful paradigm to model many real-world\nsettings. Most literature focuses on games with a single follower who acts\noptimistically, breaking ties in favour of the leader. Unfortunately, for\nreal-world applications, this is unlikely. In this paper, we look for\nefficiently solvable games with multiple followers who play either\noptimistically or pessimistically, i.e., breaking ties in favour or against the\nleader. We study the computational complexity of finding or approximating an\noptimistic or pessimistic leader-follower equilibrium in specific classes of\nsuccinct games---polymatrix like---which are equivalent to 2-player Bayesian\ngames with uncertainty over the follower, with interdependent or independent\ntypes. Furthermore, we provide an exact algorithm to find a pessimistic\nequilibrium for those game classes. Finally, we show that in general polymatrix\ngames the computation is harder even when players are forced to play pure\nstrategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 16:50:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["De Nittis", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Marchesi", "Alberto", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""]]}]
