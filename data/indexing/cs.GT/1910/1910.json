Riding on the wave\nof the proliferation of sharing economy, Airbnb-like charger sharing markets\nopens the opportunity to expand the existing charging networks without\nrequiring costly and time-consuming infrastructure investments, yet the\nsuccessful design of such markets relies on innovations at the interface\nbetween game theory, mechanism design, and large scale optimization. In this\npaper, we propose a price-based iterative double auction for charger sharing\nmarkets where charger owners rent out their under-utilized chargers to the\ncharge-needing EV drivers. Charger owners and EV drivers form a two-sided\nmarket which is cleared by a price-based double auction. Chargers' locations,\navailability, and time unit costs as well as the EV drivers' time, distance\nconstraints, and preferences are considered in the allocation and scheduling\nprocess. The goal is to compute social welfare maximizing allocations which\nbenefits both charger owners and EV drivers and, in turn, ensure the continuous\ngrowth of the market. We prove that the proposed double auction is budget\nbalanced, individually rational, and that it is a weakly dominant strategy for\nEV drivers and charger owners to truthfully report their charging time\nconstraints. In addition, results from our computation study show that the\ndouble auction achieves on average 94% efficiency compared with the optimal\nsolutions and scales well to larger problem instances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:40:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Jie", ""], ["Wong", "Terrence", ""], ["Wang", "Chun", ""], ["Yu", "Jia Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00094", "submitter": "Marion Hallet", "authors": "Thomas Brihaye, Gilles Geeraerts, Marion Hallet, Benjamin Monmege and\n  Bruno Quoitin", "title": "Dynamics on Games: Simulation-Based Techniques and Applications to\n  Routing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider multi-player games played on graphs, in which the players aim at\nfulfilling their own (not necessarily antagonistic) objectives.

The storage investment\nbrings the benefits of stabilizing renewable energy suppliers' outputs, but it\nalso leads to substantial investment costs as well as some surprising changes\nin the market outcome. To study the equilibrium decisions of storage investment\nin the renewable energy suppliers' competition, we model the interactions\nbetween suppliers and consumers using a three-stage game-theoretic model. In\nStage I, at the beginning of the investment horizon, suppliers decide whether\nto invest in storage. Once such decisions have been made, in the day-ahead\nmarket of each day, suppliers decide on their bidding prices and quantities in\nStage II, based on which consumers decide the electricity quantity purchased\nfrom each supplier in Stage III. In the real-time market, a supplier is\npenalized if his actual generation falls short of his commitment. We\ncharacterize a price-quantity competition equilibrium of Stage II, and we\nfurther characterize a storage-investment equilibrium in Stage I incorporating\nelectricity-selling revenue and storage cost. Counter-intuitively, we show that\nthe uncertainty of renewable energy without storage investment can lead to\nhigher supplier profits compared with the stable generations with storage\ninvestment due to the reduced market competition under random energy\ngeneration. Simulations further illustrate results due to the market\ncompetition. For example, a higher penalty for not meeting the commitment, a\nhigher storage cost, or a lower consumer demand can sometimes increase a\nsupplier's profit. We also show that although storage investment can increase a\nsupplier 's profit, the first-mover supplier who invests in storage may benefit\nless than the free-rider competitor who chooses not to invest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2019 12:03:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2019 03:22:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Dongwei", ""], ["Wang", "Hao", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaojun", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.02750", "submitter": "Abhishek Gupta", "authors": "Abhishek k Gupta and Adrish Banerjee", "title": "Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Traffic Networks with Anarchists\n  and Socialist Traffic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous traffic network with multiple\nusers classes which differ considerably in their path selection objective.

In this paper,\ninspired by social structures in various real-life scenarios, we introduce\ncertain restrictions on coalition formation, and on their basis we introduce a\nnumber of equilibrium notions. As an application we study our equilibrium\nnotions in resource selection games (RSGs), and we present a complete set of\nexistence and non-existence results for general RSGs and their important\nspecial cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:30:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Caskurlu", "Bugra", ""], ["Ekici", "Ozgun", ""], ["Kizilkaya", "Fatih Erdem", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.06228", "submitter": "Tommaso Bianchi", "authors": "Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Tommaso Bianchi, Nicola Gatti", "title": "Learning to Correlate in Multi-Player General-Sum Sequential Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the context of multi-player, general-sum games, there is an increasing\ninterest in solution concepts modeling some form of communication among\nplayers, since they can lead to socially better outcomes with respect to Nash\nequilibria, and may be reached through learning dynamics in a decentralized\nfashion. In this paper, we focus on coarse correlated equilibria (CCEs) in\nsequential games. First, we complete the picture on the complexity of finding\nsocial-welfare-maximizing CCEs by showing that the problem is not in Poly-APX\nunless P = NP. Furthermore, simple arguments show that CFR - working with\nbehavioral strategies - may not converge to a CCE. However, we devise a simple\nvariant (CFR-S) which provably converges to the set of CCEs, but may be\nempirically inefficient. Thus, we design a variant of the CFR algorithm (called\nCFR-Jr) which approaches the set of CCEs with a regret bound sub-linear in the\nsize of the game, and is shown to be dramatically faster than CFR-S and the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms to compute CCEs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Celli", "Andrea", ""], ["Marchesi", "Alberto", ""], ["Bianchi", "Tommaso", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.06384", "submitter": "Georgios Birmpas", "authors": "Georgios Birmpas, Evangelos Markakis, Guido Sch\\\"afer", "title": "Cost Sharing over Combinatorial Domains: Complement-Free Cost Functions\n  and Beyond", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study mechanism design for combinatorial cost sharing.

We also study a number of variants and\nextensions, including when approximate equitability is considered, or when the\nitem to be divided is undesirable (also known as chore division).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bei", "Xiaohui", ""], ["Suksompong", "Warut", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.14269", "submitter": "Biaoshuai Tao", "authors": "Yuqing Kong, Chris Peikert, Grant Schoenebeck and Biaoshuai Tao", "title": "Outsourcing Computation: the Minimal Refereed Mechanism", "comments": "17 pages, 1 figure; WINE 2019: The 15th Conference on Web and\n  Internet Economics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a setting where a verifier with limited computation power\ndelegates a resource intensive computation task---which requires a $T\\times S$\ncomputation tableau---to two provers where the provers are rational in that\neach prover maximizes their own payoff---taking into account losses incurred by\nthe cost of computation.
