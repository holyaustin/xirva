Having completed their tasks and generated\nprofits, task payoffs must be divided among the agents in some reasonable\nmanner. Cooperative games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) are a recent\nframework proposed by Chalkiadakis et al. (2010), generalizing classic\ncooperative games to the case where agents may belong to more than one\ncoalition. Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided profits, some\nagents may feel dissatisfied with their share of the profits, and would like to\ndeviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a\ncomplicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight\nfrom some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it\nis possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators.\nThis means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed\ncoalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators.\nIn this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core\nin OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is\nnot empty, and whether a core payoff division can be found in polynomial time;\nmoreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial\ntime algorithms. Finally, we introduce and study a natural class of OCF games,\nLinear Bottleneck Games. Interestingly, we show that such games always have a\nnon-empty core, even assuming a highly lenient reaction to deviations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 22:30:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2014 15:27:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2014 14:26:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zick", "Yair", ""], ["Chalkiadakis", "Georgios", ""], ["Elkind", "Edith", ""], ["Markakis", "Evangelos", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0643", "submitter": "Stefano Leucci", "authors": "Davide Bil\\`o and Luciano Gual\\`a and Stefano Leucci and Guido\n  Proietti", "title": "The Max-Distance Network Creation Game on General Host Graphs", "comments": "17 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study a generalization of the classic \\emph{network creation\ngame} in the scenario in which the $n$ players sit on a given arbitrary\n\\emph{host graph}, which constrains the set of edges a player can activate at a\ncost of $\\alpha \\geq 0$ each. This finds its motivations in the physical\nlimitations one can have in constructing links in practice, and it has been\nstudied in the past only when the routing cost component of a player is given\nby the sum of distances to all the other nodes. Here, we focus on another\npopular routing cost, namely that which takes into account for each player its\n\\emph{maximum} distance to any other player. For this version of the game, we\nfirst analyze some of its computational and dynamic aspects, and then we\naddress the problem of understanding the structure of associated pure Nash\nequilibria. In this respect, we show that the corresponding price of anarchy\n(PoA) is fairly bad, even for several basic classes of host graphs. More\nprecisely, we first exhibit a lower bound of $\\Omega (\\sqrt{ n / (1+\\alpha)})$\nfor any $\\alpha = o(n)$. Notice that this implies a counter-intuitive lower\nbound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ for very small values of $\\alpha$ (i.e., edges can\nbe activated almost for free).

First, we use\ntheoretical analysis to compare the two schemes and show that for a single\nprovider in a market, as long as the WiFi capacity is abundant, the flat-rate\npricing leads to more revenue.

We formulate {the interactions between the global and\nlocal providers as a dynamic game. In Stage I, the global provider bargains\nwith the local provider in each market to determine the global WiFi service\nprice and revenue sharing agreement. In Stage II, local users and travelers\nchoose local or global WiFi services. We analytically show that the global\nprovider prefers to use the usage-based pricing to avoid a severe competition\nwith the local provider. At the equilibrium, the global provider always shares\nthe majority of his revenue with the local provider to incentivize the\ncooperation. Finally, we analytically study how the interaction changes if the\nlocal market has more than one local provider. In this case, the global\nprovider can integrate the coverages of multiple local providers and provide a\nbetter service. Compared to the local monopoly case, local market competition\nenables the global provider to share less revenue with each of the local\nproviders.

Assuming a reactive interference-limited\nscenario, each transmitter is allowed to select one frequency channel (from a\ncommon pool) together with a power level at each transmission trial; hence, for\nall transmitters, not only the fading gain, but also the number of interfering\ntransmissions and their transmit powers are varying over time. Due to the\nabsence of a central controller and time-varying network characteristics, it is\nhighly inefficient for transmitters to acquire global channel and network\nknowledge. Therefore a reasonable assumption is that transmitters have no\nknowledge of fading gains, interference, and network topology. Each\ntransmitting node selfishly aims at maximizing its average reward (or\nminimizing its average cost), which is a function of the action of that\nspecific transmitter as well as those of all other transmitters. This scenario\nis modeled as a multi-player multi-armed adversarial bandit game, in which\nmultiple players receive an a priori unknown reward with an arbitrarily\ntime-varying distribution by sequentially pulling an arm, selected from a known\nand finite set of arms. Since players do not know the arm with the highest\naverage reward in advance, they attempt to minimize their so-called regret,\ndetermined by the set of players' actions, while attempting to achieve\nequilibrium in some sense. To this end, we design in this paper two joint power\nlevel and channel selection strategies. We prove that the gap between the\naverage reward achieved by our approaches and that based on the best fixed\nstrategy converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, the empirical joint\nfrequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated equilibria.

Specifically, we provide an\nalgorithm that finds $\\tilde O(\\sqrt n)$-sketch of a submodular function with\nonly $\\tilde O(n^\\frac{3}{2})$ value queries, and an algorithm that finds\n$\\tilde O(\\sqrt n)$-sketch of a subadditive function with $O(n)$ demand and\nvalue queries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 18:15:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cohavi", "Keren", ""], ["Dobzinski", "Shahar", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7294", "submitter": "Lili Dworkin", "authors": "Kareem Amin, Rachel Cummings, Lili Dworkin, Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth", "title": "Online Learning and Profit Maximization from Revealed Preferences", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of learning from revealed preferences in an online\nsetting.

This\nproves that finding a winning strategy of P2 is $\\mathcal{NP}$-complete.\nConsequently, we design an $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ factor approximation algorithm,\nwhere $e \\approx 2.718$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 16:14:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bandyapadhyay", "Sayan", ""], ["Banik", "Aritra", ""], ["Das", "Sandip", ""], ["Sarkar", "Hirak", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8535", "submitter": "Nicolas Bousquet", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet and Sergey Norin and Adrian Vetta", "title": "A Near-Optimal Mechanism for Impartial Selection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine strategy-proof elections to select a winner amongst a set of\nagents, each of whom cares only about winning. This impartial selection problem\nwas introduced independently by Holzman and Moulin and Alon et al. Fisher and\nKlimm showed that the permutation mechanism is impartial and $1/2$-optimal,\nthat is, it selects an agent who gains, in expectation, at least half the\nnumber of votes of most popular agent. Furthermore, they showed the mechanism\nis $7/12$-optimal if agents cannot abstain in the election. We show that a\nbetter guarantee is possible, provided the most popular agent receives at least\na large enough, but constant, number of votes. Specifically, we prove that, for\nany $\\epsilon>0$, there is a constant $N_{\\epsilon}$ (independent of the number\n$n$ of voters) such that, if the maximum number of votes of the most popular\nagent is at least $N_{\\epsilon}$ then the permutation mechanism is\n$(\\frac{3}{4}-\\epsilon)$-optimal. This result is tight.\n  Furthermore, in our main result, we prove that near-optimal impartial\nmechanisms exist. In particular, there is an impartial mechanism that is\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-optimal, for any $\\epsilon>0$, provided that the maximum number\nof votes of the most popular agent is at least a constant $M_{\\epsilon}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 19:02:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bousquet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Norin", "Sergey", ""], ["Vetta", "Adrian", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8540", "submitter": "Michael Winterrose", "authors": "M.

The attacker-defender\ninteraction is modeled as a game in which a defender deploys a temporal\nplatform migration defense. Against this defense, a population of attackers\ndevelop strategies specifying the temporal ordering of resource investments\nthat bring targeted zero-day exploits into existence. Attacker response to two\ndefender temporal platform migration scheduling policies are examined. In the\nfirst defender scheduling policy, the defender selects the active platform in\neach match uniformly at random from a pool of available platforms. In the\nsecond policy the defender schedules each successive platform to maximize the\ndiversity of the source code presented to the attacker. Adaptive attacker\nresponse strategies are modeled by finite state machine (FSM) constructs that\nevolve during simulated play against defender strategies via an evolutionary\nalgorithm. It is demonstrated that the attacker learns to invest heavily in\nexploit creation for the platform with the least similarity to other platforms\nwhen faced with a diversity defense, while avoiding investment in exploits for\nthis least similar platform when facing a randomization defense. Additionally,\nit is demonstrated that the diversity-maximizing defense is superior for\nshorter duration attacker-defender engagements, but performs sub-optimally in\nextended attacker-defender interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 19:26:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Winterrose", "M.
