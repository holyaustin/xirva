A key issue in\nthese settings, where direct monitoring is infeasible, is incentivizing agents\nin the `crowd' to put in effort to make good evaluations, as well as to\ntruthfully report their evaluations. This leads to a new family of information\nelicitation problems with unobservable ground truth, where an agent's\nproficiency- the probability with which she correctly evaluates the underlying\nground truth- is endogenously determined by her strategic choice of how much\neffort to put into the task.\n  Our main contribution is a simple, new, mechanism for binary information\nelicitation for multiple tasks when agents have endogenous proficiencies, with\nthe following properties: (i) Exerting maximum effort followed by truthful\nreporting of observations is a Nash equilibrium. (ii) This is the equilibrium\nwith maximum payoff to all agents, even when agents have different maximum\nproficiencies, can use mixed strategies, and can choose a different strategy\nfor each of their tasks. Our information elicitation mechanism requires only\nminimal bounds on the priors, asks agents to only report their own evaluations,\nand does not require any conditions on a diverging number of agent reports per\ntask to achieve its incentive properties. The main idea behind our mechanism is\nto use the presence of multiple tasks and ratings to identify and penalize\nlow-effort agreement: the mechanism rewards agents for agreeing with a\n`reference' rater on a task but also penalizes for blind agreement by\nsubtracting out a statistic term designed so that agents obtain reward only\nwhen they put effort into their observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 19:10:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Dasgupta", "Anirban", ""], ["Ghosh", "Arpita", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.0916", "submitter": "Bruno Salcedo", "authors": "Bruno Salcedo", "title": "Implementation without commitment in moral hazard environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Interdependent-choice equilibrium is defined as an extension of correlated\nequilibrium in which the mediator is able to choose the timing of her signals,\nand observe the actions taken by the players.

These penalty-regulated dynamics are equivalent to\nplayers keeping an exponentially discounted aggregate of their on-going payoffs\nand then using a smooth best response to pick an action based on these\nperformance scores. Owing to this inherent duality, the proposed dynamics\nsatisfy a variant of the folk theorem of evolutionary game theory and they\nconverge to (arbitrarily precise) approximations of Nash equilibria in\npotential games. Motivated by applications to traffic engineering, we exploit\nthis duality further to design a discrete-time, payoff-based learning algorithm\nwhich retains these convergence properties and only requires players to observe\ntheir in-game payoffs: moreover, the algorithm remains robust in the presence\nof stochastic perturbations and observation errors, and it does not require any\nsynchronization between players.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Mar 2013 21:49:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 6 Apr 2014 20:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Coucheney", "Pierre", ""], ["Gaujal", "Bruno", ""], ["Mertikopoulos", "Panayotis", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.2558", "submitter": "Timo Mennle", "authors": "Timo Mennle and Sven Seuken", "title": "Hybrid Mechanisms: Trading off Strategyproofness and Efficiency of\n  Random Assignment Mechanisms", "comments": "Working Paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Severe impossibility results restrict the design of strategyproof random\nassignment mechanisms, and trade-offs are necessary when aiming for more\ndemanding efficiency requirements, such as ordinal or rank efficiency.

The proposed dynamic is a generalization of the discrete replicator\ndynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract dense\nclusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution\nof a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to\ndetect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic\nparameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process. The path\nparameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a current\ncluster containing a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolution\nprocess proceeds. By limiting the maximal probability, the phenomenon of some\nvertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is suppressed, thus\nmaking evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with a\nfixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The time\ncomplexity of the path following replicator dynamic is only linear in the\nnumber of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze graphs with millions of\nvertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes.\nBesides, it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges of\ndifferent orders. We apply it to four important problems: maximum clique\nproblem, densest k-subgraph problem, structure fitting, and discovery of\nhigh-density regions.

Two of these\nalgorithms give regret-proof schedules, i.e. they reach Nash equilibria where\nno consumers regret their previous decisions. Our work is the first attempt to\naddress these marketing problems from an algorithmic point of view.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 16:32:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Zhigang", ""], ["Chen", "Xujin", ""], ["Wang", "Changjun", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6976", "submitter": "Monica Patriche", "authors": "Monica Patriche", "title": "The reduction of qualitative games", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT math.OC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We extend the study of the iterated elimination of strictly dominated\nstrategies (IESDS) from Nash strategic games to a class of qualitative games.\nAlso in this case, the IESDS process leads us to a kind of 'rationalizable'\nresult.
