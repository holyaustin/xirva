In this\npaper, we show that current group disparate outcomes may be immovable even when\nhiring decisions are bound by an input-output notion of \"individual fairness.\"\nInstead, we construct a dynamic reputational model of the labor market that\nillustrates the reinforcing nature of asymmetric outcomes resulting from\ngroups' divergent accesses to resources and as a result, investment choices. To\naddress these disparities, we adopt a dual labor market composed of a Temporary\nLabor Market (TLM), in which firms' hiring strategies are constrained to ensure\nstatistical parity of workers granted entry into the pipeline, and a Permanent\nLabor Market (PLM), in which firms hire top performers as desired. Individual\nworker reputations produce externalities for their group; the corresponding\nfeedback loop raises the collective reputation of the initially disadvantaged\ngroup via a TLM fairness intervention that need not be permanent. We show that\nsuch a restriction on hiring practices induces an equilibrium that, under\nparticular market conditions, Pareto-dominates those arising from strategies\nthat statistically discriminate or employ a \"group-blind\" criterion. The\nenduring nature of equilibria that are both inequitable and Pareto suboptimal\nsuggests that fairness interventions beyond procedural checks of hiring\ndecisions will be of critical importance in a world where machines play a\ngreater role in the employment process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 20:24:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:33:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Lily", ""], ["Chen", "Yiling", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.00070", "submitter": "Roberto da Silva", "authors": "Roberto da Silva, Henrique A.

The anticipation of a player's decision by their opponents\nis counterfactually dependent on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibra where\nthe decisions are made independently. The equilibrium, when it exists, is\nunique and is Pareto optimal.\n  This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart of the Perfect Prediction\nEquilibrium; the prediction happens \"in another room\" rather than in the past.\nThe equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter's\nsuperrationality to non-symmetric games.\n  Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational\nstrategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a\nstrategy profile that is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible\nworlds and rationality in all possible worlds, a stronger concept than common\nknowledge of rationality but also than common counterfactual belief of\nrationality.\n  We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common to\nthis and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential\nDecision Theory.

A service exchange dilemma arises when\nnon-cooperation among self-interested users, and zero social welfare is\nobtained at myopic equilibrium. Traditional rating protocols are not effective\nto overcome the inefficiency of the socially undesirable equilibrium due to\nspecific features of crowdsourcing: a large number of anonymous users having\nasymmetric service requirements, different service capabilities, and\ndynamically joining/leaving a crowdsourcing platform with imperfect monitoring.\nIn this paper, we develop the first game-theoretic design of the two-sided\nrating protocol to stimulate cooperation among self-interested users, which\nconsists of a recommended strategy and a rating update rule. The recommended\nstrategy recommends a desirable behavior from three predefined plans according\nto intrinsic parameters, while the rating update rule involves the update of\nratings of both users, and uses differential punishments that punish users with\ndifferent ratings differently.
