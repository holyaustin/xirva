We first introduce a new\nclass of infinite population games, termed graphon games, where a continuum of\nheterogeneous agents interact according to a graphon. After studying properties\nof equilibria in graphon games, we show that graphon equilibria can approximate\nequilibria of large network games sampled from the graphon. We next show that,\nunder some regularity assumptions, the graphon approach enables the design of\nasymptotically optimal interventions via the solution of an optimization\nproblem with much lower dimension than the one based on the entire network\nstructure. We illustrate our framework on a synthetic dataset of rural villages\nand show that the graphon intervention can be computed efficiently and based\nsolely on aggregated relational data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 21:58:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2018 16:16:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2018 15:06:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 10 Aug 2019 00:45:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:39:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Parise", "Francesca", ""], ["Ozdaglar", "Asuman", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.00257", "submitter": "Nicolas Troquard", "authors": "Nicolas Troquard", "title": "Individual Resource Games and Resource Redistributions", "comments": "To appear in Journal of Logic and Computation.

The agents are\nendowed with a bag of resources and try to achieve a resource objective. For\neach agent, an action consists in making available a part of their endowed\nresources. All the resources made available can be used towards the agents'\nobjectives. We study three decision problems, the first of which is deciding\nwhether an action profile is a Nash equilibrium: when all the agents have\nchosen an action, it is a Nash Equilibrium if no agent has an incentive to\nchange their action unilaterally. When dealing with resources, interesting\nquestions arise as to whether some equilibria can be eliminated or constructed\nby a central authority by redistributing the available resources among the\nagents. In our economies, division of property in divorce law exemplifies how a\ncentral authority can redistribute the resources of individuals and why they\nwould desire to do so. We thus study two related decision problems: (i)\nrational elimination: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed\nresources be redistributed so that it is not the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?\n(ii) Rational construction: given an action profile's outcome, can the endowed\nresources be redistributed so that it is the outcome of a Nash equilibrium?\nAmong other results, we prove that all three problems are PSPACE-complete when\nthe resources are described in the very expressive language of the\npropositional multiplicative and additive linear logic. We also identify a new\nmodest fragment of linear logic that we call MULT, suitable to represent\nmultisets and reason about the inclusion and equality of bags of resources.

Ride-sharing platforms\nsuch as Uber and Lyft are becoming a more commonplace, particularly in urban\nenvironments. While such services may be deemed more convenient than riding\npublic transit due to their on-demand nature, reports show that they do not\nnecessarily decrease the congestion in major cities. One of the key problems is\nthat typically mobility decision support systems focus on individual utility\nand react only after congestion appears. In this paper, we propose socially\nconsiderate multi-modal routing algorithms that are proactive and consider, via\npredictions, the shared effect of riders on the overall efficacy of mobility\nservices. We have adapted the MATSim simulator framework to incorporate the\nproposed algorithms present a simulation analysis of a case study in Nashville,\nTennessee that assesses the effects of our routing models on the traffic\ncongestion for different levels of penetration and adoption of socially\nconsiderate routes. Our results indicate that even at a low penetration (social\nratio), we are able to achieve an improvement in system-level performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 19:50:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Samal", "Chinmaya", ""], ["Zheng", "Liyuan", ""], ["Sun", "Fangzhou", ""], ["Ratliff", "Lillian J.", ""], ["Dubey", "Abhishek", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10351", "submitter": "Anja Huber", "authors": "Tobias Harks, Martin Hoefer, Anja Huber and Manuel Surek", "title": "Efficient Black-Box Reductions for Separable Cost Sharing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DM cs.DS math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In cost sharing games with delays, a set of agents jointly allocates a finite\nsubset of resources. Each resource has a fixed cost that has to be shared by\nthe players, and each agent has a nonshareable player-specific delay for each\nresource. A prominent example is uncapacitated facility location (UFL), where\nfacilities need to be opened (at a shareable cost) and clients want to connect\nto opened facilities. Each client pays a cost share and his non-shareable\nphysical connection cost. Given any profile of subsets allocated by the agents,\na separable cost sharing protocol determines cost shares that satisfy budget\nbalance on every resource and separability over the resources. Moreover, a\nseparable protocol guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria in the induced\nstrategic game for the agents. In this paper, we study separable cost sharing\nprotocols in several general combinatorial domains. We provide black-box\nreductions to reduce the design of a separable cost-sharing protocol to the\ndesign of an approximation algorithm for the underlying cost minimization\nproblem. In this way, we obtain new separable cost-sharing protocols in games\nbased on arbitrary player-specific matroids, single-source connection games\nwithout delays, and connection games on $n$-series-parallel graphs with delays.\nAll these reductions are efficiently computable - given an initial allocation\nprofile, we obtain a cheaper profile and separable cost shares turning the\nprofile into a pure Nash equilibrium. Hence, in these domains any approximation\nalgorithm can be used to obtain a separable cost sharing protocol with a price\nof stability bounded by the approximation factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Harks", "Tobias", ""], ["Hoefer", "Martin", ""], ["Huber", "Anja", ""], ["Surek", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10465", "submitter": "Yusuke Kawamoto", "authors": "M\\'ario S.

The defender, on the other hand,\ntypically tries to decrease leakage by introducing some controlled noise. This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nadversary. In this work we consider operators for modeling visible and\ninvisible choice in protocol composition, and we study their algebraic\nproperties. We then formalize the interplay between defender and adversary in a\ngame-theoretic framework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the\npayoff is information leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games,\ndepending on whether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether\nor not the choices of the defender are visible to the adversary. Finally, we\nestablish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information leakage, and\nprovide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of equilibrium)\nfor both attacker and defender in the various cases.

A\ncentral authority is able to regulate this competition by means of a (uniform)\nprice cap.

We provide an algorithm\nthat finds an optimal price cap for networks with affine latency functions and\na full support Wardrop equilibrium. Second, we consider the induced network\nperformance at an optimal price cap. We show that for two link networks with\naffine latency functions, the congestion costs at the optimal price cap are at\nmost $8/7$ times the optimal congestion costs. For more general latency\nfunctions, this bound goes up to 2 under the assumption that an uncapped Nash\nequilibrium exists.
