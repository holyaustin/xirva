This is an important\nconsideration in settings such as crowdsourcing competitions, open science\nchallenges and group-based assignments, where a large number of agents organize\nthemselves into small teams which then compete against each other. A central\ntension here is between the strategic interests of agents who want to have the\nhighest-performing team, and that of the principal who wants teams to be\nbalanced. Moreover, although the principal cannot choose the teams or modify\nrewards, she often has additional knowledge of agents' abilities, and can\nleverage this information asymmetry to provide signals that influence team\nformation. Our work uncovers the critical role of self-awareness (i.e.,\nknowledge of one's own abilities) for the design of such mechanisms. For\nsettings with two-member teams and binary-valued agents partitioned into a\nconstant number of prior classes, we provide signaling mechanisms which are\nasymptotically optimal when agents are agnostic of their own abilities. On the\nother hand, when agents are self-aware, then we show that there is no signaling\nmechanism that can do better than not releasing information, while satisfying\nagent participation constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2018 00:24:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2019 19:06:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 23:24:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hssaine", "Chamsi", ""], ["Banerjee", "Siddhartha", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00989", "submitter": "Ye Hu", "authors": "Ye Hu, Anibal Sanjab, and Walid Saad", "title": "Dynamic Psychological Game Theory for Secure Internet of Battlefield\n  Things (IoBT) Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a novel anti-jamming mechanism is proposed to analyze and\nenhance the security of adversarial Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT)\nsystems.

In many cloud settings, providers would\nlike to operate resources at high utilization while simultaneously respecting\nindividual SLAs. There is typically a tradeoff between these two objectives;\nfor example, utilization can be increased by shifting away resources from idle\nusers to \"scavenger\" workload, but with the risk of the former then becoming\nactive again. We study this fundamental tradeoff by formulating a resource\nallocation model that captures basic properties of cloud computing systems,\nincluding SLAs, highly limited feedback about the state of the system, and\nvariable and unpredictable input sequences. Our main result is a simple and\npractical algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance on the above two\nobjectives. First, we guarantee nearly optimal utilization of the resource even\nif compared to the omniscient offline dynamic optimum. Second, we\nsimultaneously satisfy all individual SLAs up to a small error. The main\nalgorithmic tool is a multiplicative weight update algorithm, and a primal-dual\nargument to obtain its guarantees. We also provide numerical validation on real\ndata to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practical applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2018 21:47:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:33:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2021 04:45:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Perez-Salazar", "Sebastian", ""], ["Menache", "Ishai", ""], ["Singh", "Mohit", ""], ["Toriello", "Alejandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.02718", "submitter": "Kostas Kollias", "authors": "Sreenivas Gollapudi, Kostas Kollias, Ali Shameli", "title": "Cost Sharing in Two-Sided Markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the emergence of popular service-based two-sided markets where\nsellers can serve multiple buyers at the same time, we formulate and study the\n{\\em two-sided cost sharing} problem.

We extend here the existing\nframework of correlated games and find that there are other interesting and\npreviously unknown Nash equilibria that make use of correlations to obtain the\nbest payoff. This is achieved by allowing the players the freedom to follow or\nnot to follow the suggestions of the correlation device. By assigning\nindependent probabilities to follow every possible suggestion, the players\nengage in a response game that turns out to have a rich structure of Nash\nequilibria that goes beyond the correlated equilibrium and mixed-strategy\nsolutions. We determine the Nash equilibria for all possible correlated\nSnowdrift games, which we find to be describable by Ising Models in thermal\nequilibrium. We believe that our approach paves the way to a study of\ncorrelations in games that uncovers the existence of interesting underlying\ninteraction mechanisms, without compromising the independence of the players.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2018 12:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Correia", "A.

We theoretically and\nnumerically show that the information stabilizes the Cournot-Nash equilibrium\nand suppresses chaotic behavior in the duopoly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 05:57:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2019 05:10:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ueda", "Masahiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.11034", "submitter": "Wayes Tushar", "authors": "Wayes Tushar, Tapan Kumar Saha, Chau Yuen, Paul Liddell, Richard Bean\n  and H.

In particular, a canonical coalition game\n(CCG) is utilized to propose a P2P energy trading scheme, in which a set of\nparticipating prosumers form a coalition group to trade their energy, if there\nis any, with one another. By exploring the concept of the core of the designed\nCCG framework, the mid-market rate is utilized as a pricing mechanism of the\nproposed P2P trading to confirm the stability of the coalition as well as to\nguarantee the benefit to the prosumers for forming the social coalition. The\npaper further introduces the motivational psychology models that are relevant\nto the proposed P2P scheme and it is shown that the outcomes of proposed P2P\nenergy trading scheme satisfy the discussed models. Consequently, it is proven\nthat the proposed scheme is consumer-centric that has the potential to\ncorroborate sustainable prosumers participation in P2P energy trading. Finally,\nsome numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the beneficial properties\nof the proposed scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 14:02:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tushar", "Wayes", ""], ["Saha", "Tapan Kumar", ""], ["Yuen", "Chau", ""], ["Liddell", "Paul", ""], ["Bean", "Richard", ""], ["Poor", "H.
