We show that they are always stable and that their\neventual subpopulation percentages are actually a Markov Chain stationary\ndistribution. (b) protocols that have dynamics resembling virus spread.

The games are concurrent in that at each turn,\nboth players independently propose a time delay and an action, and the action\nwith the shorter delay is chosen. To prevent a player from winning by blocking\ntime, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot\nbe responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction\nof these games to turn-based (i.e., nonconcurrent) finite-state (i.e., untimed)\nparity games. The states of the resulting game are pairs of clock regions of\nthe original game. Our reduction improves the best known complexity for solving\ntimed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical parity\ngames can now be applied to timed parity games.\n  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that\nrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,\nlimit-robust and bounded-robust strategies. Using a limit-robust strategy, the\ncontroller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow for\nsome nonzero jitter in each of its actions. If there is a given lower bound on\nthe jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust. We show that exact strategies\nare more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than\nbounded-robust strategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies,\nwe present efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These\nreductions provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time\ncontrollers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 06:37:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Henzinger", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Prabhu", "Vinayak", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1297", "submitter": "Martin Pal", "authors": "Gagan Aggarwal and S.

Several auction\nmechanisms have been proposed, with variants of the Generalized Second Price\n(GSP) being widely used in practice.\n  A rich body of work on bipartite matching markets builds upon the stable\nmarriage model of Gale and Shapley and the assignment model of Shapley and\nShubik. We apply insights from this line of research into the structure of\nstable outcomes and their incentive properties to advertising auctions.\n  We model advertising auctions in terms of an assignment model with linear\nutilities, extended with bidder and item specific maximum and minimum prices.\nAuction mechanisms like the commonly used GSP or the well-known\nVickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) are interpreted as simply computing a\n\\emph{bidder-optimal stable matching} in this model, for a suitably defined set\nof bidder preferences. In our model, the existence of a stable matching is\nguaranteed, and under a non-degeneracy assumption a bidder-optimal stable\nmatching exists as well. We give an algorithm to find such matching in\npolynomial time, and use it to design truthful mechanism that generalizes GSP,\nis truthful for profit-maximizing bidders, implements features like\nbidder-specific minimum prices and position-specific bids, and works for rich\nmixtures of bidders and preferences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 17:16:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Gagan", ""], ["Muthukrishnan", "S.", ""], ["Pal", "David", ""], ["Pal", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1494", "submitter": "Matteo Gagliolo", "authors": "Matteo Gagliolo and Juergen Schmidhuber", "title": "Algorithm Selection as a Bandit Problem with Unbounded Losses", "comments": "15 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-13800-3_7", "report-no": "IDSIA-07-08", "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Algorithm selection is typically based on models of algorithm performance,\nlearned during a separate offline training sequence, which can be prohibitively\nexpensive.

Altruistic behavior is modeled by a trade-off between selfish\nand social objectives. In particular, we assume agents optimize a linear\ncombination of personal delay of a strategy and the resulting increase in\nsocial cost. Our model can be embedded in the framework of congestion games\nwith player-specific latency functions. Stable states are the Nash equilibria\nof these games, and we examine their existence and the convergence of\nsequential best-response dynamics. Previous work shows that for symmetric\nsingleton games with convex delays Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist. For\nconcave delay functions we observe that there are games without Nash equilibria\nand provide a polynomial time algorithm to decide existence for symmetric\nsingleton games with arbitrary delay functions. Our algorithm can be extended\nto compute best and worst Nash equilibria if they exist. For more general\ncongestion games existence becomes NP-hard to decide, even for symmetric\nnetwork games with quadratic delay functions. Perhaps surprisingly, if all\ndelay functions are linear, then there is always a Nash equilibrium in any\ncongestion game with altruists and any better-response dynamics converges. In\naddition to these results for uncoordinated dynamics, we consider a scenario in\nwhich a central altruistic institution can motivate agents to act\naltruistically. We provide constructive and hardness results for finding the\nminimum number of altruists to stabilize an optimal congestion profile and more\ngeneral mechanisms to incentivize agents to adopt favorable behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jul 2008 05:58:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2009 16:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hoefer", "Martin", ""], ["Skopalik", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2496", "submitter": "Ashish Goel", "authors": "Ashish Goel and Kamesh Munagala", "title": "Hybrid Keyword Search Auctions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Search auctions have become a dominant source of revenue generation on the\nInternet. Such auctions have typically used per-click bidding and pricing. We\npropose the use of hybrid auctions where an advertiser can make a\nper-impression as well as a per-click bid, and the auctioneer then chooses one\nof the two as the pricing mechanism. We assume that the advertiser and the\nauctioneer both have separate beliefs (called priors) on the click-probability\nof an advertisement. We first prove that the hybrid auction is truthful,\nassuming that the advertisers are risk-neutral. We then show that this auction\nis superior to the existing per-click auction in multiple ways: 1) It takes\ninto account the risk characteristics of the advertisers. 2) For obscure\nkeywords, the auctioneer is unlikely to have a very sharp prior on the\nclick-probabilities. In such situations, the hybrid auction can result in\nsignificantly higher revenue. 3) An advertiser who believes that its\nclick-probability is much higher than the auctioneer's estimate can use\nper-impression bids to correct the auctioneer's prior without incurring any\nextra cost. 4) The hybrid auction can allow the advertiser and auctioneer to\nimplement complex dynamic programming strategies. As Internet commerce matures,\nwe need more sophisticated pricing models to exploit all the information held\nby each of the participants.
