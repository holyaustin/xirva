This is however not the case with general-sum\nstochastic games. A fairly general optimization problem formulation is\navailable for general-sum stochastic games by Filar and Vrieze [2004]. However,\nthe optimization problem there has a non-linear objective and non-linear\nconstraints with special structure. Since gradients of both the objective as\nwell as constraints of this optimization problem are well defined, gradient\nbased schemes seem to be a natural choice. We discuss a gradient scheme tuned\nfor two-player stochastic games. We show in simulations that this scheme indeed\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium, for a simple terrain exploration problem\nmodelled as a general-sum stochastic game. However, it turns out that only\nglobal minima of the optimization problem correspond to Nash equilibria of the\nunderlying general-sum stochastic game, while gradient schemes only guarantee\nconvergence to local minima. We then provide important necessary conditions for\ngradient schemes to converge to Nash equilibria in general-sum stochastic\ngames.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 02:37:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Prasad", "H.

This index is a second order population\nstatistic that captures how frequently two agents performing the same\nevaluation agree on the particular answer. Rare agreements thus earn a higher\nreward than agreements that are relatively more common.\n  In the regime where there are a large number of evaluation tasks, we show\nthat truthful behavior is a strict Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the game induced\nby the mechanism. Further, we show that the truthful equilibrium is\napproximately optimal in terms of expected payoffs to the agents across all\nsymmetric equilibria, where the approximation error vanishes in the number of\nevaluation tasks. Moreover, under a mild condition on strategy space, we show\nthat any symmetric equilibrium that gives a higher expected payoff than the\ntruthful equilibrium must be close to being fully informative if the number of\nevaluations is large. These last two results are driven by a new notion of an\nagreement measure that is shown to be monotonic in information loss.

We make use of these techniques to prove lower\nbounds on the approximability of several non-utilitarian multi-parameter\nproblems.\n  In particular, we demonstrate the strength of our techniques by exhibiting a\nlower bound of $2-\\frac{1}{m}$ for the scheduling problem with unrelated\nmachines (formulated as a mechanism design problem in the seminal paper of\nNisan and Ronen on Algorithmic Mechanism Design). Our lower bound applies to\ntruthful randomized mechanisms (disregarding any computational assumptions on\nthe running time of these mechanisms). Moreover, it holds even for the weaker\nnotion of truthfulness for randomized mechanisms -- i.e., truthfulness in\nexpectation. This lower bound nearly matches the known $\\frac{7}{4}$\n(randomized) truthful upper bound for the case of two machines (a non-truthful\nFPTAS exists). No lower bound for truthful randomized mechanisms in\nmulti-parameter settings was previously known.\n  We show an application of our techniques to the workload-minimization problem\nin networks. We prove our lower bounds for this problem in the inter-domain\nrouting setting presented by Feigenbaum, Papadimitriou, Sami, and Shenker.\n  Finally, we discuss several notions of non-utilitarian \"fairness\" (Max-Min\nfairness, Min-Max fairness, and envy minimization). We show how our techniques\ncan be used to prove lower bounds for these notions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 23:51:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2015 17:33:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 20:02:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mu'alem", "Ahuva", ""], ["Schapira", "Michael", ""]]}]
