A recently proposed method, Deep CFR, applies deep\nlearning directly to CFR, allowing the agent to intrinsically abstract and\ngeneralize over the state-space from samples, without requiring expert\nknowledge.

As a motivating example, we consider the problem of wireless network\nselection. Mobile devices are often required to choose the right network to\nassociate with for optimal performance, which is non-trivial. The excellent\ntheoretical properties of EXP3, a leading multi-armed bandit algorithm, suggest\nthat it should work well for this type of problem. Yet, it performs poorly in\npractice. A major limitation is its slow rate of stabilization. Bandit-style\nalgorithms perform better when global knowledge is available, i.e., when\ndevices receive feedback about all networks after each selection. But,\nunfortunately, communicating full information to all devices is expensive.\nTherefore, we address the question of how much information is adequate to\nachieve better performance. We propose Co-Bandit, a novel cooperative bandit\napproach, that allows devices to occasionally share their observations and\nforward feedback received from neighbors; hence, feedback may be received with\na delay. Devices perform network selection based on their own observation and\nfeedback from neighbors. As such, they speed up each other's rate of learning.\nWe prove that Co-Bandit is regret-minimizing and retains the convergence\nproperty of multiplicative weight update algorithms with full information.\nThrough simulation, we show that a very small amount of information, even with\na delay, is adequate to nudge each other to select the right network and yield\nsignificantly faster stabilization at the optimal state (about 630x faster than\nEXP3).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2019 08:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Appavoo", "Anuja Meetoo", ""], ["Gilbert", "Seth", ""], ["Tan", "Kian-Lee", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.08106", "submitter": "David Balduzzi", "authors": "David Balduzzi, Marta Garnelo, Yoram Bachrach, Wojciech M.

A committee formed\non attribute preferences is more likely to be a better representative of the\nqualities desired by the voters and is less likely to be susceptible to\ncollusion or manipulation. In this work, we provide a formal study of the\ndifferent aspects of this problem and define properties of weak unanimity,\nstrong unanimity, simple justified representations and compound justified\nrepresentation, that are required to be satisfied by the selected committee. We\nshow that none of the existing vote/approval aggregation rules satisfy these\nnew properties for attribute aggregation. We describe a greedy approach for\nattribute aggregation that satisfies the first three properties, but not the\nfourth, i.e., compound justified representation, which we prove to be\nNP-complete. Furthermore, we prove that finding a committee with justified\nrepresentation and the highest approval voting score is NP-complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2019 01:42:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2020 05:40:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kagita", "Venkateswara Rao", ""], ["Pujari", "Arun K", ""], ["Padmanabhan", "Vineet", ""], ["Kumar", "Vikas", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10450", "submitter": "Anay Mehrotra", "authors": "L.

However, recent studies show that advertisements can be\ndiscriminatory with respect to the gender or race of the audience that sees the\nad, and may inadvertently cross ethical and/or legal boundaries. To prevent\nthis, we propose a constrained ad auction framework that maximizes the\nplatform's revenue conditioned on ensuring that the audience seeing an\nadvertiser's ad is distributed appropriately across sensitive types such as\ngender or race. Building upon Myerson's classic work, we first present an\noptimal auction mechanism for a large class of fairness constraints. Finding\nthe parameters of this optimal auction, however, turns out to be a non-convex\nproblem. We show that this non-convex problem can be reformulated as a more\nstructured non-convex problem with no saddle points or local-maxima; this\nallows us to develop a gradient-descent-based algorithm to solve it. Our\nempirical results on the A1 Yahoo! dataset demonstrate that our algorithm can\nobtain uniform coverage across different user types for each advertiser at a\nminor loss to the revenue of the platform, and a small change to the size of\nthe audience each advertiser reaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2019 18:55:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 02:53:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Celis", "L.

Boxes are presented\nonline, each with a random value and cost drew jointly from some known\ndistribution. Pandora chooses online whether to open each box given its cost,\nand then chooses irrevocably whether to keep the revealed prize or pass on it.\nWe aim for approximation algorithms against adversaries that can choose the\nlargest prize over any opened box, and use optimal offline policies to decide\nwhich boxes to open (without knowledge of the value inside). We consider\nvariations where Pandora can collect multiple prizes subject to feasibility\nconstraints, such as cardinality, matroid, or knapsack constraints.

Most of the election\nrules studied in the literature require the voters to rank the candidates from\nthe most to the least preferred one. This method of eliciting preferences is\nimpractical when the number of candidates to be ranked is large. We ask how\nwell certain election rules (focusing on positional scoring rules and the\nMinimax rule) can be approximated from partial preferences collected through\none of the following procedures: (i) randomized-we ask each voter to rank a\nrandom subset of $\\ell$ candidates, and (ii) deterministic-we ask each voter to\nprovide a ranking of her $\\ell$ most preferred candidates (the $\\ell$-truncated\nballot). We establish theoretical bounds on the approximation ratios and we\ncomplement our theoretical analysis with computer simulations. We find that\nmostly (apart from the cases when the preferences have no or very little\nstructure) it is better to use the randomized approach.
