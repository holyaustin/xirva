We model the interaction among\nmultiple self-interested nodes as a game. It is well-known that the Nash\nequilibria in this game result in zero throughput for all the nodes if they\ntake myopic best-response, thereby leading to a network collapse. This paper\nenables nodes to behave as intelligent entities which can proactively gather\ninformation, form internal conjectures on how their competitors would react to\ntheir actions, and update their beliefs according to their local observations.\nIn this way, nodes are capable to autonomously \"learn\" the behavior of their\ncompetitors, optimize their own actions, and eventually cultivate reciprocity\nin the random access network. To characterize the steady-state outcome, the\nconjectural equilibrium is introduced. Inspired by the biological phenomena of\n\"derivative action\" and \"gradient dynamics\", two distributed conjecture-based\naction update mechanisms are proposed to stabilize the random access network.\nThe sufficient conditions that guarantee the proposed conjecture-based learning\nalgorithms to converge are derived. Moreover, it is shown that all the\nachievable operating points in the throughput region are essentially stable\nconjectural equilibria corresponding to different conjectures. We investigate\nhow the conjectural equilibrium can be selected in heterogeneous networks and\nhow the proposed methods can be extended to ad-hoc networks. Simulations verify\nthat the system performance significantly outperforms existing protocols, such\nas IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol and the PMAC protocol, in terms of throughput,\nfairness, convergence, and stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:42:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Dec 2009 23:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Yi", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0126", "submitter": "Beihang He", "authors": "Beihang He", "title": "Villager's dilemma", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With deeper study of the Game Theory, some conditions of Prisoner's Dilemma\nis no longer suitable of games in real life.
