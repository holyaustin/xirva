In the proposed model, each cognitive node may have\nits own individual view on each PU's distribution, and, hence, seeks to find\npartners having a correlated perception. To address this problem, a coalitional\ngame is formulated between the cognitive devices and an algorithm for\ncooperative coalition formation is proposed. It is shown that the proposed\ncoalition formation algorithm allows the cognitive nodes that are experiencing\na similar behavior from some PUs to self-organize into disjoint, independent\ncoalitions. Inside each coalition, the cooperative cognitive nodes use a\ncombination of Bayesian nonparametric models such as the Dirichlet process and\nstatistical goodness of fit techniques in order to improve the accuracy of the\nestimated PUs' activity distributions. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm significantly improves the estimates of the PUs'\ndistributions and yields a performance advantage, in terms of reduction of the\naverage achieved Kullback-Leibler distance between the real and the estimated\ndistributions, reaching up to 36.5% relative the non-cooperative estimates. The\nresults also show that the proposed algorithm enables the cognitive nodes to\nadapt their cooperative decisions when the actual PUs' distributions change due\nto, for example, PU mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2012 15:25:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Poor", "H.

In the new model we allow the\ngovernment to be bureaucratic, i.e., to have the power of to force each player\nto choose from only a specific set of available facilities. In the\nproportionality mechanism, we force every player that receives a facility at\nhis reported location to connect to exactly that facility. We extend the\nproportionality mechanism to a more general setting with a private network of\nfacilities already present in the metric space and show that it is truthful as\nwell.\n  We further show that for any fixed k, the proportionality rule achieves in\nexpectation a constant approximation guarantee to the optimal solution; namely\nat most a ratio of 4k.

Beyond the\nalgorithmic problem, competition raises issues of strategic behaviour: rational\nagents should not be incentivized to underreport their budget demands.\n  We show that when there are two players, the social welfare can be\n$2$-approximated by a polynomial-time strategyproof mechanism. Our mechanism is\ndefined recursively, randomizing the order in which advertisers are allocated\nseeds according to a particular greedy method. For three or more players, we\ndemonstrate that under additional assumptions (satisfied by many existing\nmodels of influence spread) there exists a simpler strategyproof\n$\\frac{e}{e-1}$-approximation mechanism; notably, this second mechanism is not\nnecessarily strategyproof when there are only two players.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 20:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 14 Oct 2012 22:15:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 8 Dec 2013 02:56:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 16:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Borodin", "Allan", ""], ["Braverman", "Mark", ""], ["Lucier", "Brendan", ""], ["Oren", "Joel", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2209", "submitter": "Krzysztof R.
