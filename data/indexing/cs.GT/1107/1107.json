However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing\nto non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may\nbe selected by the agents. The interested party assumes that agents are\nrational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated\nstrategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game\nif by adding non-negative payments, rational players will necessarily produce\nan outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one\ncan implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of\nimplementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a\ndesired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that\nneed to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major\npoint in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily\nmaterialize when following desired behaviors. We define and study\nk-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete\ninformation. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting\nis later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices.\nTogether, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable\noutcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide\nprotocols), complementing previous work in mechanism design, while making it\nmore applicable to many realistic CS settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:32:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Monderer", "D.", ""], ["Tennenholtz", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.0028", "submitter": "M.

Much of the\ngroundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory, in\nparticular, the concept of Nash equilibria. Learners that directly learn an\nequilibrium obviously rely on their existence. Learners that instead seek to\nplay optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria\nsince equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,\nagents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical\nlimitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction\nand approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article\nexplores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and\nlimitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria\ncontinue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects\nlimitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of\nequilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we\nmake three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence\nof equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that\npreserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations\nthat satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a\nspecific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of\nlimited agents.

In weighted congestion games with linear latency\nfunctions, the existence of (pure Nash) equilibria is guaranteed by potential\nfunction arguments. Unfortunately, this proof of existence is inefficient and\ncomputing equilibria is such games is a {\\sf PLS}-hard problem. The situation\ngets worse when superlinear latency functions come into play; in this case, the\nNash dynamics of the game may contain cycles and equilibria may not even exist.\nGiven these obstacles, we consider approximate equilibria as alternative\nsolution concepts. Do such equilibria exist? And if so, can we compute them\nefficiently?\n  We provide positive answers to both questions for weighted congestion games\nwith polynomial latency functions by exploiting an \"approximation\" of such\ngames by a new class of potential games that we call $\\Psi$-games. This allows\nus to show that these games have $d!$-approximate equilibria, where $d$ is the\nmaximum degree of the latency functions. Our main technical contribution is an\nefficient algorithm for computing O(1)-approximate equilibria when $d$ is a\nconstant. For games with linear latency functions, the approximation guarantee\nis $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}+O(\\gamma)$ for arbitrarily small $\\gamma>0$; for\nlatency functions with maximum degree $d\\geq 2$, it is $d^{2d+o(d)}$.

Bayesian mechanism design has\nusually focused on maximizing expected revenue in a {\\em risk neutral}\nenvironment, and no succinct characterization of expected utility maximizing\nmechanisms is known even for single-parameter multi-unit auctions.\n  We first consider the problem of designing optimal DSIC mechanism for a risk\naverse seller in the case of multi-unit auctions, and we give a poly-time\ncomputable SPM that is $(1-1/e-\\eps)$-approximation to the expected utility of\nthe seller in an optimal DSIC mechanism. Our result is based on a novel\napplication of a correlation gap bound, along with {\\em splitting} and {\\em\nmerging} of random variables to redistribute probability mass across buyers.\nThis allows us to reduce our problem to that of checking feasibility of a small\nnumber of distinct configurations, each of which corresponds to a covering LP.\nA feasible solution to the LP gives us the distribution on prices for each\nbuyer to use in a randomized SPM.\n  We next consider the setting when buyers as well as the seller are risk\naverse, and the objective is to maximize the seller's expected utility. We\ndesign a truthful-in-expectation mechanism whose utility is a $(1-1/e\n-\\eps)^3$-approximation to the optimal BIC mechanism under two mild\nassumptions. Our mechanism consists of multiple rounds that processes each\nbuyer in a round with small probability.
