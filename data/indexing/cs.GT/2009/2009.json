The payoffs of the agents depend\non the social distancing they practice and on the probability of getting\ninfected. We consider two types of agents, the non-vulnerable agents who have a\nsmall cost if they get infected, and the vulnerable agents who have a higher\ncost. For the modeling of the epidemic outbreak, we consider a variant of the\nSIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model involving populations of susceptible,\ninfected, and removed persons of vulnerable and non-vulnerable types. The Nash\nequilibria of this social distancing game are studied. The main contribution of\nthis work is the analysis of the case where the players, desiring to achieve a\nlow social inequality, pose a bound on the variance of the payoffs. In this\ncase, we introduce and characterize a notion of Generalized Nash Equilibrium\n(GNE) for games with a continuum of players. Through numerical studies, we show\nthat inequality constraints result in a slower spread of the epidemic and an\nimproved cost for the vulnerable players. Furthermore, it is possible that\ninequality constraints are beneficial for non-vulnerable players as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:28:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Apr 2021 17:42:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kordonis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Lagos", "Athanasios-Rafail", ""], ["Papavassilopoulos", "George P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00162", "submitter": "Yue Guan", "authors": "Yue Guan, Qifan Zhang, Panagiotis Tsiotras", "title": "Learning Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games via\n  Entropy-Regularized Policy Approximation", "comments": "Accepted at IJCAI-21", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We explore the use of policy approximations to reduce the computational cost\nof learning Nash equilibria in zero-sum stochastic games.

Recent\nbreaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous threat of\noffline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker can quickly check\nmillions (or sometimes billions/trillions) of password guesses by comparing\ntheir hash value with the stolen hash from a breached authentication server.\nThe attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest. Our key\nidea is to have the authentication server store a (noisy) signal about the\nstrength of each user password for an offline attacker to find. Surprisingly,\nwe show that the noise distribution for the signal can often be tuned so that a\nrational (profit-maximizing) attacker will crack fewer passwords. The signaling\nscheme exploits the fact that password cracking is not a zero-sum game i.e.,\nthe attacker's profit is given by the value of the cracked passwords minus the\ntotal guessing cost. Thus, a well-defined signaling strategy will encourage the\nattacker to reduce his guessing costs by cracking fewer passwords. We use an\nevolutionary algorithm to compute the optimal signaling scheme for the\ndefender. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our mechanism on several password\ndatasets and show that it can reduce the total number of cracked passwords by\nup to $12\\%$ (resp. $5\\%$) of all users in defending against offline (resp.\nonline) attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2020 17:51:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2020 02:50:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:43:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Wenjie", ""], ["Blocki", "Jeremiah", ""], ["Harsha", "Ben", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.10061", "submitter": "Gabriele Farina", "authors": "Gabriele Farina and Andrea Celli and Nicola Gatti and Tuomas Sandholm", "title": "Faster Algorithms for Optimal Ex-Ante Coordinated Collusive Strategies\n  in Extensive-Form Zero-Sum Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We focus on the problem of finding an optimal strategy for a team of two\nplayers that faces an opponent in an imperfect-information zero-sum\nextensive-form game.

In our game agents correspond to nodes in a network that activate a\nsingle outgoing edge to connect to the common target node (possibly via other\nnodes). Agents pay for their path to the common target, and edge costs are\nshared fairly among all agents using an edge. The main novelty of our model is\ndynamic edge costs that depend on the in-degree of the respective endpoint.\nThis reflects that connecting to popular nodes that have increased internal\ncoordination costs is more expensive since they can charge higher prices for\ntheir routing service.\n  In contrast to related models, we show that equilibria are not guaranteed to\nexist, but we prove the existence for infinitely many numbers of agents.\nMoreover, we analyze the structure of equilibrium trees and employ these\ninsights to prove a constant upper bound on the Price of Anarchy as well as\nnon-trivial lower bounds on both the Price of Anarchy and the Price of\nStability. We also show that in comparison with the social optimum tree the\noverall cost of an equilibrium tree is more fairly shared among the agents.\nThus, we prove that self-organization of rational agents yields on average only\nslightly higher cost per agent compared to the centralized optimum, and at the\nsame time, it induces a more fair cost distribution.

Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT),\nhere we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for\nenhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff\nstructure, in both pairwise and multiparty interactions. Arguably, coordination\nis more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several\ndesirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual\ncooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas).\nOur analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that\nwhether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing\ncoordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the\ncollective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how\nasymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multiparty\ninteractions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group\ndiversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for\ndifferent selection intensities. Overall, our analysis provides new insights\ninto the complexity and beauty of behavioral evolution driven by humans'\ncapacity for commitment, as well as for the design of self-organised and\ndistributed multi-agent systems for ensuring coordination among autonomous\nagents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2020 14:36:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2020 12:21:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bianca", "Ogbo Ndidi", ""], ["Elgarig", "Aiman", ""], ["Han", "The Anh", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.11841", "submitter": "Kangning Wang", "authors": "Reza Alijani, Siddhartha Banerjee, Kamesh Munagala and Kangning Wang", "title": "The Limits of an Information Intermediary in Auction Design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the limits of an information intermediary in Bayesian auctions.\nFormally, we consider the standard single-item auction, with a\nrevenue-maximizing seller and $n$ buyers with independent private values; in\naddition, we now have an intermediary who knows the buyers' true values, and\ncan map these to a public signal so as to try to increase buyer surplus.
