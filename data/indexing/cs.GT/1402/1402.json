Our analysis takes\ninto account the gaming possibilities of producers and retailers, controlling\nload flexibility, in the day-ahead energy and reserve markets, and in imbalance\nsettlement. This analysis is carried out by an agent-based approach where, for\nevery round, each actor uses linear programs to maximize its profit according\nto forecasts of the prices. The procurement of a reserve is assumed to be\ndetermined, for each period, as a fixed percentage of the total consumption\ncleared in the energy market for the same period. The results show that the\nprovision of reserves by flexible loads has a negligible impact on the energy\nmarket prices but markedly decreases the cost of reserve procurement. However,\nas the rate of flexible loads increases, the system operator has to rely more\nand more on non-contracted reserves, which may cancel out the benefits made in\nthe procurement of reserves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 12:34:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 09:51:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mathieu", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Louveaux", "Quentin", ""], ["Ernst", "Damien", ""], ["Corn\u00e9lusse", "Bertrand", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.0410", "submitter": "Sergey Kuniavsky", "authors": "Sergey Kuniavsky", "title": "Minimum Price in Search Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the effects of a low bound price.

Next, we argue that in large games ($n$ player games in\nwhich unilateral deviations by single players have only a small impact on the\nutility of other players), many monitoring settings naturally lead to signals\nthat satisfy $(\\epsilon,\\gamma)$-differential privacy, for $\\epsilon$ and\n$\\gamma$ tending to zero as the number of players $n$ grows large. We conclude\nthat in such settings, the set of equilibria of the repeated game collapse to\nthe set of equilibria of the stage game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 12:30:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 19:05:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pai", "Mallesh M.", ""], ["Roth", "Aaron", ""], ["Ullman", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2970", "submitter": "Piotr Skowron", "authors": "Piotr Skowron and Krzysztof Rzadca and Anwitaman Datta", "title": "Cooperation and Competition when Bidding for Complex Projects:\n  Centralized and Decentralized Perspectives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To successfully complete a complex project, be it a construction of an\nairport or of a backbone IT system, agents (companies or individuals) must form\na team having required competences and resources.

However, service systems are generally staffed by\npeople. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives; that is, how hard a\nperson works can depend both on how much work there is, and how the work is\ndivided between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing\nand staffing policies control such workload incentives; and so the rate servers\nwork will be impacted by the system's routing and staffing policies. This\nobservation has consequences when modeling service system performance, and our\nobjective is to investigate those consequences.\n  We do this in the context of the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model\nfor large service systems. First, we present a model for \"strategic\" servers\nthat choose their service rate in order to maximize a trade-off between an\n\"effort cost\", which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when\nworking at a faster rate, and a \"value of idleness\", which assumes that servers\nvalue having idle time. Next, we characterize the symmetric Nash equilibrium\nservice rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server idle\ntime. We find that the system must operate in a quality-driven regime, in which\nservers have idle time, in order for an equilibrium to exist, which implies\nthat the staffing must have a first-order term that strictly exceeds that of\nthe common square-root staffing policy. Then, within the class of policies that\nadmit an equilibrium, we (asymptotically) solve the problem of minimizing the\ntotal cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting costs.\nFinally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies that are\nbased on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2014 21:21:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 04:31:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:54:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Ragavendran", ""], ["Doroudi", "Sherwin", ""], ["Ward", "Amy R.", ""], ["Wierman", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.3610", "submitter": "Ragavendran Gopalakrishnan", "authors": "Ragavendran Gopalakrishnan and Jason R.

Lurking beneath this literature\nis a fundamental, yet largely unexplored, algorithmic question: how should a\n\"market maker\" who is privy to additional information, and equipped with a\nspecified objective, inform the players in the game? This is an informational\nanalogue of the mechanism design question, and views the information structure\nof a game as a mathematical object to be designed, rather than an exogenous\nvariable.\n  We initiate a complexity-theoretic examination of the design of optimal\ninformation structures in general Bayesian games, a task often referred to as\nsignaling. We focus on one of the simplest instantiations of the signaling\nquestion: Bayesian zero-sum games, and a principal who must choose an\ninformation structure maximizing the equilibrium payoff of one of the players.\nIn this setting, we show that optimal signaling is computationally intractable,\nand in some cases hard to approximate, assuming that it is hard to recover a\nplanted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. This is despite the fact that\nequilibria in these games are computable in polynomial time, and therefore\nsuggests that the hardness of optimal signaling is a distinct phenomenon from\nthe hardness of equilibrium computation. Necessitated by the non-local nature\nof information structures, en-route to our results we prove an \"amplification\nlemma\" for the planted clique problem which may be of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 00:43:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2014 05:41:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 18:27:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 11:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Dughmi", "Shaddin", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.4343", "submitter": "Gabriel Istrate", "authors": "Cosmin Bonchi\\c{s} and Gabriel Istrate", "title": "Minimum Entropy Submodular Optimization (and Fairness in Cooperative\n  Games)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study minimum entropy submodular optimization, a common generalization of\nthe minimum entropy set cover problem, studied earlier by Cardinal et al., and\nthe submodular set cover problem.\n  We give a general bound of the approximation performance of the greedy\nalgorithm using an approach that can be interpreted in terms of a particular\ntype of biased network flows.
