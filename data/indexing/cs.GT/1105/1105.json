Coalitions enable\nagents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their\nown. Previous work has shown problems in coalitional games to be\ncomputationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006)\nstudied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision\nproblems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is\nendowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals\nif they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The\ninput of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g.,\nthe agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and\nKraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using\nthe theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not\nall parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed\ntractable while others still remain intractable.\n  We answer an important question left open by Shrot, Aumann and Kraus by\nshowing that the SC Problem (checking whether a Coalition is Successful) is\nW[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the coalition. Then via a single\ntheme of reduction from SC, we are able to show that various problems related\nto resources, resource bounds and resource conflicts introduced by Wooldridge\net al are 1. W[1]-hard or co-W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of the\ncoalition. 2. para-NP-hard or co-para-NP-hard when parameterized by |R|. 3.

It is the smallest fraction of the social welfare that needs\nto be offered to each player to achieve that a social optimum is realized in a\npure Nash equilibrium. The selfishness level is unrelated to the price of\nstability and the price of anarchy and is invariant under positive linear\ntransformations of the payoff functions. Also, it naturally applies to other\nsolution concepts and other forms of games.\n  We study the selfishness level of several well-known strategic games. This\nallows us to quantify the implicit tension within a game between players'\nindividual interests and the impact of their decisions on the society as a\nwhole. Our analyses reveal that the selfishness level often provides a deeper\nunderstanding of the characteristics of the underlying game that influence the\nplayers' willingness to cooperate.\n  In particular, the selfishness level of finite ordinal potential games is\nfinite, while that of weakly acyclic games can be infinite. We derive explicit\nbounds on the selfishness level of fair cost sharing games and linear\ncongestion games, which depend on specific parameters of the underlying game\nbut are independent of the number of players. Further, we show that the\nselfishness level of the $n$-players Prisoner's Dilemma is $c/(b(n-1)-c)$,\nwhere $b$ and $c$ are the benefit and cost for cooperation, respectively, that\nof the $n$-players public goods game is $(1-\\frac{c}{n})/(c-1)$, where $c$ is\nthe public good multiplier, and that of the Traveler's Dilemma game is\n$\\frac{1}{2}(b-1)$, where $b$ is the bonus. Finally, the selfishness level of\nCournot competition (an example of an infinite ordinal potential game, Tragedy\nof the Commons, and Bertrand competition is infinite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 11:38:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 13:41:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2012 09:51:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2012 13:17:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 14:34:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 12:51:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2014 14:28:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Apt", "Krzysztof R.", ""], ["Schaefer", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2470", "submitter": "Bertrand Georgeot", "authors": "Bertrand Georgeot and Olivier Giraud", "title": "The game of go as a complex network", "comments": "6 pages, 9 figures, final version", "journal-ref": "Europhysics Letters 97, 68002 (2012)", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/97/68002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cond-mat.stat-mech cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the game of go from a complex network perspective.
