This point may lead to poor spectrum utilization from a global network\npoint of view and even for each user individually.\n  In this paper, we provide a closed form expression for a non pure-FS\nepsilon-Nash equilibrium point; i.e., an equilibrium point where players choose\nFDM for some channel realizations and FS for the others. We show that operating\nin this non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point increases each user's\nthroughput and therefore improves the spectrum utilization, and demonstrate\nthat this performance gain can be substantial. Finally, important insights are\nprovided into the behaviour of selfish and rational wireless users as a\nfunction of the channel parameters such as fading probabilities, the\ninterference-to-signal ratio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Feb 2010 19:03:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Noam", "Yair", ""], ["Leshem", "Amir", ""], ["Messer", "Hagit", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4298", "submitter": "Haoyang Wu", "authors": "Haoyang Wu", "title": "Signaling games with pattern recognition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The classical model of signaling games assumes that the receiver exactly know\nthe type space (private information) of the sender and be able to discriminate\neach type of the sender distinctly.

Inspired\nby this line of work, we introduce a notion of equilibrium whereby strategies\nare also maximally simplified, but with respect to a simplification procedure\nthat is more careful in that a player will not simplify if the simplification\nincents other players to deviate. We study such equilibria in two-player\nmachine games in which players choose finite automata that succinctly represent\nstrategies for repeated games; in this context, we present techniques for\nestablishing that an outcome is at equilibrium and present results on the\nstructure of equilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2010 16:29:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2011 09:14:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Jun 2011 23:18:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Hubie", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4832", "submitter": "Jugal Garg", "authors": "Bharat Adsul, Ch.

However due\nto strategic play by buyers, it is not clear whether these are actually\nobserved in the market. Motivated by the observation that a buyer may derive a\nbetter payoff by feigning a different utility function and thereby manipulating\nthe Fisher market equilibrium, we formulate the {\\em Fisher market game} in\nwhich buyers strategize by posing different utility functions. We show that\nexistence of a {\\em conflict-free allocation} is a necessary condition for the\nNash equilibria (NE) and also sufficient for the symmetric NE in this game.\nThere are many NE with very different payoffs, and the Fisher equilibrium\npayoff is captured at a symmetric NE. We provide a complete polyhedral\ncharacterization of all the NE for the two-buyer market game. Surprisingly, all\nthe NE of this game turn out to be symmetric and the corresponding payoffs\nconstitute a piecewise linear concave curve. We also study the correlated\nequilibria of this game and show that third-party mediation does not help to\nachieve a better payoff than NE payoffs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2010 17:16:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2010 16:12:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 05:13:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Adsul", "Bharat", ""], ["Babu", "Ch.
