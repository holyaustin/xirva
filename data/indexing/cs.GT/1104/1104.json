In all these markets, externalities such as complementarities and peer\neffects severely complicate the preference ordering of each agent. Further,\nresearch has shown that externalities lead to serious problems for market\nstability and for developing efficient algorithms to find stable matchings. In\nthis paper we make the observation that peer effects are often the result of\nunderlying social connections, and we explore a formulation of the many-to-one\nmatching market where peer effects are derived from an underlying social\nnetwork. The key feature of our model is that it captures peer effects and\ncomplementarities using utility functions, rather than traditional preference\nordering. With this model and considering a weaker notion of stability, namely\ntwo-sided exchange stability, we prove that stable matchings always exist and\ncharacterize the set of stable matchings in terms of social welfare. We also\ngive distributed algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to a two-sided\nexchange stable matching. To assess the competitive ratio of these algorithms\nand to more generally characterize the efficiency of matching markets with\nexternalities, we provide general bounds on how far the welfare of the\nworst-case stable matching can be from the welfare of the optimal matching, and\nfind that the structure of the social network (e.g. how well clustered the\nnetwork is) plays a large role.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 00:24:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 01:21:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Jul 2011 07:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bodine-Baron", "Elizabeth", ""], ["Lee", "Christina", ""], ["Chong", "Anthony", ""], ["Hassibi", "Babak", ""], ["Wierman", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0151", "submitter": "Dongmei Shi", "authors": "Dong-Mei Shi, Yong Zhuang, and Bing-Hong Wang", "title": "Effect of depreciation of the public goods in spatial public goods games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2011/10/P10007", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, depreciated effect of the public goods is considered in the\npublic goods games, which is realized by rescaling the multiplication factor r\nof each group as r' = r(nc/G)^beta (beat>= 0).

A key objective for the analysis and\nverification of these games is the termination objective, where the players aim\nto maximize (minimize, respectively) the probability of hitting counter value\n0, starting at a given control state and given counter value. Recently, we\nstudied qualitative decision problems (\"is the optimal termination value = 1?\")\nfor OC-MDPs (and OC-SSGs) and showed them to be decidable in P-time (in NP and\ncoNP, respectively). However, quantitative decision and approximation problems\n(\"is the optimal termination value ? p\", or \"approximate the termination value\nwithin epsilon\") are far more challenging. This is so in part because optimal\nstrategies may not exist, and because even when they do exist they can have a\nhighly non-trivial structure. It thus remained open even whether any of these\nquantitative termination problems are computable. In this paper we show that\nall quantitative approximation problems for the termination value for OC-MDPs\nand OC-SSGs are computable. Specifically, given a OC-SSG, and given epsilon >\n0, we can compute a value v that approximates the value of the OC-SSG\ntermination game within additive error epsilon, and furthermore we can compute\nepsilon-optimal strategies for both players in the game. A key ingredient in\nour proofs is a subtle martingale, derived from solving certain LPs that we can\nassociate with a maximizing OC-MDP. An application of Azuma's inequality on\nthese martingales yields a computable bound for the \"wealth\" at which a \"rich\nperson's strategy\" becomes epsilon-optimal for OC-MDPs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 17:42:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 14:43:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e1zdil", "Tom\u00e1\u0161", ""], ["Bro\u017eek", "V\u00e1clav", ""], ["Etessami", "Kousha", ""], ["Ku\u010dera", "Anton\u00edn", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5070", "submitter": "Alexander Rakhlin", "authors": "Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari", "title": "Online Learning: Stochastic and Constrained Adversaries", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Learning theory has largely focused on two main learning scenarios. The first\nis the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a\nfixed distribution and the second scenario is the online learning, completely\nadversarial scenario where adversary at every time step picks the worst\ninstance to provide the learner with. It can be argued that in the real world\nneither of these assumptions are reasonable. It is therefore important to study\nproblems with a range of assumptions on data. Unfortunately, theoretical\nresults in this area are scarce, possibly due to absence of general tools for\nanalysis. Focusing on the regret formulation, we define the minimax value of a\ngame where the adversary is restricted in his moves. The framework captures\nstochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential\nsymmetrization approach, we define a notion of distribution-dependent\nRademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to\nworst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We then\nconsider the i.i.d. adversary and show equivalence of online and batch\nlearnability. In the supervised setting, we consider various hybrid assumptions\non the way that x and y variables are chosen. Finally, we consider smoothed\nlearning problems and show that half-spaces are online learnable in the\nsmoothed model. In fact, exponentially small noise added to adversary's\ndecisions turns this problem with infinite Littlestone's dimension into a\nlearnable problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 04:11:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Rakhlin", "Alexander", ""], ["Sridharan", "Karthik", ""], ["Tewari", "Ambuj", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5275", "submitter": "Clement  Ampadu B", "authors": "Clement Ampadu", "title": "A Quantum Analogue of Parrondo's Game", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the discrete-time quantum walk in the plane, and present a\nquantum implementation of Parrondo's game for four players.

We focus on the well known class of congestion games and we show\nthat, if each player is allowed to play at least once and at most $\\beta$ times\nany $T$ best responses, states with approximation ratio $O(\\beta)$ times the\nprice of anarchy are reached after $T \\lceil \\log \\log n \\rceil$ best\nresponses, and that such a bound is essentially tight also after exponentially\nmany ones. One important consequence of our result is that the fairness among\nplayers is a necessary and sufficient condition for guaranteeing a fast\nconvergence to efficient states. This answers the important question of the\nmaximum order of $\\beta$ needed to fast obtain efficient states, left open by\n[9,10] and [3], in which fast convergence for constant $\\beta$ and very slow\nconvergence for $\\beta=O(n)$ have been shown, respectively. Finally, we show\nthat the structure of the game implicitly affects its performances.
