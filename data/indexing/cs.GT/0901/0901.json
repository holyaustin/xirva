Cooperative game theory\nallows one to understand aspects of all of these problems from a fresh and\nunifying perspective that treats users as players in a game, sometimes leading\nto new insights. At the heart of these analyses are fundamental dualities that\nhave been long studied in the context of cooperative games; for information\ntheoretic purposes, these are dualities between information inequalities on the\none hand and properties of rate, capacity or other resource allocation regions\non the other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Dec 2008 05:26:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Madiman", "Mokshay", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0355", "submitter": "Angel (Anxo) Sanchez", "authors": "Carlos P.

Nash\nEquilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers the mathematical\nfoundation for social science and economy. However, the original definition is\ndeclarative without including a solution to find them. It has been found later\nthat it is computationally difficult to find a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a\nNash equilibrium may be unstable, sensitive to the smallest variation of payoff\nfunctions. Making the situation worse, a society with selfish individuals can\nhave an enormous number of equilibria, making it extremely hard to find out the\nglobal optimal one. This paper offers a constructive generalization of Nash\nequilibrium to cover the case when the selfishness of individuals are reduced\nto lower levels in a controllable way. It shows that the society has one and\nonly one equilibrium when the selfishness is reduced to a certain level. When\nevery individual follows the iterative, soft-decision optimization process\npresented in this paper, the society converges to the unique equilibrium with\nan exponential rate under any initial conditions. When it is a consensus\nequilibrium at the same time, it must be the global optimum. The study of this\npaper suggests that, to build a good, stable society (including the financial\nmarket) for the benefit everyone in it, the pursuing of maximal payoff by each\nindividual should be controlled at some level either by voluntary good\ncitizenship or some proper regulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jan 2009 07:40:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Xiaofei", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3692", "submitter": "Dorothea Baumeister", "authors": "Dorothea Baumeister, Felix Brandt, Felix Fischer, Jan Hoffmann, Joerg\n  Rothe", "title": "The Complexity of Computing Minimal Unidirectional Covering Sets", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Theory of Computing Systems 53(3), 2012", "doi": "10.1007/s00224-012-9437-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a binary dominance relation on a set of alternatives, a common thread\nin the social sciences is to identify subsets of alternatives that satisfy\ncertain notions of stability.
