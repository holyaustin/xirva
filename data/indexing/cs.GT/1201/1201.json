A desirable goal in practice is to\ndesign incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal auctions\nwhile respecting the budget constraints. Achieving this goal is particularly\nchallenging in the presence of nontrivial combinatorial constraints over the\nset of feasible allocations.\n  Toward this goal and motivated by AdWords auctions, we present an auction for\n{\\em polymatroidal} environments satisfying the above properties. Our auction\nemploys a novel clinching technique with a clean geometric description and only\nneeds an oracle access to the submodular function defining the polymatroid. As\na result, this auction not only simplifies and generalizes all previous\nresults, it applies to several new applications including AdWords Auctions,\nbandwidth markets, and video on demand. In particular, our characterization of\nthe AdWords auction as polymatroidal constraints might be of independent\ninterest. This allows us to design the first mechanism for Ad Auctions taking\ninto account simultaneously budgets, multiple keywords and multiple slots.\n  We show that it is impossible to extend this result to generic polyhedral\nconstraints. This also implies an impossibility result for multi-unit auctions\nwith decreasing marginal utilities in the presence of budget constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 01:05:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Mar 2012 04:17:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2012 02:40:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Goel", "Gagan", ""], ["Mirrokni", "Vahab", ""], ["Leme", "Renato Paes", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0410", "submitter": "Zhigang Cao", "authors": "Zhigang Cao and Xiaoguang Yang", "title": "A note on anti-coordination and social interactions", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10878-012-9486-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This note confirms a conjecture of [Bramoull\\'{e}, Anti-coordination and\nsocial interactions, Games and Economic Behavior, 58, 2007: 30-49].

In this paper, we build\nincentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a social\nstrategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes to\nreward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. Because users in these\nsystems often have only limited capability to observe the global system\ninformation, e.g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in the\nsystem, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and\nbiased. Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to not\nfollow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard\nequilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directly\napplicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. To\ninvestigate how the system designs need to change when the participating users\nhave only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binary\nreputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity through\nrandomization. First, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitable\nBayesian belief function. Next, we formalize the users' optimal decision\nproblems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed social\nstrategy.

This significantly improves the\ntriple exponential upper bound for multi energy games (without parity) that\ncould be derived from results in literature for games on VASS (vector addition\nsystems with states). Second, we present an optimal symbolic and incremental\nalgorithm to compute a finite-memory winning strategy (if one exists) in such\ngames.

Specifically, we start by\nproposing the theoretical notion of Abstract Negotiation Method (ANM) as a map\nfrom the negotiation domain in itself, for any utility profile of the parties.\nANM can face both direct and iterative negotiations, since we show that ANM\nclass is closed under the limit operation. The generality of ANM is proven by\nshowing that it captures a large class of well known in literature negotiation\nmethods. Hence we show that if mutual information is assumed then any Pareto\nefficient ANM is manipulable by one single party or by a collusion of few of\nthem. We concern about the efficiency of the resulting manipulation. Thus we\nfind necessarily and sufficient conditions those make manipulability equivalent\nto actual inefficiency, meaning that the manipulation implies a change of the\nefficient frontier so the Pareto efficient ANM converges to a different, hence\nactually inefficient, frontier. In particular we distinguish between strong and\nweak actual inefficiency. Where, the strong actual inefficiency is a drawback\nwhich is not possible to overcome of the ANMs, like the Pareto invariant one,\nso its negotiation result is invariant for any two profiles of utility sharing\nthe same Pareto frontier, we present. While the weak actual inefficiency is a\ndrawback of any mathematical theorization on rational agents which constrain in\na particular way their space of utility functions. For the weak actual\ninefficiency we state a principle of Result's Inconsistency by showing that to\nfalsify theoretical hypotheses is rational for any agent which is informed\nabout the preference of the other, even if the theoretical assumptions, which\nconstrain the space of agents' utilities, are exact in the reality, i.e. the\npreferences of each single agent are well modeled.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 10:37:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Jun 2012 17:03:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Barzanti", "Luca", ""], ["Mastroleo", "Marcello", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5621", "submitter": "Ian Kash", "authors": "Vineet Abhishek, Ian A.
