Previously, it was shown\nthat a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state information\ncan make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performance\ncompared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterative\nwater-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. This paper\ndiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its\nexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To\ncharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural\nequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the\ninvestigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash\nequilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of\nthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms\nto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.\nNumerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori\nknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the\nrequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that\nimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other\nparticipants in the water-filling game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2008 23:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Yi", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0071", "submitter": "Pierre Lescanne", "authors": "St\\'ephane Le Roux (LIP), Pierre Lescanne (LIP), Ren\\'e Vestergaard", "title": "Conversion/Preference Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the concept of Conversion/Preference Games, or CP games for\nshort.
