Each of these might impose some privacy threats on users'\n\"Personally Identifiable Information\" (PII). Location privacy is a crucial part\nof PII, and as such, privacy-aware users wish to maximize it. This privacy can\nbe, for instance, threatened by a company, which collects users' traces and\nshares them with third parties. To maximize their location privacy, users can\ndecide to get offline so that the company cannot localize their devices. The\nlonger a user stays connected to a network, the more services he might receive,\nbut his location privacy decreases. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off\nbetween location privacy, the level of services that a user experiences, and\nthe profit of the company. To this end, we formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian\ngame between the User (follower) and the Company (leader). We present\ntheoretical results characterizing the equilibria of the game. To the best of\nour knowledge, our work is the first to model the economically rational\ndecision-making of the service provider (i.e., the Company) in conjunction with\nthe rational decision-making of users who wish to protect their location\nprivacy. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we have used real-data\nfrom a testbed, and we have also shown that the game-theoretic strategy of the\nCompany outperforms non-strategic methods. Finally, we have considered\ndifferent User privacy types, and have determined the service level that\nincentivizes the User to stay connected as long as possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2016 12:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Panaousis", "Emmanouil", ""], ["Laszka", "Aron", ""], ["Pohl", "Johannes", ""], ["Noack", "Andreas", ""], ["Alpcan", "Tansu", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00176", "submitter": "Jiawei Li", "authors": "Jiawei Li", "title": "Interdependent Relationships in Game Theory: A Generalized Model", "comments": "8 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A generalized model of games is proposed, in which cooperative games and\nnon-cooperative games are special cases.

In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,\nwhich ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a\nnew generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the\ntransmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero\nand takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet\narrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an\nenergy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit\nby improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has\nmultiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric\nreflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global\nenergy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.\nRepeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games\n(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a\nnew operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on\nindividual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and\nthe maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The\ncross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum\nnumber of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users. In addition, the\nsocial welfare (sum of utilities) in the DRG decreases slightly with the\ncross-layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced\nconsiderably with the Goodman model.

Player 2\n(attacker) simultaneously disrupts one or more links to maximize her value of\nlost flow but also faces cost of disrupting links. Linear programming duality\nin zero-sum games and the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem are applied to obtain\nproperties that are satisfied in any Nash equilibrium. A characterization of\nthe support of the equilibrium strategies is provided using graph-theoretic\narguments. Finally, conditions under which these results extend to\nbudget-constrained environments are also studied.

The numerous behavioral experiments investigating the Prisoner's\nDilemma highlight that players often cooperate, but the level of cooperation\nvaries significantly with the specifics of the experimental predicament.
