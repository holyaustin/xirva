More precisely, the problem of\nassociating users to SBSs must be revised and carefully studied. This problem\nis NP-hard and requires solving an integer optimization problem. In order to\nefficiently solve this problem, we model it using non-cooperative game theory.\nFirst, we design two non-cooperative games to solve the problem and show the\nexistence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in both games. These equilibria are\nshown to be far from the social optimum. Hence, we propose a better game design\nin order to approach this optimum. This new game is proved to have no PNE in\ngeneral. However, simulations show, for Rayleigh fading channels, that a PNE\nalways exists for all instances of the game. In addition, we show that its\nprices of anarchy and stability are close to one. We propose a best response\ndynamics (BRD) algorithm that converges to a PNE when it exists. Because of the\nhigh information exchange of BRD, a completely distributed algorithm, based on\nthe theory of learning, is proposed.

Arguably, the\nmost fundamental problem in this domain is influence maximization, where the\ngoal is to identify a seed set of individuals that can trigger a large cascade\nof influence in the network. While there has been significant progress\nregarding this problem and its variants, one basic shortcoming of the models is\nthat they lack the flexibility in the way the budget is allocated to\nindividuals. Indeed, budget allocation is a critical issue in advertising and\nviral marketing. Taking the other point of view, known models allowing flexible\nbudget allocation do not take into account the influence spread in the network.\nWe introduce a generalized model that captures both budgets and influence\npropagation simultaneously.\n  For the offline setting, we identify a large family of budget-based\npropagation functions that admit tight approximation guarantee. This family\nextends most of the previously studied influence models, including the\nwell-known Triggering model. We establish that any function in this family\nimplies an instance of a monotone submodular function maximization over the\ninteger lattice subject to a knapsack constraint. This problem is known to\nadmit an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation. We also study the price of anarchy of\nthe multi-player game that extends the model and establish tight results.\n  For the online setting, in which an unknown subset of agents arrive in a\nrandom order and the algorithm needs to make an irrevocable budget allocation\nin each step, we develop a 1/(15e)-competitive algorithm.

In dynamic games with asymmetric\ninformation, a widely used concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian\nequilibrium (PBE), which consists of a strategy and belief pair that\nsimultaneously satisfy sequential rationality and belief consistency. In\ngeneral, there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the\ninterdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE.

In such equilibria, a player's strategy\ndepends on its history only through a common public belief and its current\nprivate type. The backward recursive part of this algorithm defines an\nequilibrium generating function. Each period in the backward recursion involves\nsolving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability simplexes for every\npossible belief on types.

We also perform a study on the core of the\ncorresponding cooperative game, where coalitions of any size may be formed. In\nparticular we show that the standard relation between the existence of a stable\nsolution and the non-emptiness of the core, which holds in the other models\nwith payments, is no longer valid for our (most general) model. We also prove\nthat the problem of deciding if an allocation belongs to the core jumps from\nbeing polynomial-time solvable for $b\\leq 2$ to NP-complete for $b\\equiv 3$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 09:25:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 16:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bir\u00f3", "P\u00e9ter", ""], ["Kern", "Walter", ""], ["Paulusma", "Dani\u00ebl", ""], ["Wojuteczky", "P\u00e9ter", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06778", "submitter": "L\\'aszl\\'o Csat\\'o", "authors": "L\\'aszl\\'o Csat\\'o", "title": "A graph interpretation of the least squares ranking method", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Social Choice and Welfare, 44(1): 51-69, 2015", "doi": "10.1007/s00355-014-0820-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper aims at analyzing the least squares ranking method for generalized\ntournaments with possible missing and multiple paired comparisons.

Each project k is characterized by a valuation\nfunction; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project\nk. We study the following classic problem in this setting: \"how should the\nagents divide the value that they collectively create?\". One traditional\napproach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the\nimplicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents\ncan partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we\nconsider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes\ncomputing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.\n  The main contribution of this paper is a black-box mechanism that reduces the\nproblem of computing a near-optimal core stable solution to the purely\nalgorithmic problem of welfare maximization; we apply this to compute an\napproximately core stable solution that extracts one-fourth of the optimal\nsocial welfare for the class of subadditive valuations. We also show much\nstronger results for several popular sub-classes: anonymous, fractionally\nsubadditive, and submodular valuations, as well as provide new approximation\nalgorithms for welfare maximization with anonymous functions. Finally, we\nestablish a connection between our setting and the well-studied simultaneous\nauctions with item bidding; we adapt our results to compute approximate pure\nNash equilibria for these auctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 09:53:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Anshelevich", "Elliot", ""], ["Sekar", "Shreyas", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07370", "submitter": "Yixin Tao", "authors": "Richard Cole and Yixin Tao", "title": "Large Market Games with Near Optimal Efficiency", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As is well known, many classes of markets have efficient equilibria, but this\ndepends on agents being non-strategic, i.e. that they declare their true\ndemands when offered goods at particular prices, or in other words, that they\nare price-takers. An important question is how much the equilibria degrade in\nthe face of strategic behavior, i.e. what is the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the\nmarket viewed as a mechanism?\n  Often, PoA bounds are modest constants such as 4/3 or 2. Nonetheless, in\npractice a guarantee that no more than 25% or 50% of the economic value is lost\nmay be unappealing. This paper asks whether significantly better bounds are\npossible under plausible assumptions. In particular, we look at how these worst\ncase guarantees improve in the following large settings.\n  Large Walrasian auctions: These are auctions with many copies of each item\nand many agents. We show that the PoA tends to 1 as the market size increases,\nunder suitable conditions, mainly that there is some uncertainty about the\nnumbers of copies of each good and demands obey the gross substitutes\ncondition. We also note that some such assumption is unavoidable.\n  Large Fisher markets: Fisher markets are a class of economies that has\nreceived considerable attention in the computer science literature. A large\nmarket is one in which at equilibrium, each buyer makes only a small fraction\nof the total purchases; the smaller the fraction, the larger the market. Here\nthe main condition is that demands are based on homogeneous monotone utility\nfunctions that satisfy the gross substitutes condition. Again, the PoA tends to\n1 as the market size increases.\n  Furthermore, in each setting, we quantify the tradeoff between market size\nand the PoA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2015 22:39:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:24:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:54:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 16:47:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 15 Dec 2017 01:50:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cole", "Richard", ""], ["Tao", "Yixin", ""]]}]
