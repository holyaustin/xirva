Most previous works consider the bid decision as\na static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression\nindependently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the\nbidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span\nbefore the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by\nthe constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the\nrewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has\ncompleted. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy\nsequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across\nall the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future\nrewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a\nreinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the\nauction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is\nthe bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition,\nwe build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding\npolicy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding\nenvironment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world\nauction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation\nusing neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 09:30:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 01:37:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Han", ""], ["Ren", "Kan", ""], ["Zhang", "Weinan", ""], ["Malialis", "Kleanthis", ""], ["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Yu", "Yong", ""], ["Guo", "Defeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02903", "submitter": "Guillermo P\\'erez", "authors": "Emmanuel Filiot, Isma\\\"el Jecker, Nathan Lhote, Guillermo A.

In this paper, customers are assumed to\nmake decisions that pertain to reactive power coordination. In consequence, the\nway in which those customers evaluate the compensation value resulting from\ntheir individual decisions will impact the overall grid performance. In\nparticular, a behavioral framework, based on the framing effect of prospect\ntheory (PT), is developed to study the effect of both objective value and\nsubjective evaluation in a reactive power compensation game. For example, such\neffect allows customers to optimize a subjective value of their utility which\nessentially frames the objective utility with respect to a reference point.\nThis game enables customers to coordinate the use of their electrical devices\nto compensate reactive power. For the proposed game, both the objective case\nusing expected utility theory (EUT) and the PT consideration are solved via a\nlearning algorithm that converges to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In\naddition, several key properties of this game are derived analytically.\nSimulation results show that, under PT, customers are likely to make decisions\nthat differ from those predicted by classical models.

In recent years, several extensions of\nthese games were proposed to incorporate aspects that are not captured by the\nstandard model. Examples of such extensions include the incorporation of risk\nsensitive players, the modeling of altruistic player behavior and the\nimposition of taxes on the resources. These extensions were studied intensively\nwith the goal to obtain a precise understanding of the inefficiency of\nequilibria of these games. In this paper, we introduce a new model of\ncongestion games that captures these extensions (and additional ones) in a\nunifying way. The key idea here is to parameterize both the perceived cost of\neach player and the social cost function of the system designer. Intuitively,\neach player perceives the load induced by the other players by an extent of\n{\\rho}, while the system designer estimates that each player perceives the load\nof all others by an extent of {\\sigma}. The above mentioned extensions reduce\nto special cases of our model by choosing the parameters {\\rho} and {\\sigma}\naccordingly. As in most related works, we concentrate on congestion games with\naffine latency functions here. Despite the fact that we deal with a more\ngeneral class of congestion games, we manage to derive tight bounds on the\nprice of anarchy and the price of stability for a large range of pa- rameters.\nOur bounds provide a complete picture of the inefficiency of equilibria for\nthese perception-parameterized congestion games. As a result, we obtain tight\nbounds on the price of anarchy and the price of stability for the above\nmentioned extensions.

In other words the equilibrium solution of the quantum\nHawk-Dove game can not be obtained in the classical Hawk-Dove game. Moreover,\nwe provide an analytical solution to the quantum $2\\times2$ strategic form\nHawk-Dove game using random mixed strategies. The random strategies which we\ndescribe are evolutionary stable implying both Pareto optimality and Nash\nequilibrium with their payoff's classically unobtainable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 12:58:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 03:48:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Vyas", "Nilesh", ""], ["Benjamin", "Colin", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08644", "submitter": "Sinong Wang", "authors": "Sinong Wang and Ness Shroff", "title": "Security Game with Non-additive Utilities and Multiple Attacker\n  Resources", "comments": "accepted in Sigmetrics 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There has been significant interest in studying security games for modeling\nthe interplay of attacks and defenses on various systems involving critical\ninfrastructure, financial system security, political campaigns, and civil\nsafeguarding. However, existing security game models typically either assume\nadditive utility functions, or that the attacker can attack only one target.\nSuch assumptions lead to tractable analysis, but miss key inherent dependencies\nthat exist among different targets in current complex networks. In this paper,\nwe generalize the classical security game models to allow for non-additive\nutility functions. We also allow attackers to be able to attack multiple\ntargets. We examine such a general security game from a theoretical perspective\nand provide a unified view. In particular, we show that each security game is\nequivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem over a set system\n$\\varepsilon$, which consists of defender's pure strategy space. The key\ntechnique we use is based on the transformation, projection of a polytope, and\nthe elipsoid method. This work settles several open questions in security game\ndomain and significantly extends the state of-the-art of both the polynomial\nsolvable and NP-hard class of the security game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 15:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Sinong", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08896", "submitter": "Desmond Wuhan Cai", "authors": "Desmond Cai, Subhonmesh Bose, Adam Wierman", "title": "On the Role of a Market Maker in Networked Cournot Competition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study Cournot competition among firms in a networked marketplace that is\ncentrally managed by a market maker.

To that end we provide a characterization of the equilibrium\noutcomes of the game between the firms and the market maker. Our results\nhighlight that the equilibrium structure is impacted dramatically by the market\nmaker's objective - depending on the objective there may be a unique\nequilibrium, multiple equilibria, or no equilibria. Further, the game may be a\npotential game (as in the case of classical Cournot competition) or not. Beyond\ncharacterizing the equilibria of the game, we provide an approach for designing\nthe market maker in order to optimize a design objective (e.g., social welfare)\nat the equilibrium of the game.
