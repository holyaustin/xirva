Two natural and competing notions of\nfairness might be to a) charge each individual the same price or b) charge each\nindividual according to the cost that they bring to the pool. In the insurance\nliterature, these general approaches are referred to as \"solidarity\" and\n\"actuarial fairness\" and are commonly viewed as opposites. However, in\ninsurance (and many other natural settings), the cost-sharing game also\nexhibits \"externalities of size\": all else being equal, larger groups have\nlower average cost. In the insurance case, we analyze a model with\nexternalities of size due to a reduction in the variability of losses. We\nexplore how this complicates traditional understandings of fairness, drawing on\nliterature in cooperative game theory.\n  First, we explore solidarity: we show that it is possible for both groups\n(high and low risk) to strictly benefit by joining an insurance pool where\ncosts are evenly split, as opposed to being in separate risk pools. We build on\nthis by producing a pricing scheme that maximally subsidizes the high risk\ngroup, while maintaining an incentive for lower risk people to stay in the\ninsurance pool. Next, we demonstrate that with this new model, the price\ncharged to each individual has to depend on the risk of other participants,\nmaking naive actuarial fairness inefficient. Furthermore, we prove that stable\npricing schemes must be ones where players have the anti-social incentive of\ndesiring riskier partners, contradicting motivations for using actuarial\nfairness.

Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is\narguably the most compelling fairness notion in this context. However, the\nexistence of EFX allocations has not been settled and is one of the most\nimportant problems in fair division. Towards resolving this problem, many\nimpressive results show the existence of its relaxations, e.g., the existence\nof $0.618$-EFX allocations, and the existence of EFX at most $n-1$ unallocated\ngoods. The latter result was recently improved for three agents, in which the\ntwo unallocated goods are allocated through an involved procedure. Reducing the\nnumber of unallocated goods for arbitrary number of agents is a systematic way\nto settle the big question. In this paper, we develop a new approach, and show\nthat for every $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1/2]$, there always exists a\n$(1-\\varepsilon)$-EFX allocation with sublinear number of unallocated goods and\nhigh Nash welfare.\n  For this, we reduce the EFX problem to a novel problem in extremal graph\ntheory.

In\nthis method the voters give (weak) ordinal preference ballots which are used to\ndefine the weighted majority graph (WMG) of direct comparisons between pairs of\ncandidates. The choice of the winner comes from indirect comparisons in the\ngraph, and more specifically from considering directed paths instead of direct\ncomparisons between candidates.\n  When the input is the WMG, to our knowledge, the fastest algorithm for\ncomputing all winners in the Schulze method uses a folklore reduction to the\nAll-Pairs Bottleneck Paths problem and runs in $O(m^{2.69})$ time, where $m$ is\nthe number of candidates. It is an interesting open question whether this can\nbe improved. Our first result is a combinatorial algorithm with a nearly\nquadratic running time for computing all winners. This running time is\nessentially optimal. If the input to the Schulze winners problem is not the WMG\nbut the preference profile, then constructing the WMG is a bottleneck that\nincreases the running time significantly; in the special case when there are\n$m$ candidates and $n=O(m)$ voters, the running time is $O(m^{2.69})$, or\n$O(m^{2.5})$ if there is a nearly-linear time algorithm for multiplying dense\nsquare matrices.

In large two-player\nzero-sum imperfect-information games, modern extensions of counterfactual\nregret minimization (CFR) are currently the practical state of the art for\ncomputing a Nash equilibrium. Most regret-minimization algorithms for tree-form\nsequential decision making, including CFR, require (i) an exact model of the\nplayer's decision nodes, observation nodes, and how they are linked, and (ii)\nfull knowledge, at all times t, about the payoffs -- even in parts of the\ndecision space that are not encountered at time t. Recently, there has been\ngrowing interest towards relaxing some of those restrictions and making regret\nminimization applicable to settings for which reinforcement learning methods\nhave traditionally been used -- for example, those in which only black-box\naccess to the environment is available. We give the first, to our knowledge,\nregret-minimization algorithm that guarantees sublinear regret with high\nprobability even when requirement (i) -- and thus also (ii) -- is dropped. We\nformalize an online learning setting in which the strategy space is not known\nto the agent and gets revealed incrementally whenever the agent encounters new\ndecision points. We give an efficient algorithm that achieves $O(T^{3/4})$\nregret with high probability for that setting, even when the agent faces an\nadversarial environment. Our experiments show it significantly outperforms the\nprior algorithms for the problem, which do not have such guarantees. It can be\nused in any application for which regret minimization is useful: approximating\nNash equilibrium or quantal response equilibrium, approximating coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium in multi-player games, learning a best response,\nlearning safe opponent exploitation, and online play against an unknown\nopponent/environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 04:03:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Farina", "Gabriele", ""], ["Sandholm", "Tuomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.04546", "submitter": "Gabriele Farina", "authors": "Gabriele Farina, Robin Schmucker, Tuomas Sandholm", "title": "Bandit Linear Optimization for Sequential Decision Making and\n  Extensive-Form Games", "comments": "Full version.

A review of GT models studied in the VNs is then\nintroduced, including its basic concepts, classifications, and applicable\nvehicular issues. After discussing the requirements of VNs and the motivation\nof using GT, a comprehensive literature review on GT applications in dealing\nwith the challenges of current VNs is provided. Furthermore, recent\ncontributions of GT to VNs integrating with diverse emerging 5G technologies\nare surveyed. Finally, the lessons learned are given, and several key research\nchallenges and possible solutions for applying GT in VNs are outlined.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2021 14:09:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Zemin", ""], ["Liu", "Yanheng", ""], ["Wang", "Jian", ""], ["Li", "Guofa", ""], ["Anil", "Carie", ""], ["Li", "Keqiang", ""], ["Guo", "Xinyu", ""], ["Sun", "Geng", ""], ["Tian", "Daxin", ""], ["Cao", "Dongpu", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.12229", "submitter": "Lucianna Kiffer", "authors": "Lucianna Kiffer and Rajmohan Rajaraman", "title": "HaPPY-Mine: Designing a Mining Reward Function", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In cryptocurrencies, the block reward is meant to serve as the incentive\nmechanism for miners to commit resources to create blocks and in effect secure\nthe system. Existing systems primarily divide the reward in proportion to\nexpended resources and follow one of two static models for total block reward:\n(i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block\nreward halves every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving\nroughly every 4 years) but otherwise remains fixed between halvings. In recent\nwork, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under asymmetric miner\ncosts showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique. Their analysis\nalso reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in\nblockchain mining, a phenomenon that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum\nand highlighted by other studies. In this work we introduce a novel family of\nmining reward functions, HaPPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which peg\nthe value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as\nthe hashrate increases. HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to\nexpended hashrate and inherits the safety properties of the generalized\nproportional reward function. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner\ncost model and show that an equilibrium always exists with a unique set of\nminer participants and a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a\nHaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized than the static model equilibrium\nunder a set of metrics including number of mining participants and hashrate\ndistribution. Finally, we show that any HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is also safe\nagainst collusion and sybil attacks, and explore how the market value of the\ncurrency affects the equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2021 23:28:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kiffer", "Lucianna", ""], ["Rajaraman", "Rajmohan", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.12334", "submitter": "Zhiyuan Wang", "authors": "Zhiyuan Wang and Lin Gao and Jianwei Huang", "title": "Taming Time-Varying Information Asymmetry in Fresh Status Acquisition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE INFOCOM 2021", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Many online platforms are providing valuable real-time contents (e.g.,\ntraffic) by continuously acquiring the status of different Points of Interest\n(PoIs).

The LtD mechanism enables the platforms to achieve a tunable\ntrade-off between payoff maximization and freshness conditions.

[SODA'14] in the pursuit of prior-independent\nposted-price mechanisms. As they show, $O(1)$-competitive policies are\nachievable using only a single sample from the distribution of each agent. A\nnotable portion of their results relies on reducing the design of single-sample\nprophet inequalities (SSPIs) to that of order-oblivious secretary (OOS)\npolicies. The above reduction comes at the cost of not fully utilizing the\navailable samples. However, to date, this is essentially the only method for\nproving SSPIs for many combinatorial sets. Very recently, Rubinstein et al.\n[ITCS'20] give a surprisingly simple algorithm which achieves the optimal\ncompetitive ratio for the single-choice SSPI problem $-$ a result which is\nunobtainable going through the reduction to secretary problems. Motivated by\nthis discrepancy, we study the competitiveness of simple SSPI policies\ndirectly, without appealing to results from OOS literature. In this direction,\nwe first develop a framework for analyzing policies against a greedy-like\nprophet solution. Using this framework, we obtain the first SSPI for general\n(non-bipartite) matching environments, as well as improved competitive ratios\nfor transversal and truncated partition matroids. Second, motivated by the\nobservation that many OOS policies for matroids decompose the problem into\nindependent rank-$1$ instances, we provide a meta-theorem which applies to any\nmatroid satisfying this partition property.

The focus of this\npaper is on problem (i), where we seek to characterize the impact of the\ndivision of resources on the best-case efficiency of the resulting collective\nbehavior. Specifically, we focus on a team Colonel Blotto game where there are\ntwo sub-colonels competing against a common adversary in a two battlefield\nenvironment. Here, each sub-colonel is assigned a given resource budget and is\nrequired to allocate these resources independent of the other sub-colonel.\nHowever, their success is dependent on the allocation strategy of both\nsub-colonels. The central focus of this manuscript is on how to divide a common\npool of resources among the two sub-colonels to optimize the resulting\nbest-case efficiency guarantees. Intuitively, one would imagine that the more\nbalanced the division of resources, the worse the performance, as such\ndivisions restrict the sub-colonels' ability to employ joint randomized\nstrategies that tend to be necessary for optimizing performance guarantees.\nHowever, the main result of this paper demonstrates that this intuition is\nactually incorrect. A more balanced division of resources can offer better\nperformance guarantees than a more centralized division. Hence, this paper\ndemonstrates that the resource division problem is highly non-trivial in such\nenmeshed environments and worthy of significant future research efforts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 21:20:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Paarporn", "Keith", ""], ["Chandan", "Rahul", ""], ["Alizadeh", "Mahnoosh", ""], ["Marden", "Jason R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16813", "submitter": "Xiaojie Chen", "authors": "Fang Yan, Xiaojie Chen, Zhipeng Qiu, and Attila Szolnoki", "title": "Cooperator driven oscillation in a time-delayed feedback-evolving game", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "New Journal of Physics 23 (2021) 053017", "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/abf205", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Considering feedback of collective actions of cooperation on common resources\nhas vital importance to reach sustainability. But such efforts may have not\nimmediate consequence on the state of environment and it is unclear how they\ninfluence the strategic and environmental dynamics with feedbacks. To address\nthis issue, we construct a feedback-evolving game model in which we consider\nthe growth capacity of resources and the punishment efficiency on defectors who\ndo not provide returns to the environment. Importantly, we further assume a\ndelay in adopting the contribution of cooperative individuals to environmental\nchange in our model. We find that when this contribution amount from\ncooperators' endowment is fixed, the time delay has no particular consequence\non the coevolutionary dynamics. However, when the return is proportional to\ntheir endowment, then the time delay can induce periodic oscillatory dynamics\nof cooperation level and environment. Our work reveals the potential effects of\ntime delay of cooperative actions on the coevolutionary dynamics in strategic\ninteractions with environmental feedback.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 05:11:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Fang", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaojie", ""], ["Qiu", "Zhipeng", ""], ["Szolnoki", "Attila", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16879", "submitter": "Akifumi Kira", "authors": "Akifumi Kira, Kiyohito Nagano, Manabu Sugiyama, and Naoyuki Kamiyama", "title": "Optimal class assignment problem: a case study at Gunma University", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT econ.TH math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, we consider the real-world problem of assigning students to\nclasses, where each student has a preference list, ranking a subset of classes\nin order of preference.
