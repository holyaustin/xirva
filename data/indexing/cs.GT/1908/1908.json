Hence, opening channels, although costly, can benefit\na party, both by reducing the cost of the party for sending a transaction and\nby collecting the fees from forwarding transactions of other parties.\n  This trade-off spawns a network creation game between the channel parties. In\nthis work, we introduce the first game theoretic model for analyzing the\nnetwork creation game on blockchain payment channels.

All preferences are described by choice functions that satisfy\nnatural conditions.

In this framework, a two-sided matching problem may be described as\nan agreement problem between two parties: the two parties must find a stable\nagreement, i.e., a set of contracts from which no party will want to take away\nany contract and to which the two parties cannot agree to add any contract. On\nsuch stable agreements each party's preference relation is a partial order and\nthe two parties have inverse preferences. An algorithm is presented that\ngeneralizes algorithms previously proposed in less general situations. This\nalgorithm provides a stable agreement that is preferred to all stable\nagreements by one of the parties and therefore less preferred than all stable\nagreements by the other party. The number of steps of the algorithm is linear\nin the size of the set of contracts, i.e., polynomial in the size of the\nproblem. The algorithm provides a proof that stable agreements form a lattice\nunder the two inverse preference relations. Under additional assumptions on the\nrole of money in preferences, agreement problems can describe general two-sided\nmarkets in which goods are exchanged for money.
