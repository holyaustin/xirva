WGANs is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with\nsimultaneous no-regret dynamics. Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror\ndecent addresses the limit cycling problem in training WGANs. We formally show\nthat in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of OMD dynamics\nconverges to an equilibrium, in contrast to GD dynamics which are bound to\ncycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between GD and OMD\ndynamics with toy examples, even when GD is modified with many adaptations\nproposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We\napply OMD WGAN training to a bioinformatics problem of generating DNA\nsequences.

Most\nprevious studies on co-design of incentive mechanism and privacy preservation\nassume a trustworthy fusion center (FC). Very recent work has taken steps to\nrelax the assumption on trustworthy FC and allows participatory users (PUs) to\nadd well calibrated noise to their raw sensing data before reporting them,\nwhereas the focus is on the equilibrium behavior of data subjects with binary\ndata. Making a paradigm shift, this paper aim to quantify the privacy\ncompensation for continuous data sensing while allowing FC to directly control\nPUs. There are two conflicting objectives in such scenario: FC desires better\nquality data in order to achieve higher aggregation accuracy whereas PUs prefer\nadding larger noise for higher privacy-preserving levels (PPLs). To achieve a\ngood balance therein, we design an efficient incentive mechanism to REconcile\nFC's Aggregation accuracy and individual PU's data Privacy (REAP).\nSpecifically, we adopt the celebrated notion of differential privacy to measure\nPUs' PPLs and quantify their impacts on FC's aggregation accuracy. Then,\nappealing to Contract Theory, we design an incentive mechanism to maximize FC's\naggregation accuracy under a given budget. The proposed incentive mechanism\noffers different contracts to PUs with different privacy preferences, by which\nFC can directly control PUs. It can further overcome the information asymmetry,\ni.e., the FC typically does not know each PU's precise privacy preference. We\nderive closed-form solutions for the optimal contracts in both complete\ninformation and incomplete information scenarios. Further, the results are\ngeneralized to the continuous case where PUs' privacy preferences take values\nin a continuous domain.

While\nprior research has made progress with regards to scalability, many real world\nproblems cannot be solved satisfactorily yet as per current requirements; these\ninclude the deployed federal air marshals (FAMS) application and the threat\nscreening (TSG) problem at airports. Further, these problem domains are\ninherently limited by NP hardness shown in prior literature. We initiate a\nprincipled study of approximations in zero-sum SSGs. Our contribution includes\nthe following: (1) a unified model of SSGs called adversarial randomized\nallocation (ARA) games that allows studying most SSGs in one model, (2)\nhardness of approximation results for zero-sum ARA, as well as for the\nsub-problem of allocating federal air marshal (FAMS) and threat screening\nproblem (TSG) at airports, (3) an approximation framework for zero-sum ARA with\nprovable approximation guarantees and (4) experiments demonstrating the\nsignificant scalability of up to 1000x improvement in runtime with an\nacceptable 5% solution quality loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Nov 2017 23:25:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Arunesh", ""], ["Schlenker", "Aaron", ""], ["Dmello", "Donnabell", ""], ["Tambe", "Milind", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04484", "submitter": "Peter Biro Dr.", "authors": "Kolos Csaba \\'Agoston, P\\'eter Bir\\'o, Rich\\'ard Sz\\'ant\\'o", "title": "Stable project allocation under distributional constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a two-sided matching market when agents on both sides have preferences the\nstability of the solution is typically the most important requirement.
