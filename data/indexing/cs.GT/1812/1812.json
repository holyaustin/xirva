Each time, every agent chooses an action that maximizes her\ninstantaneous subjective expected payoff and then updates her beliefs according\nto what she observes. In particular, we assume that each agent only observes\nher realized payoff. A steady state of the resulting dynamic is a\nselfconfirming equilibrium given the assumed feedback. We characterize the\nstructure of the set of selfconfirming equilibria in the given class of network\ngames, we relate selfconfirming and Nash equilibria, and we analyze simple\nconjectural best-reply paths whose limit points are selfconfirming equilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 12:27:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 15:31:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Battigalli", "Pierpaolo", ""], ["Panebianco", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Pin", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11896", "submitter": "Inbal Talgam-Cohen", "authors": "Tim Roughgarden and Inbal Talgam-Cohen", "title": "Approximately Optimal Mechanism Design", "comments": "Preprint; final version to appear in Annual Reviews of Economics,\n  August 2019.

There are,\nhowever, some basic problems for which the traditional optimal mechanism design\napproach is ill-suited---either because it makes overly strong assumptions, or\nbecause it advocates overly complex designs. This survey reviews several common\nissues with optimal mechanisms, including exorbitant communication,\ncomputation, and informational requirements; and it presents several examples\ndemonstrating that passing to the relaxed goal of an approximately optimal\nmechanism allows us to reason about fundamental questions that seem out of\nreach of the traditional theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:54:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Aug 2020 19:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Roughgarden", "Tim", ""], ["Talgam-Cohen", "Inbal", ""]]}]
