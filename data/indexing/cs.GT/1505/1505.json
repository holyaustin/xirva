Whether it is a password for user authentication or a secret key\nfor a cryptographic primitive, picking it requires the user to trade-off\nusability costs with resistance against an adversary: a simple password is\neasier to remember but is also easier to guess; likewise, a shorter\ncryptographic key may require fewer computational and storage resources but it\nis also easier to attack. A fundamental question is how one can optimally\nresolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also\nutilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen\nits attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing\nthe optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two\ntypes of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that\nare ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive\nthe mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically\npessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg\nEquilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a\ncapped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform\nrandomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the\nattacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash\nEquilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,\nsignifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases.

The proposed approach allows to jointly exploit both\nthe wireless and social context of wireless users for optimizing the overall\nallocation of resources and improving traffic offload in SCNs. This\ncontext-aware resource allocation problem is formulated as a matching game in\nwhich user equipments (UEs) and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another, based\non utility functions that capture both wireless and social metrics. Due to\nsocial interrelations, this game is shown to belong to a class of matching\ngames with peer effects. To solve this game, a novel, selforganizing algorithm\nis proposed, using which UEs and RBs can interact to decide on their desired\nallocation. The proposed algorithm is then proven to converge to a two-sided\nstable matching between UEs and RBs. The properties of the resulting stable\noutcome are then studied and assessed.

We complement her result\nwith proving that the linear orders of any profile which is intermediate on a\nmedian graph form a Condorcet domain. We prove that for any median graph there\nexists a profile that is intermediate with respect to that graph and that one\nmay need at least as many alternatives as vertices to construct such a profile.\nWe provide a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize whether or not a given\nprofile is intermediate with respect to some median graph. Finally, we show\nthat finding winners for the Chamberlin-Courant rule is polynomial-time\nsolvable for profiles that are single-crossing on a tree.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 18:32:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Clearwater", "Adam", ""], ["Puppe", "Clemens", ""], ["Slinko", "Arkadii", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.06984", "submitter": "Endre Cs\\'oka", "authors": "Endre Cs\\'oka", "title": "Limit theory of discrete mathematics problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DM math.CO math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show a general problem-solving tool called limit theory.

These models focus on isolated\nsystems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system\nwith multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation\nnetworks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and,\nconsequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To\nunderstand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we\ninvestigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders.\nUnlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender\nmust protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response\ndecision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical\ninvestigation of multidefender security games with independent targets,\noffering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with\nincreasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive\nto over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler\nmodels, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing\nboth in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender.\nConsidering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer\nlinear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make\nuse of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply\nthis approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of\nnetworks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks.\nOur analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread\ndetermine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2015 04:54:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Lou", "Jian", ""], ["Smith", "Andrew M.", ""], ["Vorobeychik", "Yevgeniy", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07737", "submitter": "Lefteris  Kirousis", "authors": "Lefteris Kirousis, Phokion G.

This corresponds to the well-known concept of {\\em\ncore} in cooperative game theory.\n  In particular, VCG revenue is known to be not competitive when the goods\nbeing sold have complementarities. A bottleneck here is an impossibility result\nshowing that there is no auction that simultaneously achieves competitive\nprices (a core outcome) and incentive-compatibility.\n  In this paper we try to overcome the above impossibility result by asking the\nfollowing natural question: is it possible to design an incentive-compatible\nauction whose revenue is comparable (even if less) to a competitive outcome?\nTowards this, we define a notion of {\\em core-competitive} auctions.
