In this paper, we\nexamine how these tradeoffs should be made. We begin by arguing that the most\nnatural solution concept to evaluate these tradeoffs is the lowest symmetric\nNash equilibrium (SNE). As part of this argument, we generalise the well known\nconnection between the lowest SNE and the VCG outcome. We then propose a new\nranking algorithm, loosely based on the revenue-optimal auction, that uses a\nreserve price to order the ads (not just to filter them) and give conditions\nunder which it raises more revenue than simply applying that reserve price.\nFinally, we conduct extensive simulations examining the tradeoffs enabled by\ndifferent ranking algorithms and show that our proposed algorithm enables\nsuperior operating points by a variety of metrics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 12:29:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Roberts", "Ben", ""], ["Gunawardena", "Dinan", ""], ["Kash", "Ian A.", ""], ["Key", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7718", "submitter": "Christopher Wilkens", "authors": "Darrell Hoy, Kamal Jain, and Christopher A.

Moreover, its potential virtues grow in complex settings where\nincentive compatible auctions may generate little or no revenue. Unfortunately,\nthe first-price auction is poorly understood in theory because equilibrium is\nnot {\\em a priori} a credible predictor of bidder behavior.\n  We take a dynamic approach to studying first-price auctions: rather than\nbasing performance guarantees solely on static equilibria, we study the\nrepeated setting and show that robust performance guarantees may be derived\nfrom simple axioms of bidder behavior. For example, as long as a loser raises\nher bid quickly, a standard first-price auction will generate at least as much\nrevenue as a second-price auction. We generalize this dynamic technique to\ncomplex pay-your-bid auction settings and show that progressively stronger\nassumptions about bidder behavior imply progressively stronger guarantees about\nthe auction's performance.\n  Along the way, we find that the auctioneer's choice of bidding language is\ncritical when generalizing beyond the single-item setting, and we propose a\nspecific construction called the {\\em utility-target auction} that performs\nwell. The utility-target auction includes a bidder's final utility as an\nadditional parameter, identifying the single dimension along which she wishes\nto compete. This auction is closely related to profit-target bidding in\nfirst-price and ascending proxy package auctions and gives strong revenue\nguarantees for a variety of complex auction environments. Of particular\ninterest, the guaranteed existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium in the\nutility-target auction shows how Overture might have eliminated the cyclic\nbehavior in their generalized first-price sponsored search auction if bidders\ncould have placed more sophisticated bids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 17:31:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hoy", "Darrell", ""], ["Jain", "Kamal", ""], ["Wilkens", "Christopher A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.8125", "submitter": "Sigal Oren", "authors": "Flavio Chierichetti, Jon Kleinberg and Sigal Oren", "title": "On Discrete Preferences and Coordination", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An active line of research has considered games played on networks in which\npayoffs depend on both a player's individual decision and also the decisions of\nher neighbors. Such games have been used to model issues including the\nformation of opinions and the adoption of technology. A basic question that has\nremained largely open in this area is to consider games where the strategies\navailable to the players come from a fixed, discrete set, and where players may\nhave different intrinsic preferences among the possible strategies. It is\nnatural to model the tension among these different preferences by positing a\ndistance function on the strategy set that determines a notion of \"similarity\"\namong strategies; a player's payoff is determined by the distance from her\nchosen strategy to her preferred strategy and to the strategies chosen by her\nnetwork neighbors. Even when there are only two strategies available, this\nframework already leads to natural open questions about a version of the\nclassical Battle of the Sexes problem played on a graph.\n  We develop a set of techniques for analyzing this class of games, which we\nrefer to as discrete preference games. We parametrize the games by the relative\nextent to which a player takes into account the effect of her preferred\nstrategy and the effect of her neighbors' strategies, allowing us to\ninterpolate between network coordination games and unilateral decision-making.\nWhen these two effects are balanced, we show that the price of stability is\nequal to 1 for any discrete preference game in which the distance function on\nthe strategies is a tree metric; as a special case, this includes the Battle of\nthe Sexes on a graph. We also show that trees form the maximal family of\nmetrics for which the price of stability is 1, and produce a collection of\nmetrics on which the price of stability converges to a tight bound of 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 19:22:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chierichetti", "Flavio", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Jon", ""], ["Oren", "Sigal", ""]]}]
