We show\nthat despite these restrictions, recommender mechanisms can implement\nequilibria of complete information games in settings of incomplete information\nunder the condition that the game is large---i.e. that there are a large number\nof players, and any player's action affects any other's payoff by at most a\nsmall amount.\n  Our result follows from a novel application of differential privacy. We show\nthat any algorithm that computes a correlated equilibrium of a complete\ninformation game while satisfying a variant of differential privacy---which we\ncall joint differential privacy---can be used as a recommender mechanism while\nsatisfying our desired incentive properties. Our main technical result is an\nalgorithm for computing a correlated equilibrium of a large game while\nsatisfying joint differential privacy.\n  Although our recommender mechanisms are designed to satisfy game-theoretic\nproperties, our solution ends up satisfying a strong privacy property as well.\nNo group of players can learn \"much\" about the type of any player outside the\ngroup from the recommendations of the mechanism, even if these players collude\nin an arbitrary way. As such, our algorithm is able to implement equilibria of\ncomplete information games, without revealing information about the realized\ntypes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2012 18:49:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 20:24:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 22 Aug 2013 19:29:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 16:24:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kearns", "Michael", ""], ["Pai", "Mallesh M.", ""], ["Roth", "Aaron", ""], ["Ullman", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.4108", "submitter": "Amy Greenwald", "authors": "Amy Greenwald, Justin Boyan", "title": "Bidding under Uncertainty: Theory and Experiments", "comments": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twentieth Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI2004)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2004-PG-209-216", "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a study of agent bidding strategies, assuming\ncombinatorial valuations for complementary and substitutable goods, in three\nauction environments: sequential auctions, simultaneous auctions, and the\nTrading Agent Competition (TAC) Classic hotel auction design, a hybrid of\nsequential and simultaneous auctions.

Each peer has the ability to change the network in a\nlimited way, e.g., by creating or deleting incident links. In doing so, a peer\ncan reduce its individual communication cost. Typically, these costs are\nmodeled by the maximum or average distance in the network. We introduce a\ngeneralized version of the basic network creation game (BNCG). In the BNCG (by\nAlon et al., SPAA 2010), each peer may replace one of its incident links by a\nlink to an arbitrary peer. This is done in a selfish way in order to minimize\neither the maximum or average distance to all other peers. That is, each peer\nworks towards a network structure that allows himself to communicate\nefficiently with all other peers. However, participants of large networks are\nseldom interested in all peers. Rather, they want to communicate efficiently\nonly with a small subset of peers. Our model incorporates these (communication)\ninterests explicitly.

We also\nshow that when users experience very different channel gains on their two\ncarriers, they may choose to transmit on the same carrier at the Stackelberg\nequilibrium as this contributes enough energy efficiency to outweigh the\ninterference degradation caused by the mutual transmission.

In this context, Game Theory has\nbeen instrumental to model collaborative systems and the task allocation\nproblem, and to design mechanisms for optimal allocation of tasks. In this\npaper, we revise the classical assumptions and propose a new approach to this\nproblem. First, we establish a system model based on heterogenous nodes (users,\nplayers), and propose a basic distributed mechanism so that, when a new task\nappears, it is assigned to the most suitable node. The classical technique for\ncompensating a node that executes a task is the use of payments (which in most\nnetworks are hard or impossible to implement). Instead, we propose a\ndistributed mechanism for the optimal allocation of tasks without payments. We\nprove this mechanism to be robust event in the presence of independent selfish\nor rationally limited players. Additionally, our model is based on very weak\nassumptions, which makes the proposed mechanisms susceptible to be implemented\nin networked systems (e.g., the Internet).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2012 16:29:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e9ndez", "Agust\u00edn Santos", ""], ["Anta", "Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez", "Luis L\u00f3pez", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6087", "submitter": "Majed Haddad", "authors": "Majed Haddad, Habib Sidi, Piotr Wiecek and Eitan Altman", "title": "Automated Dynamic Offset Applied to Cell Association", "comments": "12 pages, 3 figures, technical report. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1002.3931, arXiv:0903.2966 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian game framework for\nautomated dynamic offset selection.
