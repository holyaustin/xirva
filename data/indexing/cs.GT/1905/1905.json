The service time during which the resource is used by the customer is\nstochastic and the firm may incur a service cost. This model represents various\nmarkets for reusable resources such as cloud computing, shared vehicles,\nrotable parts, and hotel rooms.

Both the Perfect\nPrediction Equilibrium and the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium for strategic\ngames become special cases of this generalized equilibrium concept. The\ngeneralized equilibrium, if there are no ties in the payoffs, is at most\nunique, and is Pareto-optimal.\n  We also contribute a special-relativistic interpretation of a subclass of the\ngames in extensive form with imperfect information as a directed acyclic graph\nof decisions made by any number of agents, each decision being located at a\nspecific position in Minkowski spacetime, and the information sets and game\nstructure being derived from the causal structure.

In this paper, we investigate the economic\nviability of offering the data trading market together with the rollover\nmechanism, to gain a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between the\nuser-flexibility and the time-flexibility.

Due to the availability of monthly data rollover, a user's\ndaily trading decision corresponds to a dynamic programming problem with two\ntime scales (i.e., day-to-day and month-to-month). Our analysis reveals an\noptimal trading policy with a target interval structure, specified by a\nbuy-up-to threshold and a sell-down-to threshold in each time slot.

Understanding\nhow to incorporate this into the models used to design cryptocurrencies has\nmotivated a large body of work, yet many open problems still exist and current\nsystems rarely deal with incentive related problems well. This issue arises due\nto the gap between Cryptography and Distributed Systems security, which deals\nwith traditional security problems that ignore the explicit consideration of\nincentives, and Game Theory, which deals best with situations involving\nincentives. With this work, we aim to offer a systematization of the work that\nrelates to this problem, considering papers that blend Game Theory with\nCryptography or Distributed systems and discussing how they can be related.\nThis gives an overview of the available tools, and we look at their (potential)\nuse in practice, in the context of existing blockchain based systems that have\nbeen proposed or implemented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2019 13:06:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2020 18:16:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Azouvi", "Sarah", ""], ["Hicks", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.08909", "submitter": "Shahin Jabbari", "authors": "Jinshuo Dong and Hadi Elzayn and Shahin Jabbari and Michael Kearns and\n  Zachary Schutzman", "title": "Equilibrium Characterization for Data Acquisition Games", "comments": "The short version of this paper appears in the proceedings of\n  IJCAI-19", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a game between two firms in which each provide a service based on\nmachine learning.

In this\nsetting, the strategic behavior of players is complemented by an external\ndevice that privately recommends moves to agents as the game progresses;\nplayers are free to deviate at any time, but will then not receive future\nrecommendations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that an EFCE\ncan be formulated as the solution to a bilinear saddle-point problem. To\nshowcase how this novel formulation can inspire new algorithms to compute\nEFCEs, we propose a simple subgradient descent method which exploits this\nformulation and structural properties of EFCEs. Our method has better\nscalability than the prior approach based on linear programming. Second, we\npropose two benchmark games, which we hope will serve as the basis for future\nevaluation of EFCE solvers. These games were chosen so as to cover two natural\napplication domains for EFCE: conflict resolution via a mediator, and\nbargaining and negotiation. Third, we document the qualitative behavior of EFCE\nin our proposed games. We show that the social-welfare-maximizing equilibria in\nthese games are highly nontrivial and exhibit surprisingly subtle sequential\nbehavior that so far has not received attention in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2019 16:15:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Oct 2019 05:17:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Farina", "Gabriele", ""], ["Ling", "Chun Kai", ""], ["Fang", "Fei", ""], ["Sandholm", "Tuomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.13031", "submitter": "Thomas Nedelec", "authors": "Cl\\'ement Calauz\\`enes and Thomas Nedelec and Vianney Perchet and\n  Noureddine El Karoui", "title": "Robust Stackelberg buyers in repeated auctions", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1808.06979", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the practical and classical setting where the seller is using an\nexploration stage to learn the value distributions of the bidders before\nrunning a revenue-maximizing auction in a exploitation phase.

In this paper, we extend the state of the art along two main\ndirections. First, we focus on games where players' actions are made of\nmultiple resources, and we prove that the problem is NP-hard and not in\nPoly-APX unless P = NP, even in the basic case in which players are symmetric,\ntheir actions are made of only two resources, and the cost functions are\nmonotonic.

Moreover, we prove that, if we allow for leader's\nmixed strategies, then the problem becomes NP-hard even with only four classes\nand monotonic costs.
