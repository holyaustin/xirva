Research on RS has mainly focused on the\ncustomer perspective, i.e., accurate prediction of user preferences and\nmaximization of user utilities. As a result, most existing techniques are not\nexplicitly built for revenue maximization, the primary business goal of\nenterprises. In this work, we explore and exploit a novel connection between RS\nand the profitability of a business. As recommendations can be seen as an\ninformation channel between a business and its customers, it is interesting and\nimportant to investigate how to make strategic dynamic recommendations leading\nto maximum possible revenue. To this end, we propose a novel \\model that takes\ninto account a variety of factors including prices, valuations, saturation\neffects, and competition amongst products. Under this model, we study the\nproblem of finding revenue-maximizing recommendation strategies over a finite\ntime horizon. We show that this problem is NP-hard, but approximation\nguarantees can be obtained for a slightly relaxed version, by establishing an\nelegant connection to matroid theory. Given the prohibitively high complexity\nof the approximation algorithm, we also design intelligent heuristics for the\noriginal problem.

To make this idea concrete, we consider the societally\nimportant decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Extensive past\nwork in quantitative political science provides a framework for empirically\nmodeling the decisions of justices and how they relate to text. We incorporate\ninto such a model texts authored by amici curiae (\"friends of the court\"\nseparate from the litigants) who seek to weigh in on the decision, then\nexplicitly model their goals in a random utility model. We demonstrate the\nbenefits of this approach in improved vote prediction and the ability to\nperform counterfactual analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 03:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:54:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2014 18:47:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 10 Oct 2014 00:20:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2014 21:29:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sim", "Yanchuan", ""], ["Routledge", "Bryan", ""], ["Smith", "Noah A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8498", "submitter": "Jacob Crandall", "authors": "Jacob W.

This\nmachine-learning problem is particularly challenging due, in part, to the\npresence of multiple (even infinite) equilibria and inherently large strategy\nspaces. In this paper, we introduce a method to reduce the strategy space of\ntwo-player general-sum RSGs to a handful of expert strategies. This process,\ncalled Mega, effectually reduces an RSG to a bandit problem. We show that the\nresulting strategy space preserves several important properties of the original\nRSG, thus enabling a learner to produce robust strategies within a reasonably\nsmall number of interactions. To better establish strengths and weaknesses of\nthis approach, we empirically evaluate the resulting learning system against\nother algorithms in three different RSGs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 11:46:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Jan 2018 15:30:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 Jan 2018 13:54:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Crandall", "Jacob W.", ""]]}]
