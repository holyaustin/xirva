Agents may\nmanipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does\nnot reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people\noften do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can\nbe computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their\nexpected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote\ntruthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being\ntruthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we\nexamine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner\napproval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at\nheuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and\nmakes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a\nbehavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations\nand prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these\nbehaviors maximize expected utility and show how the structure of the voting\nenvironment affects both how well each heuristic performs and how humans employ\nthese heuristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:38:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Scheuerman", "Jaelle", ""], ["Harman", "Jason L.", ""], ["Mattei", "Nicholas", ""], ["Venable", "K.

A new potential-based framework for the fixed horizon\nversion of this problem has been recently developed using verification\narguments from optimal control theory. This paper extends this framework to the\nrandom (geometric) stopping version. To obtain explicit bounds, we construct\npotentials for the geometric version from potentials used for the fixed horizon\nversion of the problem. This construction leads to new explicit lower and upper\nbounds associated with specific adversary and player strategies. While there\nare several known lower bounds in the fixed horizon setting, our lower bounds\nappear to be the first such results in the geometric stopping setting with an\narbitrary number of experts. Our framework also leads in some cases to improved\nupper bounds.

The goal is to keep the discrepancy small as\npossible. A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where T\npoints are sampled uniformly in [0,1], and the goal is to immediately color\nthem $\\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As random\ncoloring incurs $\\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds are\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n \\log (T/n)})$ for vector balancing and $1$ for interval\nbalancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline\nbounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the\nstochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is\n$\\Omega(T^{1/2})$ for any online algorithm.\n  Bansal and Spencer recently show an $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log T)$ bound when each\ncoordinate is independent. When there are dependencies among the coordinates,\nthe problem becomes much more challenging, as evidenced by a recent work of\nJiang, Kulkarni, and Singla that gives a non-trivial $O(T^{1/\\log\\log T})$\nbound for online interval discrepancy. Although this beats random coloring, it\nis still far from the offline bound.\n  In this work, we introduce a new framework for online vector balancing when\nthe input distribution has dependencies across coordinates. This lets us obtain\na $poly(n, \\log T)$ bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input\ndistributions, and a $poly(\\log T)$ bound for online interval discrepancy. Our\nframework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric\ndiscrepancy problems; e.g., a $poly(\\log^d (T))$ bound for the online\n$d$-dimensional Tusn\\'ady's problem.

However, in real-life situations (which are often modeled by SGs)\nthe followers (terrorists, thieves, poachers or smugglers) -- as humans in\ngeneral -- may act not in a perfectly rational way, as their decisions may be\naffected by biases of various kinds which bound rationality of their decisions.\nOne of the popular models of bounded rationality (BR) is Anchoring Theory (AT)\nwhich claims that humans have a tendency to flatten probabilities of available\noptions, i.e. they perceive a distribution of these probabilities as being\ncloser to the uniform distribution than it really is.

For instance, Stealthy Link Flooding Attack (SLFA) is a variant of\nDDoS attacks that strives to block access to a target area by flooding a small\nset of links, and it is shown that it can bypass traditional DDoS defense\nmechanisms. One potential solution to tackle such SLFAs is to apply Moving\nTarget Defense (MTD) techniques in which network settings are dynamically\nchanged to confuse/deceive attackers, thus making it highly expensive to launch\na successful attack. However, since MTD comes with some overhead to the\nnetwork, to find the best strategy (i.e., when and/or to what extent) of\napplying it has been a major challenge. The strategy is significantly\ninfluenced by the attacker's behavior that is often difficult to guess. In this\nwork, we address the challenge of obtaining the optimal MTD strategy that\neffectively mitigates SLFAs while incurs a minimal overhead. We design the\nproblem as a signaling game considering the network defender and the attacker\nas players.
