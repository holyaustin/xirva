C-WMMG models a basic\ncooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a\nsister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this\npaper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of\nthis case is that there are at most $n+1$ minimal winning coalitions (MWC for\nshort), and they can be enumerated in time $O(n\\log n)$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is\nmore handleable than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices,\ni.e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel\nindex, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a\ncomparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none\nof the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for\nthe two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the\nfour power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik\nindex and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the\nDeegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and\ncompetition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in\nmeasuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more\nobjective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new\ninsights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It\nmay also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of\nnon-additive voting mechanisms.

It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi\nagent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population\nbiology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy\nspaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the\nchoices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra.\nThis paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to\nstudy the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy\nspaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized\nby probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary\ndifferential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of\ncoupled integral--differential replicator equations that describe the mutual\nevolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional\nequations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their\nsolutions for several two-player games, and confirm our analytical results\nusing simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Apr 2009 23:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Sep 2011 20:32:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Galstyan", "Aram", ""]]}]
