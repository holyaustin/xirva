In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'.

This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist.

We consider the issue of judgement aggregation from the\nperspective of approximation. That is, we generalize the previous results by\nstudying approximate judgement aggregation. We relax the main two constraints\nassumed in the current literature, Consistency and Independence and consider\nmechanisms that only approximately satisfy these constraints, that is, satisfy\nthem up to a small portion of the inputs. The main question we raise is whether\nthe relaxation of these notions significantly alters the class of satisfying\naggregation mechanisms. The recent works for preference aggregation of Kalai,\nMossel, and Keller fit into this framework. The main result of this paper is\nthat, as in the case of preference aggregation, in the case of a subclass of a\nnatural class of aggregation problems termed `truth-functional agendas', the\nset of satisfying aggregation mechanisms does not extend non-trivially when\nrelaxing the constraints. Our proof techniques involve Boolean Fourier\ntransform and analysis of voter influences for voting protocols. The question\nwe raise for Approximate Aggregation can be stated in terms of Property\nTesting.
