Our starting point is a networked\ncoordination game where each agent's payoff is the sum of the payoffs coming\nfrom pairwise interactions with each of the neighbors. We first establish that\nthe best response dynamics in this networked game is equivalent to the linear\nthreshold dynamics with heterogeneous thresholds over the agents. While the\nprevious literature has studied such linear threshold models under the\nassumption that each agent may change actions at most once, a study of best\nresponse dynamics in such networked games necessitates an analysis that allows\nfor multiple switches in actions. In this paper, we develop such an analysis\nand construct a combinatorial framework to understand the behavior of the\nmodel. To this end, we establish that the agents behavior cycles among\ndifferent actions in the limit and provide three sets of results.\n  We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We\ndetermine the length of the limit cycles and reveal bounds on the time steps\nrequired to reach such cycles for different network structures. We then study\nthe complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context.\nSpecifically, we consider the tractability of counting the number of limit\ncycles and fixed-points, and deciding the reachability of action profiles. We\nfinally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the\ninvolved dynamics. We prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different\nnetwork structures under this measure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Nov 2012 00:35:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 01:55:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Adam", "Elie M.", ""], ["Dahleh", "Munther A.", ""], ["Ozdaglar", "Asuman", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.0877", "submitter": "Justin Hsu", "authors": "Justin Hsu and Aaron Roth and Jonathan Ullman", "title": "Differential Privacy for the Analyst via Private Equilibrium Computation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2488608.2488651", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give new mechanisms for answering exponentially many queries from multiple\nanalysts on a private database, while protecting differential privacy both for\nthe individuals in the database and for the analysts.

Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of\nirrationality (a.k.a. \"noise\") is introduced in players' behavior. In this\ncontext, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as\nopposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy\nprofiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and\nuniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time\nexponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate\nversion of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by\nAuletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e.,\nplayers do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps\n(rather than forever, as for logit equilibria).
