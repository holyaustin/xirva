We use the the\nmaxmin share paradigm introduced by Budish as a measure for fairness. Procaccia\nand Wang (EC'14) were first to investigate this fundamental problem in the\nadditive setting. In contrast to what real-world experiments suggest, they show\nthat a maxmin guarantee (1-MMS allocation) is not always possible even when the\nnumber of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation\nsolution (e.g. a $1/2$-MMS allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the\nguarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. Procaccia provide a proof for\nexistence of a $2/3$-MMS allocation and leave the question open for better\nguarantees.\n  Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the\nresult of [Procaccia and Wang] to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The\nmain idea for our $3/4$-MMS allocation method is clustering the agents. To this\nend, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching\nallocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of\nour algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques. Our analysis\ninvolves coloring and double counting arguments that might be of independent\ninterest.\n  One major shortcoming of the current studies on fair allocation is the\nadditivity assumption on the valuations. We alleviate this by extending our\nresults to the case of submodular, fractionally subadditive, and subadditive\nsettings. More precisely, we give constant approximation guarantees for\nsubmodular and XOS agents, and a logarithmic approximation for the case of\nsubadditive agents. Furthermore, we complement our results by providing close\nupper bounds for each class of valuation functions. Finally, we present\nalgorithms to find such allocations for additive, submodular, and XOS settings\nin polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 20:00:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 21:12:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 23 Jul 2017 14:44:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ghodsi", "Mohammad", ""], ["Hajiaghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Seddighin", "Masoud", ""], ["Seddighin", "Saeed", ""], ["Yami", "Hadi", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.00293", "submitter": "Martin Lackner", "authors": "Piotr Skowron, Martin Lackner, Edith Elkind, Luis\n  S\\'anchez-Fern\\'andez", "title": "Optimal Average Satisfaction and Extended Justified Representation in\n  Polynomial Time", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short note, we describe an approval-based committee selection rule\nthat admits a polynomial-time algorithm and satisfies the Extended Justified\nRepresentation (EJR) axiom.

A proposed solution\nto this problem recommends the sharing of resources between competing SCs to\nalleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise [1].

One unique feature of this framework is that it\njointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors\nduring both network formation and resource management. The multi-hop network\nformation stage is formulated as a one-to-many matching game which is solved\nusing a novel algorithm, that builds on the so-called deferred acceptance\nalgorithm and is shown to yield a stable and Pareto optimal multi-hop mmW\nbackhaul network.
