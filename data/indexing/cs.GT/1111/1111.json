A single\ncommodity, such as a resource or a task, is bought and sold by multiple buyers\nand sellers that arrive and depart over time. Our algorithm, Chain, provides\nthe first framework that allows a truthful dynamic double auction (DA) to be\nconstructed from a truthful, single-period (i.e. static) double-auction rule.\nThe pricing and matching method of the Chain construction is unique amongst\ndynamic-auction rules that adopt the same building block. We examine\nexperimentally the allocative efficiency of Chain when instantiated on various\nsingle-period rules, including the canonical McAfee double-auction rule. For a\nbaseline we also consider non-truthful double auctions populated with\nzero-intelligence plus\"-style learning agents. Chain-based auctions perform\nwell in comparison with other schemes, especially as arrival intensity falls\nand agent valuations become more volatile.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 21:50:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bredin", "J.

In our model, each link has unit\nprice and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local\ndiameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying\ngraph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: in the MAX\nversion, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the\nvertex and other vertices, and in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a\nvertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove\nthat in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding\nthe best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the\ncreated network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible\ndiameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum\nof players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we\nprove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in MAX and SUM\nversions, respectively. When each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish\nlink to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either\nversion is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version,\nsuch that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is\nOmega(sqrt(log n)). This interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result\nshows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium\ngraphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every\nequilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2^O(sqrt(log n)). Finally, we\nshow that if the budget of each player is at least k, then every equilibrium\ngraph in the SUM version is k-connected or has diameter smaller than 4.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 16:11:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jun 2012 22:20:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Ehsani", "Shayan", ""], ["Fadaee", "Saber Shokat", ""], ["Fazli", "MohammadAmin", ""], ["Mehrabian", "Abbas", ""], ["Sadeghabad", "Sina Sadeghian", ""], ["Safari", "MohammadAli", ""], ["Saghafian", "Morteza", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.0754", "submitter": "Mahan Mj", "authors": "Arnab Basu, Samik Basu, Mahan Mj", "title": "Nash Equilibria via Duality and Homological Selection", "comments": "20 pages, 4 figures.

The\nreward may depend on the last m outcomes as well as the actions of the players\nin the current round. The standard notion of regret for repeated games is no\nlonger suitable because actions and rewards can depend on the history of play.\nTo account for this generality, we introduce the notion of k-adaptive regret,\nwhich compares the reward obtained by playing actions prescribed by the\nalgorithm against a hypothetical k-adaptive adversary with the reward obtained\nby the best expert in hindsight against the same adversary. Roughly, a\nhypothetical k-adaptive adversary adapts her strategy to the defender's actions\nexactly as the real adversary would within each window of k rounds. Our\ndefinition is parametrized by a set of experts, which can include both fixed\nand adaptive defender strategies.\n  We investigate the inherent complexity of and design algorithms for adaptive\nregret minimization in bounded memory games of perfect and imperfect\ninformation.

We show\nthat these hierarchical markets do not result in a socially efficient spectrum\nallocation which is aimed by the agency, due to lack of coordination among the\nentities in different layers and the inherently selfish revenue-maximizing\nstrategy of POs. In order to reconcile these opposing objectives, we propose an\nincentive mechanism which aligns the strategy and the actions of the POs with\nthe objective of the agency, and thus leads to system performance improvement\nin terms of social welfare. This pricing-based scheme constitutes a method for\nhierarchical market regulation. A basic component of the proposed incentive\nmechanism is a novel auction scheme which enables POs to allocate their\nspectrum by balancing their derived revenue and the welfare of the SOs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2011 13:03:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Dec 2011 03:56:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 04:47:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Iosifidis", "George", ""], ["Chorppath", "Anil Kumar", ""], ["Alpcan", "Tansu", ""], ["Koutsopoulos", "Iordanis", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4504", "submitter": "Krzysztof Szajowski", "authors": "Krzysztof Szajowski", "title": "Multi-variate Quickest Detection of Significant Change Process", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": "GameSec 2011, LNCS 7037, pp. 56-66, 2011", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-25280-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT math.OC math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper deals with a mathematical model of a surveillance system based on a\nnet of sensors.

To\nimprove efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce\npricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price\n(NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback\nminus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate. The existence of\nthe Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback\nprotocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by\nadjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close\noptimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 09:52:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Lingyang", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhongshan", ""], ["Jiao", "Bingli", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7299", "submitter": "Pierre Lescanne", "authors": "Pierre Lescanne (LIP)", "title": "Les crashs sont rationnels", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As we show by using notions of equilibrium in infinite sequential games,\ncrashes or financial escalations are rational for economic or environmental\nagents, who have a vision of an infinite world.
