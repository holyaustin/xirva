Many\nnatural zero-sum games have exponentially many strategies, but highly\nstructured payoffs. For example, in the well-studied Colonel Blotto game\n(introduced by Borel in 1921), players must divide a pool of troops among a set\nof battlefields with the goal of winning (i.e., having more troops in) a\nmajority. The Colonel Blotto game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range\nof applications from the U.S presidential election, to innovative technology\ncompetitions, to advertisement, to sports. However, because of the size of the\nstrategy space, standard methods for computing equilibria of zero-sum games\nfail to be computationally feasible. Indeed, despite its importance, only a few\nsolutions for special variants of the problem are known.\n  In this paper we show how to compute equilibria of Colonel Blotto games.\n  Moreover, our approach takes the form of a general reduction: to find a Nash\nequilibrium of a zero-sum game, it suffices to design a separation oracle for\nthe strategy polytope of any bilinear game that is payoff-equivalent. We then\napply this technique to obtain the first polytime algorithms for a variety of\ngames. In addition to Colonel Blotto, we also show how to compute equilibria in\nan infinite-strategy variant called the General Lotto game; this involves\nshowing how to prune the strategy space to a finite subset before applying our\nreduction. We also consider the class of dueling games, first introduced by\nImmorlica et al. (2011). We show that our approach provably extends the class\nof dueling games for which equilibria can be computed: we introduce a new\ndueling game, the matching duel, on which prior methods fail to be\ncomputationally feasible but upon which our reduction can be applied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 03:09:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 00:00:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 14:00:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 03:36:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 05:08:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadinejad", "AmirMahdi", ""], ["Dehghani", "Sina", ""], ["Hajiaghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Lucier", "Brendan", ""], ["Mahini", "Hamid", ""], ["Seddighin", "Saeed", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00226", "submitter": "Holger Ingmar Meinhardt", "authors": "Holger Ingmar Meinhardt", "title": "Finding the Nucleoli of Large Cooperative Games: A Disproof with\n  Counter-Example", "comments": "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1509.05883", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nguyen and Thomas (2016) claimed that they have found a method to compute the\nnucleoli of games with more than $50$ players using nested linear programs\n(LP).

In particular, the first\ndifficulty is that when pointwise maximizing virtual surplus under\nmulti-dimensional feasibility (i.e., the Border feasibility), (1) neither the\noptimal interim allocation is trivially monotone in the virtual value, (2) nor\nthe virtual value is monotone in the bidder's type. As a result, the optimal\ninterim allocations resulting from virtual surplus maximization no longer\nguarantees BIC. To address (1), we prove a generalization of Border's theorem\nand show that optimal interim allocation is indeed monotone in the virtual\nvalue. To address (2), we adapt Myerson's ironing procedure to this setting by\nredefining the (ironed) virtual value as a function of the lowest utility\npoint. The second difficulty, perhaps a more challenging one, is that the\nlowest utility type in general is no longer at the endpoints of the type\ninterval. To address this difficulty, we show by construction that there exist\nan allocation rule and an induced lowest utility type such that they form a\nsolution of the virtual surplus maximization and in the meanwhile guarantees\nIIR. In the single bidder case, the optimal auction consists of a randomized\nbundle menu and a deterministic bundle menu; while in the multiple bidder case,\nthe optimal auction is a randomization between two extreme mechanisms.

This model is a refinement of Wald's MiniMax principle, which we\nshow to be too coarse for games with type ambiguity. We characterize ${\\rm\nMINthenMAX}$ as the finest refinement of the MiniMax principle that satisfies\nthree properties we claim are necessary for games with type ambiguity. This\nprior-less approach we present her also follows the common practice in computer\nscience of worst-case analysis.\n  Finally, we define and analyze the corresponding equilibrium concept assuming\nall players follow ${\\rm MINthenMAX}$. We demonstrate this equilibrium by\napplying it to two common economic scenarios: coordination games and bilateral\ntrade. We show that in both scenarios, an equilibrium in pure strategies always\nexists and we analyze the equilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 19:00:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 18:51:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nehama", "Ilan", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.02208", "submitter": "Wen Shen", "authors": "Wen Shen, Cristina V.

Our aim is to establish how\ngrouping and cooperation among users affect performance bounds. We consider two\ntypes of grouping. The first type is from \\cite{Zhang2014}, where each user\nbelongs to a group of users having social ties with it. For this type of\nutility system, each user's strategy maximizes its social group utility\nfunction, giving rise to the notion of \\emph{social-aware Nash equilibrium}. We\nprove that this social utility system yields to the bounding results of Vetta\nfor non-cooperative system, thus establishing provable performance guarantees\nfor the social-aware Nash equilibrium. For the second type of grouping, the set\nof users is partitioned into $l$ disjoint groups, where the users within a\ngroup cooperate to maximize their group utility function, giving rise to the\nnotion of \\emph{group Nash equilibrium}. In this case, each group can be viewed\nas a new user with vector-valued actions, and a 1/2 bound for the performance\nof group Nash equilibrium follows from the result of Vetta. But as we show\ntighter bounds involving curvature can be established. By defining the group\ncurvature $c_{k_i}$ associated with group $i$ with $k_i$ users, we show that if\nthe social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group\nNash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+\\max_{1\\leq i\\leq l}c_{k_i})$ of the\noptimal social utility, which is tighter than that for the case without\ngrouping. As a special case, if each user has the same action space, then we\nhave that any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+c_{k^*})$ of the\noptimal social utility, where $k^*$ is the least number of users among the $l$\ngroups. Finally, we present an example of a utility system for database\nassisted spectrum access to illustrate our results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 21:42:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:47:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Oct 2017 19:54:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yajing", ""], ["Chong", "Edwin K.

In this comment, we give a\ndetailed argument that the RSD assignment is not SD-efficient if and only if an\nex post assignment exists that is not SD-efficient. Hence RSD can be viewed as\nbeing inherently averse to SD-efficiency.

One aspect involves modelling social storage\nas an endogenous social network, where agents themselves decide with whom they\nwant to build data backup relation. The second aspect involves studying the\nstability of social storage systems, which would help reduce maintenance costs\nand further, help build efficient as well as contented networks.\n  We have a four fold contribution that covers the above two aspects. We,\nfirst, model the social storage system as a strategic network formation game.\nWe define the utility of each agent in the network under two different\nframeworks. Second, we propose the concept of bilateral stability which refines\nthe pairwise stability concept defined by Jackson et. al. 1996, by requiring\nmutual consent for both addition and deletion of links, as compared to mutual\nconsent just for link addition. Mutual consent for link deletion is especially\nimportant in the social storage setting. Third, we prove necessary and the\nsufficient conditions for bilateral stability of social storage networks. For\nsymmetric social storage networks, we prove that there exists a unique\nneighborhood size, independent of the number of agents (for all non-trivial\ncases), where no pair of agents has any incentive to increase or decrease their\nneighborhood size. We call this neighborhood size as the stability point.\nFourth, given the number of agents and other parameters, we discuss which\nbilaterally stable networks would evolve and also discuss which of these stable\nnetworks are efficient --- that is, stable networks with maximum sum of\nutilities of all agents.

It\nhas also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics\nliterature. While the simplest models assume that the agents are naive,\nreasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is\nconsiderable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated\nwith respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will\nbe present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action\nto reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are\ninstances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life.\n  Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that\nallows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a\nsophisticated agent might face. This has made it correspondingly difficult to\nmake comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the\nnotion of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent\nwork for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms -\nsophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that\nwasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem.\n  In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results\npossible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal\nplan.
