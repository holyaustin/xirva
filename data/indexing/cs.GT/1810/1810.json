This paper considers the bidder's problem of\nmaximizing the value of ads they purchase in these auctions, subject to budget\nconstraints. This 'second-price knapsack' problem presents challenges when\ndevising a bidding strategy because of the uncertain resource consumption:\nbidders win if they bid the highest amount, but pay the second-highest bid,\nunknown a priori. This is in contrast to the traditional online knapsack\nproblem, where posted prices are revealed when ads arrive, and for which there\nexists a rich literature of primal and dual algorithms.\n  The main results of this paper establish general methods for adapting these\nprimal and dual online knapsack selection algorithms to the second-price\nknapsack problem, where the prices are revealed only after bidding. In\nparticular, a methodology is provided for converting deterministic and\nrandomized knapsack selection algorithms into second-price knapsack bidding\nstrategies, that purchase ads through an equivalent set of criteria and thereby\nachieve the same competitive guarantees. This shows a connection between the\ntraditional knapsack selection algorithm and second-price auction bidding\nalgorithms, that has not previously been leveraged.\n  Empirical analysis on real ad exchange data verifies the usefulness of this\nmethod, and gives examples where it can outperform state-of-the-art techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2018 00:16:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Nov 2018 22:58:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2019 03:08:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:52:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Amar", "Jonathan", ""], ["Renegar", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10900", "submitter": "Will Ma", "authors": "Will Ma, David Simchi-Levi, Chung-Piaw Teo", "title": "On Policies for Single-leg Revenue Management with Limited Demand\n  Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the single-item revenue management problem, with no\ninformation given about the demand trajectory over time.

With Blockchains gaining traction, we can\nimplement CC in a reliable, transparent, and secure manner with smart contracts\n(SCs). The fundamental challenge in CC is free-riding. PPR, the proposal by\nZubrickas [23] of giving refund bonus to the contributors, in the case of the\nproject not getting provisioned, has attractive properties. However, as\nobserved by Chandra et al. [7], PPR faces a challenge wherein the agents defer\ntheir contribution until the deadline. We define this delaying of contributions\nas a race condition.

In this work, our goal is to identify all essential\nproperties a refund bonus scheme must satisfy in order to curb free-riding\nwhile avoiding the race condition.

Common knowledge arises naturally in a\nlarge number of decentralised cooperative multi-agent tasks, for example, when\nagents can reconstruct parts of each others' observations. Since agents an\nindependently agree on their common knowledge, they can execute complex\ncoordinated policies that condition on this knowledge in a fully decentralised\nfashion.

Higher levels in the hierarchy coordinate groups of agents by\nconditioning on their common knowledge, or delegate to lower levels with\nsmaller subgroups but potentially richer common knowledge. The entire policy\ntree can be executed in a fully decentralised fashion. As the lowest policy\ntree level consists of independent policies for each agent, MACKRL reduces to\nindependently learnt decentralised policies as a special case.
