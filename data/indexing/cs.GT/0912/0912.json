One of the most\nchallenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling\nstrategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers\nin order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this\nproblem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly\nconsidering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that\nof modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the\nintruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective\npatrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal\nframework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends\nthe previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments\nwith arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main\noriginal contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game\nfor generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic\nequilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,\nand an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is\na set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph.

In\nthis setting, frugality [Archer&Tardos'02] provides a measure to evaluate the\n\"cost of truthfulness\", that is, the overpayment of a truthful mechanism\nrelative to the \"fair\" payment. We propose a uniform scheme for designing\nfrugal truthful mechanisms for general set systems. Our scheme is based on\nscaling the agents' bids using the eigenvector of a matrix that encodes the\ninterdependencies between the agents. We demonstrate that the r-out-of-k-system\nmechanism and the \\sqrt-mechanism for buying a path in a graph [Karlin et.\nal'05] can be viewed as instantiations of our scheme. We then apply our scheme\nto two other classes of set systems, namely, vertex cover systems and k-path\nsystems, in which a customer needs to purchase k edge-disjoint source-sink\npaths. For both settings, we bound the frugality of our mechanism in terms of\nthe largest eigenvalue of the respective interdependency matrix. We show that\nour mechanism is optimal for a large subclass of vertex cover systems\nsatisfying a simple local sparsity condition. For k-path systems, while our\nmechanism is within a factor of k + 1 from optimal, we show that it is, in\nfact, optimal, when one uses a modified definition of frugality proposed in\n[Elkind et al.'07]. Our lower bound argument combines spectral techniques and\nYoung's inequality, and is applicable to all set systems. As both r-out-of-k\nsystems and single path systems can be viewed as special cases of k-path\nsystems, our result improves the lower bounds of [Karlin et al.'05] and answers\nseveral open questions proposed in that paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2009 15:44:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Apr 2010 07:14:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Ning", ""], ["Elkind", "Edith", ""], ["Gravin", "Nick", ""], ["Petrov", "Fedor", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3541", "submitter": "Sahand Haji Ali Ahmad", "authors": "Sahand Ahmad, Cem Tekin, Mingyan Liu, Jianwei Huang and Yunnan Wu", "title": "Spectrum Sharing as Network Congestion Games", "comments": "24 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to Journal of special issues\n  in communication(JSAC)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT math.IT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the first author due to incomplete\nbibliography and incorporation of multiple formats in the same file.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2009 21:59:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2009 21:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmad", "Sahand", ""], ["Tekin", "Cem", ""], ["Liu", "Mingyan", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""], ["Wu", "Yunnan", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3856", "submitter": "Vinith Reddy Podduturi", "authors": "Vinith Reddy, Younghoon Kim, Srinivas Shakkottai, A.L.

An\ninfinite game is defined as a play consisting of a fixed number of players\nwhose sequence of moves is repeated, or iterated ad infinitum. Each sequence\ncorresponds to a single iteration of the play, where there are an infinite\namount of iterations. There are two distinct concepts within this broad\ndefinition which encompass all infinite games: the strong infinite game and the\nweak infinite game. Both differ in terms of imputations. The strong infinite\ngame has a uniqueness qualification in that all moves must differ to the extent\nthat no imputation (these occur at the end of any given iteration) may ever be\nthe same. Conversely, there is no such qualification in a weak infinite game,\nany payout may equal another.\n  Another property shared by strong and weak infinite games (apart from their\nfulfilling the criterion of an infinite game) is the fact that both consist of\na countably infinite amount of moves. Therefore all infinite games have a\ncountably infinite number of turns; the set of all infinite games is composed\nof each strong and weak infinite game. This result has a very important\nconsequence: the ordinality of turns. That is, the moves of an infinite game\nhave an order or structure which they adhere to. It is this structure which\nprovides any future development or game theoretical analysis of these sorts of\ngames with the necessary foundation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 20:01:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2010 23:40:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Meyer", "Thomas Kellam", ""]]}]
