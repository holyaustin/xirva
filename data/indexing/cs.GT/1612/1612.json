The EVs can inject energies by discharging via a\nVehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service which can enhance the profits of the charging\nstation. However, frequent charging and discharging degrade battery life. A\nproper compensation needs to be paid to the users to participate in the V2G\nservice. We propose a menu-based pricing scheme, where the charging station\nselects a price for each arriving user for the amount of battery utilization,\nthe total energy, and the time (deadline) that the EV will stay. The user can\naccept one of the contracts or rejects all depending on their utilities. The\ncharging station can serve users using a combination of the renewable energy\nand the conventional energy bought from the grid. We show that though there\nexists a profit maximizing price which maximizes the social welfare, it\nprovides no surplus to the users if the charging station is aware of the\nutilities of the users. If the charging station is not aware of the exact\nutilities, the social welfare maximizing price may not maximize the expected\nprofit. In fact, it can give a zero profit. We propose a pricing strategy which\nprovides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and it also\nmaximizes the expected profit for a wide range of utility functions. Our\nanalysis shows that when the harvested renewable energy is small the users have\nhigher incentives for the V2G service. We, numerically, show that the charging\nstation's profit and the user's surplus both increase as V2G service is\nefficiently utilized by the pricing mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 01:38:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Arnob", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00179", "submitter": "Mohammad Hajiesmaili", "authors": "Lin Yang, Mohammad H.

In this paper,\nwe provide the first polynomial-size LP formulation of the optimal strategies\nfor the Colonel Blotto game. We use linear extension techniques. Roughly\nspeaking, we project the strategy space polytope to a higher dimensional space,\nwhich results in a lower number of facets for the polytope. We use this\npolynomial-size LP to provide a novel, simpler and significantly faster\nalgorithm for finding the optimal strategies for the Colonel Blotto game. We\nfurther show this representation is asymptotically tight in terms of the number\nof constraints. We also extend our approach to multi-dimensional Colonel Blotto\ngames, and implement our algorithm to observe interesting properties of Colonel\nBlotto; for example, we observe the behavior of players in the discrete model\nis very similar to the previously studied continuous model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2016 04:58:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Dec 2016 06:38:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Behnezhad", "Soheil", ""], ["Dehghani", "Sina", ""], ["Derakhshan", "Mahsa", ""], ["HajiAghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Seddighin", "Saeed", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.04217", "submitter": "Cristina Perfecto", "authors": "Cristina Perfecto, Javier Del Ser, Mehdi Bennis", "title": "Millimeter Wave V2V Communications: Distributed Association and Beam\n  Alignment", "comments": "Accepted May 24, 2017 by IEEE Journal on Selected Areas of\n  Communication (JSAC) SI on Millimeter Wave Communications for Future Mobile\n  Networks. 14 pages. 6 Figures, 3 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2017.2719998", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.GT cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently millimeter-wave bands have been postulated as a means to accommodate\nthe foreseen extreme bandwidth demands in vehicular communications, which\nresult from the dissemination of sensory data to nearby vehicles for enhanced\nenvironmental awareness and improved safety level.

Each subtask carries a reward, given to the first agent who\npublicly shares its solution.

Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and\nsynchronous process, although distributed and asynchronous variants have been\nstudied since the 1980s. Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of\ngradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on\nconvex functions $F:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ of the form $F(x) = f(x)\n+ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\Psi_k(x_k)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nsmooth convex function, and each $\\Psi_k:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nunivariate and possibly non-smooth convex function. Such functions occur in\nmany data analysis and machine learning problems.\n  We give new analyses of cyclic coordinate descent, a parallel asynchronous\nstochastic coordinate descent, and a rather general worst-case parallel\nasynchronous coordinate descent. For all of these, we either obtain sharply\nimproved bounds, or provide the first analyses. Our analyses all use a common\namortized framework. The application of this framework to the asynchronous\nstochastic version requires some new ideas, for it is not obvious how to ensure\na uniform distribution where it is needed in the face of asynchronous actions\nthat may undo uniformity. We believe that our approach may well be applicable\nto the analysis of other iterative asynchronous stochastic processes.\n  We extend the framework to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement,\na fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory,\nconverges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or\nLeontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 15:27:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Cheung", "Yun Kuen", ""], ["Cole", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09523", "submitter": "Yue Zhao", "authors": "Hossein Khazaei and Yue Zhao", "title": "Ex-post Stable and Fair Payoff Allocation for Renewable Energy\n  Aggregation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Aggregating statistically diverse renewable power producers (RPPs) is an\neffective way to reduce the uncertainty of the RPPs.
