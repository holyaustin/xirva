In the past few years, there has been significant\nresearch on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser's interaction\nwith the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this\nranking order has remained standard.\n  From a search engine's perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the\nbest assignment of advertisers to slots? Here \"best\" could mean \"maximizing\nuser satisfaction,\" \"most efficient,\" \"revenue-maximizing,\" \"simplest to\ninteract with,\" or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to\nunderstand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed\nads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its\nvalue. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on\nan ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.\n  We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption.\nWe then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under\nthis model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP. A truthful\nauction then follows from an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)\nmechanism. Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable\nproperties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive. At the technical core of our\nresult are a number of insights about the structure of the optimal assignment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2008 18:05:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Gagan", ""], ["Feldman", "Jon", ""], ["Muthukrishnan", "S.", ""], ["Pal", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0963", "submitter": "Panayotis Mertikopoulos", "authors": "Panayotis Mertikopoulos and Aris L.
