For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of\ntheoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games\nby proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally\ndefine \\emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids\niteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that\nremoving iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a\nsmall poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the\nworst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield\nstrategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a\nnew modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more\nefficient and may be used to generate stronger strategies than previously\npossible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent\nthat was built using CFR and a novel game decomposition method. Our new agent\nwins the three-player events of the 2012 ACPC and defeats the winning\nthree-player programs from previous competitions while requiring less resources\nto generate than the 2011 winner. Finally, we show that our CFR modification\ncomputes a strategy of equal quality to our new agent in a quarter of the time\nof standard CFR using half the memory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:54:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gibson", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0085", "submitter": "Renato Paes Leme", "authors": "Michal Feldman and David Kempe and Brendan Lucier and Renato Paes Leme", "title": "Pricing Public Goods for Private Sale", "comments": "accepted to EC'13", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the pricing problem faced by a seller who assigns a price to a\ngood that confers its benefits not only to its buyers, but also to other\nindividuals around them. For example, a snow-blower is potentially useful not\nonly to the household that buys it, but also to others on the same street.\nGiven that the seller is constrained to selling such a (locally) public good\nvia individual private sales, how should he set his prices given the\ndistribution of values held by the agents?\n  We study this problem as a two-stage game. In the first stage, the seller\nchooses and announces a price for the product. In the second stage, the agents\n(each having a private value for the good) decide simultaneously whether or not\nthey will buy the product. In the resulting game, which can exhibit a\nmultiplicity of equilibria, agents must strategize about whether they will\nthemselves purchase the good to receive its benefits.\n  In the case of a fully public good (where all agents benefit whenever any\nagent purchases), we describe a pricing mechanism that is approximately\nrevenue-optimal (up to a constant factor) when values are drawn from a regular\ndistribution. We then study settings in which the good is only \"locally\"\npublic: agents are arranged in a network and share benefits only with their\nneighbors.

First, we describe a general framework,\nwhere we consider the class of 2.5-player games with almost-sure parity winning\nconditions on possibly infinite game graphs, assuming that the game contains a\nfinite attractor. An attractor is a set of states (not necessarily absorbing)\nthat is almost surely re-visited regardless of the players' decisions. We\npresent a scheme that characterizes the set of winning states for each player.\nThen, we instantiate this scheme to obtain an algorithm for stochastic game\nlossy channel systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2013 18:43:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Jun 2013 10:17:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Abdulla", "Parosh Aziz", ""], ["Clemente", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Mayr", "Richard", ""], ["Sandberg", "Sven", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.5399", "submitter": "Gilles Stoltz", "authors": "Shie Mannor (EE-Technion), Vianney Perchet (LPMA), Gilles Stoltz\n  (INRIA Paris - Rocquencourt, DMA, GREGH)", "title": "A Primal Condition for Approachability with Partial Monitoring", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In approachability with full monitoring there are two types of conditions\nthat are known to be equivalent for convex sets: a primal and a dual condition.\nThe primal one is of the form: a set C is approachable if and only all\ncontaining half-spaces are approachable in the one-shot game; while the dual\none is of the form: a convex set C is approachable if and only if it intersects\nall payoff sets of a certain form.

We study the\nproblem of automatically allocating the user traffic of a group-buying website\nto different deals to maximize the total revenue and refer to it as the\nGroup-buying Allocation Problem (\\GAP). The key challenge of \\GAP\\ is how to\nhandle the tipping point (lower bound) and the purchase limit (upper bound) of\neach deal. We formulate \\GAP\\ as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized\nitems and majorization constraints. Our main results for \\GAP\\ can be\nsummarized as follows. (1) We first show that for a special case of \\GAP, in\nwhich the lower bound equals the upper bound for each deal, there is a simple\ndynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in\npseudo-polynomial time. (2) The general case of \\GAP\\ is much more difficult\nthan the special case. To solve the problem, we first discover several\nstructural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer\ndynamic programming-based algorithm leveraging those properties. This algorithm\ncan find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial time. (3) We convert the\ntwo-layer dynamic programming based algorithm to a fully polynomial time\napproximation scheme (FPTAS), using the technique developed in\n\\cite{ibarra1975fast}, combined with some careful modifications of the dynamic\nprograms.

This has\ngenerated a significant interest in the deployment of incentive mechanisms to\nreduce peak-time congestion. Typically, the design of these mechanisms requires\ninformation about user demand and sensitivity to prices. Such information is\nnaturally imperfect. In this paper, we propose a \\emph{fixed-budget rebate\nmechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentage\ncontribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, we\nalso study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed reward\nper unit reduction of his peak-time demand. To evaluate the two mechanisms, we\nintroduce a game-theoretic model that captures the \\emph{public good} nature of\ndecongestion. For each mechanism, we demonstrate that the socially optimal\nlevel of decongestion is achievable for a specific choice of the mechanism's\nparameter. We then investigate how imperfect information about user demand\naffects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budget\nrebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is\n\"sufficiently\" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism is\nattractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loop\nproperty, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 22:54:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Loiseau", "Patrick", ""], ["Schwartz", "Galina", ""], ["Musacchio", "John", ""], ["Amin", "Saurabh", ""], ["Sastry", "S.
