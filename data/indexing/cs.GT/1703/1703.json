Specifically, we show that when the valuations of the\nagents are nonnegative, monotone, and submodular, then a 0.21-approximate\nmaximin fair allocation is guaranteed to exist. In fact, we show that such an\nallocation can be efficiently found by using a simple round-robin algorithm.

A\nunique feature of this experiment is that the bidders in this market are real\nestate agents that bid on their own behalf, not using third-party\nintermediaries. To help bidders, Zillow also provided a recommendation tool\nthat suggested a bid for each bidder.\n  Our main focus in this paper is on the decisions of bidders whether or not to\nadopt the platform-provided bid recommendation. We observe that a significant\nproportion of bidders do not use the recommended bid. Using the bid history of\nthe agents we infer their value, and compare the agents' regret with their\nactual bidding history with results they would have obtained following the\nrecommendation. We find that for half of the agents not following the\nrecommendation, the increased effort of experimenting with alternate bids\nresults in increased regret, i.e., they get decreased net value out of the\nsystem. The proportion of agents not following the recommendation slowly\ndeclines as markets mature, but it remains large in most markets that we\nobserve. We argue that the main reason for this phenomenon is the lack of trust\nin the platform-provided tool.\n  Our work provides an empirical insight into possible design choices for\nauction-based online advertising platforms. While search advertising platforms\n(such as Google or Bing) allow bidders to submit bids on their own, many\ndisplay advertising platforms (such as Facebook) optimize bids on bidders'\nbehalf and eliminate the need for bids. Our empirical analysis shows that the\nlatter approach is preferred for markets where bidders are individuals, who\ndon't have access to third party tools, and who may question the fairness of\nplatform-provided suggestions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 20:57:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Jalaly", "Pooya", ""], ["Nekipelov", "Denis", ""], ["Tardos", "Eva", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10678", "submitter": "Jos Uiterwijk", "authors": "Jos Uiterwijk", "title": "Set Matching: An Enhancement of the Hales-Jewett Pairing Strategy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When solving k-in-a-Row games, the Hales-Jewett pairing strategy [4] is a\nwell-known strategy to prove that specific positions are (at most) a draw.

A matching set consists of a set of nodes (the markers), a\nset of possible winning lines (the groups), and a coverage set indicating how\nall groups are covered after every first initial move. This strategy needs less\nthan two markers per group. As such it is able to prove positions in k-in-a-Row\ngames to be draws, which cannot be proven using the Hales-Jewett pairing\nstrategy.

The budget feasible\nmechanism design problem aims to design a mechanism which incentivizes the\nsellers to truthfully report their cost, and maximizes the buyer's value while\nguaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget\nfeasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in\nrecruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her.\n  This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in\n2010. There have been a number of improvements on the approximation guarantee\nof such mechanisms since then. We consider the general case where the buyer's\nvaluation is a monotone submodular function. We offer two general frameworks\nfor simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly\nimprove on the best known results for this problem, while also simplifying the\nanalysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general\nmonotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets\n(where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More\ngenerally, given an $r$ approximation algorithm for the optimization problem\n(ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a $r+1$ approximation mechanism for\nlarge markets, an improvement from $2r^2$.
