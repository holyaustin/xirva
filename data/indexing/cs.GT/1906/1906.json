Leaving\nagents to selfishly optimize comes with the risk of ending up in sub-optimal\nstates (in terms of performance and/or costs), compared to a centralized system\ndesign. However, the PoA relies on strong assumptions about agents' rationality\n(e.g., resources and information) and interactions, whereas in many distributed\nsystems agents interact locally with bounded resources. They do so repeatedly\nover time (in contrast to \"one-shot games\"), and their strategies may evolve.\nUsing a more realistic evolutionary game model, this paper introduces a\nrealized evolutionary Price of Anarchy (ePoA). The ePoA allows an exploration\nof equilibrium selection in dynamic distributed systems with multiple\nequilibria, based on local interactions of simple memoryless agents.\nConsidering a fundamental game related to virus propagation on networks, we\npresent analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies and for\ndifferent strategy update dynamics. In particular, deriving stationary\ndistributions of the stochastic evolutionary process, we find that the Nash\nequilibria are not always the most abundant states, and that different\nprocesses can feature significant off-equilibrium behavior, leading to a\nsignificantly higher ePoA compared to the PoA studied traditionally in the\nliterature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 22:39:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Schmid", "Laura", ""], ["Schmid", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.00182", "submitter": "Jie Zhang", "authors": "Yansong Gao and Jie Zhang", "title": "Average-case Analysis of the Assignment Problem with Independent\n  Preferences", "comments": "To appear in IJCAI 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fundamental assignment problem is in search of welfare maximization\nmechanisms to allocate items to agents when the private preferences over\nindivisible items are provided by self-interested agents.

For\nsingle buyer case these mechanisms are quite simple: there are two stages. For\neach item $j$, we create a separate permit that allows the buyer to purchase\nthe item in the second stage. In the first stage, we sell the permits without\nrevealing any information about the costs. In the second stage, the seller\nreveals all the costs, and the buyer can buy item $j$ by paying the item price\nif the buyer has purchased the permit for item $j$ in the first stage. We show\nthat either selling the permits separately or as a grand bundle suffices to\nachieve the constant factor approximation to the optimal profit (6 for\nadditive, and 11 for constrained additive). For multiple buyers, we sell the\npermits sequentially and obtain the constant factor approximation.

A second issue\nis that while EFGs have recently seen significant algorithmic progress, their\nclassical formalization is unsuitable for efficient presentation of the\nunderlying ideas, such as those around decomposition.\n  To solve the first issue, we introduce factored-observation stochastic games\n(FOSGs), a minor modification of the POSG formalism which distinguishes between\nprivate and public observation and thereby greatly simplifies decomposition. To\nremedy the second issue, we show that FOSGs and POSGs are naturally connected\nto EFGs: by \"unrolling\" a FOSG into its tree form, we obtain an EFG.\nConversely, any perfect-recall timeable EFG corresponds to some underlying FOSG\nin this manner. Moreover, this relationship justifies several minor\nmodifications to the classical EFG formalization that recently appeared as an\nimplicit response to the model's issues with decomposition. Finally, we\nillustrate the transfer of ideas between EFGs and MARL by presenting three key\nEFG techniques -- counterfactual regret minimization, sequence form, and\ndecomposition -- in the FOSG framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2019 14:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 10:50:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 12:20:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kova\u0159\u00edk", "Vojt\u011bch", ""], ["Schmid", "Martin", ""], ["Burch", "Neil", ""], ["Bowling", "Michael", ""], ["Lis\u00fd", "Viliam", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11372", "submitter": "Carlos Barreto", "authors": "Carlos Barreto, Eduardo Mojica-Nava, Nicanor Quijano", "title": "Incentive Mechanisms to Prevent Efficiency Loss of Non-Profit Utilities", "comments": "17 pages, 3 figures, accepted in the International Journal of\n  Electrical Power and Energy Systems", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, Volume\n  110, 2019, Pages 523-535, ISSN 0142-0615", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijepes.2019.03.018", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The modernization of the power system introduces technologies that may\nimprove the system's efficiency by enhancing the capabilities of users.
