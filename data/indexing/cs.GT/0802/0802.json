We focus on Hanson's popular logarithmic\nmarket scoring rule market maker (LMSR). Our goal is to implicitly maintain\ncorrect LMSR prices across an exponentially large outcome space. We examine\nboth permutation combinatorics, where outcomes are permutations of objects, and\nBoolean combinatorics, where outcomes are combinations of binary events. We\nlook at three restrictive languages that limit what traders can bet on. Even\nwith severely limited languages, we find that LMSR pricing is $\\SP$-hard, even\nwhen the same language admits polynomial-time matching without the market\nmaker. We then propose an approximation technique for pricing permutation\nmarkets based on a recent algorithm for online permutation learning. The\nconnections we draw between LMSR pricing and the vast literature on online\nlearning with expert advice may be of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2008 00:23:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yiling", ""], ["Fortnow", "Lance", ""], ["Lambert", "Nicolas", ""], ["Pennock", "David M.", ""], ["Wortman", "Jennifer", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1604", "submitter": "Constantinos Daskalakis", "authors": "Constantinos Daskalakis, Grant Schoenebeck, Gregory Valiant, Paul\n  Valiant", "title": "On the Complexity of Nash Equilibria of Action-Graph Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of computing Nash Equilibria of action-graph games\n(AGGs). AGGs, introduced by Bhat and Leyton-Brown, is a succinct representation\nof games that encapsulates both \"local\" dependencies as in graphical games, and\npartial indifference to other agents' identities as in anonymous games, which\noccur in many natural settings. This is achieved by specifying a graph on the\nset of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends\nonly on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the\naction graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing\nmixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of\nagent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness\nresults for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is\nunconstrained. In particular, we show that even if the action graph is a tree,\nbut the number of agent-types is unconstrained, it is NP-complete to decide the\nexistence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a\nmixed Nash equilibrium (even an approximate one); similarly for symmetric AGGs\n(all agents belong to a single type), if we allow arbitrary treewidth. These\nhardness results suggest that, in some sense, our PTAS is as strong of a\npositive result as one can expect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2008 09:45:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Daskalakis", "Constantinos", ""], ["Schoenebeck", "Grant", ""], ["Valiant", "Gregory", ""], ["Valiant", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1957", "submitter": "Sudhir Singh", "authors": "Sudhir Kumar Singh, Vwani P.

Starting\nwith a very natural setting for strategies available to the advertisers, and\nvia a careful look through the algorithmic lens, we first propose solution\nconcepts for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as\nthey try to optimize their budget allocation across various keywords. Next, we\nconsider two broad match scenarios based on factors such as information\nasymmetry between advertisers and the auctioneer, and the extent of\nauctioneer's control on the budget splitting. In the first scenario, the\nadvertisers have the full information about broad match and relevant\nparameters, and can reapportion their own budgets to utilize the extra\ninformation; in particular, the auctioneer has no direct control over budget\nsplitting. We show that, the same broad match may lead to different equilibria,\none leading to a revenue improvement, whereas another to a revenue loss. This\nleaves the auctioneer in a dilemma - whether to broad-match or not. This\nmotivates us to consider another broad match scenario, where the advertisers\nhave information only about the current scenario, and the allocation of the\nbudgets unspent in the current scenario is in the control of the auctioneer. We\nobserve that the auctioneer can always improve his revenue by judiciously using\nbroad match. Thus, information seems to be a double-edged sword for the\nauctioneer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Feb 2008 03:45:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2008 19:40:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sudhir Kumar", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Vwani P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.2159", "submitter": "Walid Saad", "authors": "Walid Saad, Zhu Han, Merouane Debbah and Are Hj{\\o}rungnes", "title": "A Distributed Merge and Split Algorithm for Fair Cooperation in Wireless\n  Networks", "comments": "This paper is accepted for publication at the IEEE ICC Workshop on\n  Cooperative Communications and Networking", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCW.2008.65", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a novel concept from coalitional game theory which\nallows the dynamic formation of coalitions among wireless nodes.
