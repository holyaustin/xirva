Whereas convergence is often\na property of learning algorithms in games satisfying a particular reward\nstructure (e.g. zero-sum), it is well known, that for general payoffs even\nbasic learning models, such as the replicator dynamics, are not guaranteed to\nconverge. Worse yet, chaotic behavior is possible even in rather simple games,\nsuch as variants of Rock-Paper-Scissors games (Sato et al., 2002). Although\nchaotic behavior in learning dynamics can be precluded by the celebrated\nPoincar\\'e-Bendixson theorem, it is only applicable to low-dimensional\nsettings. Are there other characteristics of a game, which can force regularity\nin the limit sets of learning?\n  In this paper, we show that behaviors consistent with the\nPoincar\\'e-Bendixson theorem (limit cycles, but no chaotic attractor) follows\npurely based on the topological structure of the interaction graph, even for\nhigh-dimensional settings with arbitrary number of players and arbitrary payoff\nmatrices. We prove our result for a wide class of follow-the-regularized leader\n(FoReL) dynamics, which generalize replicator dynamics, for games where each\nplayer has two strategies at disposal, and for interaction graphs where payoffs\nof each agent are only affected by one other agent (i.e. interaction graphs of\nindegree one). Since chaos has been observed in a game with only two players\nand three strategies, this class of non-chaotic games is in a sense maximal.\nMoreover, we provide simple conditions under which such behavior translates to\nsocial welfare guarantees, implying that FoReL learning achieves time average\nsocial welfare which is at least as good as that of a Nash equilibrium; and\nconnecting the topology of the dynamics to the Price of Anarchy analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:32:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Czechowski", "Aleksander", ""], ["Piliouras", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.00167", "submitter": "Peter Biro Dr.", "authors": "P\\'eter Bir\\'o and Flip Klijn and Xenia Klimentova and Ana Viana", "title": "Shapley-Scarf Housing Markets: Respecting Improvement, Integer\n  Programming, and Kidney Exchange", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.TH cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In a housing market of Shapley and Scarf, each agent is endowed with one\nindivisible object and has preferences over all objects.

In each round, each bird\nreceives a noisy measurement of the average direction of others in the group,\nand consequently updates its orientation.

This study proposes an\nincentive-based decentralized routing strategy to nudge the network performance\ncloser to the system optimum for the context where all vehicles are connected\nand autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The strategy consists of three stages. The\nfirst stage incorporates a decentralized local route switching dynamical system\nto approximate the system optimal route flow in a local area based on vehicles'\nknowledge of local traffic information. The second stage optimizes the route\nfor each CAV by considering individual heterogeneity in traveler preferences\n(e.g., the value of time) to maximize the utilities of all travelers in the\nlocal area. Constraints are also incorporated to ensure that these routes can\nachieve the approximated local system optimal flow of the first stage. The\nthird stage leverages an expected envy-free incentive mechanism to ensure that\ntravelers in the local area can accept the optimal routes determined in the\nsecond stage. The study analytically discusses the convergence of the local\nroute switching dynamical system. We also show that the proposed incentive\nmechanism is expected individual rational and budget-balanced, which ensures\nthat travelers are willing to participate and guarantee the balance between\npayments and compensations, respectively. Further, the conditions for the\nexpected incentive compatibility of the incentive mechanism are analyzed and\nproved, ensuring behavioral honesty in disclosing information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2021 14:44:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Chaojie", ""], ["Peeta", "Srinivas", ""], ["Wang", "Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.01071", "submitter": "Pramod Mane", "authors": "Pramod C.

A proof's validity can thus become a subjective\nmatter and lead to a debate, which may be difficult to settle. Hence, while the\nconcept of valid proof is well-defined, the process to establish validity is\nitself a complex multi-agent problem.\n  We introduce the SPRIG protocol. SPRIG allows agents to propose and verify\nsuccinct and informative proofs in a decentralized fashion; the trust is\nestablished by agents being able to request more details in the proof steps;\ndebates, if they arise, must isolate details of proofs and, if they persist, go\ndown to machine-level details, where they are automatically settled. A\nstructure of bounties and stakes is set to incentivize agents to act in good\nfaith.\n  We propose a game-theoretic discussion of SPRIG, showing how agents with\nvarious types of information interact, leading to a proof tree with an\nappropriate level of detail and to the invalidation of wrong proofs, and we\ndiscuss resilience against various attacks. We then analyze a simplified model,\ncharacterize its equilibria and compute the agents' level of trust.\n  SPRIG is designed to run as a smart contract on a blockchain platform.

Many cities use participatory\nbudgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts\nproportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over\nlocal projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by\nits voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor\nsocial welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across\nmultiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global\nsocial welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A\nsocial-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred\nby a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.\nThus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory\nbudgeting setting with a single city-wide election.

Our contributions in this article are two-fold, conceptual\nand computational. We first resolve the open question posed by Ito et al.\n[AAMAS 2019] about the computational complexity of the problem when the input\ngraph is a path. Next, we propose a generalization of their model, where the\ninput consists of a graph on $n$ vertices representing the set of voters, a set\nof $m$ candidates $\\mathcal{C}$, a weight function $w_v: \\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow\n{\\mathbb Z}^+$ for each voter $v\\in V(G)$ representing the preference of the\nvoter over the candidates, a distinguished candidate $p\\in \\mathcal{C}$, and a\npositive integer $k$. The objective is to decide if one can partition the\nvertex set into $k$ pairwise disjoint connected sets (districts) s.t $p$ wins\nmore districts than any other candidate. The problem is known to be NPC even if\n$k=2$, $m=2$, and $G$ is either a complete bipartite graph (in fact $K_{2,n}$)\nor a complete graph. This means that in search for FPT algorithms we need to\neither focus on the parameter $n$, or subclasses of forest. Circumventing these\nintractable results, we give a deterministic and a randomized algorithms for\nthe problem on paths running in times $2.619^{k}(n+m)^{O(1)}$ and\n$2^{k}(n+m)^{O(1)}$, respectively. Additionally, we prove that the problem on\ngeneral graphs is solvable in time $2^n (n+m)^{O(1)}$.

We consider three representative\ntwo-player general-sum games: bandit games, bandit-reinforcement learning\n(bandit-RL) games, and linear bandit games. In all these games, we identify a\nfundamental gap between the exact value of the Stackelberg equilibrium and its\nestimated version using finitely many noisy samples, which can not be closed\ninformation-theoretically regardless of the algorithm. We then establish sharp\npositive results on sample-efficient learning of Stackelberg equilibrium with\nvalue optimal up to the gap identified above, with matching lower bounds in the\ndependency on the gap, error tolerance, and the size of the action spaces.\nOverall, our results unveil unique challenges in learning Stackelberg\nequilibria under noisy bandit feedback, which we hope could shed light on\nfuture research on this topic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 05:11:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2021 03:48:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Yu", ""], ["Jin", "Chi", ""], ["Wang", "Huan", ""], ["Xiong", "Caiming", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11686", "submitter": "Estelle Varloot", "authors": "Andrew Jennings, Rida Laraki, Clemens Puppe and Estelle Varloot", "title": "New Characterizations of Strategy-Proofness under Single-Peakedness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT econ.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide novel simple representations of strategy-proof voting rules when\nvoters have uni-dimensional single-peaked preferences (as well as\nmulti-dimensional separable preferences).

We evaluate the\neffectiveness of low-degree Proposer assignment considering networks with\ndifferent average connectivity, group sizes, and group voting rules when\naccepting proposals (e.g. majority or unanimity). We further show that\nlow-degree Proposer assignment is efficient, not only optimizing fairness, but\nalso the average payoff level in the population. Finally, we show that stricter\nvoting rules (i.e., imposing an accepting consensus as requirement for\ncollectives to accept a proposal) attenuates the unfairness that results from\nsituations where high-degree nodes (hubs) are the natural candidates to play as\nProposers. Our results suggest new routes to use role assignment and voting\nmechanisms to prevent unfair behaviors from spreading on complex networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:08:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Teixeira", "Andreia Sofia", ""], ["Santos", "Francisco C.", ""], ["Francisco", "Alexandre P.", ""], ["Santos", "Fernando P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13642", "submitter": "Matthias Bentert", "authors": "Matthias Bentert, Robert Bredereck, P\\'eter Gy\\\"orgyi, Andrzej\n  Kaczmarczyk, Rolf Niedermeier", "title": "A Multivariate Complexity Analysis of the Material Consumption\n  Scheduling Problem", "comments": "Accepted for publication in The Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on\n  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-21)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The NP-hard MATERIAL CONSUMPTION SCHEDULING Problem and closely related\nproblems have been thoroughly studied since the 1980's. Roughly speaking, the\nproblem deals with minimizing the makespan when scheduling jobs that consume\nnon-renewable resources. We focus on the single-machine case without\npreemption: from time to time, the resources of the machine are (partially)\nreplenished, thus allowing for meeting a necessary pre-condition for processing\nfurther jobs, each of which having individual resource demands. We initiate a\nsystematic exploration of the parameterized (exact) complexity landscape of the\nproblem, providing parameterized tractability as well as intractability\nresults. Doing so, we mainly investigate how parameters related to the resource\nsupplies influence the computational solvability. Thereby, we get a deepened\nunderstanding of the algorithmic complexity of this fundamental scheduling\nproblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 18:40:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Mar 2021 18:15:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bentert", "Matthias", ""], ["Bredereck", "Robert", ""], ["Gy\u00f6rgyi", "P\u00e9ter", ""], ["Kaczmarczyk", "Andrzej", ""], ["Niedermeier", "Rolf", ""]]}]
