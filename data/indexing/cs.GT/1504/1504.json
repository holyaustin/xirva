The buyer\nearns the profit by reselling these units in an external consumer market. The\npaper looks at three scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we look at unit\ncapacity sellers where per unit valuation is private information of each seller\nand the revenue curve is concave. For this setting, we define two benchmarks.\nWe show that no randomized prior free auction can be constant competitive\nagainst any of these two benchmarks. However, for a lightly constrained\nbenchmark we design a prior-free auction PEPA (Profit Extracting Procurement\nAuction) which is 4-competitive and we show this bound is tight. Second, we\nstudy a setting where the sellers have non-unit capacities that are common\nknowledge and derive similar results. In particular, we propose a prior free\nauction PEPAC (Profit Extracting Procurement Auction with Capacity) which is\ntruthful for any concave revenue curve. Third, we obtain results in the\ninherently harder bi-dimensional case where per unit valuation as well as\ncapacities are private information of the sellers. We show that PEPAC is\ntruthful and constant competitive for the specific case of linear revenue\ncurves. We believe that this paper represents the first set of results on\nsingle dimensional and bi-dimensional profit maximizing prior-free multi-unit\nprocurement auctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 16:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ray", "Arupratan", ""], ["Mandal", "Debmalya", ""], ["Narahari", "Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01033", "submitter": "Zhiwei Steven Wu", "authors": "Aaron Roth, Jonathan Ullman, Zhiwei Steven Wu", "title": "Watch and Learn: Optimizing from Revealed Preferences Feedback", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.GT cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Stackelberg game is played between a leader and a follower.

The producer chooses the prices of the goods he\nproduces, and then a consumer chooses to buy a utility maximizing bundle of\ngoods. The goal of the seller here is to set prices to maximize his\nprofit---his revenue, minus the production cost of the purchased bundle. It is\nquite natural that the seller in this example should not know the buyer's\nutility function. However, he does have access to revealed preference\nfeedback---he can set prices, and then observe the purchased bundle and his own\nprofit. We give algorithms for efficiently solving, in terms of both\ncomputational and query complexity, a broad class of Stackelberg games in which\nthe follower's utility function is unknown, using only \"revealed preference\"\naccess to it.

For the partial-observation case, the problem that asks if\nthe first player has an observation-based winning strategy that enforces a\ngiven threshold on the mean-payoff, is undecidable. In this paper, we study the\nwindow mean-payoff objectives that were introduced recently as an alternative\nto the classical mean-payoff objectives. We show that, in sharp contrast to the\nclassical mean-payoff objectives, some of the window mean-payoff objectives are\ndecidable in games with partial-observation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Apr 2015 09:25:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hunter", "Paul", ""], ["P\u00e9rez", "Guillermo A.", ""], ["Raskin", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.03257", "submitter": "Nick Arnosti", "authors": "Nick Arnosti, Nicole Immorlica, Brendan Lucier", "title": "The (Non)-Existence of Stable Mechanisms in Incomplete Information\n  Environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider two-sided matching markets, and study the incentives of agents to\ncircumvent a centralized clearing house by signing binding contracts with one\nanother.

In this paper, we focus\non \"greening\" demand response in multi-tenant data centers, i.e., colocation\ndata centers, by designing a pricing mechanism through which the data center\noperator can efficiently extract load reductions from tenants during emergency\nperiods to fulfill energy reduction requirement for EDR. In particular, we\npropose a pricing mechanism for both mandatory and voluntary EDR programs,\nColoEDR, that is based on parameterized supply function bidding and provides\nprovably near-optimal efficiency guarantees, both when tenants are price-taking\nand when they are price-anticipating. In addition to analytic results, we\nextend the literature on supply function mechanism design, and evaluate ColoEDR\nusing trace-based simulation studies. These validate the efficiency analysis\nand conclude that the pricing mechanism is both beneficial to the environment\nand to the data center operator (by decreasing the need for backup diesel\ngeneration), while also aiding tenants (by providing payments for load\nreductions).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 23:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Niangjun", ""], ["Ren", "Xiaoqi", ""], ["Ren", "Shaolei", ""], ["Wierman", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.07342", "submitter": "Jiandong Zhu", "authors": "Xinyun Liu, Jiandong Zhu", "title": "On Potential Equations of Finite Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, some new criteria for detecting whether a finite game is\npotential are proposed by solving potential equations.
