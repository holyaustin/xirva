Problems such as\nwhen quantum advantage exists, and if existing, how much it could be, are at a\ncentral position of these studies. In a broad class of scenarios, there are,\nimplicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved, who share a state, and\nthe correlation in this shared state is the key factor to the efficiency under\nconcern. In these scenarios, the shared \\emph{entanglement} or \\emph{discord}\nis usually what accounts for quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a\nfundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a\nbranch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more\nplayers. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the chance for any player\nto win the game depends only on the ending correlation. We show that in a\ncertain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can further\nincrease her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever first uses a\nquantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The\nequilibrium is fair to both players and, as a shared correlation, it does not\ncontain any discord, yet a quantum advantage still exists. This indicates that\nat least in game theory, the previous notion of discord as a measure of\nnon-classical correlation needs to be reexamined, when there are two players\nwith different objectives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 07:04:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Zhaohui", ""], ["Zhang", "Shengyu", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00481", "submitter": "Valerio Capraro", "authors": "Valerio Capraro and Giorgia Cococcioni", "title": "Social setting, intuition, and experience in lab experiments interact to\n  shape cooperative decision-making", "comments": "Forthcoming in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological\n  Sciences", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.GT physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent studies suggest that cooperative decision-making in one-shot\ninteractions is a history-dependent dynamic process: promoting intuition versus\ndeliberation has typically a positive effect on cooperation (dynamism) among\npeople living in a cooperative setting and with no previous experience in\neconomic games on cooperation (history-dependence).

A similar story emerges when devices\nrunning different physical and link layer protocols share frequencies in the\nsame spectrum in order to maximize the system-wide spectral efficiency. In such\nsituations, coordinating multiple interfering devices presents a significant\nchallenge not only from an interworking perspective (as a result of reduced\ninfrastructure), but also from an implementation point of view.

To deal with this problem we model\nthe situation as two games, between a Scanner and an Invader, and solve them\nsequentially. The first game is formulated to design the optimal (in maxmin\nsense) scanning algorithm, while the second one allows one to find the optimal\nvalues of the parameters for the algorithm depending on parameters of the\nnetwork. These games provide solutions for two dilemmas that the rivals face.\nThe Invader's dilemma consists of the following: the more bandwidth the Invader\nattempts to use leads to a larger payoff if he is not detected, but at the same\ntime also increases the probability of being detected and thus fined.\nSimilarly, the Scanner faces a dilemma: the wider the bandwidth scanned, the\nhigher the probability of detecting the Invader, but at the expense of\nincreasing the cost of building the scanning system. The equilibrium strategies\nare found explicitly and reveal interesting properties. In particular, we have\nfound a discontinuous dependence of the equilibrium strategies on the network\nparameters, fine and the type of the Invader's award. This discontinuity of the\nfine means that the network provider has to take into account a human/social\nfactor since some threshold values of fine could be very sensible for the\nInvader, while in other situations simply increasing the fine has minimal\ndeterrence impact.

The non-emptiness of the core of a coalition game\ncan be tested by a well-known covering LP. Moreover, the integrality gap of its\ndual packing LP defines exactly the multiplicative least-core and the relative\ncost of stability of the coalition game. This gap is upper bounded by the\npacking-covering ratio which, for graphical coalition games, is known to be at\nmost the treewidth of the interaction graph plus one (Meir et al. 2013).\n  We examine the packing-covering ratio and integrality gaps of graphical\ncoalition games in more detail. We introduce the thicket parameter of a graph,\nand prove it precisely measures the packing-covering ratio. It also\napproximately measures the primal and dual integrality gaps. The thicket number\nprovides an upper bound of both integrality gaps. Moreover we show that for any\ninteraction graph, the primal integrality gap is, in the worst case, linear in\nterms of the thicket number while the dual integrality gap is polynomial in\nterms of it. At the heart of our results, is a graph theoretic minmax theorem\nshowing the thicket number is equal to the minimum width of a vine\ndecomposition of the coalition graph (a vine decomposition is a generalization\nof a tree decomposition). We also explain how the thicket number relates to the\nVC-dimension of the set system produced by the game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 20:18:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bousquet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Li", "Zhentao", ""], ["Vetta", "Adrian", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07823", "submitter": "Weiran Shen", "authors": "Yuan Deng, Weiran Shen, Pingzhong Tang", "title": "Coalitional Permutation Manipulations in the Gale-Shapley Algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider permutation manipulations by any subset of women\nin the Gale-Shapley algorithm. This paper is motivated by the college\nadmissions process in China. Our results also answer Gusfield and Irving's open\nproblem on what can be achieved by permutation manipulations. We present an\nefficient algorithm to find a strategy profile such that the induced matching\nis stable and Pareto-optimal while the strategy profile itself is\ninconspicuous. Surprisingly, we show that such a strategy profile actually\nforms a Nash equilibrium of the manipulation game. We also show that a strong\nNash equilibrium or a super-strong Nash equilibrium does not always exist in\ngeneral and it is NP-hard to check the existence of these equilibria. We\nconsider an alternative notion of strong Nash equilibria and super-strong Nash\nequilibrium. Under such notions, we characterize the super-strong Nash\nequilibrium by Pareto-optimal strategy profiles.\n  In the end, we show that it is NP-complete to find a manipulation that is\nstrictly better for all members of the coalition. This result demonstrates a\nsharp contrast between weakly better-off outcomes and strictly better-off\noutcomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 06:37:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 07:03:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 06:51:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Nov 2017 03:07:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Deng", "Yuan", ""], ["Shen", "Weiran", ""], ["Tang", "Pingzhong", ""]]}]
