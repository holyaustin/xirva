This shift in network\narchitecture requires network devices to become more autonomous and,\npotentially, cooperate with one another. Such cooperation can, for example,\ntake place between interfering small access points that seek to coordinate\ntheir radio resource allocation, nearby single-antenna users that can\ncooperatively perform virtual MIMO communications, or even unlicensed users\nthat wish to cooperatively sense the spectrum of the licensed users. Such\ncooperative mechanisms involve the simultaneous sharing and distribution of\nresources among a number of overlapping cooperative groups or coalitions. In\nthis paper, a novel mathematical framework from cooperative games, dubbed\n\\emph{overlapping coalition formation games} (OCF games), is introduced to\nmodel and solve such cooperative scenarios. First, the concepts of OCF games\nare presented, and then, several algorithmic aspects are studied for two main\nclasses of OCF games. Subsequently, two example applications, namely,\ninterference management and cooperative spectrum sensing, are discussed in\ndetail to show how the proposed models and algorithms can be used in the future\nscenarios of wireless systems. Finally, we conclude by providing an overview on\nfuture directions and applications of OCF games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 21:04:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Tianyu", ""], ["Song", "Lingyang", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00126", "submitter": "Yangbo Song", "authors": "Yangbo Song, Mihaela van der Schaar", "title": "Dynamic Network Formation with Foresighted Agents", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What networks can form and persist when agents are self-interested?

In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which\nis able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or\nusers. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle\n(EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it\nstrongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g.,\nin terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is\nchosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally\ndistributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this\nheterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the\nnotion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the\nliterature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium. By\nassuming a rectangular charging profile for an EV, a composite equilibrium\nanalysis is conducted, followed by a detailed analysis of a case study which\nassumes three possible charging periods or time-slots.
