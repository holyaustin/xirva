A\nnotorious one is controller synthesis, which can be rephrased through the\ngame-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of the system in a\ngame against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification,\noptimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use\n(possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which\nsettings allow for simple strategies.\n  In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of\npreference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game\nobjectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the\nlast fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community\ntoward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or\ninfinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers\nof the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal\nstrategies still elude us.\n  In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference\nrelations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory,\ngeneralizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We\nalso prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical\ninterest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory\nstrategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player\ngames. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the\nliterature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory\n(e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives),\nand paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded\nenergy objectives).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2020 09:27:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2020 09:20:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2020 06:43:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 07:29:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bouyer", "Patricia", ""], ["Roux", "St\u00e9phane Le", ""], ["Oualhadj", "Youssouf", ""], ["Randour", "Mickael", ""], ["Vandenhove", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.03962", "submitter": "Michael Vyalyi", "authors": "Vladimir Gurvich, Michael Vyalyi", "title": "Computational Hardness of Multidimensional Subtraction Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.GT math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study algorithmic complexity of solving subtraction games in a~fixed\ndimension with a finite difference set.

Then, the principal rewards the agent according\nto the realized priority sequence with which the tasks were performed. We show\nthat the proposed mechanism is individually rational and incentive compatible.\nFurther, it is also socially optimal for the case of linear cost of priority\nsequence modification for the agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jan 2020 21:24:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Mar 2020 02:23:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 00:42:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Dobakhshari", "Donya G.", ""], ["Varshney", "Lav R.", ""], ["Gupta", "Vijay", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.05196", "submitter": "Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen", "authors": "Marie Louisa T{\\o}lb{\\o}ll Berthelsen and Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen", "title": "On the Computational Complexity of Decision Problems about Multi-Player\n  Nash Equilibria", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the computational complexity of decision problems about Nash\nequilibria in $m$-player games.

We extend these results to the case of selecting multiple items by\ndesigning a new $(1+o(1))$ approximation ratio algorithm that is robust to\naugmentations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 21:44:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 May 2020 17:35:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Immorlica", "Nicole", ""], ["Singla", "Sahil", ""], ["Waggoner", "Bo", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.10640", "submitter": "Jie Zhang", "authors": "Zihe Wang and Zhide Wei and Jie Zhang", "title": "Bounded Incentives in Manipulating the Probabilistic Serial Rule", "comments": "To appear in AAAI 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Probabilistic Serial mechanism is well-known for its desirable fairness\nand efficiency properties. It is one of the most prominent protocols for the\nrandom assignment problem. However, Probabilistic Serial is not\nincentive-compatible, thereby these desirable properties only hold for the\nagents' declared preferences, rather than their genuine preferences. A\nsubstantial utility gain through strategic behaviors would trigger\nself-interested agents to manipulate the mechanism and would subvert the very\nfoundation of adopting the mechanism in practice. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the extent to which an individual agent can increase its utility\nby strategic manipulation. We show that the incentive ratio of the mechanism is\n$\\frac{3}{2}$. That is, no agent can misreport its preferences such that its\nutility becomes more than 1.5 times of what it is when reports truthfully. This\nratio is a worst-case guarantee by allowing an agent to have complete\ninformation about other agents' reports and to figure out the best response\nstrategy even if it is computationally intractable in general. To complement\nthis worst-case study, we further evaluate an agent's utility gain on average\nby experiments. The experiments show that an agent' incentive in manipulating\nthe rule is very limited. These results shed some light on the robustness of\nProbabilistic Serial against strategic manipulation, which is one step further\nthan knowing that it is not incentive-compatible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:53:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zihe", ""], ["Wei", "Zhide", ""], ["Zhang", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.10772", "submitter": "Naftali Waxman", "authors": "Naftali Waxman, Sarit Kraus and Noam Hazon", "title": "On Maximizing Egalitarian Value in K-coalitional Hedonic Games", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of dividing agents among coalitions. We\nconcentrate on Additively Separable Hedonic Games (ASHG's), in which each agent\nhas a non-negative value for every other agent and her utility is the sum of\nthe values she assigns to the members of her coalition. Unlike previous work,\nwe analyze a model where exactly $k$ coalitions must be formed, and the goal is\nto maximize the utility of the agent which is worst off, i.e., the egalitarian\nsocial welfare. We show that this problem is hard, even when the number of\nagents should be equally divided among the coalitions. We thus propose a\nheuristic that maximizes the egalitarian social welfare and maximizes the\naverage utility of each agent as a secondary goal. Using extensive simulations,\nboth on synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. Specifically, our heuristic provides solutions that are much fairer\nthan the solutions that maximize the average social welfare, while still\nproviding a relatively high average social welfare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 12:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Waxman", "Naftali", ""], ["Kraus", "Sarit", ""], ["Hazon", "Noam", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11165", "submitter": "Sam Ganzfried", "authors": "Sam Ganzfried", "title": "Fictitious Play Outperforms Counterfactual Regret Minimization", "comments": "Fixed a bug in the 5-player CFR implementation from prior version and\n  reran the 5-player experiments", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA econ.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We compare the performance of two popular algorithms, fictitious play and\ncounterfactual regret minimization, in approximating Nash equilibrium in\nmultiplayer games.

For the electrical grid, the flexibility\nof EV charging makes it a significant actor in \"Demand Response\" mechanisms.\nTherefore, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms to foster customer\nengagement. A congestion game approach is adopted to evaluate the performance\nof such electrical transportation system with multiple classes of vehicles: EV\nand Gasoline Vehicles. Both temporal and energy operating costs are considered.\nThe latter is nonseparable as it depends on the global charging need of all EV,\nwhich is scheduled in time by a centralized aggregator in function of\nnonflexible consumption at charging location. Thus, driving and charging\ndecisions are coupled. An adaptation of Beckmann's method proves the existence\nof a Wardrop Equilibrium (WE) in the considered nonseparable congestion game;\nthis WE is unique when the charging unit price is an increasing function of the\nglobal charging need. A condition on the nonflexible load is given to guarantee\nthe monotonicity of this function. This condition is tested on real consumption\ndata in France and in Texas, USA. Optimal tolls are used to control this\nelectrical transportation system and then computed in order to minimize an\nenvironmental cost on a simple network topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:42:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sohet", "Beno\u00eet", ""], ["Hayel", "Yezekael", ""], ["Beaude", "Olivier", ""], ["Jeandin", "Alban", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11769", "submitter": "Ludwig Dierks", "authors": "Ludwig Dierks, Sven Seuken", "title": "The Competitive Effects of Variance-based Pricing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In many markets, like electricity or cloud computing markets, providers incur\nlarge costs for keeping sufficient capacity in reserve to accommodate demand\nfluctuations of a mostly fixed user base.
