Using the PAC model, this\npaper lays a firm theoretical foundation for learning in SSGs (e.g.,\ntheoretically answer questions about the numbers of samples required to learn\nadversary behavior) and provides utility guarantees when the learned adversary\nmodel is used to plan the defender's strategy. The paper also aims to answer\npractical questions such as how much more data is needed to improve an\nadversary model's accuracy. Additionally, we explain a recently observed\nphenomenon that prediction accuracy of learned adversary behavior is not enough\nto discover the utility maximizing defender strategy. We provide four main\ncontributions: (1) a PAC model of learning adversary response functions in\nSSGs; (2) PAC-model analysis of the learning of key, existing bounded\nrationality models in SSGs; (3) an entirely new approach to adversary modeling\nbased on a non-parametric class of response functions with PAC-model analysis\nand (4) identification of conditions under which computing the best defender\nstrategy against the learned adversary behavior is indeed the optimal strategy.\nFinally, we conduct experiments with real-world data from a national park in\nUganda, showing the benefit of our new adversary modeling approach and\nverification of our PAC model predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 22:27:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 17:51:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 08:34:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Arunesh", ""], ["Kar", "Debarun", ""], ["Tambe", "Milind", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.00188", "submitter": "Anshul Gupta", "authors": "Anshul Gupta, M.

Incentive equilibria generalise well-studied solution concepts such as\nNash equilibria and leader equilibria (also known as Stackelberg equilibria).\nRecall that a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve\nhis payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally. In the setting of incentive\nand leader equilibria, there is a distinguished player called the leader who\ncan assign strategies to all other players, referred to as her followers. A\nstrategy profile is a leader strategy profile if no player, except for the\nleader, can improve his payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally, and a\nleader equilibrium is a leader strategy profile with a maximal return for the\nleader. In the proposed case of incentive equilibria, the leader can\nadditionally influence the behaviour of her followers by transferring parts of\nher payoff to her followers. The ability to incentivise her followers provides\nthe leader with more freedom in selecting strategy profiles, and we show that\nthis can indeed improve the payoff for the leader in such games. The key\nfundamental result of the paper is the existence of incentive equilibria in\nmean-payoff games. We further show that the decision problem related to\nconstructing incentive equilibria is NP-complete. On a positive note, we show\nthat, when the number of players is fixed, the complexity of the problem falls\nin the same class as two-player mean-payoff games. We also present an\nimplementation of the proposed algorithms, and discuss experimental results\nthat demonstrate the feasibility of the analysis of medium sized games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 23:27:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Anshul", ""], ["Deepak", "M.

We\nconsider a new network formation game that incorporates an adversarial attack,\nas well as immunization against attack. An agent's benefit is the expected size\nof her connected component post-attack, and agents may also choose to immunize\nthemselves from attack at some additional cost. Our framework is a stylized\nmodel of settings where reachability rather than centrality is the primary\nconcern and vertices vulnerable to attacks may reduce risk via costly measures.\n  In the reachability benefit model without attack or immunization, the set of\nequilibria is the empty graph and any tree. The introduction of attack and\nimmunization changes the game dramatically; new equilibrium topologies emerge,\nsome more sparse and some more dense than trees. We show that, under a mild\nassumption on the adversary, every equilibrium network with $n$ agents contains\nat most $2n-4$ edges for $n\\geq 4$. So despite permitting topologies denser\nthan trees, the amount of overbuilding is limited.

One fundamental\ndistributed decision-making process is coalition formation for sharing certain\nreplaceable resources collaboratively, for example, sharing hotel rooms among\ntravelers, sharing taxi-rides among passengers, and sharing regular passes\namong users. Motivated by the applications of sharing economy, this paper\nstudies a coalition formation game subject to the capacity of $K$ participants\nper coalition. The participants in each coalition are supposed to split the\nassociated cost according to a given cost-sharing mechanism. A stable coalition\nstructure is established when no group of participants can opt out to form\nanother coalition that leads to lower individual payments. We quantify the\ninefficiency of distributed decision-making processes under a cost-sharing\nmechanism by the strong price of anarchy (SPoA), comparing a worst-case stable\ncoalition structure and a social optimum. In particular, we derive SPoA for\ncommon fair cost-sharing mechanisms (e.g., equal-split, proportional-split,\negalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions of bargaining games, and usage based\ncost-sharing). We show that the SPoA for equal-split, proportional-split, and\nusage based cost-sharing (under certain conditions) is $\\Theta(\\log K)$,\nwhereas the one for egalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions is $O(\\sqrt{K}\n\\log K)$.
