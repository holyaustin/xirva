These games model\ndecision-making in political bodies as well as collaboration and surplus\ndivision in multiagent domains. The computational complexity of various\nsolution concepts for weighted voting games received a lot of attention in\nrecent years. In particular, Elkind et al.(2007) studied the complexity of\nstability-related solution concepts in WVGs, namely, of the core, the least\ncore, and the nucleolus. While they have completely characterized the\nalgorithmic complexity of the core and the least core, for the nucleolus they\nhave only provided an NP-hardness result. In this paper, we solve an open\nproblem posed by Elkind et al. by showing that the nucleolus of WVGs, and, more\ngenerally, k-vector weighted voting games with fixed k, can be computed in\npseudopolynomial time, i.e., there exists an algorithm that correctly computes\nthe nucleolus and runs in time polynomial in the number of players and the\nmaximum weight. In doing so, we propose a general framework for computing the\nnucleolus, which may be applicable to a wider of class of games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2008 05:22:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Elkind", "Edith", ""], ["Pasechnik", "Dmitrii V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0978", "submitter": "Gesualdo Scutari", "authors": "Gesualdo Scutari, Daniel P.

Guruswami et al. (2005) propose this\nproblem and give logarithmic approximations (in the number of consumers) when\neach consumer's values for bundles are known precisely. Subsequently several\nversions of the problem have been shown to have poly-logarithmic\ninapproximability. This problem has direct ties to the important open question\nof better understanding the Bayesian optimal mechanism in multi-parameter\nsettings; however, logarithmic approximations are inadequate for this purpose.\nIt is therefore of vital interest to consider special cases where constant\napproximations are possible. We consider the unit-demand variant of this\nproblem. Here a consumer has a valuation for each different item and their\nvalue for a set of items is simply the maximum value they have for any item in\nthe set. We assume that the preferences of the consumers are drawn from a\ndistribution, the standard assumption in economics; furthermore, the setting of\na specific set of customers with known preferences, which is employed in all\nprior work in algorithmic pricing, is a special case of this general problem,\nwhere there is a discrete Bayesian distribution for preferences specified by\npicking one consumer uniformly from the given set of consumers. Our work\ncomplements these existing works by considering the case where the consumer's\nvaluations for the different items are independent random variables. Our main\nresult is a constant approximation that makes use of an interesting connection\nbetween this problem and the concept of virtual valuations from the\nsingle-parameter Bayesian optimal mechanism design literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2008 18:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chawla", "Shuchi", ""], ["Hartline", "Jason", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2081", "submitter": "Martin Hoefer", "authors": "Heiner Ackermann, Petra Berenbrink, Simon Fischer, Martin Hoefer", "title": "Concurrent Imitation Dynamics in Congestion Games", "comments": "28 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Imitating successful behavior is a natural and frequently applied approach to\ntrust in when facing scenarios for which we have little or no experience upon\nwhich we can base our decision. In this paper, we consider such behavior in\natomic congestion games. We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that\nemerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this\nagents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our\nmain focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument,\nwe show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states. In\nsuch a state none of the players can improve its latency by imitating somebody\nelse. As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria.\nAt an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a\nlatency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics\nbehave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all\nother parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on\nthe number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot\ndiscover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with\nnon-zero probability. For the case of singleton games, we show that the\nprobability of this event occurring is negligible. Additionally, we prove that\nthe social cost of a stable state reached by our dynamics is not much worse\nthan an optimal state in singleton congestion games with linear latency\nfunction. Finally, we discuss how the protocol can be extended such that, in\nthe long run, dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Aug 2008 02:45:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Oct 2008 01:58:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ackermann", "Heiner", ""], ["Berenbrink", "Petra", ""], ["Fischer", "Simon", ""], ["Hoefer", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2801", "submitter": "Constantinos Daskalakis", "authors": "Constantinos Daskalakis, Christos H.
