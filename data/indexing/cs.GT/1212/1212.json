Yet while much work has been done in this\narea, relatively little attention has been paid to studying perhaps the\nultimate lever of resource allocation: pricing. Most data centers today charge\nusers by \"bundling\" heterogeneous resources together in a fixed ratio and\nselling these bundles to their clients. But bundling masks the fact that\ndifferent users require different combinations of resources (e.g., CPUs,\nmemory, bandwidth) to process their jobs. The presence of multiple resources in\nfact allows an operator to offer many different types of pricing strategies,\nwhich may have different effects on its revenue. Moreover, to avoid user\ndissatisfaction, operators must consider the impact of their chosen prices on\nthe fairness of the jobs processed for different users. In this paper, we\ndevelop an analytical framework that accounts for the fairness and revenue\ntradeoffs that arise in a datacenter's multi-resource setting and the impact\nthat different pricing plans can have on this tradeoff. We characterize the\nimplications of different pricing plans on various fairness metrics and derive\nanalytical limits on the operator's fairness-revenue tradeoff. We then provide\nan algorithm to navigate this tradeoff and compare the tradeoff points for\ndifferent pricing strategies on a data trace taken from a Google cluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 21:57:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:22:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Joe-Wong", "Carlee", ""], ["Sen", "Soumya", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0526", "submitter": "Bastien Maubert", "authors": "Bastien Maubert (INRIA - IRISA), Sophie Pinchinat (INRIA - IRISA)", "title": "Uniform Strategies", "comments": "(2012)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider turn-based game arenas for which we investigate uniformity\nproperties of strategies.

Solving a previously open\nproblem we exactly show when, depending on collusions, convergence occurs\nwithin polynomial time, non-polynomial time, and when it never occurs. We also\nprove that previously known bounds on convergence time are all loose: by a\nnovel combinatorial analysis of the evolution of this game we are able to\nprovide the first \\emph{asymptotically exact} formula on its convergence.\nMoreover, we extend these results by providing a complete analysis when groups\nmay \\emph{overlap}, and for general utility functions representing\n\\emph{multi-modal} interactions. Finally, we prove that collusions have a\nsignificant and \\emph{positive} effect on the \\emph{efficiency} of the\nequilibrium that is attained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Dec 2012 12:09:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 09:44:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 13:56:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 09:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ducoffe", "Guillaume", ""], ["Mazauric", "Dorian", ""], ["Chaintreau", "Augustin", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.4797", "submitter": "Pascal Lenzner", "authors": "Bernd Kawald and Pascal Lenzner", "title": "On Dynamics in Selfish Network Creation", "comments": "36 pages, 16 figures.

Equilibrium networks in these\nmodels have desirable properties like low social cost and small diameter, which\nmakes them attractive for the decentralized creation of overlay-networks.\nUnfortunately, due to the non-constructiveness of the Nash equilibrium, no\ndistributed algorithm for finding such networks is known. We treat these games\nas sequential-move games and analyze whether (uncoordinated) selfish play\neventually converges to an equilibrium state. Thus, we shed light on one of the\nmost natural algorithms for this problem: distributed local search, where in\neach step some agent performs a myopic selfish improving move.\n  We show that fast convergence is guaranteed for all versions of Swap Games,\nintroduced by Alon et al. [SPAA'10], if the initial network is a tree, and show\nthat this process can be sped up to an almost optimal number of moves. For\nnon-tree networks we show the surprising result that even one non-tree edge\nsuffices to destroy the convergence guarantee and no move policy can enforce\nconvergence. This answers an open problem from Ehsani et al. [SPAA'11] in the\nnegative. We extend our negative results to the well-studied original version\nand prove that there is no convergence guarantee -- even if all agents play\noptimally. Furthermore, we show the quite surprising result that employing\ncost-sharing yields even worse dynamic behavior.\n  Finally, we contrast our mostly negative theoretical results by a careful\nempirical study. Our simulations indicate two positive facts: (1) The\nnon-convergent behavior seems to be confined to a small set of pathological\ninstances and is unlikely to show up in practice. (2) In all our simulations we\nobserved a remarkably fast convergence towards a stable network in O(n) steps,\nwhere n is the number of agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 19:17:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2013 14:56:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kawald", "Bernd", ""], ["Lenzner", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.5132", "submitter": "Ilias Diakonikolas", "authors": "Anindya De, Ilias Diakonikolas, Rocco A.
