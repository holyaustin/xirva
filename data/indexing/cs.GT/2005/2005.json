Besides, it is expected that CR-enabled\nvehicular ad-hoc networks (CR-VANETs) enrich the communication performance of\nthe existing vehicular networks (VANETs). However, to ensure efficient\nperformance in a multi-hop communication, the routing protocol in CR-VANETs\nneeds to consider the autonomous mobility of the vehicles as well as the\nstochastic availability of the channels. Hence, this paper introduces a\nspectrum-aware mobility pattern based reactive routing protocol for CR-VANET.\nThe proposed protocol accommodates the dynamic behavior and selects a stable\ntransmission path from a source node to the destination. Therefore, the\nproposed protocol is outlined as a weighted graph problem where the weight for\nan edge is measured based on a parameter termed as NHDF (Next-hop Determination\nFactor). The NHDF implicitly considers mobility patterns of the nodes and\nchannel availability to select the optimum path for communication. Therefore,\nin the proposed routing protocol, the mobility pattern of a node is defined\nfrom the viewpoint of distance, speed, direction, and node's reliability.\nFurthermore, the spectrum awareness in the proposed protocol is measured over\nthe number of shared common channels and the channel quality. It is anticipated\nthat the proposed protocol shows efficient routing performance by selecting\nstable and secured paths from source to destination. Simulation is carried out\nto assess the performance of the protocol where it is witnessed that the\nproposed routing protocol outperforms existing ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 May 2020 20:06:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Akter", "Sharmin", ""], ["Mansoor", "Nafees", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.01496", "submitter": "Edwin Lock", "authors": "Paul W.

A neural network is used to model the\nopponent from their behaviors and the corresponding policy is inferred for\naction selection and rule evolution. In cases of multiple heuristic policies,\nwe introduce the concept of Pareto optimality for action selection. Besides,\ntaking advantages of the condition representation and matching mechanism of\nXCS, the heuristic policies and the opponent model can provide guidance for\nsituations with similar feature representation. Furthermore, we introduce an\naccuracy-based eligibility trace mechanism to speed up rule evolution, i.e.,\nclassifiers that can match the historical traces are reinforced according to\ntheir accuracy.
