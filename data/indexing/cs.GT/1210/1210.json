The sensing game is shown\nto be a weighted potential game and its set of correlated equilibria is\nstudied. Interestingly, it is shown that the general hybrid game where each\ntransmitter can jointly choose the hybrid pair of actions (to sense or not to\nsense, transmit power level) leads to an outcome which is worse than the one\nobtained by playing the sensing game first, and then playing the power control\ngame. This is an interesting Braess-type paradox to be aware of for\nenergy-efficient power control in cognitive networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2012 20:27:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Treust", "Ma\u00ebl Le", ""], ["Hayel", "Yezekael", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""], ["Debbah", "M\u00e9rouane", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6398", "submitter": "Ma\\\"el  Le Treust", "authors": "Ma\\\"el Le Treust, Samson Lasaulce, M\\'erouane Debbah", "title": "Implicit cooperation in distributed energy-efficient networks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1007.5004", "journal-ref": "Proc. 4th International Symposium on Communications, Control and\n  Signal Processing (ISCCSP), 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of cooperation in distributed wireless networks of\nselfish and free transmitters aiming at maximizing their energy-efficiency. The\nstrategy of each transmitter consists in choosing his power control (PC)\npolicy. Two scenarios are considered: the case where transmitters can update\ntheir power levels within time intervals less than the channel coherence time\n(fast PC) and the case where it is updated only once per time interval (slow\nPC). One of our objectives is to show how cooperation can be stimulated without\nassuming cooperation links between the transmitters but only by repeating the\ncorresponding PC game and by signals from the receiver. In order to design\nefficient PC policies, standard and stochastic repeated games are respectively\nexploited to analyze the fast and slow PC problems. In the first case a\ncooperation plan between transmitters, that is both efficient and relies on\nmild information assumptions, is proposed.

GE are interesting for\ntwo reasons: (1) they model outcomes found by agents which prefer smooth\nadaptations over radical strategy-changes, (2) GE are outcomes found by agents\nwhich do not have enough computational resources to play optimally. In the\nmodel of Fabrikant et al. agents correspond to Internet Service Providers which\nbuy network links to improve their quality of network usage. It is known that\ncomputing a best response in this model is NP-hard. Hence, poly-time agents are\nlikely not to play optimally. But how good are networks created by such agents?\nWe answer this question for very simple agents. Quite surprisingly, naive\ngreedy play suffices to create remarkably stable networks. Specifically, we\nshow that in the SUM version, where agents attempt to minimize their average\ndistance to all other agents, GE capture Nash equilibria (NE) on trees and that\nany GE is in 3-approximate NE on general networks. For the latter we also\nprovide a lower bound of 3/2 on the approximation ratio. For the MAX version,\nwhere agents attempt to minimize their maximum distance, we show that any\nGE-star is in 2-approximate NE and any GE-tree having larger diameter is in\n6/5-approximate NE. Both bounds are tight. We contrast these positive results\nby providing a linear lower bound on the approximation ratio for the MAX\nversion on general networks in GE.
