Interactions of APTs with victim\nsystem introduce information flows that are recorded in the system logs.\nDynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a promising detection mechanism for\ndetecting APTs. DIFT taints information flows originating at system entities\nthat are susceptible to an attack, tracks the propagation of the tainted flows,\nand authenticates the tainted flows at certain system components according to a\npre-defined security policy. Deployment of DIFT to defend against APTs in cyber\nsystems is limited by the heavy resource and performance overhead associated\nwith DIFT. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient model for DIFT by\nincorporating the security costs, false-positives, and false-negatives\nassociated with DIFT. Specifically, we develop a game-theoretic framework and\nprovide an analytical model of DIFT that enables the study of trade-off between\nresource efficiency and the effectiveness of detection. Our game model is a\nnonzero-sum, infinite-horizon, average reward stochastic game. Our model\nincorporates the information asymmetry between players that arises from DIFT's\ninability to distinguish malicious flows from benign flows and APT's inability\nto know the locations where DIFT performs a security analysis. Additionally,\nthe game has incomplete information as the transition probabilities\n(false-positive and false-negative rates) are unknown. We propose a\nmultiple-time scale stochastic approximation algorithm to learn an equilibrium\nsolution of the game. We prove that our algorithm converges to an average\nreward Nash equilibrium. We evaluate our proposed model and algorithm on a\nreal-world ransomware dataset and validate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 19:45:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:13:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sahabandu", "Dinuka", ""], ["Moothedath", "Shana", ""], ["Allen", "Joey", ""], ["Bushnell", "Linda", ""], ["Lee", "Wenke", ""], ["Poovendran", "Radha", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.00426", "submitter": "Michael Tashman", "authors": "Michael Tashman, Jiayi Xie, John Hoffman, Lee Winikor, Rouzbeh Gerami", "title": "Dynamic Bidding Strategies with Multivariate Feedback Control for\n  Multiple Goals in Display Advertising", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Real-Time Bidding (RTB) display advertising is a method for purchasing\ndisplay advertising inventory in auctions that occur within milliseconds.

In this paper, we study a monopolistic provider\nwho initially does not know users' demand and needs to learn it over time by\nobserving the users' responses to the service prices. We design a pricing and\nvehicle supply policy, considering the tradeoff between exploration (i.e.,\nlearning the demand) and exploitation (i.e., maximizing the provider's\nshort-term payoff). Considering that the provider needs to ensure the vehicle\nflow balance at each location, its pricing and supply decisions for different\norigin-destination pairs are tightly coupled. This makes it challenging to\ntheoretically analyze the performance of our policy. We analyze the gap between\nthe provider's expected time-average payoffs under our policy and a clairvoyant\npolicy, which makes decisions based on complete information of the demand. We\nprove that after running our policy for D days, the loss in the expected\ntime-average payoff can be at most O((ln D)^0.5 D^(-0.25)), which decays to\nzero as D approaches infinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 05:24:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Haoran", ""], ["Wei", "Ermin", ""], ["Berry", "Randall A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.03323", "submitter": "Bart Smeulders", "authors": "Bart Smeulders and Danny Blom and Frits C.R.

We derive a tight bound on the perversity index for the\nclass of series-parallel network congestion games with convex latency\nfunctions, and show three facts: First, the harm of altruism is maximized when\nexactly half of the traffic is altruistic, but it gracefully vanishes when the\nfraction of altruistic traffic approaches either 0 or 1. Second, we show that\nthe harm of altruism is linearly increasing in a natural measure of the\n\"steepness\" of network latency functions. Finally, we show that for any\nnontrivial fraction of altruistic traffic, the harm of altruism exceeds the\nprice of anarchy associated with all-selfish traffic: in a sense, partial\naltruism is worse than complete selfishness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2020 20:00:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "Philip N.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.05647", "submitter": "Wenshuo Guo", "authors": "Wenshuo Guo, Mihaela Curmei, Serena Wang, Benjamin Recht, Michael I.\n  Jordan", "title": "Finding Equilibrium in Multi-Agent Games with Payoff Uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of finding equilibrium strategies in multi-agent games\nwith incomplete payoff information, where the payoff matrices are only known to\nthe players up to some bounded uncertainty sets.

In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI\nresources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in\nnon-optimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption.\nSimilarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures\nin the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG\ncan lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this paper,\nthe security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is\nstudied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. To defend against such\nattacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can\nallocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power\nloss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the\nadministrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk\nof failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical\nframework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and\nPG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets\nis derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components' failure on the\noptimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS\nallocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg\nequilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized.

As computing an exact or even an approximate\npure Nash equilibrium is in general PLS-complete, Caragiannis et al.

We show that this\nfactor can be improved to $(1.61+\\epsilon)$ and further improved results for\npolynomial cost functions, by a seemingly simple modification to their\nalgorithm by allowing for the cost functions used during the best response\ndynamics be different from the overall objective function. Interestingly, our\nmodification to the algorithm also extends to efficiently computing improved\napproximate pure Nash equilibria in games with arbitrary non-decreasing\nresource cost functions. Additionally, our analysis exhibits an interesting\nmethod to optimally compute universal load dependent taxes and using linear\nprogramming duality prove tight bounds on PoA under universal taxation, e.g,\n2.012 for linear congestion games and further results for polynomial cost\nfunctions.

We model the interaction between the agent (player 1)\nand the adversary (player 2) as a two-player concurrent game in which the\nadversary has incomplete information about the agent's task specification in\ntemporal logic. During the online interaction, the adversary can infer the\nagent's intention from observations and adapt its strategy so as to prevent the\nagent from satisfying the task. To plan against such an adaptive opponent, the\nagent must leverage its knowledge about the adversary's incomplete information\nto influence the behavior of the opponent, and thereby being deceptive. To\nsynthesize a deceptive strategy, we introduce a class of hypergame models that\ncapture the interaction between the agent and its adversary given asymmetric,\nincomplete information. A hypergame is a hierarchy of games, perceived\ndifferently by the agent and its adversary. We develop the solution concept of\nthis class of hypergames and show that the subjectively rationalizable strategy\nfor the agent is deceptive and maximizes the probability of satisfying the task\nin temporal logic. This deceptive strategy is obtained by modeling the opponent\nevolving perception of the interaction and integrating the opponent model into\nproactive planning. Following the deceptive strategy, the agent chooses actions\nto influence the game history as well as to manipulate the adversary's\nperception so that it takes actions that benefit the goal of the agent. We\ndemonstrate the correctness of our deceptive planning algorithm using robot\nmotion planning examples with temporal logic objectives and design a detection\nmechanism to notify the agent of potential errors in modeling of the\nadversary's behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 20:26:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Lening", ""], ["Ma", "Haoxiang", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Abhishek N.", ""], ["Fu", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15895", "submitter": "Satoshi Tanaka", "authors": "Satoshi Tanaka and Fran\\c{c}ois Bonnet and S\\'ebastien Tixeuil and\n  Yasumasa Tamura", "title": "Quixo Is Solved", "comments": "19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quixo is a two-player game played on a 5$\\times$5 grid where the players try\nto align five identical symbols.
