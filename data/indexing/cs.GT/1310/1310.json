This is principally because in absence of money, very little can be\ndone to enforce truthfulness.

For example, in Combinatorial Auctions (CAs), the\nparadigmatic problem of the area, we aim at solutions of maximum social welfare\nbut still charge the society to ensure truthfulness. Additionally, truthfulness\nof CAs is poorly understood already in the case in which bidders happen to be\ninterested in only two different sets of goods.\n  We focus on the design of incentive-compatible CAs without money in the\ngeneral setting of $k$-minded bidders. We trade monetary transfers with the\nobservation that the mechanism can detect certain lies of the bidders: i.e., we\nstudy truthful CAs with verification and without money. We prove a\ncharacterization of truthful mechanisms, which makes an interesting parallel\nwith the well-understood case of CAs with money for single-minded bidders. We\nthen give a host of upper bounds on the approximation ratio obtained by either\ndeterministic or randomized truthful mechanisms when the sets and valuations\nare private knowledge of the bidders.

However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to\nsatisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for\nwireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS\nrequirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing,\nwhere users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our\nspectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless\nchannels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and\nhow many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly\nheterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities,\nhardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we\nshow that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the\nmaximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also\nshow that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel\nselections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because\nbetter response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in\npolynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the\nworst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and\nchannels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the\nfrequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a\ngraph where players only contend with their neighbors.

In\nthis paper we attempt to understand how such middlemen compete with each other\nthrough a game theoretic analysis using novel techniques from decision-making\nunder ambiguity. We model a purposely abstract and reduced model of one\nmiddleman who pro- vides a two-sided platform, mediating surplus-creating\ninteractions between two users. The middleman evaluates uncertain outcomes\nunder positional ambiguity, taking into account the possibility of the\nemergence of an alternative middleman offering intermediary services to the two\nusers. Surprisingly, we find many situations in which the middleman will\npurposely extract maximal gains from her position. Only if there is relatively\nlow probability of devastating loss of business under competition, the\nmiddleman will adopt a more competitive attitude and extract less from her\nposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Oct 2013 20:50:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Gilles", "Robert P.", ""], ["Diamantaras", "Dimitrios", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.3593", "submitter": "Zhuang Qian", "authors": "Qian Zhuang, Zegnru Di and Jinshan Wu", "title": "Stability of Mixed-Strategy-Based Iterative Logit Quantal Response\n  Dynamics in Game Theory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0105391", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using the Logit quantal response form as the response function in each step,\nthe original definition of static quantal response equilibrium (QRE) is\nextended into an iterative evolution process.

In our model, search providers\ncompete for customers by strategically selecting which search results to\ndisplay in response to user queries. Customers, in turn, have private\npreferences over search results and will tend to use search engines that are\nmore likely to display pages satisfying their demands.\n  Our main question is whether competition between search engines increases the\noverall welfare of the users (i.e., the likelihood that a user finds a page of\ninterest). When search engines derive utility only from customers to whom they\nshow relevant results, we show that they differentiate their results, and every\nequilibrium of the resulting game achieves at least half of the welfare that\ncould be obtained by a social planner. This bound also applies whenever the\nlikelihood of selecting a given engine is a convex function of the probability\nthat a user's demand will be satisfied, which includes natural Markovian models\nof user behavior.\n  On the other hand, when search engines derive utility from all customers\n(independent of search result relevance) and the customer demand functions are\nnot convex, there are instances in which the (unique) equilibrium involves no\ndifferentiation between engines and a high degree of randomness in search\nresults. This can degrade social welfare by a factor of the square root of N\nrelative to the social optimum, where N is the number of webpages.

Towards this conjecture, we show that if a Nash\nequilibrium has a cycle of length at most 10, then indeed {\\alpha} < 1.3n. We\nfurther provide experimental evidence suggesting that when the girth of a Nash\nequilibrium is increasing, the upper bound on {\\alpha} obtained by the simple\nstrategy changes is not increasing. To the end, we investigate the approach for\na coalitional variant of Nash equilibrium, where coalitions of two players\ncannot collectively improve, and show that if {\\alpha} >= 41n, then every such\nNash equilibrium is a tree.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 17:53:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mamageishvili", "Akaki", ""], ["Mihalak", "Matus", ""], ["Muller", "Dominik", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8613", "submitter": "Vojt\\v{e}ch Kova\\v{r}\\'ik", "authors": "Viliam Lis\\'y, Vojt\\v{e}ch Kova\\v{r}\\'ik, Marc Lanctot, Branislav\n  Bo\\v{s}ansk\\'y", "title": "Convergence of Monte Carlo Tree Search in Simultaneous Move Games", "comments": "NIPS 2013 paper including appendix", "journal-ref": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, pp\n  2112-2120, 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in zero-sum extensive-form games with\nperfect information and simultaneous moves.
