In this\npaper we assume that such deliberations are carried out via interviews, where\nan interview involves a man and a woman, each of whom learns information about\nthe other as a consequence. If everybody interviews everyone else, then clearly\nagents can fully learn their preferences. But interviews are costly, and we may\nwish to minimize their use. It is often the case, especially in practical\nsettings, that due to correlation between agents' preferences, it is\nunnecessary for all potential interviews to be carried out in order to obtain a\nstable matching. Thus the problem is to find a good strategy for interviews to\nbe carried out in order to minimize their use, whilst leading to a stable\nmatching. One way to evaluate the performance of an interview strategy is to\ncompare it against a naive algorithm that conducts all interviews. We argue\nhowever that a more meaningful comparison would be against an optimal offline\nalgorithm that has access to agents' preference orderings under complete\ninformation.
