However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate\nand defect. In real-world prisoner's dilemmas, these choices are temporally\nextended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions,\nreflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner's Dilemma\n(SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work,\nwe propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates\nthe evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two\nphases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different\ncooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The\nsecond phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the\ndetected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the\nFruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid\nbeing exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with\ncooperative opponents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 01:53:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Weixun", ""], ["Hao", "Jianye", ""], ["Wang", "Yixi", ""], ["Taylor", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00283", "submitter": "Nicole Sawyer", "authors": "Nicole Sawyer, Mehdi Naderi Soorki, Walid Saad, David B.

In dense machine-to-machine networks, MTDs are typically\nlocated within close proximity and will gather correlated data, and, thus,\nclustering MTDs based on data correlation will lead to a decrease in the number\nof redundant bits transmitted to the base station. To analyze this clustering\nproblem, a novel utility function that captures the average MTD transmission\npower per cluster is derived, as a function of the MTD location, cluster size,\nand inter-cluster interference. Then, the clustering problem is formulated as\nan evolutionary game, which models the interactions among the massive number of\nMTDs, in order to decrease MTD transmission power. To solve this game, a\ndistributed algorithm is proposed to allow the infinite number of MTDs to\nautonomously form clusters. It is shown that the proposed distributed algorithm\nconverges to an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), that is robust to a small\nportion of MTDs deviating from the stable cluster formation at convergence. The\nmaximum fraction of MTDs that can deviate from the ESS, while still maintaining\na stable cluster formation is derived. Simulation results show that the\nproposed approach can effectively cluster MTDs with highly correlated data,\nwhich, in turn, enables those MTDs to eliminate a large number of redundant\nbits. The results show that, on average, using the proposed approach yields\nreductions of up to 23.4% and 9.6% in terms of the transmit power per cluster,\ncompared to forming clusters with the maximum possible size and uniformly\nselecting a cluster size, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 10:22:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sawyer", "Nicole", ""], ["Soorki", "Mehdi Naderi", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Smith", "David B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00345", "submitter": "Oliver Braganza", "authors": "Oliver Braganza", "title": "Proxyeconomics, the inevitable corruption of proxy-based competition", "comments": "This is a work in progress uploaded for sharing and feedback.\n  Depending on contributions even authorships may change", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When society maintains a competitive system to promote an abstract goal,\ncompetition by necessity relies on imperfect proxy measures.

In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic\nauthentication of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning\nframework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the IoT\ndevices (IoTDs) to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated\nsignal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method\nenables the cloud, which collects signals from the IoT devices, to effectively\nauthenticate the reliability of the signals. Moreover, in massive IoT\nscenarios, since the cloud cannot authenticate all the IoTDs simultaneously due\nto computational limitations, a game-theoretic framework is proposed to improve\nthe cloud's decision making process by predicting vulnerable IoTDs. The\nmixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) for this game is derived and the\nuniqueness of the expected utility at the equilibrium is proven. In the massive\nIoT system, due to a large set of available actions for the cloud, it is shown\nthat analytically deriving the MSNE is challenging and, thus, a learning\nalgorithm proposed that converges to the MSNE. Moreover, in order to cope with\nthe incomplete information case in which the cloud cannot access the state of\nthe unauthenticated IoTDs, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed\nto dynamically predict the state of unauthenticated IoTDs and allow the cloud\nto decide on which IoTDs to authenticate.

RTB enables advertisers to\nbuy individual ad impressions via an auction in real-time and facilitates the\nevaluation and the bidding of individual impressions across multiple\nadvertisers. In RTB, the advertisers face three main challenges when optimizing\ntheir bidding strategies, namely (i) estimating the utility (e.g., conversions,\nclicks) of the ad impression, (ii) forecasting the market value (thus the cost)\nof the given ad impression, and (iii) deciding the optimal bid for the given\nauction based on the first two. Previous solutions assume the first two are\nsolved before addressing the bid optimization problem. However, these\nchallenges are strongly correlated and dealing with any individual problem\nindependently may not be globally optimal. In this paper, we propose Bidding\nMachine, a comprehensive learning to bid framework, which consists of three\noptimizers dealing with each challenge above, and as a whole, jointly optimizes\nthese three parts.

For\nexample, a request may be to establish a virtual circuit, thus contributing to\nthe load on each edge in the circuit. Motivated by energy efficiency\napplications, recently, there is a growing interest in GND using cost functions\nthat exhibit (dis)economies of scale ((D)oS), namely, cost functions that\nappear subadditive for small loads and superadditive for larger loads.\n  The current paper advances the existing literature on approximation\nalgorithms for GND problems with (D)oS cost functions in various aspects: (1)\nwe present a generic approximation framework that yields approximation results\nfor a much wider family of requests in both directed and undirected graphs; (2)\nour framework allows for unrelated weights, thus providing the first\nnon-trivial approximation for the problem of scheduling unrelated parallel\nmachines with (D)oS cost functions; (3) our framework is fully combinatorial\nand runs in strongly polynomial time; (4) the family of (D)oS cost functions\nconsidered in the current paper is more general than the one considered in the\nexisting literature, providing a more accurate abstraction for practical energy\nconservation scenarios; and (5) we obtain the first approximation ratio for GND\nwith (D)oS cost functions that depends only on the parameters of the resources'\ntechnology and does not grow with the number of resources, the number of\nrequests, or their weights.

The amount of memory required to represent these games is the main\nbottleneck of algorithms for computing optimal strategies and the size of these\nstrategies is often impractical for real-world applications. A common approach\nto tackle the memory bottleneck is to use information abstraction that removes\nparts of information available to players thus reducing the number of decision\npoints in the game. However, existing information-abstraction techniques are\neither specific for a particular domain, they do not provide any quality\nguarantees, or they are applicable to very small subclasses of EFGs. We present\ndomain-independent abstraction methods for creating imperfect recall\nabstractions in extensive-form games that allow computing strategies that are\n(near) optimal in the original game. To this end, we introduce two novel\nalgorithms, FPIRA and CFR+IRA, based on fictitious play and counterfactual\nregret minimization. These algorithms can start with an arbitrary domain\nspecific, or the coarsest possible, abstraction of the original game. The\nalgorithms iteratively detect the missing information they require for\ncomputing a strategy for the abstract game that is (near) optimal in the\noriginal game. This information is then included back into the abstract game.\nMoreover, our algorithms are able to exploit imperfect-recall abstractions that\nallow players to forget even history of their own actions.

We first study the physical service\nmodel where the provider (e.g., FON) offers users customized WiFi devices for\nindoor Internet access, and allows service subscribers to physically access all\ndevice owners' WiFi when traveling. Observing that all device-owners contribute\nto the connectivity sharing, we show, via a Stackelberg game theoretic\napproach, that bundled pricing outperforms separate pricing as long as the\ntotal cost of device and service is reasonably low to stimulate network\nexternality. Further, hybrid pricing strictly dominates bundled pricing thanks\nto the pricing flexibility to keep high marginal profit of device-selling.\nNext, we investigate the virtual sharing service model where the provider\n(e.g., Apple) sells devices and device-supported applications. Different from\nthe connectivity service model, in this model service subscribers directly\ncontribute to the virtual content sharing, and the network externality can be\nfairly strong.

On the other hand,\ncost allocation classically assumes that agents do not anticipate the effect of\ntheir actions on the incentive that they obtain. We remove these assumptions\nand present an incentive rule for this setup by bridging the gap between\nmechanism design and classical cost allocation. We analyze whether the proposed\ndesign satisfies various desirable properties such as social optimality, budget\nbalance, participation constraint, and so on. We also analyze which of these\nproperties can be satisfied if the assumptions of cost functions of the agents\nbeing private and the agents being anticipatory are relaxed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Feb 2018 02:56:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 01:15:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ghavidel", "Donya", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Pratyush", ""], ["Baeyens", "Enrique", ""], ["Gupta", "Vijay", ""], ["Khargonekar", "Pramod P.", ""]]}]
