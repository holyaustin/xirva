However, sharing information is often\ncostly for the agents while resulting in no direct immediate benefit for them.\nHence, lacking incentives to collaborate, strategic agents who aim to maximize\ntheir own individual utilities will withhold rather than share information,\nleading to inefficient operation or even collapse of networks. In this paper,\nwe develop a systematic framework for designing distributed rating protocols\naimed at incentivizing the strategic agents to collaborate with each other by\nsharing information. The proposed incentive protocols exploit the ongoing\nnature of the agents' interactions to assign ratings and through them,\ndetermine future rewards and punishments: agents that have behaved as directed\nenjoy high ratings -- and hence greater future access to the information of\nothers; agents that have not behaved as directed enjoy low ratings -- and hence\nless future access to the information of others. Unlike existing rating\nprotocols, the proposed protocol operates in a distributed manner, online, and\ntakes into consideration the underlying interconnectivity of agents as well as\ntheir heterogeneity. We prove that in many deployment scenarios the price of\nanarchy (PoA) obtained by adopting the proposed rating protocols is one. In\nsettings in which the PoA is larger than one, we show that the proposed rating\nprotocol still significantly outperforms existing incentive mechanisms such as\nTit-for-Tat.

Based on probability theory, in a\nsituation of uncorrelated events, the average payoff that involves all of the\nneighbors should,in principal,be equivalent to the payoff from pairing up with\none neighbor.However,our simulation of games on graphs shows that, in many\ncases,the two payoff schemes lead to qualitatively different levels of\ncooperation.This finding appears to provide a possible explanation for a wide\nspectrum of observed behaviors in the literature.We have also observed that\nresults from the randomly-pairing-one mechanism are more robust than the\ninvolving-all-neighbours mechanism because,in the former case, neither the\nother three main elements nor the initial states of the players have a large\nimpact on the final level of cooperation compared with in the latter case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 03:46:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 13:11:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Qiang", ""], ["Qi", "Tianxiao", ""], ["Li", "Keqiang", ""], ["Di", "Zengru", ""], ["Wu", "Jinshan", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6797", "submitter": "Petr Golovach", "authors": "Fedor V.

It amounts to estimating the parameters of a linear model that maps\ninput features to corresponding outputs. In the classical setting where the\nprecision of each data point is fixed, the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem\nin statistics states that generalized least squares (GLS) is a so-called \"Best\nLinear Unbiased Estimator\" (BLUE).

We\nassume that the analyst performs linear regression on this dataset, and\nindividuals benefit from the outcome of this estimation. We model this scenario\nas a game where individuals minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) an\n(agent-specific) disclosure cost for providing high-precision data; and (b) a\n(global) estimation cost representing the inaccuracy in the linear model\nestimate. In this game, the linear model estimate is a public good that\nbenefits all individuals. We establish that this game has a unique non-trivial\nNash equilibrium. We study the efficiency of this equilibrium and we prove\ntight bounds on the price of stability for a large class of disclosure and\nestimation costs.
