Each agent's value or opportunity\ncost for the item is their private information and preferences are\nquasi-linear. Trade between agents employs a double oral auction (DOA) in which\nboth buyers and sellers call out bids or offers which an auctioneer recognizes.\nTransactions resulting from accepted bids and offers are recorded. This\ncontinues until there are no more acceptable bids or offers. Remarkably, the\nexperiment consistently terminates in a Walrasian price. The main result of\nthis paper is a mechanism in the spirit of the DOA that converges to a\nWalrasian equilibrium in a polynomial number of steps, thus providing a\ntheoretical basis for the above-described empirical phenomenon. It is\nwell-known that computation of a Walrasian equilibrium for this market\ncorresponds to solving a maximum weight bipartite matching problem. The\nuncoordinated but rational responses of agents thus solve in a distributed\nfashion a maximum weight bipartite matching problem that is encoded by their\nprivate valuations. We show, furthermore, that every Walrasian equilibrium is\nreachable by some sequence of responses. This is in contrast to the well known\nauction algorithms for this problem which only allow one side to make offers\nand thus essentially choose an equilibrium that maximizes the surplus for the\nside making offers. Our results extend to the setting where not every agent\npair is allowed to trade with each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 01:40:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Assadi", "Sepehr", ""], ["Khanna", "Sanjeev", ""], ["Li", "Yang", ""], ["Vohra", "Rakesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.00295", "submitter": "Nicolas Bousquet", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet and Yang Cai and Adrian Vetta", "title": "Welfare and Rationality Guarantees for the Simultaneous Multiple-Round\n  Ascending Auction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The simultaneous multiple-round auction (SMRA) and the combinatorial clock\nauction (CCA) are the two primary mechanisms used to sell bandwidth. Under\ntruthful bidding, the SMRA is known to output a Walrasian equilibrium that\nmaximizes social welfare provided the bidder valuation functions satisfy the\ngross substitutes property. Recently, it was shown that the combinatorial clock\nauction (CCA) provides good welfare guarantees for general classes of valuation\nfunctions. This motivates the question of whether similar welfare guarantees\nhold for the SMRA in the case of general valuation functions.\n  We show the answer is no. But we prove that good welfare guarantees still\narise if the degree of complementarities in the bidder valuations are bounded.\nIn particular, if bidder valuations functions are $\\alpha$-near-submodular\nthen, under truthful bidding, the SMRA has a welfare ratio (the worst case\nratio between the social welfare of the optimal allocation and the auction\nallocation) of at most $(1+\\alpha)$. The special case of submodular valuations,\nnamely $\\alpha=1$, and produces individually rational solutions. However, for\n$\\alpha>1$, this is a bicriteria guarantee, to obtain good welfare under\ntruthful bidding requires relaxing individual rationality.\n  Finally, we examine what strategies are required to ensure individual\nrationality in the SMRA with general valuation functions. First, we provide a\nweak characterization, namely \\emph{secure bidding}, for individual\nrationality. We then show that if the bidders use a profit-maximizing secure\nbidding strategy the welfare ratio is at most $1+\\alpha$. Consequently, by\nbidding securely, it is possible to obtain the same welfare guarantees as\ntruthful bidding without the loss of individual rationality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 16:09:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bousquet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Cai", "Yang", ""], ["Vetta", "Adrian", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.00460", "submitter": "Haris Aziz", "authors": "Haris Aziz", "title": "Characterizing SW-Efficiency in the Social Choice Domain", "comments": "Short Note", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Dogan, Dogan and Yildiz (2015) presented a new efficiency notion\nfor the random assignment setting called SW (social welfare)-efficiency and\ncharacterized it.

In\nthis paper, we consider a millimeter wave network composed of multiple source-\ndestination pairs and a set of deployed relays. We formulate the problem of\nmultihop relaying as a cooperative network formation game in which each relay\nchooses which source-destination pair to assist in order to improve the\nend-to-end performance, that is, the multihop delay between the source and the\ndestination. Further, we present an algorithm based on the Nash Bargaining\nSolution to ensure fairness among the different source-destination pairs and\nassess its efficiency on numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 14:28:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Abuzainab", "Nof", ""], ["Touati", "Corinne", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08204", "submitter": "Hessam Mahdavifar", "authors": "Hessam Mahdavifar, Ahmad Beirami, Behrouz Touri, Jeff S.

Each agent has access to an independent noisy\nobservation of $\\theta$. In order to capture the behavior of agents in a social\nnetwork of information exchange we assume that agents share their observation\nin a noisy environment prior to making their decision. We show that global\ngames with noisy sharing of information do not admit an intuitive type of\nthreshold policy which only depends on agents' belief about the underlying\n$\\theta$. This is in contrast to the existing results on the threshold policy\nfor the conventional set-up of global games. Motivated by this result, we\ninvestigate the existence of equilibrium strategies in a more general\ncollection of threshold-type policies and show that such equilibrium strategies\nexist and are unique if the sharing of information happens over a sufficiently\nnoisy environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 06:18:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 28 Oct 2017 13:32:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mahdavifar", "Hessam", ""], ["Beirami", "Ahmad", ""], ["Touri", "Behrouz", ""], ["Shamma", "Jeff S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08578", "submitter": "Sam Ganzfried", "authors": "Sam Ganzfried", "title": "My Reflections on the First Man vs. Machine No-Limit Texas Hold 'em\n  Competition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA econ.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The first ever human vs. computer no-limit Texas hold 'em competition took\nplace from April 24-May 8, 2015 at River's Casino in Pittsburgh, PA.

The attack probability\nexperienced by a node is a function of her own investment and the investment by\nher neighbors in the network. Most of the existing work in these settings\nconsiders players who are risk-neutral. In contrast, studies in behavioral\ndecision theory have shown that individuals often deviate from risk-neutral\nbehavior while making decisions under uncertainty. In particular, the true\nprobabilities associated with uncertain outcomes are often transformed into\nperceived probabilities in a highly nonlinear fashion by the users, which then\ninfluence their decisions. In this paper, we investigate the effects of such\nbehavioral probability weightings by the nodes on their optimal investment\nstrategies and the resulting security risk profiles that arise at the Nash\nequilibria of interdependent network security games. We characterize graph\ntopologies that achieve the largest and smallest worst case average attack\nprobabilities at Nash equilibria in Total Effort games, and equilibrium\ninvestments in Weakest Link and Best Shot games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 14:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 17:30:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2016 20:06:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hota", "Ashish R.", ""], ["Sundaram", "Shreyas", ""]]}]
