A potential game approach has been applied to addressing\ndistributed implementation of decision making for cooperative sensor planning.\nWhen a sensor network involves a large number of sensing agents, the local\nutility function for a sensing agent is hard to compute, because the local\nutility function depends on the other agents' decisions while each sensing\nagent is inherently faced with limitations in both its communication and\ncomputational capabilities. Accordingly, a local utility function for each\nagent should be approximated to accommodate limitations in information\ngathering and processing. We propose an approximation method for a local\nutility function using only a portion of the decisions of other agents. The\npart of the decisions that each agent considers is called the neighboring set\nfor the agent. The error induced by the approximation is also analyzed, and to\nkeep the error small we propose a neighbor selection algorithm that chooses the\nneighbor set for each agent in a greedy way. The selection algorithm is based\non the correlation information between one agent's measurement selection and\nthe other agents' selections.

An advantage of our\nprotocol is that it is very simple to describe, and users only need a counter\nto keep track of time.

We study a synchronisation problem\nfor such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of\nthe controller , the controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a\ntarget state. The agents are naturally represented by a non-deterministic\nfinite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and the whole system is\nencoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and\nthe second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game\nwith m agents is called the m-population game.

An allocation is said to be fair if it\nis envy-free up to one good (EF1), which means that each agent prefers its own\nbundle over the bundle of any other agent up to the removal of one good. In\naddition, an allocation is deemed efficient if it satisfies Pareto optimality\n(PO).

As a result, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm for\nfinding a fair and efficient allocation.\n  In this paper, we bypass this barrier, and develop a pseudopolynomial time\nalgorithm for finding allocations that are EF1 and PO; in particular, when the\nvaluations are bounded, our algorithm finds such an allocation in polynomial\ntime.

In particular, the\npaper focuses on studying the behavior of FP in potential games in which all\nequilibria of the game are regular, as introduced by Harsanyi. Such games are\nreferred to as regular potential games. Recently it has been shown that almost\nall potential games (in the sense of the Lebesgue measure) are regular. In this\npaper it is shown that in any regular potential game (and hence, in almost\nevery potential game), FP converges to the set of Nash equilibria at an\nexponential rate from almost every initial condition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Swenson", "Brian", ""], ["Kar", "Soummya", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.08250", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "J\\'er\\^ome Lang (CNRS)", "title": "Proceedings Sixteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality\n  and Knowledge", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 251, 2017", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.251", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.CR cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume consists of papers presented at the Sixteenth Conference on\nTheoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK) held at the University\nof Liverpool, UK, from July 24 to 26, 2017.\n  TARK conferences bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields,\nincluding Computer Science (especially, Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography,\nDistributed Computing), Economics (especially, Decision Theory, Game Theory,\nSocial Choice Theory), Linguistics, Philosophy (especially, Philosophical\nLogic), and Cognitive Psychology, in order to further understand the issues\ninvolving reasoning about rationality and knowledge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 23:32:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lang", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "", "CNRS"]]}, {"id": "1707.08598", "submitter": "Arkadii Slinko", "authors": "Edith Elkind and Umberto Grandi and Francesca Rossi and Arkadii Slinko", "title": "Cognitive Hierarchy and Voting Manipulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By the Gibbard--Satterthwaite theorem, every reasonable voting rule for three\nor more alternatives is susceptible to manipulation: there exist elections\nwhere one or more voters can change the election outcome in their favour by\nunilaterally modifying their vote.
