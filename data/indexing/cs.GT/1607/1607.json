At the center of this literature lies the\nquestion of whether there exist fair mechanisms despite strategic behavior of\nthe agents. A fundamental objective function used for measuring fair outcomes\nis the Nash social welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the agent\nutilities. This objective function is maximized by widely known solution\nconcepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal\nincomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing\nthe Nash social welfare. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher\nmarket, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the\n(weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of\nvaluations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and\nfind that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism has a constant\napproximation: at most 2 and at least e1e. However, for perfect complements,\nthe Fisher market does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with the\nnumber of players.\n  Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism---an indirect market mechanism also\nknown as the Shapley-Shubik game---has significantly better performance than\nthe Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve an\napproximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for all\nconcave utilities and becomes arbitrarily close to optimal for Leontief\nutilities (perfect complements), where it reaches $(1+\\epsilon)$ for every\n$\\epsilon > 0$.

Each\ndocument to be clustered is represented as a player and each cluster as a\nstrategy. The players receive a reward interacting with other players that they\ntry to maximize choosing their best strategies. The geometry of the data is\nmodeled with a weighted graph that encodes the pairwise similarity among\ndocuments, so that similar players are constrained to choose similar\nstrategies, updating their strategy preferences at each iteration of the games.\nWe used different approaches to find the prototypical elements of the clusters\nand with this information we divided the players into two disjoint sets, one\ncollecting players with a definite strategy and the other one collecting\nplayers that try to learn from others the correct strategy to play. The latter\nset of players can be considered as new data points that have to be clustered\naccording to previous information. This representation is useful in scenarios\nin which the data are streamed continuously. The evaluation of the system was\nconducted on 13 document datasets using different settings. It shows that the\nproposed method performs well compared to different document clustering\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 16:17:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Tripodi", "Rocco", ""], ["Pelillo", "Marcello", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.02526", "submitter": "Shiva Navabi", "authors": "Shiva Navabi and Ashutosh Nayyar", "title": "Optimal Auction Design for Flexible Consumers", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of designing revenue-maximizing auctions for allocating\nmultiple goods to flexible consumers.

As some items might be substitutes,\nagents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of\nresults indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on\nthe welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that\nequilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.\n  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response\ndynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated\nagent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other\nagents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long\nbefore they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,\nconvergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that\nagents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will\nremain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least\nonce.\n  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive\nvaluations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$\napproximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at\nleast once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee an $\\Omega(1/\\log m)$\napproximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated\nhis bid at least once and at any point after that.

We investigate how much revenue is lost when a\nsingle static price is used instead for all buyers and goods, and prove upper\nbounds on the ratio between the maximum revenue from dynamic prices and that\nfrom static prices. These bounds are tight for all values of $k$ and $n$ and\nvary depending on a regularity property of the underlying distribution. For\ngeneral distributions we obtain a ratio of $2-k/n$, for regular distributions a\nratio that increases in $n$ and is bounded from above by $1/(1-k^k/(e^{k}k!))$,\nwhich is roughly $1/(1-1/(\\sqrt{2\\pi k}))$. The lower bounds hold for the\nrevenue gap between dynamic and static prices. The upper bounds are obtained\nvia an ex-ante relaxation of the revenue maximization problem, as a consequence\nthe tight bounds of $2-k/n$ in the general case and of $1/(1-1/(\\sqrt{2\\pi\nk}))$ in the regular case apply also to the potentially larger revenue gap\nbetween the optimal incentive-compatible mechanism and the optimal static\nprice. Our results imply that for regular distributions the benefit of dynamic\nprices vanishes while for non-regular distributions dynamic prices may achieve\nup to twice the revenue of static prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 22:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Aug 2018 11:59:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2019 13:00:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["D\u00fctting", "Paul", ""], ["Fischer", "Felix", ""], ["Klimm", "Max", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07306", "submitter": "Ragavendran Gopalakrishnan", "authors": "Ragavendran Gopalakrishnan and Koyel Mukherjee and Theja Tulabandhula", "title": "The Costs and Benefits of Sharing: Sequential Individual Rationality and\n  Sequential Fairness", "comments": "Presented as a poster at EC 2016.

In this work, within a model that explicitly considers the\n\"inconvenience costs\" incurred by customers due to sharing, we introduce the\nnotion of sequential individual rationality (SIR) that requires that the\ndisutility of existing customers is nonincreasing as the system state changes\ndue to new customer arrivals. Next, under SIR, we observe that cost sharing can\nalso be viewed as benefit sharing, which inspires a natural definition of\nsequential fairness (SF) - the total incremental benefit due to a new customer\nis shared among existing customers in proportion to the incremental\ninconvenience suffered.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of these notions by applying them to a\nridesharing system, where unexpected detours to pick up subsequent passengers\ninconvenience the existing passengers. Imposing SIR and SF reveals interesting\nand surprising results, including: (a) natural limits on the incremental\ndetours permissible, (b) exact characterization of \"SIR-feasible\" routes, which\nboast sublinear upper and lower bounds on the fractional detours, (c) exact\ncharacterization of sequentially fair cost sharing schemes, which includes a\nstrong requirement that passengers must compensate each other for the detour\ninconveniences that they cause, and (d) new algorithmic problems related to and\nmotivated by SIR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2016 15:08:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 22:08:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Ragavendran", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Koyel", ""], ["Tulabandhula", "Theja", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07684", "submitter": "Vasilis Syrgkanis", "authors": "Tim Roughgarden, Vasilis Syrgkanis, Eva Tardos", "title": "The Price of Anarchy in Auctions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This survey outlines a general and modular theory for proving approximation\nguarantees for equilibria of auctions in complex settings.
