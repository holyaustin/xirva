We do this by correlating\nthe revenue stream of the customer to the prices charged by the provider. We\nshow that our mechanism is incentive compatible in that it is in the best\ninterest of the customer to provide his true revenue as a function of the\nresources rented. We next add another restriction to the price function, i.e.,\nthat it be linear. This removes the distortion that creeps in when the customer\nhas to pay more money for less resources.

In the considered model, at the demand side, it is\nassumed that customers can act as prosumers who own renewable energy sources\nand can both produce and consume energy. Due to the coupling between the\nprosumers' decisions and the stochastic nature of renewable energy, the\ninteraction among prosumers is formulated as a stochastic game, in which each\nprosumer seeks to maximize its payoff, in terms of revenues, by controlling its\nenergy consumption and demand. In particular, the subjective behavior of\nprosumers is explicitly reflected into their payoff functions using prospect\ntheory, a powerful framework that allows modeling real-life human choices. For\nthis prospect-based stochastic game, it is shown that there always exists a\nstationary Nash equilibrium where the prosumers' trading policies in the\nequilibrium are independent of the time and their histories of the play.\nMoreover, a novel distributed algorithm with no information sharing among\nprosumers is proposed and shown to converge to an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.\nOn the other hand, at the supply side, the interaction between the utility\ncompany and the prosumers is formulated as an online optimization problem in\nwhich the utility company's goal is to learn its optimal energy allocation\nrules. For this case, it is shown that such an optimization problem admits a\nno-regret algorithm meaning that regardless of the actual outcome of the game\namong the prosumers, the utility company can follow a strategy that mitigates\nits allocation costs as if it knew the entire demand market a priori.\nSimulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to their\npredicted outcomes and present new insights resulting from prospect theory that\ncontribute toward more efficient energy management in the smart grids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 21:02:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 17:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Etesami", "Seyed Rasoul", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Mandayam", "Narayan", ""], ["Poor", "H.

In this paper, the problem of optimizing the energy trading decisions of\nMG operators (MGOs) is studied using game theory. In the formulated game, each\nMGO chooses the amount of energy that must be sold immediately or stored for\nfuture emergencies, given the prospective market prices which are influenced by\nother MGOs' decisions. The problem is modeled using a Bayesian game to account\nfor the incomplete information that MGOs have about each others' levels of\nsurplus. The proposed game explicitly accounts for each MGO's subjective\ndecision when faced with the uncertainty of its opponents' energy surplus. In\nparticular, the so-called framing effect, from the framework of prospect theory\n(PT), is used to account for each MGO's valuation of its gains and losses with\nrespect to an individual utility reference point. The reference point is\ntypically different for each individual and originates from its past\nexperiences and future aspirations. A closed-form expression for the Bayesian\nNash equilibrium is derived for the standard game formulation. Under PT, a best\nresponse algorithm is proposed to find the equilibrium. Simulation results show\nthat, depending on their individual reference points, MGOs can tend to store\nmore or less energy under PT compared to classical game theory.

In this game,\nthe attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS\nto maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator\nchooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize\npotential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts\nfor the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational\ncapabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such\nbounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from\nthe behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this\nframework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have\ndifferent possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and\ncomputational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each\nattacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing\nthese different types is computed.

In particular, we show that the\nequilibrium strategies satisfy a network decaying dependence (NDD) condition\nrequiring that dependence between any two players' decisions decays with their\nnetwork distance. The formulation of such an NDD property is novel and serves\nas the basis for statistical inference. Further, we establish the\nidentification of the structural model and introduce a computationally feasible\nand efficient estimation method. We illustrate the estimation method with an\nactual application to college attendance, as well as in Monte Carlo\nexperiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:50:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Haiqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.08906", "submitter": "Francisco Javier Marmolejo-Coss\\'io", "authors": "Paul W.

Large games have a Lipschitz-type property that no single player's\nutility is greatly affected by any other individual player's actions. In this\npaper, we mostly focus on the case where any change of strategy by a player\ncauses other players' payoffs to change by at most $\\frac{1}{n}$.

Each buyer is interested in a subset of the\nitems on sale, and she appraises at some single-value every item in her\npreference-set. Moreover, each buyer has a budget that constraints the maximum\naffordable payment, while she aims to obtain as many items as possible of her\npreference-set. Our goal is to compute an envy-free pricing allocation that\nmaximizes the revenue, i.e., the total payment charged to the buyers. This\npricing problem is hard to approximate better than $\\Omega({\\rm min}\n\\{n,m\\}^{1/2-\\epsilon})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$, unless $P=NP$. The hardness\nresult is due to the presence of the matching constraints given that the\nsimpler multi-unit case can be approximated up to a constant factor of $2$. The\ngoal of this paper is to circumvent the hardness result by restricting\nourselves to specific settings of valuations and budgets. Two particularly\nsignificant scenarios are: each buyer has a budget that is greater than her\nsingle-value valuation, and each buyer has a budget that is lower than her\nsingle-value valuation. Surprisingly, in both scenarios we are able to achieve\na $1/4$-approximation to the optimal envy-free revenue. The algorithms utilize\na novel version of the Ausebel ascending price auction. These results may\nsuggest that, although it is difficult to approximate the optimal revenue in\ngeneral, ascending price auctions could achieve relatively good revenue in most\nof the practical settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 14:01:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Colini-Baldeschi", "Riccardo", ""], ["Leonardi", "Stefano", ""], ["Zhang", "Qiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.09976", "submitter": "Yannai A.
