In such\ncontrol scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election\nvia actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.\nSP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of\ncandidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'\napproval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred\ncandidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule\ncoerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and\nhybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.\n  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the\ncorresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of\nconstructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to\ncontrol than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a\npolynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,\nsee Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the\nsecond natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that\nis known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland\nvoting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 13:27:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 22:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Sep 2008 21:57:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 09:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 15:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Erdelyi", "Gabor", ""], ["Nowak", "Markus", ""], ["Rothe", "Joerg", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1343", "submitter": "Riccardo Alberti", "authors": "Riccardo Alberti", "title": "Temporized Equilibria", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in the\nsubmission action.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jun 2008 17:39:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Jun 2008 23:19:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 21 Sep 2008 19:33:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2008 11:28:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Alberti", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1565", "submitter": "Gesualdo Scutari", "authors": "Gesualdo Scutari, Daniel P.

This problem has been studied in a number of papers during the past\ndecade for the case of frequency-selective channels.

In this paper we\nprovide a unified view of the state-of-the-art results, showing that most of\nthe techniques proposed in the literature to study the game, even though\napparently different, can be unified using our recent interpretation of the\nwaterfilling operator as a projection onto a proper polyhedral set. Based on\nthis interpretation, we then provide a mathematical framework, useful to derive\na unified set of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of the NE\nand the global convergence of waterfilling based asynchronous distributed\nalgorithms.\n  The proposed mathematical framework is also instrumental to study the\nextension of the game to the more general MIMO case, for which only few results\nare available in the current literature. The resulting algorithm is, similarly\nto the frequency-selective case, an iterative asynchronous MIMO waterfilling\nalgorithm. The proof of convergence hinges again on the interpretation of the\nMIMO waterfilling as a matrix projection, which is the natural generalization\nof our results obtained for the waterfilling mapping in the frequency-selective\ncase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 03:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Scutari", "Gesualdo", ""], ["Palomar", "Daniel P.", ""], ["Barbarossa", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1649", "submitter": "Carlos Roca P.", "authors": "Carlos P.

We show that determining the existence of a pure Nash\nequilibrium in general BBC games is NP-hard. However, in a natural variant,\nfractional BBC games - where it is permitted to buy fractions of links - a pure\nNash equilibrium always exists. A major focus is the study of (n,k)-uniform BBC\ngames - those in which all link costs, link lengths and preference weights are\nequal (to 1) and all budgets are equal (to k). We show that a pure Nash\nequilibrium or stable graph exists for all (n,k)-uniform BBC games and that all\nstable graphs are essentially fair (i.e. all nodes have similar costs). We\nprovide an explicit construction of a family of stable graphs that spans the\nspectrum from minimum total social cost to maximum total social cost. We also\nstudy a special family of regular graphs in which all nodes imitate the \"same\"\nbuying pattern, and show that if n is sufficiently large no such regular graph\ncan be a pure Nash equilibrium. We analyze best-response walks on the\nconfiguration defined by the uniform game. Lastly, we extend our results to the\ncase where each node seeks to minimize its maximum distance to the other nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 19:18:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Laoutaris", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Poplawski", "Laura J.", ""], ["Rajaraman", "Rajmohan", ""], ["Sundaram", "Ravi", ""], ["Teng", "Shang-Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2139", "submitter": "Joseph Y.
