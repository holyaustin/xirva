We extend our previous work, to games with N players as\nwell as frequency selective channels and joint TDM/FDM strategies.\n  We show that the Nash bargaining solution can be computed using convex\noptimization techniques. We also show that the same results are applicable to\ninterference channels where only statistical knowledge of the channel is\navailable. Moreover, for the special case of two players $2\\times K$ frequency\nselective channel (with K frequency bins) we provide an $O(K \\log_2 K)$\ncomplexity algorithm for computing the Nash bargaining solution under mask\nconstraint and using joint FDM/TDM strategies. Simulation results are also\nprovided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2007 21:47:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Leshem", "Amir", ""], ["Zehavi", "Ephi", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.2023", "submitter": "Lyubov Positselskaya", "authors": "Lyubov N.
