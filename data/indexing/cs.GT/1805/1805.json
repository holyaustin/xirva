Intuitively, by selecting the revenue maximizing\nauction, the seller introduces a dependency on the buyers' distributions in the\nchoice of the auction. We study in depth the case of the Myerson auction and\nshow that a symmetric equilibrium exists in which buyers shade non-linearly\nwhat would be their first price bid.

As carried out by a dynamical system, it\nis the process by which the system absorbs information into its state. A\ncomplex network of agents cognizes knowledge about its environment, internal\ndynamics and initial state by forming emergent, macro-level patterns. Such\npatterns require each agent to find its place while partially aware of the\nwhole pattern. Such partial awareness can be achieved by separating the system\ndynamics into two parts by timescale: the propagation dynamics and the pattern\ndynamics. The fast propagation dynamics describe the spread of signals across\nthe network. If they converge to a fixed point for any quasi-static state of\nthe slow pattern dynamics, that fixed point represents an aggregate of\nmacro-level information. On longer timescales, agents coordinate via positive\nfeedback to form patterns, which are defined using closed walks in the graph of\nagents. Patterns can be coherent, in that every part of the pattern depends on\nevery other part for context. Coherent patterns are acausal, in that (a) they\ncannot be predicted and (b) no part of the stored knowledge can be mapped to\nany part of the pattern, or vice versa. A cognitive network's knowledge is\nencoded or embodied by the selection of patterns which emerge.

The motivating example is a group of animals\nthat disperse over patches of food of different abundances. In such scenarios,\nindividuals are biased towards selecting the higher quality patches, while, at\nthe same time, aiming to avoid costly collisions or overlaps. Our goal is to\ninvestigate the impact of collision costs on the parallel coverage of resources\nby the whole group. Consider M sites, where a site x has value f(x). We think\nof f(x) as the reward associated with site x, and assume that if a single\nindividual visits x exclusively, it receives this exact reward. Typically, we\nassume that if > 1 individuals visit x then each receives at most f(x). In\nparticular, when competition costs are high, each individual might receive an\namount strictly less than f(x), which could even be negative. Conversely,\nmodeling cooperation at a site, we also consider cases where each one gets more\nthan f(x). There are k identical players that compete over the rewards. They\nindependently act in parallel, in a one-shot scenario, each specifying a single\nsite to visit, without knowing which sites are explored by others. The group\nperformance is evaluated by the expected coverage, defined as the sum of f(x)\nover all sites that are explored by at least one player. Since we assume that\nplayers cannot coordinate before choosing their site we focus on symmetric\nstrategies. The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal\nsymmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively\nhigh, so that the following \"Judgment of Solomon\" type of rule holds: If a\nsingle player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if\nseveral players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Under this\npolicy, it turns out that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium\nstrategy, which is, in fact, evolutionary stable. Moreover, this strategy\nyields the best possible coverage among all symmetric strategies. Viewing the\ncoverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric)\nPrice of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy\nhas a price strictly greater than 1.
