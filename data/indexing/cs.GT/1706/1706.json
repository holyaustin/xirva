A natural benchmark, this model allows us to provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the optimal price sequence asymptotically as the number of\nagents goes to infinity, which notably is linearly increasing in time with a\nslope that depends on the network effect through a scalar given by the sum of\nentries of the inverse of the network weight matrix.

Simulations on New York City\n(NYC) taxi trip data show that our heuristics are up to 90% optimal and 10^5\ntimes faster than the (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm.\n  Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by\nmatching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings\nare typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased\nprofit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not\nclear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would\nencourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction\nof savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the\ndecisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount\noffered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm\nIDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the\nprovider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the\noptimal discount factor in under 16 iterations.\n  Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy\nbased on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept. Such\nrestricted policies offer a better ride experience, increasing the provider's\nmarket share, but at the cost of decreased average per-ride profit due to the\nreduced number of matched rides.

The learning dynamics breaks the indeterminacy of the Nash\nequilibria. Non-trivially, depending on how the relevant limits are taken, more\nthan one type of equilibrium can be selected. These include the standard\nhomogeneous mixed and heterogeneous pure states, but also \\emph{heterogeneous\nmixed} states where different agents play different strategies that are not all\npure. The analysis of the EWA learning involves Fokker-Planck modeling combined\nwith large deviation methods. The theoretical results are confirmed by\nmulti-agent simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 14:02:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Nicole", "Robin", ""], ["Sollich", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09861", "submitter": "Mehrdad Nojoumian", "authors": "Mehrdad Nojoumian", "title": "Rational Trust Modeling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.GT cs.MA cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Trust models are widely used in various computer science disciplines. The\nmain purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a\nset of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of\n\"rational trust modeling\" is introduced by bridging trust management and game\ntheory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory\n(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been\nutilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty\nof our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust\nmodel assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are\nrational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy\nbased on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are\nincentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of\ntrust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and\nsolution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be\nbuilt-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of\nrational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will\nresult in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model\ncan incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper\nparameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish\nplayers in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).\nFurthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known\nattacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict\nbehavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 17:18:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nojoumian", "Mehrdad", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09869", "submitter": "Warut Suksompong", "authors": "Warut Suksompong", "title": "Approximate Maximin Shares for Groups of Agents", "comments": "To appear in the 10th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game\n  Theory (SAGT), 2017", "journal-ref": "Mathematical Social Sciences, 92:40-47 (2018)", "doi": "10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2017.09.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods among\ninterested agents using the concept of maximin share.

The\nbenefit a non-owner derives from the good is affected by many factors,\nincluding the type of the good, its availability, and the social status of the\nnon-owner. Depending on the magnitude of the benefit and on the price of the\ngood, a potential buyer might stay away from purchasing the good, hoping to\nfree ride on others' purchases. A revenue-maximizing seller who sells social\ngoods must take these considerations into account when setting prices for the\ngood. The literature on optimal pricing has advanced considerably over the last\ndecade, but little is known about optimal pricing schemes for selling social\ngoods. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of revenue-maximizing\npricing schemes for social goods: we introduce a Bayesian model for this\nscenario, and devise nearly-optimal pricing schemes for various types of\nexternalities, both for simultaneous sales and for sequential sales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 03:31:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Jul 2017 11:12:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Eden", "Alon", ""], ["Ezra", "Tomer", ""], ["Feldman", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10200", "submitter": "Pascal Lenzner", "authors": "Ankit Chauhan, Pascal Lenzner, Anna Melnichenko, Louise Molitor", "title": "Selfish Network Creation with Non-Uniform Edge Cost", "comments": "To appear at SAGT'17", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Network creation games investigate complex networks from a game-theoretic\npoint of view.
