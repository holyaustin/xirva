Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership.\nFirst there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose\nof this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the\napplication of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of\nnon-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution.\nThese equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The\nprimary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator\nwithin the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is\nthe role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles\nto all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately\nprovides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds\nprivately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a\nmultitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling\nthese sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet,\nif these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational\nto construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine\nwould need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player\nand itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input\nor strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme. Here is the\nsynthesis of cryptography into game theory; analyzing the ability of the\nplayers to construct a protocol which can be used successfully in the place of\na mediator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 23:59:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Meyer", "Thomas Kellam", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0393", "submitter": "Chinmay Karande", "authors": "Sourav Chakraborty, Nikhil Devanur, Chinmay Karande", "title": "Market Equilibrium with Transaction Costs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Identical products being sold at different prices in different locations is a\ncommon phenomenon.

In these auctions, bidders incur a\ncost for placing each bid in addition to (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner's\nfinal purchase cost. Thus even when a winner's purchase cost is a small\nfraction of the item's intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit\nhandsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these\nauctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at\nSwoopo.com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work\npredicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry\nbroadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now\noption specifically, to quantify the effects of imperfect information in these\nauctions. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids,\nbetter estimates of other players' intent, different valuations of items,\ncommitted players willing to play \"chicken\") can increase the auction duration\nwell beyond that predicted by previous work and thus skew the auctioneer's\nprofit disproportionately. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of a\ndataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us\nalso to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding.\nUltimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players\noverlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits\nfor pay-per-bid auctioneers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2010 16:31:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:58:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 21:51:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Byers", "John W.", ""], ["Mitzenmacher", "Michael", ""], ["Zervas", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0641", "submitter": "Pierre Clairambault", "authors": "Pierre Clairambault (PPS)", "title": "Least and greatest fixpoints in game semantics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Foundations of Software Science and Computational Structures, York\n  : United Kingdom (2009)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-00596-1_3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.GT cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how solutions to many recursive arena equations can be computed in a\nnatural way by allowing loops in arenas.

In this case, the election can be viewed as a game, and the election\noutcomes correspond to Nash equilibria of this game. We use this framework to\nanalyze two variants of Plurality voting, namely, simultaneous voting, where\nall voters submit their ballots at the same time, and sequential voting, where\nthe voters express their preferences one by one. For simultaneous voting, we\ncharacterize the preference profiles that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, but\nshow that it is computationally hard to check if a given profile fits our\ncriterion.

However, assuming that all\nplayers are selfish and in particular that all players have the same utility\nfunction may not always be appropriate. Hence, several extensions to\nincorporate also altruistic and malicious behavior in addition to selfishness\nhave been proposed over the last years.
