The random order model allows us to escape from the strong lower bounds\nfor the adversarial order setting, and excellent algorithms are known in this\nsetting. However, one worrying aspect of these results is that the algorithms\noverfit to the model: they are not very robust. Indeed, if a few \"outlier\"\narrivals are adversarially placed in the arrival sequence, the algorithms\nperform poorly. E.g., Dynkin's popular $1/e$-secretary algorithm fails with\neven a single adversarial arrival.\n  We investigate a robust version of the secretary problem.

The green elements\narrive at times uniformly randomly drawn from $[0,1]$. The red elements,\nhowever, arrive at adversarially chosen times. Naturally, the algorithm does\nnot see these colors: how well can it solve secretary problems?\n  We give algorithms which get value comparable to the value of the optimal\ngreen set minus the largest green item.

In this model, every agent has a budget of artificial\ncurrency with which to purchase bundles of goods. Equilibrium prices match\nbetween demand and supply---at such prices, all agents simultaneously get their\nfavorite within-budget bundle, and the market clears. Unfortunately, a\ncompetitive equilibrium may not exist when the goods are indivisible, even in\nextremely simple markets such as two agents with exactly the same budget and a\nsingle item. Yet in this example, once the budgets are slightly\nperturbed---i.e., made generic---a competitive equilibrium is guaranteed to\nexist. In this paper we explore the extent to which generic budgets can\nguarantee equilibrium existence (and thus related fairness guarantees) in\nmarkets with multiple items. We complement our results in [Babaioff et al.,\n2019] for additive preferences by exploring the case of general monotone\npreferences, establishing positive results for small numbers of items and\nmapping the limits of our approach. We then consider cardinal preferences,\ndefine a hierarchy of such preference classes and establish relations among\nthem, and for some classes prove equilibrium existence under generic budgets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Nov 2019 12:18:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Babaioff", "Moshe", ""], ["Nisan", "Noam", ""], ["Talgam-Cohen", "Inbal", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10014", "submitter": "Xin Zhou", "authors": "Xin Zhou and Shigeo Matsubara and Qidong Liu and Yuan Liu and Gang\n  Huang", "title": "Bribery in Rating System: A Game-Theoretic Perspective", "comments": "(6+1)pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rich revenue gained from a mobile application ($a.k.a.$ app) boost app\nowners (sellers) to manipulate the app store with fake ratings.

In the paper, we investigate the\nrelation for two classic online settings: Online Algorithms (OA) and Online\nConvex Optimization (OCO). We provide a new theoretical analysis framework,\nwhich shows an interesting observation, that is, the relation between the\nswitching cost and the dynamic regret is different for settings of OA and OCO.\nSpecifically, the switching cost has significant impact on the dynamic regret\nin the setting of OA. But, it does not have an impact on the dynamic regret in\nthe setting of OCO. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound of regret for the\nsetting of OCO, which is same with the lower bound in the case of no switching\ncost.
