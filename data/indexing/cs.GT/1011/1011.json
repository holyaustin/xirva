They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and\nproposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a\nstable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally\nefficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm\nis also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a\nmechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties\n(colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their\ntrue preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm\nis often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM)\nor its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without\ndeferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite\nof Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we\nintroduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a\nstudent's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the\nactual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The\nnotion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms,\nallowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and\ncolleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent\nreciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and\noptimality as well.

Although the purchase and sale of private data has\nalready begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing.\nIn this paper, we propose to build such a theory. Specifically, we consider a\nsetting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population\nfrom which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an\naccurate estimate cheaply. On the other hand, the owners of the private data\nexperience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for\nthis loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal\nis to design truthful mechanisms. Our main result is that such auctions can\nnaturally be viewed and optimally solved as variants of multi-unit procurement\nauctions. Based on this result, we derive auctions for two natural settings\nwhich are optimal up to small constant factors:\n  1. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed accuracy goal, we\nshow that an application of the classic Vickrey auction achieves the analyst's\naccuracy goal while minimizing his total payment.\n  2. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed budget, we give a\nmechanism which maximizes the accuracy of the resulting estimate while\nguaranteeing that the resulting sum payments do not exceed the analysts budget.\n  In both cases, our comparison class is the set of envy-free mechanisms, which\ncorrespond to the natural class of fixed-price mechanisms in our setting.\n  In both of these results, we ignore the privacy cost due to possible\ncorrelations between an individuals private data and his valuation for privacy\nitself.

The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in\nwhich one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not\nefficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices\nwhen the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space\nof securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that\nsecurities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching\nfor spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms\ndesigned for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of\nthis research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically\ndifferent approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded\npayoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We\nprove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price\nsecurities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable\nprices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show\nhow the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization\nover the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the\noptimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we\nprovide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on\na sphere.

How is the optimal behavior of a benevolent provider different from the\noptimal behavior of a selfish provider, and how does this difference affect\nsocial welfare? And, most importantly, how does the medium access control (MAC)\ntechnology influence the answers to these questions? To address these\nquestions, we build a general model, and provide analysis and simulations for\nsimplified but typical scenarios; the focus in these scenarios is on the\ncontrast between the outcomes obtained under carrier-sensing multiple access\n(CSMA) and outcomes obtained under time-division multiple access (TDMA).\nSimulation results demonstrate that differences in MAC technology can have a\nsignificant effect on social welfare, on provider profit, and even on the\n(financial) feasibility of a wireless network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 04:15:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Nov 2010 07:12:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 21:06:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Xiao", "Yuanzhang", ""], ["Zame", "William R.", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3666", "submitter": "Wei Li Dr.", "authors": "Juergen Jost and Wei Li", "title": "The tragedy of the commons in a multi-population complementarity game", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures, ECCS 09", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.GT physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a complementarity game with multiple populations whose members'\noffered contributions are put together towards some common aim.

In a classical congestion game, multiple users share the\nsame set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function\nof the total number of users sharing it. As a potential game, this game enjoys\nsome very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy Nash\nequilibrium (NE) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a\nNE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP). While it's tempting to\nuse this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse\nfeature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels)\nmay be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far\naway from each other. This motivates us to study an extended form of the\ncongestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the\nnumber of its interfering users sharing it. This naturally results in a spatial\ncongestion game (SCG), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict\ngraph).

The standard\nsolution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is\nwell known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players\nincreases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where\nplayers optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others' states remains\nconstant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we\nprovide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a\nparsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that\nguarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation\nproperty to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces.\nSecond, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market\nstructure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE\nwell, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate\nthis connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples.\nThese examples show that our conditions enforce a form of \"decreasing returns\nto larger states\"; this yields fragmented industries in the limit. By contrast,\nviolation of these conditions suggests \"increasing returns to larger states\"\nand potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully\ndynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial\norganization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different\nindustries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Nov 2010 00:28:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Dec 2010 02:42:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 21:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2011 02:06:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2011 04:10:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Adlakha", "Sachin", ""], ["Johari", "Ramesh", ""], ["Weintraub", "Gabriel Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5610", "submitter": "Panayotis Mertikopoulos", "authors": "Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Elena V.
