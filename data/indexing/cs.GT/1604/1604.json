By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can\nmanipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic\nbenefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such\nworks assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or\ndefense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with\nmultiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study\nthe defender-attackers interaction, two game models are considered. In the\nfirst, a Stackelberg game model is used in which the defender acts as a leader\nthat can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers,\nbefore deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties\nof the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the\nequilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited\nsystem information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In\nthe second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot\nanticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, we proposed a hybrid\nsatisfaction equilibrium - Nash equilibrium game and defined its equilibrium\nconcept. A search algorithm is also provided to find the equilibrium of the\nhybrid game. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to\nillustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and\ndefender. Our results show that by defending a very small set of measurements,\nthe grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks\nhave no effect on the system. Moreover, our results show how, at equilibrium,\nmultiple attackers can play a destructive role towards each other, by choosing\nto carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:32:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sanjab", "Anibal", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00299", "submitter": "Serdar Y\\\"uksel", "authors": "Nuh Ayg\\\"un Dalk{\\i}ran and Serdar Y\\\"uksel", "title": "Stochastic Control Approach to Reputation Games", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Through a stochastic control theoretic approach, we analyze reputation games\nwhere a strategic long-lived player acts in a sequential repeated game against\na collection of short-lived players.

This nested information structure is obtained through an appropriate\nmonitoring structure.

The cooperative framework considers the\nself-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term\ninvestment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon.\nSpecifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to\ndeploy renewable energy generations, and how to split the associated investment\ncost. We show that the cooperative framework minimizes the overall system cost.\nWe also design a fair cost sharing method based on Nash bargaining to\nincentivize cooperative planning, such that all microgrids will benefit from\ncooperative planning. Using realistic data obtained from the Hong Kong\nobservatory, we validate the cooperative planning framework, and demonstrate\nthat all microgrids benefit through the cooperation, and the overall system\ncost is reduced by 35.9% compared to the noncooperative planning benchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 18:34:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Hao", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.02364", "submitter": "Piotr Faliszewski", "authors": "Piotr Faliszewski and Jean-Francois Laslier and Robert Schaefer and\n  Piotr Skowron and Arkadii Slinko and Nimrod Talmon", "title": "Modeling Representation of Minorities Under Multiwinner Voting Rules", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The goal of this paper is twofold.

The result is\nsurprising because it does not even require additional symmetry or fairness\nconditions such as anonymity, neutrality, or equal treatment of equals. Our\nresult further demonstrates that the lack of weak SD-strategyproofness of the\nextended PS mechanism of Katta and Sethuraman (2006) is not a design flaw of\nextended PS but is due to an inherent incompatibility of efficiency and\nstrategyproofness of PS in the full preference domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 06:34:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Aziz", "Haris", ""], ["Luo", "Pang", ""], ["Rizkallah", "Christine", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07564", "submitter": "Dietmar Berwanger", "authors": "Dietmar Berwanger, Anup Basil Mathew, R.

The previously known strategies use space {\\Omega}(logT) and it\nwas known that no strategy can use constant space if it is {\\epsilon}-optimal\neven in the limit superior sense. We also give a complementary lower bound.\nFurthermore, we also show that no Markov strategy, even extended with finite\nmemory, can ensure value greater than 0 in the Big Match, answering a question\nposed by Abraham Neyman.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 11:56:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Hansen", "Kristoffer Arnsfelt", ""], ["Ibsen-Jensen", "Rasmus", ""], ["Kouck\u00fd", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.08179", "submitter": "Eli A.
