To obtain the\napproximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually\nsimple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the\nfollowing results.\n  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in\nascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an\napproximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible\nfor deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is\nalways optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then\nshow that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or\nrandomization is allowed.\n  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,\nachieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation\nratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is\nnegligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \\pi\n/2.\n  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential\ngames, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule).

While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents\nwithin robotics or software applications, we propose a novel usage model for\nself-organizing agents suited to wireless networks. In the proposed model, a\nnumber of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located\ntasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and\nsubsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The\nproblem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and\nthe tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed\ncoalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents which\nmove between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit\nthe packets. Within each coalition, some agents can also take the role of a\nrelay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed\nalgorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join\nor leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective\nthroughput, and the cost in terms of delay. As a result of these decisions, the\nagents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions\nwhich constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed\nalgorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental\nchanges such as the arrival/removal of tasks or the mobility of the tasks.\nSimulation results show how the proposed algorithm improves the performance, in\nterms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26% (for a\nnetwork of 5 agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates\nnearby tasks equally among agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Oct 2010 15:32:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Basar", "Tamer", ""], ["Debbah", "Merouane", ""], ["Hj\u00f8rungnes", "Are", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4501", "submitter": "Walid Saad", "authors": "Walid Saad, Zhu Han, Tamer Basar, Merouane Debbah, Are Hj{\\o}rungnes", "title": "Coalition Formation Games for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing", "comments": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, to appear", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2011", "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2010.2089477", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collaborative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) between secondary users (SUs) in\ncognitive networks exhibits an inherent tradeoff between minimizing the\nprobability of missing the detection of the primary user (PU) and maintaining a\nreasonable false alarm probability (e.g., for maintaining a good spectrum\nutilization). In this paper, we study the impact of this tradeoff on the\nnetwork structure and the cooperative incentives of the SUs that seek to\ncooperate for improving their detection performance. We model the CSS problem\nas a non-transferable coalitional game, and we propose distributed algorithms\nfor coalition formation.

Then, the CF algorithm is complemented\nwith a coalitional voting game for enabling distributed coalition formation\nwith detection probability guarantees (CF-PD) when required by the PU. The\nCF-PD algorithm allows the SUs to form minimal winning coalitions (MWCs), i.e.,\ncoalitions that achieve the target detection probability with minimal costs.\nFor both algorithms, we study and prove various properties pertaining to\nnetwork structure, adaptation to mobility and stability. Simulation results\nshow that CF reduces the average probability of miss per SU up to 88.45%\nrelative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a desired false alarm.\nFor CF-PD, the results show that up to 87.25% of the SUs achieve the required\ndetection probability through MWC\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Oct 2010 15:37:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Basar", "Tamer", ""], ["Debbah", "Merouane", ""], ["Hj\u00f8rungnes", "Are", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4727", "submitter": "Bryan Bruns", "authors": "Bryan Bruns", "title": "Navigating the Topology of 2x2 Games: An Introductory Note on Payoff\n  Families, Normalization, and Natural Order", "comments": "8 pages including 4 figures in text and 4 plates", "journal-ref": "Games 2015, 6(4), 495-520", "doi": "10.3390/g6040495", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The Robinson-Goforth topology of swaps in adjoining payoffs elegantly\narranges 2x2 ordinal games in accordance with important properties including\nsymmetry, number of dominant strategies and Nash Equilibria, and alignment of\ninterests.

These games directly relate\nto network routing problems and also job-shop scheduling problems. In typical\nbottleneck congestion games, the utility costs of the players are determined by\nthe worst congested resources that they use. However, the resulting Nash\nequilibria are inefficient, since the price of anarchy is proportional on the\nnumber of resources which can be high.

The\nutility cost of a player is the sum of the individual delays of the resources\nthat it uses. The social cost of the game remains the same, namely, it is the\nworst bottleneck resource congestion: $\\max_{r} C_r$.
