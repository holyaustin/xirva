One of its main features is that voters\ncan delegate their votes in a transitive manner such that: A delegates to B and\nB delegates to C leads to A indirectly delegates to C. These delegations can be\neffectively empowered by implementing liquid democracy in a social network, so\nthat voters can delegate their votes to any of their neighbors in the network.\nHowever, it is uncertain that such a delegation process will lead to a stable\nstate where all voters are satisfied with the people representing them.

Lastly, we study the convergence of delegation\ndynamics.

Given the anticipated\nwidespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop\nnew security solutions against such attacks. In this paper, a mathematical\nframework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS\nspoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the\noptimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS\nspoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this\nend, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically\nderived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack.\nThen, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS\nspoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative\nlocalization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs\ninstead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the\nproposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model\nthe interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the\ndrone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light\nof the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the\ngame are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed\nalgorithm. Simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg\nstrategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy\nselection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2019 15:32:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Nov 2019 07:02:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 01:28:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Eldosouky", "AbdelRahman", ""], ["Ferdowsi", "Aidin", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11663", "submitter": "Hao Ge", "authors": "Hao Ge, Randall Berry", "title": "Quantized VCG Mechanisms for Polymatroid Environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3323679.3326524", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many network resource allocation problems can be viewed as allocating a\ndivisible resource, where the allocations are constrained to lie in a\npolymatroid.

In many settings, data aggregators cannot\ndirectly verify the quality of the data they purchase, nor the effort exerted\nby data sources when creating the data. Recent work has explored mechanisms to\nensure that the data sources share high quality data with a single data\naggregator, addressing the issue of moral hazard. Oftentimes, there is a\nunique, socially efficient solution.\n  In this paper, we consider data markets where there is more than one data\naggregator. Since data can be cheaply reproduced and transmitted once created,\ndata sources may share the same data with more than one aggregator, leading to\nfree-riding between data aggregators. This coupling can lead to non-uniqueness\nof equilibria and social inefficiency. We examine a particular class of\nmechanisms that have received study recently in the literature, and we\ncharacterize all the generalized Nash equilibria of the resulting data market.\nWe show that, in contrast to the single-aggregator case, there is either\ninfinitely many generalized Nash equilibria or none. We also provide necessary\nand sufficient conditions for all equilibria to be socially inefficient. In our\nanalysis, we identify the components of these mechanisms which give rise to\nthese undesirable outcomes, showing the need for research into mechanisms for\ncompetitive settings with multiple data purchasers and sellers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 15:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Westenbroek", "Tyler", ""], ["Dong", "Roy", ""], ["Ratliff", "Lillian J.", ""], ["Sastry", "S.

Efforts towards protection mechanisms\nthat prevent or limit the success of such threats, however, have been ad-hoc so\nfar and have primarily focused on designing threat-specific customized defense\nmechanisms. Such approaches are not very practical, as evident from their\nlimited adoption within major mobile/wearable operating systems. In the end, it\nis clear that all privacy threats that take advantage of unrestricted access to\nzero-permission sensors can be prevented if access to these sensors is\nregulated. However, due to the dynamic nature of sensor usage and requirements\nof different mobile applications, design of such access control mechanisms is\nnot trivial. To effectively design an automated mobile defense mechanism that\ncan dynamically measure the threat level of different sensor access requests\nfrom different applications and appropriately block suspicious requests, the\nproblem of zero-permission sensor access needs to be first formally defined and\nanalyzed. This paper accomplishes the above objective by employing game theory,\nspecifically, signaling games, to analytically model the sensor access scenario\nfor mobile applications, including, formalizing sensor access strategies of\nmobile applications and defense strategies of the on-board defense mechanism\nand the associated costs and benefits. Within the confines of a formal and\npractical game model, the paper then outlines conditions under which equilibria\ncan be achieved between entities (applications and defense mechanism) with\nconflicting goals.
