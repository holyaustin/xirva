We employ\nthese tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue.\nOur approach separates the standard smoothness framework into two distinct\nparts, isolating the analysis common to any auction from the analysis specific\nto a given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare\nin equilibrium to their contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using\nthe price the bidder faces for additional allocation. Intuitively, either an\nagent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she has\nto pay for additional allocation is high relative to her value. We call this\ncondition value covering; it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any\nauction. The second part, revenue covering, relates the prices bidders face for\nadditional allocation to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's rules\nand feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation\nresults to the optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal\nrevenue.

Transmission qualities\nof a channel evolve randomly. Each primary needs to select a price and a set of\nnon-interfering locations (which is an independent set in the conflict graph of\nthe region) at which to offer its channel without knowing the transmission\nqualities of the channels of its competitors. We formulate the above problem as\na non-cooperative game. We consider two scenarios-i) when the region is small,\nii) when the region is large. In the first setting, we focus on a class of\nconflict graphs, known as mean valid graphs which commonly arise when the\nregion is small. We explicitly compute a symmetric Nash equilibrium (NE); the\nNE is threshold type in that primaries only choose independent set whose\ncardinality is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold on the\ncardinality increases with increase in quality of the channel on sale. We show\nthat the symmetric NE strategy profile is unique in a special class of conflict\ngraphs (linear graph). In the second setting, we consider node symmetric\nconflict graphs which arises when the number of locations is large\n(potentially, infinite). We explicitly compute a symmetric NE that randomizes\nequally among the maximum independent sets at a given channel state vector. In\nthe NE a primary only selects the maximum independent set at a given channel\nstate vector. We show that the two symmetric NEs computed in two settings\nexhibit important structural difference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:19:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 16:17:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 11 Oct 2015 15:45:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Arnob", ""], ["Sarkar", "Saswati", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.6786", "submitter": "Shahar Dobzinski", "authors": "Liad Blumrosen and Shahar Dobzinski", "title": "Reallocation Mechanisms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider reallocation problems in settings where the initial endowment of\neach agent consists of a subset of the resources.
