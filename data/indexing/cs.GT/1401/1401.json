This economic point of view also takes\nplace in the determination of goods and services in wireless networks. Indeed,\nbefore transmitting customer data, a network operator has to lease some\nfrequency range from a spectrum owner and also has to establish agreements with\nelectricity suppliers. The goal of this paper is to compare two pricing\nschemes, namely a power-based and a flat rate, and give a possible explanation\nwhy flat rate pricing schemes are more common than power based pricing ones in\na deregulated wireless market. We suggest a hierarchical game-theoretical model\nof a three level supply chain: the end users, the service provider and the\nspectrum owner. The end users intend to transmit data on a wireless network.\nThe amount of traffic sent by the end users depends on the available frequency\nbandwidth as well as the price they have to pay for their transmission. A\nnatural question arises for the service provider: how to design an efficient\npricing scheme in order to maximize his profit. Moreover he has to take into\naccount the lease charge he has to pay to the spectrum owner and how many\nfrequency bandwidth to rent. The spectrum owner itself also looks for\nmaximizing its profit and has to determine the lease price to the service\nprovider. The equilibrium at each level of our supply chain model are\nestablished and several properties are investigated. In particular, in the case\nof a power-based pricing scheme, the service provider and the spectrum owner\ntend to share the gross provider profit.

Rather, the agents\npreferences, or at least the relevant parts thereof, need to be elicited. This\nis done by asking the agents a (hopefully small) number of simple queries about\ntheir preferences, such as comparison queries, which ask an agent to compare\ntwo of the alternatives.

As agents in multi-agent systems are regularly\nconfronted with social dilemmas, for instance in tasks such as resource\nallocation, these agents may benefit from the inclusion of mechanisms thought\nto facilitate human fairness. Although many of such mechanisms have already\nbeen implemented in a multi-agent systems context, their application is usually\nlimited to rather abstract social dilemmas with a discrete set of available\nstrategies (usually two). Given that many real-world examples of social\ndilemmas are actually continuous in nature, we extend this previous work to\nmore general dilemmas, in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space.\nThe social dilemma under study here is the well-known Ultimatum Game, in which\nan optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy. We\ninvestigate whether a scale-free interaction network facilitates agents to\nreach agreement, especially in the presence of fixed-strategy agents that\nrepresent a desired (e.g. human) outcome.

Most significantly, the auction\nis guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a\nsmall additive factor, under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders. The\nmain departure of GAI auctions from previous literature is to accommodate\nnon-additive trader preferences, hence allowing traders to condition their\nevaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes. At the same\ntime, the GAI structure supports a compact representation of prices, enabling a\ntractable auction process. We perform a simulation study, demonstrating and\nquantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference\nmodeling. We draw random GAI-structured utility functions with various internal\nstructures, generate additive functions that approximate the GAI utility, and\ncompare the performance of the auctions using the two representations. We find\nthat allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes\nimproves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:55:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Engel", "Yagil", ""], ["Wellman", "Michael P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3852", "submitter": "Gianluigi Greco", "authors": "Gianluigi Greco, Enrico Malizia, Luigi Palopoli, Francesco Scarcello", "title": "Non-Transferable Utility Coalitional Games via Mixed-Integer Linear\n  Constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 38, pages\n  633-685, 2010", "doi": "10.1613/jair.3060", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coalitional games serve the purpose of modeling payoff distribution problems\nin scenarios where agents can collaborate by forming coalitions in order to\nobtain higher worths than by acting in isolation.

However, the\nultimate origin of this behavior represents a conundrum itself. Here we aim\nspecifically at providing an evolutionary explanation of moody conditional\ncooperation. To this end, we perform an extensive analysis of different\nevolutionary dynamics for players' behavioral traits---ranging from standard\nprocesses used in game theory based on payoff comparison to others that include\nnon-economic or social factors. Our results show that only a dynamic built upon\nreinforcement learning is able to give rise to evolutionarily stable moody\nconditional cooperation, and at the end to reproduce the human behaviors\nobserved in the experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 18:16:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cimini", "Giulio", ""], ["S\u00e1nchez", "Angel", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7406", "submitter": "Jeffrey Tsang", "authors": "Jeffrey Tsang", "title": "The parametrized probabilistic finite-state transducer probe game player\n  fingerprint model", "comments": "17 pages, 35 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games\n  2(3):208-224, 2010", "doi": "10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2062512", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fingerprinting operators generate functional signatures of game players and\nare useful for their automated analysis independent of representation or\nencoding.

This work extends in a natural way the well-studied\nmodel by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a\n(small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this\ninfluence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor\ninfluence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes.\nDespite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this\nmodel limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to\napply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings\nprecisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very\nrelevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new\nproduct by distributing five \"20% off\" coupons instead of giving away one free\nproduct.\n  While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than\nintegral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions\nhave essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two\nversions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of\nfractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main\ntheoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results\nfrom the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch\n(2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we\nintroduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain\nmatching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy\n$(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case.\nIn practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better\nthan the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 20:09:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Demaine", "Erik D.", ""], ["Hajiaghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Mahini", "Hamid", ""], ["Malec", "David L.", ""], ["Raghavan", "S.", ""], ["Sawant", "Anshul", ""], ["Zadimoghadam", "Morteza", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8038", "submitter": "Sergei Chichin", "authors": "Sergei Chichin, Quoc Bao Vo, Ryszard Kowalczyk", "title": "Truthful Market-based Trading of Cloud Resources with Reservation Price", "comments": "10 pages, 18 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the rapidly growing demand for the cloud services, a need for efficient\nmethods to trade computing resources increases.
