To cope with this issue, a common\ncountermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect\nsuspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve\nthe effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly\naffected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain\nalarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is\nuncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is\ncommon when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and\nfair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nPatrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially\nuncertain alarm system which non-deterministically generates signals once a\ntarget is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary\ngraphs is APX-hard even in zero-sum games and we provide two (exponential time)\nexact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms.\nFurthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies,\nshowing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be\nfound in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in\nreal-life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show\nthat without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling\nstrategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at\nbest. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates,\nwhich, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system.

The well-known Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm has been\nshown to achieve Nash equilibrium learning in certain classes of multi-agent\ngames. However, FP can be computationally difficult to implement when the\nnumber of players is large. Sampled FP is a variant of FP that mitigates the\ncomputational difficulties arising in FP by using a Monte-Carlo (i.e.,\nsampling-based) approach. The Sampled FP algorithm has been studied both as a\ntool for distributed learning and as an optimization heuristic for large-scale\nproblems. Despite its computational advantages, a shortcoming of Sampled FP is\nthat the number of samples that must be drawn in each round of the algorithm\ngrows without bound (on the order of $\\sqrt{t}$, where $t$ is the round of the\nrepeated play). In this paper we propose Computationally Efficient Sampled FP\n(CESFP)---a variant of Sampled FP in which only one sample need be drawn each\nround of the algorithm (a substantial reduction from $O(\\sqrt{t})$ samples per\nround, as required in Sampled FP). CESFP operates using a\nstochastic-approximation type rule to estimate the expected utility from round\nto round. It is proven that the CESFP algorithm achieves Nash equilibrium\nlearning in the same sense as classical FP and Sampled FP.

The\npotential game approach has been applied to a wide range of wireless network\nproblems, particularly to a variety of channel assignment problems. In this\npaper, the properties of potential games are introduced, and games in wireless\nnetworks that have been proven to be potential games are comprehensively\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 02:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yamamoto", "Koji", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.09140", "submitter": "Olivier Serre", "authors": "Arnaud Carayol, Christof L\\\"oding, Olivier Serre", "title": "Pure Strategies in Imperfect Information Stochastic Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider imperfect information stochastic games where we require the\nplayers to use pure (i.e. non randomised) strategies.
