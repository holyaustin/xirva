In the tournament each participating strategy plays\nan iterated prisoner's dilemma against each other strategy (round-robin) and as\na variant also against itself. The participants of a tournament are all\nstrategies that are deterministic and have the same size of memory with regard\nto their own and their opponent's past actions: up to three most recent actions\nof their opponent and up to two most recent actions of their own. A focus is\nset on the investigation of the influence of the number of iterations, details\nof the payoff matrix, and the influence of memory size. The main result is that\nfor the tournament as carried out here, different strategies emerge as winners\nfor different payoff matrices, even for different payoff matrices being similar\njudged on if they fulfill relations T + S = P + R or 2R > T + S. As a\nconsequence of this result it is suggested that whenever the iterated\nprisoner's dilemma is used to model a real system that does not explicitly fix\nthe payoff matrix, one should check if conclusions remain valid, when a\ndifferent payoff matrix is used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Jan 2011 14:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kretz", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1007", "submitter": "Bart de Keijzer", "authors": "Haris Aziz and Bart de Keijzer", "title": "Complexity of coalition structure generation", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We revisit the coalition structure generation problem in which the goal is to\npartition the players into exhaustive and disjoint coalitions so as to maximize\nthe social welfare.

A key\nfeature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network\neffect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the\nusage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's\noptimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who\nhave a central position in the underlying network.\n  First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized\nprices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each\nconsumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it\nis optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional\nto her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the\npaper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a\nsingle uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the\nnumber of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the\nmonopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the\nproblem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We\nshow that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted\nprice.

We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price\nallocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit.\nFinally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits\nof a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when\nchoosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information\noptimally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 20:31:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Candogan", "Ozan", ""], ["Bimpikis", "Kostas", ""], ["Ozdaglar", "Asuman", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5828", "submitter": "Gabriel Acosta Gabriel Acosta", "authors": "Gabriel Acosta, In\\'es Caridi, Sebasti\\'an Guala, Javier Marenco", "title": "The Full Strategy Minority Game", "comments": "To appear in Physica A", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2011.07.049", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Full Strategy Minority Game (FSMG) is an instance of the Minority Game\n(MG) which includes a single copy of every potential agent.
