Since users are\nexpected to arrive dynamically at traffic intersections, static pricing\napproaches may fail to estimate user expected waiting time accurately, and lead\nto non-strategyproof payments.

We focus on three practically-relevant utility classes:\nlinear, quasilinear, and Leontief utilities. Using structural properties of\nmarket equilibria under each utility class, we show that the corresponding\nconvex programs can be reformulated as optimization of a structured smooth\nconvex function over a polyhedral set, for which projected gradient achieves\nlinear convergence. To do so, we utilize recent linear convergence results\nunder weakened strong-convexity conditions, and further refine the relevant\nconstants in existing convergence results. Then, we show that proximal gradient\n(a generalization of projected gradient) with a practical linesearch scheme\nachieves linear convergence under the Proximal-PL condition, a recently\ndeveloped error bound condition for convex composite problems. For quasilinear\nutilities, we show that Mirror Descent applied to a new convex program achieves\nsublinear last-iterate convergence and yields a form of Proportional Response\ndynamics, an elegant, interpretable algorithm for computing market equilibria\noriginally developed for linear utilities. Numerical experiments show that\nProportional Response dynamics is highly efficient for computing approximate\nmarket equilibria, while projected gradient with linesearch can be much faster\nwhen higher-accuracy solutions are needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2020 19:02:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2020 01:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Yuan", ""], ["Kroer", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.06875", "submitter": "Lirong Xia", "authors": "Lirong Xia", "title": "The Smoothed Possibility of Social Choice", "comments": "NeurIPS 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a framework that leverages the smoothed complexity analysis by\nSpielman and Teng to circumvent paradoxes and impossibility theorems in social\nchoice, motivated by modern applications of social choice powered by AI and ML.\nFor Condrocet's paradox, we prove that the smoothed likelihood of the paradox\neither vanishes at an exponential rate as the number of agents increases, or\ndoes not vanish at all.

As $\\epsilon$-soundness can be difficult to compute in general, we\nintroduce a consistency framework -- a hierarchy that connects an online\nalgorithm's behavior to a Nash equilibrium. These multiple levels of\nconsistency describe in what sense an online algorithm plays \"just like a fixed\nNash equilibrium\". These notions further illustrate the difference between\nperfect and imperfect information settings, as the same consistency guarantees\nhave different worst-case online performance in perfect and imperfect\ninformation games. The definitions of soundness and the consistency hierarchy\nfinally provide appropriate tools to analyze online algorithms in repeated\nimperfect information games.

Due to the strategic nature of the\nsender not all the transmitted information is truthful, which leads to\nquestion: how much true information can be recovered by the receiver from such\na sender? We study this question in this paper. We pose the problem as a game\nbetween the sender and receiver, where the receiver tries to maximize the\nnumber of sequences that can be recovered perfectly and the sender maximizes\nits utility. We show that, in spite of the sender being strategic and the\npresence of noise in the channel, there is a strategy for the receiver by which\nit can perfectly recover an \\textit{exponentially} large number of sequences.\nOur analysis leads to the notion of the \\textit{information extraction\ncapacity} of the sender which quantifies the growth rate of the number of\nrecovered sequences with blocklength, in the presence of a noiseless channel.\nWe identify cases where this capacity is equal to its theoretical maximum, and\nalso when it is strictly less than maximum. In the latter case, we show that\nthe capacity is sandwiched between the independence number and the Shannon\ncapacity of a suitably defined graph. These results lead to an exact\ncharacterization of the information extraction capacity in large number of\ncases. We show that in the presence of a noisy channel, the rate of information\nextraction achieved by the receiver is the minimum of the zero-error capacity\nof the channel and the information extraction capacity of the sender.

Group Pareto\nefficiency requires that no group can be made better off without another group\nbe made worse off. We study these new group properties from an axiomatic\nviewpoint. We thus propose new fairness taxonomies that generalize existing\ntaxonomies. We further study near versions of these group properties as\nallocations for some of them may not exist. We finally give three prices of\ngroup fairness between group properties for three common social welfares (i.e.\nutilitarian, egalitarian, and Nash).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:38:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Aleksandrov", "Martin", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.15900", "submitter": "Martin Aleksandrov D", "authors": "Martin Aleksandrov and Toby Walsh", "title": "Strategy-proofness, Envy-freeness and Pareto efficiency in Online Fair\n  Division with Additive Utilities", "comments": "13 pages, 1 table, 1 figure, PRICAI 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider fair division problems where indivisible items arrive one-by-one\nin an online fashion and are allocated immediately to agents who have additive\nutilities over these items.

In\nthis paper we introduce an approach that shows that it is possible to provide\nexploitability guarantees in such settings without ever exploring the entire\ngame. We introduce a notion of a certificate of an extensive-form approximate\nNash equilibrium. For verifying a certificate, we give an algorithm that runs\nin time linear in the size of the certificate rather than the size of the whole\ngame. In zero-sum games, we further show that an optimal certificate -- given\nthe exploration so far -- can be computed with any standard game-solving\nalgorithm (e.g., using a linear program or counterfactual regret minimization).\nHowever, unlike in the cases of normal form or perfect information, we show\nthat certain families of extensive-form games do not have small approximate\ncertificates, even after making extremely nice assumptions on the structure of\nthe game. Despite this difficulty, we find experimentally that very small\ncertificates, even exact ones, often exist in large and even in infinite games.\nOverall, our approach enables one to try one's favorite exploration strategies\nwhile offering exploitability guarantees, thereby decoupling the exploration\nstrategy from the equilibrium-finding process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 21:11:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2020 04:32:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Brian Hu", ""], ["Sandholm", "Tuomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16395", "submitter": "Olivier Buffet", "authors": "Olivier Buffet, Jilles Dibangoye, Aur\\'elien Delage, Abdallah\n  Saffidine, Vincent Thomas", "title": "On Bellman's Optimality Principle for zs-POSGs", "comments": "18 pages, 0 figures, 1 algorithm", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many non-trivial sequential decision-making problems are efficiently solved\nby relying on Bellman's optimality principle, i.e., exploiting the fact that\nsub-problems are nested recursively within the original problem.
