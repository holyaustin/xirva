Suppose we have a\nvoting rule that takes all of the votes and produces a single outcome and\nsuppose that each individual voter has little effect on the outcome of the\nvoting rule. If the voting rule is a weighted plurality, then we show that with\nhigh probability, the preferred candidate will win the election. Conversely, we\nshow that this statement fails for all other reasonable voting rules.\n  This result is an extension of H\\\"aggstr\\\"om, Kalai and Mossel, who proved\nthe above in the case k=2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 15:53:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 07:54:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Neeman", "Joe", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5448", "submitter": "Lirong Xia", "authors": "Vincent Conitzer and Toby Walsh and Lirong Xia", "title": "Dominating Manipulations in Voting with Partial Information", "comments": "7 pages by arxiv pdflatex, 1 figure.

Such partial information is\ndescribed by an information set, which is the set of profiles of the\nnonmanipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an\ninformation set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the\nmanipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and\nsometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully.\nWhen the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there\nexists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known\nresults). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no\ndominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's\ninformation is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the\npreferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for\nmany common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can\nprevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other\nvoters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 17:10:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Conitzer", "Vincent", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""], ["Xia", "Lirong", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5596", "submitter": "Mario Bravo", "authors": "Mario Bravo", "title": "An adjusted payoff-based procedure for normal form games", "comments": "19 pages, final version appeared in Math.

Each player, in order to update her mixed action, computes the\naverage vector payoff she has obtained by using the number of times she has\nplayed each pure action.
