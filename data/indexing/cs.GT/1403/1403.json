Users select servers in a distributed\nmanner. They initially attach to an arbitrary server. However, at random\ninstants of time, they may probe the load at a new server and migrate there to\nimprove their service rate. We analyze the system dynamics under the natural\nRandom Local Search (RLS) migration scheme, introduced in \\cite{sig10}. Under\nthis scheme, when a user has the opportunity to switch servers, she does it\nonly if this improves her service rate. The dynamics under RLS may be\ninterpreted as those generated by strategic players updating their strategy in\na load balancing game. In closed systems, where the user population is fixed,\nwe show that this game has pure Nash Equilibriums (NEs), and we analyze their\nefficiency. We further prove that when the user population grows large, pure\nNEs get closer to a Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation of users to servers,\nand we characterize the gap between equilibriums and this ideal allocation\ndepending on user population. Under the RLS algorithm, the system converges to\npure NEs: we study the time it takes for the system to reach the PF allocation\nwithin a certain margin. In open systems, where users randomly enter the system\nand leave upon service completion, we establish that the RLS algorithm\nstabilizes the system whenever this it at all possible, i.e., it is\nthroughput-optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 11:51:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 20:40:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Yun", "Se-Young", ""], ["Proutiere", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.5468", "submitter": "Jian-Jun Shu", "authors": "Jian-Jun Shu and Qi-Wen Wang", "title": "Beyond Parrondo's paradox", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports, Vol. 4, No. 4244, pp. 1-9, 2014", "doi": "10.1038/srep04244", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Parrondo's paradox is a counterintuitive phenomenon where\nindividually-losing strategies can be combined in producing a winning\nexpectation.

Each seller can offer multiple units of a commodity depending on the\navailability of the commodity which is random and may be different for\ndifferent sellers. Sellers seek to select a price that will be attractive to\nthe buyers and also fetch adequate profits. The selection will in general\ndepend on the number of units available with the seller and also that of its\ncompetitor - the seller may only know the statistics of the latter. The setting\ncaptures a secondary spectrum access network, a non-neutral Internet, or a\nmicrogrid network in which unused spectrum bands, resources of ISPs, and excess\npower units constitute the respective commodities of sale. We analyze this\nprice competition as a game, and identify a set of necessary and sufficient\nproperties for the Nash Equilibrium (NE). The properties reveal that sellers\nrandomize their price using probability distributions whose support sets are\nmutually disjoint and in decreasing order of the number of availability. We\nprove the uniqueness of a symmetric NE in a symmetric market, and explicitly\ncompute the price distribution in the symmetric NE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Mar 2014 23:51:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 01:07:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 19:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lotfi", "Mohammad Hassan", ""], ["Sarkar", "Saswati", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7707", "submitter": "Ephraim Zehavi Prof.", "authors": "Ephraim Zehavi and Amir Leshem", "title": "On the allocation of multiple divisible assets to players with different\n  utilities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When there is a dispute between players on how to divide multiple divisible\nassets, how should it be resolved?
