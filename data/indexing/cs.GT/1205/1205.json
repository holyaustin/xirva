Fair division may be accomplished in a\ndistributed or centralized way. Due to its natural and practical appeal, it has\nbeen a subject of study in economics. To best of our knowledge the role of\npartial information in fair division has not been studied so far from an\ninformation theoretic perspective. In this paper we study two important\nalgorithms in fair division, namely \"divide and choose\" and \"adjusted winner\"\nfor the case of two agents. We quantify the benefit of negotiation in the\ndivide and choose algorithm, and its use in tricking the adjusted winner\nalgorithm. Also we analyze the role of implicit information transmission\nthrough actions for the repeated divide and choose problem by finding a\ntrembling hand perfect equilibrium for an specific setup. Lastly we consider a\ncentralized algorithm for maximizing the overall welfare of the agents under\nthe Nash collective utility function (CUF). This corresponds to a clustering\nproblem of the type traditionally studied in data mining and machine learning.\nDrawing a conceptual link between this problem and the portfolio selection\nproblem in stock markets, we prove an upper bound on the increase of the Nash\nCUF for a clustering refinement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2012 12:00:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2013 09:44:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 21:28:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Delgosha", "Payam", ""], ["Gohari", "Amin", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4564", "submitter": "Marco Chiesa", "authors": "Marco Chiesa, Giuseppe Di Battista, Thomas Erlebach and Maurizio\n  Patrignani", "title": "Computational Complexity of Traffic Hijacking under BGP and S-BGP", "comments": "17 pages with 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Harmful Internet hijacking incidents put in evidence how fragile the Border\nGateway Protocol (BGP) is, which is used to exchange routing information\nbetween Autonomous Systems (ASes).

The total payoff for each player is then the\nconvex combination, with the corresponding weights, of the payoffs it obtains\nin the basic games. The basic games in a MG can be regarded as different\nenvironments for the players.

Hopcroft and D. Sheldon originally introduced network reputation games to\ninvestigate the self-interested behavior of web authors who want to maximize\ntheir PageRank on a directed web graph by choosing their outlinks in a game\ntheoretic manner. They give best response strategies for each player and\ncharacterize properties of web graphs which are Nash equilibria. In this paper\nwe consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such\nas certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at\nwill, but typically cannot add links without the other player's permission. In\nthe deletion-model players are free to delete any of their bidirectional links\nbut may not add links. We study the problem of determining whether the given\ngraph represents a Nash equilibrium or not in this model. We give an $O(n^{2})$\ntime algorithm for a tree, and a parametric $O(2^{k}n^{4})$ time algorithm for\ngeneral graphs, where $k$ is the maximum vertex degree in any biconnected\ncomponent of the graph. In the request- delete-model players are free to delete\nany bidirectional links and add any directed links, since these additions can\nbe done unilaterally and can be viewed as requests for bidirected links. For\nthis model we give an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in\ntrees. Finally, in the add-delete- model we allow a node to make arbitrary\ndeletions and the addition of a single bidirectional link if it would increase\nthe page rank of the other player also. In this model we give a parametric\nalgorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in general graphs and characterize so\ncalled $\\alpha$-insensitive Nash Equilibria.
