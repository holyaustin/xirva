In\nparticular, assuming that a linear multiuser detector is adopted in the uplink\nreceiver, the case considered is that in which each terminal is allowed to vary\nits transmit power, spreading code, and uplink receiver in order to maximize\nits own utility, which is defined as the ratio of data throughput to transmit\npower. Resorting to a game-theoretic formulation, a non-cooperative game for\nutility maximization is formulated, and it is proved that a unique Nash\nequilibrium exists, which, under certain conditions, is also Pareto-optimal.\nTheoretical results concerning the relationship between the problems of SINR\nmaximization and MSE minimization are given, and, resorting to the tools of\nlarge system analysis, a new distributed power control algorithm is\nimplemented, based on very little prior information about the user of interest.\nThe utility profile achieved by the active users in a large CDMA system is also\ncomputed, and, moreover, the centralized socially optimum solution is analyzed.\nConsiderations on the extension of the proposed framework to a multi-cell\nscenario are also briefly detailed. Simulation results confirm that the\nproposed non-cooperative game largely outperforms competing alternatives, and\nthat it exhibits a quite small performance loss with respect to the socially\noptimum solution, and only in the case in which the users number exceeds the\nprocessing gain. Finally, results also show an excellent agreement between the\ntheoretical closed-form formulas based on large system analysis and the outcome\nof numerical experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2007 17:26:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Buzzi", "Stefano", ""], ["Poor", "H.
