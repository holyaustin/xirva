It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper\nsubclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame\nperfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the\nend of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued\npayoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,\nworks of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This\npaper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff\nfunctions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the\nusual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,\ncalled preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash\nequilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still\nbe defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are\nequivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential\ngame has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect\nequilibrium. The result is fully computer-certified using Coq.
