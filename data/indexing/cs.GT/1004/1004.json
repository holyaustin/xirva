We show that\nthe opposite is true: creating a randomized truthful mechanism is essentially\nas easy as a single call to a monotone allocation rule. Our main result is a\ngeneral procedure to take a monotone allocation rule for a single-parameter\ndomain and transform it (via a black-box reduction) into a randomized mechanism\nthat is truthful in expectation and individually rational for every\nrealization. The mechanism implements the same outcome as the original\nallocation rule with probability arbitrarily close to 1, and requires\nevaluating that allocation rule only once. We also provide an extension of this\nresult to multi-parameter domains and cycle-monotone allocation rules, under\nmild star-convexity and non-negativity hypotheses on the type space and\nallocation rule, respectively.\n  Because our reduction is simple, versatile, and general, it has many\napplications to mechanism design problems in which re-evaluating the allocation\nrule is either burdensome or informationally impossible. Applying our result to\nthe multi-armed bandit problem, we obtain truthful randomized mechanisms whose\nregret matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors,\neven though prior work showed this is impossible for truthful deterministic\nmechanisms. We also present applications to offline mechanism design, showing\nthat randomization can circumvent a communication complexity lower bound for\ndeterministic payments computation, and that it can also be used to create\ntruthful shortest path auctions that approximate the welfare of the VCG\nallocation arbitrarily well, while having the same running time complexity as\nDijkstra's algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2010 06:32:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2012 23:04:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2012 21:43:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 18:28:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 19:42:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Babaioff", "Moshe", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Robert D.", ""], ["Slivkins", "Aleksandrs", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4317", "submitter": "MohammadHossein Bateni", "authors": "MohammadHossein Bateni and MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi and Nicole\n  Immorlica and Hamid Mahini", "title": "The cooperative game theory foundations of network bargaining games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study bargaining games between suppliers and manufacturers in a network\ncontext. Agents wish to enter into contracts in order to generate surplus which\nthen must be divided among the participants. Potential contracts and their\nsurplus are represented by weighted edges in our bipartite network. Each agent\nin the market is additionally limited by a capacity representing the number of\ncontracts which he or she may undertake. When all agents are limited to just\none contract each, prior research applied natural generalizations of the Nash\nbargaining solution to the networked setting, defined the new solution concepts\nof stable and balanced, and characterized the resulting bargaining outcomes. We\nsimplify and generalize these results to a setting in which participants in\nonly one side of the market are limited to one contract each. The heart of our\nresults uses a linear-programming formulation to establish a novel connection\nbetween well-studied cooperative game theory concepts (such as core and\nprekernel) and the solution concepts of stable and balanced defined for the\nbargaining games. This immediately implies one can take advantage of the\nresults and algorithms in cooperative game theory to reproduce results such as\nthose of Azar et al. [1] and Kleinberg and Tardos [29] and also generalize them\nto our setting. The cooperative-game-theoretic connection also inspires us to\nrefine our solution space using standard solution concepts from that literature\nsuch as nucleolus and lexicographic kernel. The nucleolus is particularly\nattractive as it is unique, always exists, and is supported by experimental\ndata in the network bargaining literature. Guided by algorithms from\ncooperative game theory, we show how to compute the nucleolus by pruning and\niteratively solving a natural linear-programming formulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Apr 2010 01:50:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bateni", "MohammadHossein", ""], ["Hajiaghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Immorlica", "Nicole", ""], ["Mahini", "Hamid", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4727", "submitter": "Krzysztof R.

Unlike what is commonly admitted,\nwe show that, provided one assumes that the other agent will always stop,\nbidding is rational, because it results in a subgame perfect equilibrium. We\nshow that this is not the only rational strategy profile (the only subgame\nperfect equilibrium). Indeed if an agent stops and will stop at every step, we\nclaim that he is rational as well, if one admits that his opponent will never\nstop, because this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium. Amazingly, in\nthe infinite dollar auction game, the behavior in which both agents stop at\neach step is not a Nash equilibrium, hence is not a subgame perfect\nequilibrium, hence is not rational.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2010 12:03:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lescanne", "Pierre", "", "LIP"], ["Matthieu", "Perrinel", "", "LIP"]]}]
