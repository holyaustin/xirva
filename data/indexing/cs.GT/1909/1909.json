This model arises naturally\nfrom the assortment optimization problem, in that the single-buyer optimization\nproblem over deterministic mechanisms reduces to deciding on an assortment of\nitems to \"show\". We study its multi-buyer generalization in the simplest\nsetting of single-winner auctions, or more broadly, any service-constrained\nenvironment. Our main result is that if the buyer rankings are drawn\nindependently from Markov Chain ranking models, then the optimal mechanism is\ncomputationally tractable, and structurally a virtual welfare maximizer.

A novel general model for extending network utility maximization (NUM)\nproblems to incorporate local information is proposed, which allows each user\nto choose its own objective locally and/or privately. Two specific problems,\ni.e., a user-centric problem (UCP) and a network-centric problem (NCP), are\nstudied. In the UCP, a network center aims to maximize the collective benefit\nof all users, and truthful reporting from the users regarding their local\ninformation is necessary for finding the solution. We show that the\nwidely-adopted dual pricing cannot guarantee truthful information reporting\nfrom a user unless the resource is over-supplied or the price is too high for\nthis user to afford. In the NCP, the network center has its own objective and\npreferred solution, and incentive needs to be provided for the users to adopt\nthe solution it prefers. Truthful reporting from users is necessary for the\ncenter to determine the incentives and achieve its solution.

This paper identifies and analyzes, a novel Denial-of-Service attack\nwhich is based on route hijacking, i.e., which exploits the way transactions\nare routed and executed along the created channels of the network. This attack\nis conceptually interesting as even a limited attacker that manipulates the\ntopology through the creation of new channels can navigate tradeoffs related to\nthe way it attacks the network. Furthermore, the attack also highlights a\nfundamental design tradeoff for the defender (who determines its own routes):\nto become less predictable and hence secure, a rational node has to pay higher\nfees to nodes that forward its payments. We find that the three most common\nimplementations for payment channels in Bitcoin (lnd, C-lightning, Eclair)\napproach routing differently. We begin by surveying the current state of the\nLightning network and explore the routes chosen by these implementations. We\nfind that in the current network nearly 60\\% of all routes pass through only\nfive nodes, while 80\\% go through only 10 nodes. Thus, a relatively small\nnumber of colluding nodes can deny service to a large fraction of the network.\n  We then turn to study an external attacker who creates links to the network\nand draws more routes through its nodes by asking for lower fees. We find that\njust five new links are enough to draw the majority (65\\% - 75\\%) of the\ntraffic regardless of the implementation being used.

In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield\nuncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time\nuncertainty or, \"soft\" supply caps).

In the presence of\nyield uncertainty only, the resulting supply chain networks are sparse.\nRetailers concentrate their links on a single supplier, counter to the idea\nthat they should mitigate yield uncertainty by diversifying their supply base.\nThis happens because retailers benefit from supply variance. It suggests that\ncompetition will amplify output uncertainty. When congestion is included as\nwell, the resulting networks are denser and resemble the bipartite expander\ngraphs that have been proposed in the supply chain literature, thereby,\nproviding the first example of endogenous formation of resilient supply chain\nnetworks, without resilience being explicitly encoded in payoffs.

Obtaining the optimal private\nmechanism involves two steps: first, solve a linear program to get the marginal\nprobability each agent should be recommended to move; second, sample the moving\nagents satisfying the marginal probabilities with a sequential sampling\nprocedure. For public signaling, we show the sender preferred equilibrium has a\nsimple threshold structure and the optimal public mechanism with respect to the\nsender preferred equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time. We support our\nanalytical results with numerical computations that show the optimal private\nand public signaling mechanisms achieve substantially higher social welfare\ncompared with no information or full information benchmarks in many settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2019 14:54:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Pu", ""], ["Iyer", "Krishnamurthy", ""], ["Frazier", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13031", "submitter": "Sarath Yasodharan", "authors": "Sarath Yasodharan, Patrick Loiseau", "title": "Nonzero-sum Adversarial Hypothesis Testing Games", "comments": "23 pages, 14 figures.
