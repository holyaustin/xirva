However,\ngiven the prior information that sellers are patient and the demand is not more\nthan the supply, a deterministic and truthful greedy mechanism is actually\n2-competitive, i.e. it guarantees that the social welfare of its allocation is\nat least half of the optimal one achievable offline. Moreover, if the number of\nincoming buyers is predictable, we demonstrate that an online double auction\ncan be reduced to an online one-sided auction, and the truthfulness and\ncompetitiveness of the reduced online double auction follow that of the online\none-sided auction. Notably, by using the reduction, we find a truthful\nmechanism that is almost 1-competitive, when buyers arrive randomly. Finally,\nwe argue that these mechanisms also have a promising applicability in more\ngeneral settings without assuming that sellers are patient, by decomposing a\nmarket into multiple sub-markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 14:45:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Dengji", ""], ["Zhang", "Dongmo", ""], ["Perrussel", "Laurent", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0803", "submitter": "Marcin Makowski", "authors": "Marcin Makowski, Edward W.

Most of the\nliterature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agents\nknow in advance the value of linking to other agents, even with agents they\nhave never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct or\nindirect). This paper addresses the same questions under what seems to us to be\nthe much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not know\nin advance -- but must learn -- the value of linking to agents they have never\nmet. We show that the assumption of incomplete information has profound\nimplications for the process of network formation and the topology of networks\nthat ultimately form. Under complete information, the networks that form and\nare stable typically have a star, wheel or core-periphery form, with high-value\nagents in the core. Under incomplete information, the presence of positive\nexternalities (the value of indirect links) implies that a much wider\ncollection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. Moreover, even when\nthe topologies that emerge are the same, the locations of agents can be very\ndifferent. For instance, when information is incomplete, it is possible for a\nhub-and-spokes network with a low-value agent in the center to form and endure\npermanently: an agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of\nchance rather than as the result of merit. Perhaps even more strikingly: when\ninformation is incomplete, a connected network could form and persist even if,\nwhen information were complete, no links would ever form, so that the final\nform would be a totally disconnected network.

However, large $n$ player interactions are more realistically\nmodeled as games of incomplete information, where players may know little to\nnothing about the types of other players. Unfortunately, games in incomplete\ninformation settings lose many of the nice properties of complete information\ngames: the quality of equilibria can become worse, the equilibria lose their\nex-post properties, and coordinating on an equilibrium becomes even more\ndifficult. Because of these problems, we would like to study games of\nincomplete information, but still implement equilibria of the complete\ninformation game induced by the (unknown) realized player types.\n  This problem was recently studied by Kearns et al. and solved in large games\nby means of introducing a weak mediator: their mediator took as input reported\ntypes of players, and output suggested actions which formed a correlated\nequilibrium of the underlying game. Players had the option to play\nindependently of the mediator, or ignore its suggestions, but crucially, if\nthey decided to opt-in to the mediator, they did not have the power to lie\nabout their type. In this paper, we rectify this deficiency in the setting of\nlarge congestion games. We give, in a sense, the weakest possible mediator: it\ncannot enforce participation, verify types, or enforce its suggestions.\nMoreover, our mediator implements a Nash equilibrium of the complete\ninformation game. We show that it is an (asymptotic) ex-post equilibrium of the\nincomplete information game for all players to use the mediator honestly, and\nthat when they do so, they end up playing an approximate Nash equilibrium of\nthe induced complete information game. In particular, truthful use of the\nmediator is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in any Bayesian game for any prior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 21:50:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 16:26:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Rogers", "Ryan", ""], ["Roth", "Aaron", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.2655", "submitter": "Siddharth Barman", "authors": "Siddharth Barman, Umang Bhaskar, Federico Echenique and Adam Wierman", "title": "On the Existence of Low-Rank Explanations for Mixed Strategy Behavior", "comments": "Updated writeup. 19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nash equilibrium is used as a model to explain the observed behavior of\nplayers in strategic settings.

In boolean games\nagents exercise control over propositional variables and strive to achieve a\ngoal formula whose realization might require the opponents' cooperation.\nRecently, a theory of incentive engineering for such games has been devised,\nwhere an external authority steers the outcome of the game towards certain\ndesirable properties consistent with players' goals, by imposing a taxation\nmechanism on the players that makes the outcomes that do not comply with those\nproperties less appealing to them. The present contribution stems from a\ncomplementary perspective and studies, instead, how games with\nquasi-dichotomous preferences can be transformed from inside, rather than from\noutside, by endowing players with the possibility of sacrificing a part of\ntheir payoff received at a certain outcome in order to convince other players\nto play a certain strategy.

The buyer's valuations towards the two items are independent and\nadditive. In this setting, optimal mechanism is unknown for general valuation\ndistributions. We obtain two categories of structural results that shed light\non the optimal mechanisms.\n  The first category of results state that, under certain mild condition, the\noptimal mechanism has a monotone menu. In other words, in the menu that\nrepresents the optimal mechanism, as payment increases, the allocation\nprobabilities for both items increase simultaneously. Applying this theorem, we\nderive a version of revenue monotonicity theorem that states stochastically\nsuperior distributions yield more revenue. Moreover, our theorem subsumes a\nprevious result regarding sufficient conditions under which bundling is\noptimal. The second category of results state that, under certain conditions,\nthe optimal mechanisms have few menu items. Our first result in this category\nsays, for certain distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 4 items. The\ncondition admits power (including uniform) density functions. Based on a\nsimilar proof of this result, we are able to obtain a wide class of\ndistributions where bundling is optimal. Our second result in this category\nworks for a weaker condition, under which the optimal menu contains at most 6\nitems. This condition includes exponential density functions. Our last result\nin this category works for unit-demand setting. It states that, for uniform\ndistributions, the optimal menu contains at most 5 items. All these results are\nin sharp contrast to Hart and Nisan's recent result that finite-sized menu\ncannot guarantee any positive fraction of optimal revenue for correlated\nvaluation distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Nov 2013 07:03:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 06:38:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zihe", ""], ["Tang", "Pingzhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.6230", "submitter": "David Sun", "authors": "Jiajun Sun", "title": "Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Incentive Mechanism for Crowdsourcing\n  Market Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, a novel class of incentive mechanisms is proposed to attract\nextensive users to truthfully participate in crowd sensing applications with a\ngiven budget constraint.
