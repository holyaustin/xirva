Finding optimal joint actions is especially challenging\nwhen each agent has only imperfect information about the state of its\nenvironment. Such problems can be modeled as collaborative Bayesian games in\nwhich each agent receives private information in the form of its type. However,\nrepresenting and solving such games requires space and computation time\nexponential in the number of agents. This article introduces collaborative\ngraphical Bayesian games (CGBGs), which facilitate more efficient collaborative\ndecision making by decomposing the global payoff function as the sum of local\npayoff functions that depend on only a few agents. We propose a framework for\nthe efficient solution of CGBGs based on the insight that they posses two\ndifferent types of independence, which we call agent independence and type\nindependence. In particular, we present a factor graph representation that\ncaptures both forms of independence and thus enables efficient solutions.

While most of such sociometrics (e.g.,\nPageRank) are driven by intuitions based on an actors location in a network,\nasking for the \"most influential\" actors in itself is an ill-posed question,\nunless it is put in context with a specific measurable task. Constructing a\npredictive task of interest in a given domain provides a mechanism to\nquantitatively compare different measures of influence. Furthermore, when we\nknow what type of actionable insight to gather, we need not rely on a single\nnetwork centrality measure. A combination of measures is more likely to capture\nvarious aspects of the social network that are predictive and beneficial for\nthe task.

There is an inherent tradeoff between how general a\nlanguage is, allowing it to capture more elaborate games, and how hard it is\ncomputationally to optimize and solve such games. One prominent such language\nis the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation [14],\nwhich maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge\nweighted graph.\n  We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs.\nThe agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition\nis the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The\noptimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that\nmaximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding\nthe optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is\nalso intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are\namenable for many other combinatorial problems.

Hence, traditional optimization methods for\ncommunities composed of compliant users such as network utility maximization\ncannot be applied here. In our prior work, we show how social reciprocation\nprotocols can be designed in online communities which have populations\nconsisting of a continuum of users and are stationary under stochastic\npermutations. Under these assumptions, we are able to prove that users\nvoluntarily comply with the pre-determined social norms and cooperate with\nother users in the community by providing their services. In this paper, we\ngeneralize the study by analyzing the interactions of self-interested users in\nonline communities with finite populations and are not stationary. To optimize\ntheir long-term performance based on their knowledge, users adapt their\nstrategies to play their best response by solving individual stochastic control\nproblems. The best-response dynamic introduces a stochastic dynamic process in\nthe community, in which the strategies of users evolve over time. We then\ninvestigate the long-term evolution of a community, and prove that the\ncommunity will converge to stochastically stable equilibria which are stable\nagainst stochastic permutations. Understanding the evolution of a community\nprovides protocol designers with guidelines for designing social norms in which\nno user has incentives to adapt its strategy and deviate from the prescribed\nprotocol, thereby ensuring that the adopted protocol will enable the community\nto achieve the optimal social welfare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 04:18:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5669", "submitter": "Maria Florina Balcan", "authors": "Maria Florina Balcan, Florin Constantin, Satoru Iwata, Lei Wang", "title": "Learning Valuation Functions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the approximate learnability of valuations commonly\nused throughout economics and game theory for the quantitative encoding of\nagent preferences.

This\nhighlights the importance of considering the complexity of the target function\nfor polynomial time learning. We also provide new learning results for\ninteresting subclasses of submodular functions.\n  Our upper bounds for distributional learning leverage novel structural\nresults for all these valuation classes.
