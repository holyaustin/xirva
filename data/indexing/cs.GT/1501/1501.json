In this\npaper, we investigate both classic and parameterized computational complexity\nof electoral campaign management under such rules. We focus on two methods that\ncan be used to promote a given candidate: asking voters to move this candidate\nupwards in their preference order or asking them to change the number of\ncandidates they approve of. We show that finding an optimal campaign management\nstrategy of the first type is easy for both Bucklin and Fallback. In contrast,\nthe second method is computationally hard even if the degree to which we need\nto affect the votes is small.

Selfish agents with\nprivate information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator,\nand can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each\nmediator aims to optimize the combined utility of his agents, while the\nmechanism aims to optimize the combined utility of all agents. We focus on the\nproblem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With\nnon-strategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is\noptimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there\nis no dominant strategy mechanism that achieves any approximation. We, thus,\nslightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of a two-sided\nincentive compatible mechanism. We show that the $3$-competitive deterministic\nmechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz (2013) and Dekel et al. (2010)\nfor lines extends naturally to trees, and is still $3$-competitive as well as\ntwo-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible. We then\nshow that by allowing randomization one can construct a $2$-competitive\nrandomized mechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also\nessentially tight. This result also closes a gap left in the work of Procaccia\nand Tennenholtz (2013) and Lu et al.

The conventional answer\nbased on analysis of games such as the Prisoners Dilemma (PD) is that it is\nnot, even though mutual cooperation results in a better outcome for all. This\nincompatibility between individual rationality and collective benefit lies at\nthe heart of questions about the evolution of cooperation, as illustrated by PD\nand similar games. Here, we argue that this apparent incompatibility is due to\nan inconsistency in the standard Nash framework for analyzing non-cooperative\ngames and propose a new paradigm, that of the co-action equilibrium. As in the\nNash solution, agents know that others are just as rational as them and taking\nthis into account leads them to realize that others will independently adopt\nthe same strategy, in contrast to the idea of unilateral deviation central to\nNash equilibrium thinking. Co-action equilibrium results in better collective\noutcomes for games representing social dilemmas, with relatively \"nicer\"\nstrategies being chosen by rational selfish individuals. In particular, the\ndilemma of PD gets resolved within this framework, suggesting that cooperation\ncan evolve in nature as the rational outcome even for selfish agents, without\nhaving to take recourse to additional mechanisms for promoting it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 11:52:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 10:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sasidevan", "V.", ""], ["Sinha", "Sitabhra", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05405", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Manuela Bujorianu (University of Leicester), Rafael Wisniewski\n  (Aalborg University)", "title": "Proceedings 4th Workshop on Hybrid Autonomous Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 174, 2015", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.174", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.CC cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The interest in autonomous systems is increasing both in industry and\nacademia.
