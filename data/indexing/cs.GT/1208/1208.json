In a realistic spectrum trading market, the\nrequests from secondary users often specify the usage of a fixed spectrum\nfrequency band in a certain geographical region and require a duration time in\na fixed available time interval. Considering the selfish behaviors of secondary\nusers, it is imperative to design a truthful auction which matches the\navailable spectrums and requests of secondary users optimally. Unfortunately,\nexisting designs either do not consider spectrum heterogeneity or ignore the\ndifferences of required time among secondary users. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by investigating how to use auction mechanisms to allocate and\nprice spectrum resources so that the social efficiency can be maximized. We\nbegin by classifying the spectrums and requests from secondary users into\ndifferent local markets which ensures there is no interference between local\nmarkets, and then we can focus on the auction in a single local market. We\nfirst design an optimal auction based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)\nmechanism to maximize the social efficiency while enforcing truthfulness. To\nreduce the computational complexity, we further propose a truthful sub-optimal\nauction with polynomial time complexity, which yields an approximation factor\n6+4\\surd2. Our extensive simulation results using real spectrum availability\ndata show that the social efficiency ratio of the sub-optimal auction is always\nabove 70% compared with the optimal auction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 09:14:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "He", ""], ["Sun", "Yu-e", ""], ["Li", "Xiang-yang", ""], ["Xu", "Hongli", ""], ["Zhou", "Yousong", ""], ["Huang", "Liusheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0283", "submitter": "Gabriel Istrate", "authors": "Cosmin Bonchis and Gabriel Istrate", "title": "A Parametric Worst-Case Approach to Fairness in TU-Cooperative Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a parametric family of measures of fairness in allocations of\nTU-cooperative games.

In a Chinese auction, multiple\nplayers compete for several items by buying tickets, which can be used to win\nthe items. In front of each item there is a basket, and the players can bid by\nplacing tickets in the basket(s) corresponding to the item(s) they are trying\nto win. After all the players have placed their tickets, a ticket is drawn at\nrandom from each basket and the item is given to the owner of the winning\nticket. While a player is never guaranteed to win an item, they can improve\ntheir chances of getting it by increasing the number of tickets for that item.\n  In this paper we investigate the existence of pure Nash equilibria in both\nthe continuous and discrete settings. When the players have continuous budgets,\nwe show that a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist for asymmetric games when\nsome valuations are zero. In that case we prove that the auctioneer can\nstabilize the game by placing his own ticket in each basket. On the other hand,\nwhen all the valuations are strictly positive, a pure Nash equilibrium is\nguaranteed to exist, and the equilibrium strategies are symmetric when both\nvaluations and budgets are symmetric. We also study Chinese auctions with\ndiscrete budgets, for which we give both existence results and counterexamples.\nWhile the literature on rent-seeking contests traditionally focuses on\ncontinuous costly tickets, the discrete variant is very natural and more\nclosely models the version of the auction held in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 17:40:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 16:48:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e2nzei", "Simina", ""], ["Forero", "Clara", ""], ["Larson", "Kate", ""], ["Miltersen", "Peter Bro", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0383", "submitter": "Georgios Zervas", "authors": "Joan Feigenbaum, Michael Mitzenmacher, Georgios Zervas", "title": "An Economic Analysis of User-Privacy Options in Ad-Supported Services", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the value to e-commerce website operators of offering privacy\noptions to users, e.g., of allowing users to opt out of ad targeting.

Through the paper, we distinguish different\nmechanisms that allow the system to maintain high levels of cooperation when\nthe system grows by incorporation of defectors.

The winner is determined by the parity of the\ngreatest priority occurring infinitely often in this infinite play.\n  A motivation for studying parity games comes from the area of formal\nverification of systems by model checking. Deciding the winner in a parity game\nis polynomial time equivalent to the model checking problem of the modal\nmu-calculus. Another strong motivation lies in the fact that the exact\ncomplexity of solving parity games is a long-standing open problem, the\ncurrently best known algorithm being subexponential. It is known that the\nproblem is in the complexity classes UP and coUP.\n  In this paper we identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time, following an approach from structural graph\ntheory. We consider three standard graph operations: the join of two graphs,\nrepeated pasting along vertices, and the addition of a vertex. Given a class C\nof digraphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time, we show that\nthe same holds for the class obtained from C by applying once any of these\nthree operations to its elements.\n  These results provide, in particular, polynomial time algorithms for parity\ngames whose underlying graph is an orientation of a complete graph, a complete\nbipartite graph, a block graph, or a block-cactus graph.

We illustrate,\nvia numerical examples, how robust pricing based on our DPFI formulation offers\ngenerally superior and never inferior worst case performance compared to\nnominal pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2012 20:14:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Friesz", "Terry L.", ""], ["Kwon", "Changhyun", ""], ["Kim", "Tae Il", ""], ["Fan", "Lifan", ""], ["Yao", "Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.4528", "submitter": "Mohamed I Shehata", "authors": "E.

While the quest for a single unified MCS algorithm that would\nperform well on all problems is of major interest for AI, practitioners often\nknow in advance the problem they want to solve, and spend plenty of time\nexploiting this knowledge to customize their MCS algorithm in a problem-driven\nway. We propose an MCS algorithm discovery scheme to perform this in an\nautomatic and reproducible way. We first introduce a grammar over MCS\nalgorithms that enables inducing a rich space of candidate algorithms.\nAfterwards, we search in this space for the algorithm that performs best on\naverage for a given distribution of training problems. We rely on multi-armed\nbandits to approximately solve this optimization problem. The experiments,\ngenerated on three different domains, show that our approach enables\ndiscovering algorithms that outperform several well-known MCS algorithms such\nas Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees and Nested Monte Carlo search.

In this\npaper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social\nnetworks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1(0)\nrepresenting extremely positive(negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial\nopinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his\ninitial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents\niteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and\nobserving the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can\nbe viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best\nresponse) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as\na result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends\non the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of\nstubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the\nconvergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as\na function of aforementioned factors. We also discuss the implications of such\nresults in a few well-known graphs such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs and\nsmall-world graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2012 22:24:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ghaderi", "Javad", ""], ["Srikant", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5537", "submitter": "Emmanuel Boidot", "authors": "Emmanuel Boidot and Eric Feron", "title": "Planning Random path distributions for ambush games in unstructured\n  environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Operating vehicles in adversarial environments require non-conventional\nplanning techniques.
