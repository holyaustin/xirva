In other words, people do not act a priori as single agents, but they\nforecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they\nplay according to their best forecast. In this paper we formalize this idea and\nwe define a new solution concept for one-shot normal form games. We prove that\nthis \\emph{cooperative equilibrium} exists for all finite games and it explains\na number of different experimental findings, such as (1) the rate of\ncooperation in the Prisoner's dilemma depends on the cost-benefit ratio; (2)\nthe rate of cooperation in the Traveler's dilemma depends on the bonus/penalty;\n(3) the rate of cooperation in the Publig Goods game depends on the pro-capite\nmarginal return and on the numbers of players; (4) the rate of cooperation in\nthe Bertrand competition depends on the number of players; (5) players tend to\nbe fair in the bargaining problem; (6) players tend to be fair in the Ultimatum\ngame; (7) players tend to be altruist in the Dictator game; (8) offers in the\nUltimatum game are larger than offers in the Dictator game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2013 18:59:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 Mar 2013 18:35:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2013 16:12:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 10 Sep 2013 00:15:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Capraro", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4014", "submitter": "George Barmpalias Dr", "authors": "George Barmpalias, Richard Elwes and Andy Lewis-Pye", "title": "Digital morphogenesis via Schelling segregation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Schelling's model of segregation looks to explain the way in which particles\nor agents of two types may come to arrange themselves spatially into\nconfigurations consisting of large homogeneous clusters, i.e.\\ connected\nregions consisting of only one type.

In this\nsetting, E has a budget $B$. Each subject $i$ declares an associated cost $c_i\n>0$ to be part of the experiment, and must be paid at least her cost.
