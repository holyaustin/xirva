We\ninterpret the binary sequence as the price history of a stock, and view the\npredictor as an investor, which converts the problem into a stock prediction\nproblem. In this framework, an investor, who predicts the daily movements of a\nstock, and an adversarial market, who controls the stock, play against each\nother over $N$ turns. The investor combines the predictions of $n\\geq 2$\nexperts in order to make a decision about how much to invest at each turn, and\naims to minimize their regret with respect to the best-performing expert at the\nend of the game. We consider the problem with history-dependent experts, in\nwhich each expert uses the previous $d$ days of history of the market in making\ntheir predictions. We prove that the value function for this game, rescaled\nappropriately, converges as $N\\to \\infty$ at a rate of $O(N^{-1/6})$ to the\nviscosity solution of a nonlinear degenerate elliptic PDE, which can be\nunderstood as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Issacs equation for the two-person game.

Recently, the mining\npools are proved to be vulnerable for several possible attacks, and pool block\nwithholding attack is one of them: one strategic pool manager sends some of her\nminers to other pools and these miners pretend to work on the puzzles but\nactually do nothing. And these miners still get reward since the pool manager\ncan not recognize these malicious miners. In this work, we revisit the\ngame-theoretic model for pool block withholding attacks and propose a revised\napproach to reallocate the reward to the miners. Fortunately, in the new model,\nthe pool managers have strong incentive to not launch such attacks. We show\nthat for any number of mining pools, no-pool-attacks is always a Nash\nequilibrium. Moreover, with only two minority mining pools participating,\nno-pool-attacks is actually the unique Nash equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Aug 2020 14:40:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Zhihuai", ""], ["Li", "Bo", ""], ["Shan", "Xiaohan", ""], ["Sun", "Xiaoming", ""], ["Zhang", "Jialin", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.07303", "submitter": "Philipp Geiger", "authors": "Philipp Geiger, Christoph-Nikolas Straehle", "title": "Learning game-theoretic models of multiagent trajectories using implicit\n  layers", "comments": "Accepted at AAAI-2021", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For prediction of interacting agents' trajectories, we propose an end-to-end\ntrainable architecture that hybridizes neural nets with game-theoretic\nreasoning, has interpretable intermediate representations, and transfers to\ndownstream decision making.

This novel\nbusiness model, termed as third-party platform-integration in this paper, has\npotentials to alleviate the cost of market fragmentation due to the demand\nsplitting among multiple platforms. While most existing studies focus on the\noperation strategies for one single monopolist platform, much less is known\nabout the competition and platform-integration as well as the implications on\noperation strategy and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose\nmathematical models to describe the ride-sourcing market with multiple\ncompeting platforms and compare system performance metrics between two market\nscenarios, i.e., with and without platform-integration, at Nash equilibrium as\nwell as social optimum. We find that platform-integration can increase total\nrealized demand and social welfare at both Nash equilibrium and social optimum,\nbut may not necessarily generate a greater profit when vehicle supply is\nsufficiently large or/and market is too fragmented. We show that the market\nwith platform-integration generally achieves greater social welfare. On one\nhand, the integrator in platform-integration is able to generate a thicker\nmarket and reduce matching frictions; on the other hand, multiple platforms are\nstill competing by independently setting their prices, which help to mitigate\nmonopoly mark-up as in the monopoly market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2020 11:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Yaqian", ""], ["Yang", "Hai", ""], ["Ke", "Jintao", ""], ["Wang", "Hai", ""], ["Li", "Xinwei", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.10187", "submitter": "Nabiha Nasir Orpa", "authors": "Nabiha Nasir Orpa and Lichun Li", "title": "LP Formulations of sufficient statistic based strategies in Finite\n  Horizon Two-Player Zero-Sum Stochastic Bayesian games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies two-player zero-sum stochastic Bayesian games where each\nplayer has its own dynamic state that is unknown to the other player.
