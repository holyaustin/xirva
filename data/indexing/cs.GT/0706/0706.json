The tasks of a\ngiven application all have the same computation and communication requirements,\nbut these requirements can vary from one application to another.

An observation-based strategy relies on\nimperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequence\nof observations. Such games occur in the synthesis of a controller that does\nnot see the private state of the plant. Our main results are twofold. First, we\ngive a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which a\nplayer can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for any\nomega-regular objective. The fixed point is computed in the lattice of\nantichains of state sets. This algorithm has the advantages of being directed\nby the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the game\ngraph. Second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from which\na player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-based\nstrategy for a Buechi objective. This set is of interest because in the absence\nof perfect information, randomized strategies are more powerful than\ndeterministic ones. We show that our algorithms are optimal by proving matching\nlower bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2007 15:02:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2007 14:56:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 17:01:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Doyen", "Laurent", ""], ["Henzinger", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Raskin", "<br> Jean-Francois", ""]]}]
