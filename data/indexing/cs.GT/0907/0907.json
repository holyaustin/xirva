The scenario considered is that of a wireless network\nconsisting of selfish nodes that are randomly distributed over the network\ndomain according to a known probability distribution, and that are interested\nin communicating with a common sink node using common radio resources. In this\nscenario, the wireless nodes do not know the exact locations of their\ncompetitors but rather have belief distributions about these locations.\nFirstly, properties of the packet success probability curve as a function of\nthe node-sink separation are obtained for such networks. Secondly, a\nmonotonicity property for the best-response strategies of selfish nodes is\nidentified. That is, for any given strategies of competitors of a node, there\nexists a critical node-sink separation for this node such that its\nbest-response is to transmit when its distance to the sink node is smaller than\nthis critical threshold, and to back off otherwise. Finally, necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a given strategy profile to be a Nash equilibrium are\nprovided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2009 22:46:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Inaltekin", "Hazer", ""], ["Chiang", "Mung", ""], ["Poor", "H.

Our mechanisms are surprisingly simple: We show that a\nsequential all-pay mechanism is a 4 approximation to the revenue of the optimal\nex-interim truthful mechanism with discrete correlated type space for each\nbidder. We also show that a sequential posted price mechanism is a O(1)\napproximation to the revenue of the optimal ex-post truthful mechanism when the\ntype space of each bidder is a product distribution that satisfies the standard\nhazard rate condition. We further show a logarithmic approximation when the\nhazard rate condition is removed, and complete the picture by showing that\nachieving a sub-logarithmic approximation, even for regular distributions and\none bidder, requires pricing bundles of items. Our results are based on\nformulating novel LP relaxations for these problems, and developing generic\nrounding schemes from first principles. We believe this approach will be useful\nin other Bayesian mechanism design contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2009 12:39:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2009 12:21:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2009 12:29:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2009 19:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:19:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2010 11:45:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bhattacharya", "Sayan", ""], ["Goel", "Gagan", ""], ["Gollapudi", "Sreenivas", ""], ["Munagala", "Kamesh", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4311", "submitter": "Leah Epstein", "authors": "Leah Epstein, Elena Kleiman and Julian Mestre", "title": "Parametric packing of selfish items and the subset sum algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The subset sum algorithm is a natural heuristic for the classical Bin Packing\nproblem: In each iteration, the algorithm finds among the unpacked items, a\nmaximum size set of items that fits into a new bin.

Therefore, better understanding\nsimple greedy heuristics is, in general, an interesting topic in its own right.\nVery recently, Epstein and Kleiman (Proc. ESA 2008) provided another incentive\nto study the subset sum algorithm by showing that the Strong Price of Anarchy\nof the game theoretic version of the bin-packing problem is precisely the\napproximation ratio of this heuristic.\n  In this paper we establish the exact approximation ratio of the subset sum\nalgorithm, thus settling a long standing open problem. We generalize this\nresult to the parametric variant of the bin packing problem where item sizes\nlie on the interval (0,\\alpha] for some \\alpha \\leq 1, yielding tight bounds\nfor the Strong Price of Anarchy for all \\alpha \\leq 1.

However, some\ncoalitional games have empty cores, and any outcome in such a game is unstable.\n  In this paper, we investigate the possibility of stabilizing a coalitional\ngame by using external payments. We consider a scenario where an external\nparty, which is interested in having the players work together, offers a\nsupplemental payment to the grand coalition (or, more generally, a particular\ncoalition structure). This payment is conditional on players not deviating from\ntheir coalition(s). The sum of this payment plus the actual gains of the\ncoalition(s) may then be divided among the agents so as to promote stability.\nWe define the \\emph{cost of stability (CoS)} as the minimal external payment\nthat stabilizes the game.\n  We provide general bounds on the cost of stability in several classes of\ngames, and explore its algorithmic properties. To develop a better intuition\nfor the concepts we introduce, we provide a detailed algorithmic study of the\ncost of stability in weighted voting games, a simple but expressive class of\ngames which can model decision-making in political bodies, and cooperation in\nmultiagent settings. Finally, we extend our model and results to games with\ncoalition structures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2009 21:38:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bachrach", "Yoram", ""], ["Elkind", "Edith", ""], ["Meir", "Reshef", ""], ["Pasechnik", "Dmitrii", ""], ["Zuckerman", "Michael", ""], ["Rothe", "Joerg", ""], ["Rosenschein", "Jeffrey S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5219", "submitter": "Shahar Dobzinski", "authors": "Shahar Dobzinski", "title": "A Note on the Power of Truthful Approximation Mechanisms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the power of polynomial-time truthful mechanisms comparing to\npolynomial time (non-truthful) algorithms.
