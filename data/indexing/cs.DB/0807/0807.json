We are developing an XML update language called Flux, which\nstands for FunctionaL Updates for XML, drawing upon ideas from functional\nprogramming languages. In prior work, we have introduced a core language for\nFlux with a clear operational semantics and a sound, decidable static type\nsystem based on regular expression types.\n  Our initial proposal had several limitations. First, it lacked support for\nrecursive types or update procedures. Second, although a high-level source\nlanguage can easily be translated to the core language, it is difficult to\npropagate meaningful type errors from the core language back to the source.\nThird, certain updates are well-formed yet contain path errors, or ``dead''\nsubexpressions which never do any useful work. It would be useful to detect\npath errors, since they often represent errors or optimization opportunities.\n  In this paper, we address all three limitations. Specifically, we present an\nimproved, sound type system that handles recursion. We also formalize a source\nupdate language and give a translation to the core language that preserves and\nreflects typability. We also develop a path-error analysis (a form of dead-code\nanalysis) for updates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 17:10:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cheney", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1734", "submitter": "Daniel Lemire", "authors": "Daniel Lemire", "title": "Faster Sequential Search with a Two-Pass Dynamic-Time-Warping Lower\n  Bound", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a popular similarity measure between time\nseries.

We find that LB_Improved-based search is faster for sequential\nsearch. As an example, our approach is 3 times faster over random-walk and\nshape time series. We also review some of the mathematical properties of the\nDTW. We derive a tight triangle inequality for the DTW.

DescribeX permits the\ndeclarative description of document structure using all axes and language\nconstructs in XPath, and generalizes many of the XML indexing and summarization\napproaches in the literature. DescribeX supports the construction of\nheterogeneous summaries where different document elements sharing a common\nstructure can be declaratively defined and refined by means of path regular\nexpressions on axes, or axis path regular expression (AxPREs). DescribeX can\nsignificantly help in the understanding of both the structure of complex,\nheterogeneous XML collections and the behaviour of XPath queries evaluated on\nthem.\n  Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of DescribeX summary\nrefinements and stabilizations (the key enablers for tailoring summaries) with\nmulti-gigabyte web collections. A comparative study suggests that using a\nDescribeX summary created from a given workload can produce query evaluation\ntimes orders of magnitude better than using existing summaries. DescribeX's\nlight-weight approach of combining summaries with a file-at-a-time XPath\nprocessor can be a very competitive alternative, in terms of performance, to\nconventional fully-fledged XML query engines that provide DB-like functionality\nsuch as security, transaction processing, and native storage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2008 14:12:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Rizzolo", "Flavio", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3795", "submitter": "Vadim Tropashko", "authors": "Marshall Spight, Vadim Tropashko", "title": "Relational Lattice Axioms", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Relational lattice is a formal mathematical model for Relational algebra.

MEMS storage devices, however, are\nmuch different from magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics.\nThey have thousands of heads called probe tips and provide the following two\nmajor access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of probe tips\nfor accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data\nwith the set of probe tips selected. Due to these characteristics, it is\nnontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS\nstorage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the\nRegion-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data\nretrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical\nMEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based\non the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and\ntwo-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance\nby up to 4.0 times for relational data and by up to 4.8 times for\ntwo-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of\nexisting data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more\nmarked as the database size grows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 06:18:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Yi-Reun", ""], ["Whang", "Kyu-Young", ""], ["Kim", "Min-Soo", ""], ["Song", "Il-Yeol", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4620", "submitter": "Christoph Koch", "authors": "Christoph Koch", "title": "A Compositional Query Algebra for Second-Order Logic and Uncertain\n  Databases", "comments": "22 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  World-set algebra is a variable-free query language for uncertain databases.\nIt constitutes the core of the query language implemented in MayBMS, an\nuncertain database system.
