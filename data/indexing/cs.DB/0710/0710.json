Experimental scientists, from all disciplines,\nhaving to analyse large collections of raw experimental data (astronomical,\nphysical, biological, etc.) have developed powerful methods for their\nstatistical analysis and for clustering, categorising, and classifying objects.\nFinally, physicists have developed a theory of quantum measurement, unifying\nthe logical, algebraic, and probabilistic aspects of queries into a single\nformalism. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first to show that when\nformulated at an abstract level, problems from IR, from statistical data\nanalysis, and from physical measurement theories are very similar and hence can\nprofitably be cross-fertilised, and, secondly, to propose a novel method of\nfuzzy hierarchical clustering, termed \\textit{semantic distillation} --\nstrongly inspired from the theory of quantum measurement --, we developed to\nanalyse raw data coming from various types of experiments on DNA arrays. We\nillustrate the method by analysing DNA arrays experiments and clustering the\ngenes of the array according to their specificity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Oct 2007 12:30:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2007 09:57:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Sierocinski", "Thomas", "", "IRMAR"], ["B\u00e9chec", "Anthony Le", "", "IRMAR"], ["Th\u00e9ret", "Nathalie", "", "IRMAR"], ["Petritis", "Dimitri", "", "IRMAR"]]}, {"id": "0710.1404", "submitter": "M Sabu THAMPI", "authors": "Sabu M.

XPath language\nis the result of an effort to provide address parts of an XML document. In\nsupport of this primary purpose, it becomes in a query language against an XML\ndocument. In this paper we present a proposal for the implementation of the\nXPath language in logic programming. With this aim we will describe the\nrepresentation of XML documents by means of a logic program. Rules and facts\ncan be used for representing the document schema and the XML document itself.\nIn particular, we will present how to index XML documents in logic programs:\nrules are supposed to be stored in main memory, however facts are stored in\nsecondary memory by using two kind of indexes: one for each XML tag, and other\nfor each group of terminal items. In addition, we will study how to query by\nmeans of the XPath language against a logic program representing an XML\ndocument. It evolves the specialization of the logic program with regard to the\nXPath expression. Finally, we will also explain how to combine the indexing and\nthe top-down evaluation of the logic program.
