This proximity service is usually\noffered by the network itself or by a third party service provider (SP) using\nlocation data acquired from the users. This paper provides a rigorous\ntheoretical and experimental analysis of the existing solutions for the\nlocation privacy problem in proximity services. This is a serious problem for\nusers who do not trust the SP to handle their location data, and would only\nlike to release their location information in a generalized form to\nparticipating buddies. The paper presents two new protocols providing complete\nprivacy with respect to the SP, and controllable privacy with respect to the\nbuddies. The analytical and experimental analysis of the protocols takes into\naccount privacy, service precision, and computation and communication costs,\nshowing the superiority of the new protocols compared to those appeared in the\nliterature to date.

It\nallows simple use of computer and storage facilities and to schedule or monitor\ncompute tasks and data management. It is based on the Globus Toolkit middleware\n(GT4). Chapter 1 describes the context which led to the demand for advanced\nsoftware solutions in Astrophysics, and we state the goals of the project. We\nthen present characteristic astrophysical applications that have been\nimplemented on AstroGrid-D in chapter 2. We describe simulations of different\ncomplexity, compute-intensive calculations running on multiple sites, and\nadvanced applications for specific scientific purposes, such as a connection to\nrobotic telescopes. We can show from these examples how grid execution improves\ne.g. the scientific workflow. Chapter 3 explains the software tools and\nservices that we adapted or newly developed. Section 3.1 is focused on the\nadministrative aspects of the infrastructure, to manage users and monitor\nactivity. Section 3.2 characterises the central components of our architecture:\nThe AstroGrid-D information service to collect and store metadata, a file\nmanagement system, the data management system, and a job manager for automatic\nsubmission of compute tasks.

In traditional databases, a user\ndefined score function assigns a score value to each tuple and a top-$k$ query\nreturns $k$ tuples with the highest score. In uncertain database, top-$k$\nanswer depends not only on the scores but also on the membership probabilities\nof tuples. Several top-$k$ definitions covering different aspects of\nscore-probability interplay have been proposed in recent\npast~\\cite{R10,R4,R2,R8}. Most of the existing work in this research field is\nfocused on developing efficient algorithms for answering top-$k$ queries on\nstatic uncertain data. Any change (insertion, deletion of a tuple or change in\nmembership probability, score of a tuple) in underlying data forces\nre-computation of query answers. Such re-computations are not practical\nconsidering the dynamic nature of data in many applications. In this paper, we\npropose a fully dynamic data structure that uses ranking function\n$PRF^e(\\alpha)$ proposed by Li et al.~\\cite{R8} under the generally adopted\nmodel of $x$-relations~\\cite{R11}. $PRF^e$ can effectively approximate various\nother top-$k$ definitions on uncertain data based on the value of parameter\n$\\alpha$. An $x$-relation consists of a number of $x$-tuples, where $x$-tuple\nis a set of mutually exclusive tuples (up to a constant number) called\nalternatives. Each $x$-tuple in a relation randomly instantiates into one tuple\nfrom its alternatives. For an uncertain relation with $N$ tuples, our structure\ncan answer top-$k$ queries in $O(k\\log N)$ time, handles an update in $O(\\log\nN)$ time and takes $O(N)$ space. Finally, we evaluate practical efficiency of\nour structure on both synthetic and real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 05:20:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Patil", "Manish", ""], ["Shah", "Rahul", ""], ["Thankachan", "Sharma V.", ""]]}]
