This paper proposes a\nnew scheme for stopping the application of quantum rotation transformation on\nreaching near the targets by measurement and subsequent processing to estimate\nthe distance of the state vector from the target states. It ensures a success\nprobability, which is at least greater than half for all the ratios of the\nnumber of target entities to the total number of entities in a database, which\nare less than half. The search problem is trivial for remaining possible\nratios. The proposed scheme is simpler than quantum counting and more efficient\nthan the known fixed-point schemes.

The behavioral point of view for databases is assumed, with\nbehavioural equivalence of databases corresponding to isomorphism of objects in\nDB category. The introduced observations, which are view-based computations\nwithout side-effects, are based (from Universal algebra) on monad endofunctor\nT, which is the closure operator for objects and for morphisms also.

Such patterns have\ndemonstrated considerable value for classification and subgroup discovery, but\na detailed understanding of the types of interactions among items in a\ndiscriminative pattern is lacking. To address this issue, we propose to\ncategorize discriminative patterns according to four types of item interaction:\n(i) driver-passenger, (ii) coherent, (iii) independent additive and (iv)\nsynergistic beyond independent additive. Either of the last three is of\npractical importance, with the latter two representing a gain in the\ndiscriminative power of a pattern over its subsets. Synergistic patterns are\nmost restrictive, but perhaps the most interesting since they capture a\ncooperative effect. For domains such as genetic research, differentiating among\nthese types of patterns is critical since each yields very different biological\ninterpretations. For general domains, the characterization provides a novel\nview of the nature of the discriminative patterns in a dataset, which yields\ninsights beyond those provided by current approaches that focus mostly on\npattern-based classification and subgroup discovery. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive discussion that defines these four pattern types and investigates\ntheir properties and their relationship to one another.
