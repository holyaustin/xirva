The system relies on a\nfixpoint temporal logic with converse, derived from the mu-calculus, where\nmodels are finite trees. This calculus is expressive enough to capture regular\ntree types along with multi-directional navigation in trees, while having a\nsingle exponential time complexity. Specifically the decidability of the logic\nis proved in time 2^O(n) where n is the size of the input formula.\n  Major XML concepts are linearly translated into the logic: XPath navigation\nand node selection semantics, and regular tree languages (which include DTDs\nand XML Schemas). Based on these embeddings, several problems of major\nimportance in XML applications are reduced to satisfiability of the logic.\nThese problems include XPath containment, emptiness, equivalence, overlap,\ncoverage, in the presence or absence of regular tree type constraints, and the\nstatic type-checking of an annotated query.\n  The focus is then given to a sound and complete algorithm for deciding the\nlogic, along with a detailed complexity analysis, and crucial implementation\ntechniques for building an effective solver. Practical experiments using a full\nimplementation of the system are presented. The system appears to be efficient\nin practice for several realistic scenarios.\n  The main application of this work is a new class of static analyzers for\nprogramming languages using both XPath expressions and XML type annotations\n(input and output). Such analyzers allow to ensure at compile-time valuable\nproperties such as type-safety and optimizations, for safer and more efficient\nXML processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 13:40:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 May 2014 06:02:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Geneves", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4809", "submitter": "Jan Rittinger", "authors": "T.
