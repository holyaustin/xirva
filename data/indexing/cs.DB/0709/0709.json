We use the Frequent\nEpisode Discovery framework of Laxman, Sastry, and Unnikrishnan (2005), in\nwhich the episodes are represented and recognized using finite-state automata.\nMany aspects of functional connectivity between neuronal populations can be\ninferred from the episodes. We demonstrate these using simulated multi-neuronal\ndata from a Poisson model. We also present a method to assess the statistical\nsignificance of the discovered episodes.
