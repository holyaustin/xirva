To effectively manage the\nevolution of ontologies it is essential to identify the difference (Diff)\nbetween two ontology versions. We propose a novel approach to determine an\nexpressive and invertible diff evolution mapping between given versions of an\nontology. Our approach utilizes the result of a match operation to determine an\nevolution mapping consisting of a set of basic change operations\n(insert/update/delete). To semantically enrich the evolution mapping we adopt a\nrule-based approach to transform the basic change operations into a smaller set\nof more complex change operations, such as merge, split, or changes of entire\nsubgraphs. The proposed algorithm is customizable in different ways to meet the\nrequirements of diverse ontologies and application scenarios. We evaluate the\nproposed approach by determining and analyzing evolution mappings for\nreal-world life science ontologies and web directories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 11:05:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hartung", "Michael", ""], ["Gro\u00df", "Anika", ""], ["Rahm", "Erhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0924", "submitter": "Daniele Riboni", "authors": "Daniele Riboni and Linda Pareschi and Claudio Bettini", "title": "Preserving Privacy in Sequential Data Release against Background\n  Knowledge Attacks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A large amount of transaction data containing associations between\nindividuals and sensitive information flows everyday into data stores.

A further challenge consists of presenting the results to the user in\nan asynchronous fashion, i.e. the 'push' mode, along with the 'pull' mode, in\nwhich the user explicitly issues a query, and displays the results.

We start out with a\nnegative result that also explains the lack of theoretical upper bounds on the\nspace usage of data mining algorithms for finding frequent itemsets: Any\nalgorithm that (even only approximately and with a chance of error) finds the\nmost frequent k-itemset must use space Omega(min{mb,n^k,(mb/phi)^k}) bits,\nwhere mb is the number of items in the stream so far, n is the number of\ndistinct items and phi is a support threshold.
