Our main result states that on all linear orders with at least two\nelements, the nonemptiness problem for datalog is EXPTIME-complete. While\ncontainment of the nonemptiness problem in EXPTIME is known for finite linear\norders and actually for arbitrary finite structures, it is not obvious for\ninfinite linear orders. It sharply contrasts the situation on other infinite\nstructures; for example, the datalog nonemptiness problem on an infinite\nsuccessor structure is undecidable. We extend our upper bound results to\ninfinite linear orders with constants.\n  As an application, we show that the datalog nonemptiness problem on Allen's\ninterval algebra is EXPTIME-complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Feb 2009 17:56:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2009 22:32:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Grohe", "Martin", ""], ["Schwandtner", "Goetz", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2399", "submitter": "Amit Chakrabarti", "authors": "Joshua Brody and Amit Chakrabarti", "title": "A Multi-Round Communication Lower Bound for Gap Hamming and Some\n  Consequences", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DB cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Gap-Hamming-Distance problem arose in the context of proving space lower\nbounds for a number of key problems in the data stream model. In this problem,\nAlice and Bob have to decide whether the Hamming distance between their $n$-bit\ninput strings is large (i.e., at least $n/2 + \\sqrt n$) or small (i.e., at most\n$n/2 - \\sqrt n$); they do not care if it is neither large nor small. This\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt n)$ gap in the problem specification is crucial for capturing the\napproximation allowed to a data stream algorithm.\n  Thus far, for randomized communication, an $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound on this\nproblem was known only in the one-way setting. We prove an $\\Omega(n)$ lower\nbound for randomized protocols that use any constant number of rounds.\n  As a consequence we conclude, for instance, that $\\epsilon$-approximately\ncounting the number of distinct elements in a data stream requires\n$\\Omega(1/\\epsilon^2)$ space, even with multiple (a constant number of) passes\nover the input stream. This extends earlier one-pass lower bounds, answering a\nlong-standing open question. We obtain similar results for approximating the\nfrequency moments and for approximating the empirical entropy of a data stream.\n  In the process, we also obtain tight $n - \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ lower and\nupper bounds on the one-way deterministic communication complexity of the\nproblem.
