Concept-oriented query language is based on a new data modeling construct,\ncalled concept, inclusion relation between concepts, and concept partial\nordering in which greater concepts are represented by their field types. It is\ndemonstrated how COM and COQL can be used to solve three general data modeling\ntasks: logical navigation, multidimensional analysis and inference. Logical\nnavigation is based on two operations of projection and de-projection.\nMultidimensional analysis uses product operation for producing a cube from\nlevel concepts chosen along the chosen dimension paths. Inference is defined as\na two-step procedure where input constraints are first propagated downwards\nusing de-projection and then the constrained result is propagated upwards using\nprojection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jan 2009 10:41:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2009 13:30:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 27 Dec 2009 15:20:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 2 Aug 2010 14:02:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Savinov", "Alexandr", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3751", "submitter": "Daniel Lemire", "authors": "Daniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Kamel Aouiche", "title": "Sorting improves word-aligned bitmap indexes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Data & Knowledge Engineering, Volume 69, Issue 1, 2010, Pages 3-28", "doi": "10.1016/j.datak.2009.08.006", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bitmap indexes must be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize\nCPU usage.

These techniques are sensitive to the order of the rows: a\nsimple lexicographical sort can divide the index size by 9 and make indexes\nseveral times faster.
