In\nthe streaming model the joint distribution is given by a stream of $k$-tuples,\nwith the goal of testing correlations among the components measured over the\nentire stream. In the streaming model, Indyk and McGregor (SODA 08) recently\ngave exciting new results for measuring pairwise independence. The Indyk and\nMcGregor methods provide $\\log{n}$-approximation under statistical distance\nbetween the joint and product distributions in the streaming model. Indyk and\nMcGregor leave, as their main open question, the problem of improving their\n$\\log n$-approximation for the statistical distance metric.\n  In this paper we solve the main open problem posed by of Indyk and McGregor\nfor the statistical distance for pairwise independence and extend this result\nto any constant $k$. In particular, we present an algorithm that computes an\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation of the statistical distance between the\njoint and product distributions defined by a stream of $k$-tuples.

Certain limitations of centralized geographic indexes favor\npeer-to-peer organization of the information, which, in addition to avoiding\nperformance bottleneck, allows autonomy over local information. Peer-to-peer\nsystems for geographic or multidimensional range queries built on existing DHTs\nsuffer from the inaccuracy in linearization of the multidimensional space.\nOther overlay structures that are based on hierarchical partitioning of the\nsearch space are not scalable because they use special super-peers to represent\nthe nodes in the hierarchy. GeoP2P partitions the search space hierarchically,\nmaintains the overlay structure and performs the routing without the need of\nany super-peers. Although similar fully-decentralized overlays have been\npreviously proposed, they lack the ability to dynamically grow and retract the\npartition hierarchy when the number of peers change. GeoP2P provides such\nadaptive features with minimum perturbation of the system state. Such\nadaptation makes both the routing delay and the state size of each peer\nlogarithmic to the total number of peers, irrespective of the size of the\nmultidimensional space. Our analysis also reveals that the overlay structure\nand the routing algorithm are generic and independent of several aspects of the\npartitioning hierarchy, such as the geometric shape of the zones or the\ndimensionality of the search space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2009 21:39:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Asaduzzaman", "Shah", ""], ["Bochmann", "Gregor v.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4305", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Diana Sophia Codat", "title": "Evaluation d'une requete en SQL", "comments": "6 pages, exposed on 4th International Conferences \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2007, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
