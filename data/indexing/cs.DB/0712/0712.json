We base\nrewrites on a historical click graph that records the ads that have been\nclicked on in response to past user queries. Given a query q, we first consider\nSimrank as a way to identify queries similar to q, i.e., queries whose ads a\nuser may be interested in. We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify\nquery similarities in our application, and we present two enhanced version of\nSimrank: one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that\nexploits ``evidence.'' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against\nSimrank, using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo!, and using a variety\nof metrics. Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and\nbetter query rewrites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 12:43:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Antonellis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Garcia-Molina", "Hector", ""], ["Chang", "Chi-Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.1863", "submitter": "Weng-Long Chang", "authors": "Weng-Long Chang, Michael (Shan-Hui) Ho, and Minyi Guo", "title": "Constructing Bio-molecular Databases on a DNA-based Computer", "comments": "The article includes 35 pages, several tables and figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.DB q-bio.OT", "license": null, "abstract": "  Codd [Codd 1970] wrote the first paper in which the model of a relational\ndatabase was proposed.

The relational calculus augmented with polynomial constraints is the\nstandard first-order query language for constraint databases. Although the\nexpressive power of this query language has been studied extensively, the\ndifficulty of the efficient evaluation of queries, usually involving some form\nof quantifier elimination, has received considerably less attention. The\ninefficiency of existing quantifier-elimination software and the intrinsic\ndifficulty of quantifier elimination have proven to be a bottle-neck for for\nreal-world implementations of constraint database systems. In this paper, we\nfocus on a particular query, called the \\emph{alibi query}, that asks whether\ntwo moving objects whose positions are known at certain moments in time, could\nhave possibly met, given certain speed constraints. This query can be seen as a\nconstraint database query and its evaluation relies on the elimination of a\nblock of three existential quantifiers. Implementations of general purpose\nelimination algorithms are in the specific case, for practical purposes, too\nslow in answering the alibi query and fail completely in the parametric case.\nThe main contribution of this paper is an analytical solution to the parametric\nalibi query, which can be used to answer this query in the specific case in\nconstant time. We also give an analytic solution to the alibi query at a fixed\nmoment in time. The solutions we propose are based on geometric argumentation\nand they illustrate the fact that some practical problems require creative\nsolutions, where at least in theory, existing systems could provide a solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 18:05:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kuijpers", "Bart", ""], ["Othman", "Walied", ""], ["Grimson", "Rafael", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2773", "submitter": "Emmanuel Cecchet", "authors": "Emmanuel Cecchet, George Candea, Anastasia Ailamaki", "title": "Middleware-based Database Replication: The Gaps between Theory and\n  Practice", "comments": "14 pages.

This has created over time a gap between academic\nresearch and industrial practice.\n  This paper aims to characterize the gap along three axes: performance,\navailability, and administration. We build on our own experience developing and\ndeploying replication systems in commercial and academic settings, as well as\non a large body of prior related work. We sift through representative examples\nfrom the last decade of open-source, academic, and commercial database\nreplication systems and combine this material with case studies from real\nsystems deployed at Fortune 500 customers. We propose two agendas, one for\nacademic research and one for industrial R&D, which we believe can bridge the\ngap within 5-10 years. This way, we hope to both motivate and help researchers\nin making the theory and practice of middleware-based database replication more\nrelevant to each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2007 18:42:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 20:53:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cecchet", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Candea", "George", ""], ["Ailamaki", "Anastasia", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3925", "submitter": "Pascal Heus", "authors": "Pascal Heus, Richard Gomez", "title": "QIS-XML: A metadata specification for Quantum Information Science", "comments": "26 pages, 22 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.DB quant-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  While Quantum Information Science (QIS) is still in its infancy, the ability\nfor quantum based hardware or computers to communicate and integrate with their\nclassical counterparts will be a major requirement towards their success.\nLittle attention however has been paid to this aspect of QIS.
