Presently, existing proposals show some limitations: {\\em\n(i)} the quantity of data that can be handled contemporarily is limited, due to\nthe fact that reasoning is generally carried out in main-memory; {\\em (ii)} the\ninteraction with external (and independent) DBMSs is not trivial and, in\nseveral cases, not allowed at all; {\\em (iii)} the efficiency of present\nimplementations is still not sufficient for their utilization in complex\nreasoning tasks involving massive amounts of data. This paper provides a\ncontribution in this setting; it presents a new system, called DLV$^{DB}$,\nwhich aims to solve these problems. Moreover, the paper reports the results of\na thorough experimental analysis we have carried out for comparing our system\nwith several state-of-the-art systems (both logic and databases) on some\nclassical deductive problems; the other tested systems are: LDL++, XSB, Smodels\nand three top-level commercial DBMSs.

However, this has been the way these databases and associated\noptimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This\npaper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object\nevaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by\ndefining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has\nbeen designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for\nthe object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational\nmodel with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can\nbe added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two\ndifferent sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to\ncompare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering\nalgorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the\nadaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.\nThey also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with\nmoderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades\nto be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change\nare applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the\nperformance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF\nexposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2007 09:10:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Zhen", "", "ERIC"], ["Darmont", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "", "ERIC"]]}, {"id": "0704.3501", "submitter": "Jerome Darmont", "authors": "J\\'er\\^ome Darmont (ERIC), Fadila Bentayeb (ERIC), Omar Boussa\\\"id\n  (ERIC)", "title": "Conception d'un banc d'essais d\\'ecisionnel", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": "20\\`emes Journ\\'ees Bases de Donn\\'ees Avanc\\'ees (BDA 04),\n  Montpellier (19/10/2004) 493-511", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB", "license": null, "abstract": "  We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of\ndata warehouses.
