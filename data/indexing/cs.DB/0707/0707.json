An interesting formalization recently proposed is the\nk-anonymity. This approach requires that the rows in a table are clustered in\nsets of size at least k and that all the rows in a cluster become the same\ntuple, after the suppression of some records. The natural optimization problem,\nwhere the goal is to minimize the number of suppressed entries, is known to be\nNP-hard when the values are over a ternary alphabet, k = 3 and the rows length\nis unbounded. In this paper we give a lower bound on the approximation factor\nthat any polynomial-time algorithm can achive on two restrictions of the\nproblem,namely (i) when the records values are over a binary alphabet and k =\n3, and (ii) when the records have length at most 8 and k = 4, showing that\nthese restrictions of the problem are APX-hard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 14:17:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 16:40:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bonizzoni", "Paola", ""], ["Della Vedova", "Gianluca", ""], ["Dondi", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0745", "submitter": "Richard McClatchey", "authors": "K.
