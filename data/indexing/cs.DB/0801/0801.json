This model is based on the formalism of nested\nordered sets which uses inclusion relation to produce hierarchical structure of\nsets and ordering relation to produce multi-dimensional structure among its\nelements. Nested ordered set is defined as an ordered set where an each element\ncan be itself an ordered set. Ordering relation in CoM is used to define data\nsemantics and operations with data such as projection and de-projection. This\ndata model can be applied to very different problems and the paper describes\nsome its uses such grouping with aggregation and multi-dimensional analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2007 14:29:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Savinov", "Alexandr", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0139", "submitter": "Alexandr Savinov", "authors": "Alexandr Savinov", "title": "Principles of the Concept-Oriented Data Model", "comments": "54 pages.

It is\nsupposed that items represent data units, which are stored in concepts. A\nconcept is a combination of superconcepts, which determine the concept's\ndimensionality or properties. An item is a combination of superitems taken by\none from all the superconcepts. An item stores a combination of references to\nits superitems. The references implement inclusion relation or attribute-value\nrelation among items. A concept-oriented database is defined by its concept\nstructure called syntax or schema and its item structure called semantics. The\nmodel defines formal transformations of syntax and semantics including the\ncanonical semantics where all concepts are merged and the data semantics is\nrepresented by one set of items. The concept-oriented data model treats\nrelations as subconcepts where items are instances of the relations.\nMulti-valued attributes are defined via subconcepts as a view on the database\nsemantics rather than as a built-in mechanism. The model includes\nconcept-oriented query language, which is based on collection manipulations. It\nalso has such mechanisms as aggregation and inference based on semantics\npropagation through the database schema.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2007 15:04:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Savinov", "Alexandr", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0714", "submitter": "James Cheney", "authors": "James Cheney", "title": "Regular Expression Subtyping for XML Query and Update Languages", "comments": "ESOP 2008.

Subtyping systems typically have two presentations,\nwhich should be equivalent: a declarative version in which the subsumption rule\nmay be used anywhere, and an algorithmic version in which the use of\nsubsumption is limited in order to make typechecking syntax-directed and\ndecidable. However, the XQuery standard type system circumvents this issue by\nusing imprecise typing rules for iteration constructs and defining only\nalgorithmic typechecking, and another extant proposal provides more precise\ntypes for iteration constructs but ignores subtyping. In this paper, we\nconsider a core XQuery-like language with a subsumption rule and prove the\ncompleteness of algorithmic typechecking; this is straightforward for XQuery\nproper but requires some care in the presence of more precise iteration typing\ndisciplines. We extend this result to an XML update language we have introduced\nin earlier work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2008 18:13:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cheney", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.1063", "submitter": "Ivan Titov", "authors": "Ivan Titov and Ryan McDonald", "title": "Modeling Online Reviews with Multi-grain Topic Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DB", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper we present a novel framework for extracting the ratable aspects\nof objects from online user reviews. Extracting such aspects is an important\nchallenge in automatically mining product opinions from the web and in\ngenerating opinion-based summaries of user reviews. Our models are based on\nextensions to standard topic modeling methods such as LDA and PLSA to induce\nmulti-grain topics. We argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for\nour task since standard models tend to produce topics that correspond to global\nproperties of objects (e.g., the brand of a product type) rather than the\naspects of an object that tend to be rated by a user. The models we present not\nonly extract ratable aspects, but also cluster them into coherent topics, e.g.,\n`waitress' and `bartender' are part of the same topic `staff' for restaurants.\nThis differentiates it from much of the previous work which extracts aspects\nthrough term frequency analysis with minimal clustering. We evaluate the\nmulti-grain models both qualitatively and quantitatively to show that they\nimprove significantly upon standard topic models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2008 17:01:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Titov", "Ivan", ""], ["McDonald", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.1715", "submitter": "Srivatsava Ranjit Ganta", "authors": "Srivatsava Ranjit Ganta, Raj Acharya", "title": "On Breaching Enterprise Data Privacy Through Adversarial Information\n  Fusion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CR cs.OH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Data privacy is one of the key challenges faced by enterprises today.\nAnonymization techniques address this problem by sanitizing sensitive data such\nthat individual privacy is preserved while allowing enterprises to maintain and\nshare sensitive data.
