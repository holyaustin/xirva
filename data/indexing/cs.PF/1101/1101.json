Our goal is to design\nscheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,\nmaintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,\nwhile guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure\nalgorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination\ninformation. It is usually difficult to obtain and maintain this type of\ninformation, especially in large networks, where there are numerous flows.\nAlso, the back-pressure algorithm maintains a complex data structure at each\nnode, keeps exchanging queue length information among neighboring nodes, and\ncommonly results in poor delay performance. In this paper, we propose\nscheduling schemes that can circumvent these drawbacks and guarantee throughput\noptimality. These schemes use either the readily available hop-count\ninformation or only the local information for each link. We rigorously analyze\nthe performance of the proposed schemes using fluid limit techniques via an\ninductive argument and show that they are throughput-optimal. We also conduct\nsimulations to validate our theoretical results in various settings, and show\nthat the proposed schemes can substantially improve the delay performance in\nmost scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 19:32:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 19:15:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2011 03:56:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 16:06:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Bo", ""], ["Joo", "Changhee", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4523", "submitter": "Mathieu Feuillet Mr", "authors": "Mathieu Feuillet and Matthieu Jonckheere and Balakrishna J.

We find in\nparticular that many opportunistic scheduling policies like Score-Based,\nProportionally Best or Potential Improvement are stable under the maximum\nstability conditions, whereas the opportunistic scheduler Relative-Best or the\ncmu-rule are not. (2) We show that choosing the right tie-breaking rule is\ncrucial for the performance (e.g. average delay) as perceived by a user. We\nprove that a policy is asymptotically optimal if it is maximum stable and the\ntie-breaking rule gives priority to the user with the highest departure\nprobability.
