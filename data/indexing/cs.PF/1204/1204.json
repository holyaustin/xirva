In such a system, users require a number of\nsubchannels which depends on their \\SNR, hence of their position and the\nshadowing they experience. The system is overloaded when the number of required\nsubchannels is greater than the number of available subchannels. We give an\nexact though not closed expression of the loss probability and then give an\nalgorithmic method to derive the number of subchannels which guarantees a loss\nprobability less than a given threshold. We show that Gaussian approximation\nlead to optimistic values and are thus unusable. We then introduce Edgeworth\nexpansions with error bounds and show that by choosing the right order of the\nexpansion, one can have an approximate dimensioning value easy to compute but\nwith guaranteed performance. As the values obtained are highly dependent from\nthe parameters of the system, which turned to be rather undetermined, we\nprovide a procedure based on concentration inequality for Poisson functionals,\nwhich yields to conservative dimensioning. This paper relies on recent results\non concentration inequalities and establish new results on Edgeworth\nexpansions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 14:26:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Decreusefond", "Laurent", "", "LTCI"], ["Ferraz", "Eduardo", "", "LTCI"], ["Martins", "Philippe", "", "LTCI"], ["Vu", "Thanh-Tung", "", "LTCI"]]}, {"id": "1204.1598", "submitter": "Tejaswini Apte", "authors": "Tejaswini Apte, Dr. Maya Ingle, Dr. A.K.

Will the score aggregation\npolicy influence the final recommendation? How reviewers' preference may affect\nthe accuracy of the final recommendation? To answer these important questions,\nwe formally analyze our model. Through this analysis, we obtain the insight on\nhow to design a randomized algorithm which is both computationally efficient\nand asymptotically accurate in evaluating the accuracy of a competitive group\nrecommendation system. We obtain number of interesting observations: i.e., for\na medium tier conference, three reviews per paper is sufficient for a high\naccuracy recommendation. For prestigious conferences, one may need at least\nseven reviews per paper to achieve high accuracy. We also propose a\nheterogeneous review strategy which requires equal or less reviewing workload,\nbut can improve over a homogeneous review strategy in recommendation accuracy\nby as much as 30% .
