For the sake of generality, we assume that the extended\nstate machines used in the contracts and implementations define sets of runs on\na given set of variables, that compose by intersection over the common\nvariables. In order to enable probabilistic reasoning, we consider that the\ncontracts dictate how certain input variables will behave, being either\nnon-deterministic, or probabilistic; the introduction of probabilistic\nvariables leading us to tune the notions of implementation, refinement and\ncomposition. As shown in the report, this probabilistic adaptation of the\nAssume/Guarantee contract theory preserves compositionality and therefore\nallows modular reliability analysis, either with a top-down or a bottom-up\napproach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2008 14:33:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Delahaye", "Beno\u00eet", "", "IRISA"], ["Caillaud", "Beno\u00eet", "", "IRISA, Irisa, Irisa"]]}, {"id": "0811.2596", "submitter": "Mohamed Hamdy Morsy Osman", "authors": "Mohamed H.S.

This\npaper investigates the characteristics of network topologies that maintain a\nhigh level of throughput in spite of multiple attacks. To this end, we select\nnetwork topologies belonging to the main network models and some real world\nnetworks. We consider three types of attacks: removal of random nodes, high\ndegree nodes, and high betweenness nodes. We use elasticity as our robustness\nmeasure and, through our analysis, illustrate that different topologies can\nhave different degrees of robustness. In particular, elasticity can fall as low\nas 0.8% of the upper bound based on the attack employed. This result\nsubstantiates the need for optimized network topology design. Furthermore, we\nimplement a tradeoff function that combines elasticity under the three attack\nstrategies and considers the cost of the network. Our extensive simulations\nshow that, for a given network density, regular and semi-regular topologies can\nhave higher degrees of robustness than heterogeneous topologies, and that link\nredundancy is a sufficient but not necessary condition for robustness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2008 07:35:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2009 18:55:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 20:31:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sydney", "Ali", ""], ["Scoglio", "Caterina", ""], ["Youssef", "Mina", ""], ["Schumm", "Phillip", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3387", "submitter": "Matthias W\\\"ahlisch", "authors": "Matthias W\\\"ahlisch, Thomas C.

In many\nsituations, the quality of service (QoS) in information-driven networks is\nprovisioned with the redundancy in information. Traditional performance models\ngenerally adopt evaluation measures suitable for packet-oriented service\nguarantee, such as packet delay, throughput, and packet loss rate. These\nperformance measures, however, do not align well with the actual need of\ninformation-driven networks. New performance measures and models for\ninformation-driven networks, despite their importance, have been mainly blank,\nlargely because information processing is clearly application dependent and\ncannot be easily captured within a generic framework. To fill the vacancy, we\npresent a new performance evaluation framework particularly tailored for\ninformation-driven networks, based on the recent development of stochastic\nnetwork calculus. We analyze the QoS with respect to information delivery and\nstudy the scheduling problem with the new performance metrics. Our analytical\nframework can be used to calculate the network capacity in information delivery\nand in the meantime to help transmission scheduling for a large body of systems\nwhere QoS is stochastically guaranteed with the redundancy in information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Nov 2008 21:29:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Kui", ""], ["Jiang", "Yuming", ""], ["Hu", "Guoqiang", ""]]}]
