First, we show\nconsiderable speedups attained by minor and relatively straightforward code\nchanges to off-load parts of the computation to the GPUs. Then, we identify\nfurther possible improvements to achieve even higher performance and\nscalability. On a system consisting of 16-cores and 2 GPUs, we observe speedups\nof up to 5x with respect to our optimized shared-memory code, which in turn\nmeans between 7.5x and 12.5x speedup with respect to the original FLEUR code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 13:48:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fabregat-Traver", "Diego", "", "3 and 4"], ["Davidovi\u0107", "Davor", "", "3 and 4"], ["H\u00f6hnerbach", "Markus", "", "3 and 4"], ["Di Napoli", "Edoardo", "", "3 and 4"]]}, {"id": "1611.00745", "submitter": "Siva Theja Maguluri", "authors": "Siva Theja Maguluri and Sai Kiran Burle and R.

We quantify the signal\npower loss caused by beam misalignment and the interference power accumulated\nfrom neighboring concurrent transmissions whose signals are leaked either via\nthe main-beam pointing in the similar direction or via side-lobe emission, and\nderive the probability distribution of the signal to interference plus noise\npower ratio (SINR). For scenarios where interfering transmitters are\ndistributed uniformly at random, we derive upper and lower bounds on the\ncumulative distribution function (abbreviated as CDF or c.d.f.) of SINR, which\ncan be easily applied to evaluate system performance. We validate our\nanalytical results by simulations where random nodes are uniformly distributed\nwithin a circular hall, and evaluate the sensitivity of average throughput and\noutage probability against two parameters: the half-power (3 dB) beamwidth to\nmain-lobe beamwidth ratio and the beam misalignment deviation to main-lobe\nbeamwidth ratio.
