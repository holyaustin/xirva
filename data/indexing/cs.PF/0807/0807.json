Our aim is to extend the well-known\nresults of the series and parallel cases. We first consider several exactly\nsolvable configurations of identical components with exponential failure-time\ndistribution functions to illustrate different (logarithmic or power-law)\nbehaviors as the size of the system, indexed by an integer n, increases. The\ngeneral case is then addressed: it provides a simple interpretation of the\norigin of the power-law exponent and an efficient asymptotic expression for the\ntotal reliability of large, recursive systems. Finally, we assess the influence\nof the non-exponential character of the component reliability on the\nn-dependence of the MTTF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2008 19:44:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tanguy", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.0629", "submitter": "Christian Tanguy", "authors": "Christian Tanguy", "title": "Exact two-terminal reliability of some directed networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on the Design of\n  Reliable Communication, La Rochelle : France (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The calculation of network reliability in a probabilistic context has long\nbeen an issue of practical and academic importance. Conventional approaches\n(determination of bounds, sums of disjoint products algorithms, Monte Carlo\nevaluations, studies of the reliability polynomials, etc.) only provide\napproximations when the network's size increases, even when nodes do not fail\nand all edges have the same reliability p. We consider here a directed, generic\ngraph of arbitrary size mimicking real-life long-haul communication networks,\nand give the exact, analytical solution for the two-terminal reliability. This\nsolution involves a product of transfer matrices, in which individual\nreliabilities of edges and nodes are taken into account. The special case of\nidentical edge and node reliabilities (p and rho, respectively) is addressed.\nWe consider a case study based on a commonly-used configuration, and assess the\ninfluence of the edges being directed (or not) on various measures of network\nperformance. While the two-terminal reliability, the failure frequency and the\nfailure rate of the connection are quite similar, the locations of complex\nzeros of the two-terminal reliability polynomials exhibit strong differences,\nand various structure transitions at specific values of rho. The present work\ncould be extended to provide a catalog of exactly solvable networks in terms of\nreliability, which could be useful as building blocks for new and improved\nbounds, as well as benchmarks, in the general case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2008 19:47:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tanguy", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.0993", "submitter": "Damien Hardy", "authors": "Damien Hardy (IRISA), Isabelle Puaut (IRISA)", "title": "WCET analysis of multi-level set-associative instruction caches", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-6574", "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advent of increasingly complex hardware in real-time embedded\nsystems (processors with performance enhancing features such as pipelines,\ncache hierarchy, multiple cores), many processors now have a set-associative L2\ncache. Thus, there is a need for considering cache hierarchies when validating\nthe temporal behavior of real-time systems, in particular when estimating\ntasks' worst-case execution times (WCETs). To the best of our knowledge, there\nis only one approach for WCET estimation for systems with cache hierarchies\n[Mueller, 1997], which turns out to be unsafe for set-associative caches. In\nthis paper, we highlight the conditions under which the approach described in\n[Mueller, 1997] is unsafe. A safe static instruction cache analysis method is\nthen presented. Contrary to [Mueller, 1997] our method supports set-associative\nand fully associative caches. The proposed method is experimented on\nmedium-size and large programs. We show that the method is most of the time\ntight. We further show that in all cases WCET estimations are much tighter when\nconsidering the cache hierarchy than when considering only the L1 cache. An\nevaluation of the analysis time is conducted, demonstrating that analysing the\ncache hierarchy has a reasonable computation time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2008 11:20:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Hardy", "Damien", "", "IRISA"], ["Puaut", "Isabelle", "", "IRISA"]]}, {"id": "0807.1160", "submitter": "Charles Shen", "authors": "Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Erich Nahum", "title": "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Server Overload Control: Design and\n  Evaluation", "comments": "In Proceedings of IPTComm 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server may be overloaded by\nemergency-induced call volume, ``American Idol'' style flash crowd effects or\ndenial of service attacks. The SIP server overload problem is interesting\nespecially because the costs of serving or rejecting a SIP session can be\nsimilar. For this reason, the built-in SIP overload control mechanism based on\ngenerating rejection messages cannot prevent the server from entering\ncongestion collapse under heavy load. The SIP overload problem calls for a\npushback control solution in which the potentially overloaded receiving server\nmay notify its upstream sending servers to have them send only the amount of\nload within the receiving server's processing capacity. The pushback framework\ncan be achieved by either a rate-based feedback or a window-based feedback. The\ncenterpiece of the feedback mechanism is the algorithm used to generate load\nregulation information. We propose three new window-based feedback algorithms\nand evaluate them together with two existing rate-based feedback algorithms. We\ncompare the different algorithms in terms of the number of tuning parameters\nand performance under both steady and variable load. Furthermore, we identify\ntwo categories of fairness requirements for SIP overload control, namely,\nuser-centric and provider-centric fairness. With the introduction of a new\ndouble-feed SIP overload control architecture, we show how the algorithms can\nmeet those fairness criteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 03:23:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Charles", ""], ["Schulzrinne", "Henning", ""], ["Nahum", "Erich", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1162", "submitter": "Charles Shen", "authors": "Charles Shen and Henning Schulzrinne", "title": "Measurement and Evaluation of ENUM Server Performance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of IEEE ICC 2007 p. 1967-1972", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  ENUM is a DNS-based protocol standard for mapping E.164 telephone numbers to\nInternet Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).

For such restricted mobility model, we propose a\nnovel class of scheduling and routing schemes, which significantly outperforms\nall delay-throughput results previously obtained in the case of identical\nnodes.
