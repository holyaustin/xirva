On the\nappearance of this PU on a specific frequency band, any SU occupying this band\nshould free it for PUs. Typically, SUs may collaborate to reduce the impact of\ncognitive users on the primary network and to improve the performance of the\nSUs. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of virtual\nreservation in collaborative cognitive networks. Virtual reservation is a novel\nlink maintenance strategy that aims to maximize the throughput of the cognitive\nnetwork through full spectrum utilization. Our performance evaluation shows\nsignificant improvements not only in the SUs blocking and forced termination\nprobabilities but also in the throughput of cognitive users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 18:10:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Abdel-Hamid", "Ayman T.", ""], ["Zahran", "Ahmed H.", ""], ["ElBatt", "Tamer", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.3809", "submitter": "Wilke Trei", "authors": "Wilke Trei", "title": "Efficient Modular Arithmetic for SIMD Devices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.PF math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes several new improvements of modular arithmetic and how\nto exploit them in order to gain more efficient implementations of commonly\nused algorithms, especially in cryptographic applications.

A HPC cloud is such cloud computing\nenvironment. One of challenges of energy efficient resource allocation for VMs\nin HPC cloud is tradeoff between minimizing total energy consumption of\nphysical machines (PMs) and satisfying Quality of Service (e.g. performance).\nOn one hand, cloud providers want to maximize their profit by reducing the\npower cost (e.g. using the smallest number of running PMs). On the other hand,\ncloud customers (users) want highest performance for their applications. In\nthis paper, we focus on the scenario that scheduler does not know global\ninformation about user jobs and user applications in the future. Users will\nrequest shortterm resources at fixed start times and non interrupted durations.\nWe then propose a new allocation heuristic (named Energy-aware and Performance\nper watt oriented Bestfit (EPOBF)) that uses metric of performance per watt to\nchoose which most energy-efficient PM for mapping each VM (e.g. maximum of MIPS\nper Watt). Using information from Feitelson's Parallel Workload Archive to\nmodel HPC jobs, we compare the proposed EPOBF to state of the art heuristics on\nheterogeneous PMs (each PM has multicore CPU). Simulations show that the EPOBF\ncan reduce significant total energy consumption in comparison with state of the\nart allocation heuristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2013 13:42:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 04:49:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 01:54:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Quang-Hung", "Nguyen", ""], ["Thoai", "Nam", ""], ["Son", "Nguyen Thanh", ""]]}]
