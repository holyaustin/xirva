U-relations support\nattribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider\npositive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible\nanswers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as,\na single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation. The\ntranslation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of\nnumber of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques\nemployed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective\nfor optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we\nshow that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with\nhigh degrees of uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2007 15:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Antova", "Lyublena", ""], ["Jansen", "Thomas", ""], ["Koch", "Christoph", ""], ["Olteanu", "Dan", ""]]}]
