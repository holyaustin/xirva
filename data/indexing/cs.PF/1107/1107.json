QAPL 2011 is a satellite event of the European Joint\nConferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2011).\n  The workshop theme is on quantitative aspects of computation. These aspects\nare related to the use of physical quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth,\netc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for\nreliability, security and trust), and play an important (sometimes essential)\nrole in characterising the behavior and determining the properties of systems.\nSuch quantities are central to the definition of both the model of systems\n(architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for\nthe analysis and verification of the systems properties. The aim of this\nworkshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such as\ntime and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the\nanalysis of systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2011 21:44:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Massink", "Mieke", "", "CNR-ISTI, Pisa, Italy"], ["Norman", "Gethin", "", "University of\n  Glasgow, UK"]]}, {"id": "1107.1202", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Lei Song (IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Flemming Nielson\n  (Technical University of Denmark), Bo Friis Nielsen (Technical University of\n  Denmark)", "title": "A Stochastic Broadcast Pi-Calculus", "comments": "In Proceedings QAPL 2011, arXiv:1107.0746", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 57, 2011, pp. 74-88", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.57.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a stochastic broadcast PI-calculus which can be used\nto model server-client based systems where synchronization is always governed\nby only one participant.

Unlike classical, equilibrium information\ntheory, information envelopes focus on the dynamics of sources and coders,\nusing functions of time that bound the number of bits generated. In the limit\nthe information envelopes converge to the average behavior and recover the\nentropy of a source, respectively, the average codeword length of a coder. In\ncontrast, on short time scales and for sources with memory it is shown that\nlarge deviations from known equilibrium results occur with non-negligible\nprobability. These can cause significant network delays. Compared to well-known\ntraffic models from queueing theory, information envelopes consider the\nfunctioning of information sources and coders, avoiding a priori assumptions,\nsuch as exponential traffic, or empirical, trace-based traffic models. Using\nresults from the stochastic network calculus, the envelopes yield a\ncharacterization of the operating points of source coders by the triplet of\ncapacity, delay, and error. In the limit, assuming an optimal coder the\nrequired capacity approaches the entropy with arbitrarily small probability of\nerror if infinitely large delays are permitted. We derive a corresponding\ncharacterization of channels and prove that the model has the desirable\nproperty of additivity, that allows analyzing coders and channels separately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2011 15:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["L\u00fcbben", "Ralf", ""], ["Fidler", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4851", "submitter": "Debabala Swain", "authors": "Debabala Swain, Bijay Paikaray, Debabrata Swain", "title": "AWRP: Adaptive Weight Ranking Policy for Improving Cache Performance", "comments": "6 pages; Journal of Computing, Volume 3, Issue 2, February 2011, ISSN\n  2151-9617; http://www.journalofcomputing.org", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.AR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the huge difference in performance between the computer memory and\nprocessor, the virtual memory management plays a vital role in system\nperformance.
