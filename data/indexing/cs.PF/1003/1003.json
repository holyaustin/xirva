Our research contributions are\nthree-fold: first, we propose an innovative usage model, called dynamic service\nprovision (DSP) model, for MTC or HTC service providers. In the DSP model, the\nresource provider provides the service of creating and managing runtime\nenvironments for MTC or HTC service providers, and consolidates heterogeneous\nMTC or HTC workloads on the cloud platform; second, according to the DSP model,\nwe design and implement DawningCloud, which provides automatic management for\nheterogeneous workloads; third, a comprehensive evaluation of DawningCloud has\nbeen performed in an emulatation experiment. We found that for typical\nworkloads, in comparison with the previous two cloud solutions, DawningCloud\nsaves the resource consumption maximally by 46.4% (HTC) and 74.9% (MTC) for the\nservice providers, and saves the total resource consumption maximally by 29.7%\nfor the resource provider. At the same time, comparing with the traditional\nsolution that provides MTC or HTC services with dedicated systems, DawningCloud\nis more cost-effective. To this end, we conclude that for typical MTC and HTC\nworkloads, on the cloud platform, MTC and HTC service providers and the\nresource provider can benefit from the economies of scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2010 00:10:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Apr 2010 08:09:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 05:50:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Lei", ""], ["Zhan", "Jianfeng", ""], ["Shi", "Weisong", ""], ["Liang", "Yi", ""], ["Yuan", "Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2084", "submitter": "Rena Bakhshi", "authors": "Rena Bakhshi and J\\\"org Endrullis and Wan Fokkink and Jun Pang", "title": "Asynchronous Bounded Expected Delay Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.DS cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The commonly used asynchronous bounded delay (ABD) network models assume a\nfixed bound on message delay.

While the\nconditions of ABD networks restrict the set of possible executions, in ABE\nnetworks all asynchronous executions are possible, but executions with\nextremely long delays are less probable. In contrast to ABD networks, ABE\nnetworks cannot be synchronised efficiently.

In this paper we have proposed VoD cache\nmemory replacement algorithm for a multimedia server system. We propose a Rank\nbased cache replacement policy to manage the cache space in individual proxy\nserver cache. Proposed replacement strategy incorporates in a simple way the\nmost important characteristics of the video and its accesses such as its size,\naccess frequency, recentness of the last access and the cost incurred while\ntransferring the requested video from the server to the proxy. We compare our\nalgorithm with some popular cache replacement algorithm using simulation. The\nvideo objects are ranked based on the access trend by considering the factors\nsuch as size, frequency and cost. Many studies have demonstrated that\nZipf's-like law can govern many features of the VoD and is used to describe the\npopularity of the video. In this paper, we have designed a model, which ranks\nthe video on the basis of its popularity using the Zipf-like law. The video\nwith higher ranking is named \"hot\", while the video with lower ranking is named\n\"cold\". The result show that the proposed rank based algorithm improves cache\nhit ratio, cache byte ratio and average request latencies compared to other\nalgorithms. Our experimental results indicate that Rank based cache replacement\nalgorithm outperforms LRU, LFU and Greedy Dual.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2010 05:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "T R Gopalakrishnan", ""], ["Jayarekha", "P", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.4064", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "A.
