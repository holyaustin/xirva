Both the cases with\nnon-causal and causal energy state information (ESI) are considered, which\ncorrespond to the energy harvesting rates being known and unknown prior to the\ntransmissions, respectively. For the non-causal ESI case, the average outage\nprobability minimization problem over a finite horizon is shown to be\nnon-convex for a large class of practical fading channels. However, the\nglobally optimal \"offline\" power allocation is obtained by a forward search\nalgorithm with at most $N$ one-dimensional searches, and the optimal power\nprofile is shown to be non-decreasing over time and have an interesting\n\"save-then-transmit\" structure. In particular, for the special case of N=1, our\nresult revisits the classic outage capacity for fading channels with uniform\npower allocation. Moreover, for the case with causal ESI, we propose both the\noptimal and suboptimal \"online\" power allocation algorithms, by applying the\ntechnique of dynamic programming and exploring the structure of optimal offline\nsolutions, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 07:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 May 2013 19:04:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Chuan", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Cui", "Shuguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0703", "submitter": "Kurt Mehlhorn", "authors": "Tomasz Jurkiewicz, Kurt Mehlhorn", "title": "The Cost of Address Translation", "comments": "A extended abstract of this paper was published in the proceedings of\n  ALENEX13, New Orleans, USA", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modern computers are not random access machines (RAMs).

Our goal is to design practical scheduling\npolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput\nand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$-complexity\nhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both\nrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic\nregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),\ntheir practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop\na simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\n\\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves\nthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay\nperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for\nany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable\nrate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able\nto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$ of the hybrid\npolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More\nimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity\nthan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in\nthe $O(\\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate\nour theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that\nD-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is\nvirtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 16:05:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Mar 2013 21:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2013 09:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 17:06:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Bo", ""], ["Gupta", "Gagan R.", ""], ["Sharma", "Manu", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1896", "submitter": "Muhammad Yasir Malik", "authors": "Muhammad Yasir Malik", "title": "Power Consumption Analysis of a Modern Smartphone", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents observations about power consumption of a latest\nsmartphone.
