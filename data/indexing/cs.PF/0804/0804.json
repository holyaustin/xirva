One of the technologies that enabled\nthis is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking. Traditional ATM networks\nare wired networks. But Tactical networks are meant to be mobile and this\nnecessitates the use of radio relays for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and\nVehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. ATM networks assume a physical link\nlayer BER of 10^-9 or better because of the availability of reliable media like\noptical fiber links. But this assumption is no longer valid when ATM switches\nare connected through radio relay where error rates are in the rage of 10^-3.\nThis paper presents the architecture of a Link Enhancer meant to improve the\nBit Error Rate of the Wireless links used for V2I and V2V communications from 1\nin 10^4 to 1 in 10^8\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Apr 2008 18:54:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["P", "Arun Kumar S", ""], ["Baishya", "Diganta", ""], ["Kumar", "Amrendra", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4039", "submitter": "Ioannis Chatzigiannakis", "authors": "Ioannis Chatzigiannakis, Georgios Giannoulis and Paul G.

We present\nthe preemptive algorithm \"Save-Energy\" that given a schedule of tasks it post\nprocesses it to improve the energy efficiency without any deterioration of the\nmakespan. In terms of time efficiency, we show that preemptive scheduling in an\nasymmetric system can achieve the same or better optimal makespan than in a\nsymmetric system. Motivited by real multiprocessor systems, we investigate\narchitectures that exhibit limited asymmetry: there are two essentially\ndifferent speeds. Interestingly, this special case has not been studied in the\nfield of parallel computing and scheduling theory; only the general case was\nstudied where processors have $K$ essentially different speeds. We present the\nnon-preemptive algorithm ``Remnants'' that achieves almost optimal makespan. We\nprovide a refined analysis of a recent scheduling method. Based on this\nanalysis, we specialize the scheduling policy and provide an algorithm of $(3 +\no(1))$ expected approximation factor. Note that this improves the previous best\nfactor (6 for two speeds). We believe that our work will convince researchers\nto revisit this well studied scheduling problem for these simple, yet\nrealistic, asymmetric multiprocessor architectures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2008 03:16:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jun 2008 14:21:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chatzigiannakis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Giannoulis", "Georgios", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul G.", ""]]}]
