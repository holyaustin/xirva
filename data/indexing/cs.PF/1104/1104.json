However, it is crucial to understand what type of relaying\nschemes should be used for achieving different performance objectives under\nrealistic fading conditions. In this paper, we present a general framework for\nmodelling and evaluating the performance of relaying schemes based on the\ndecode-and-forward (DF) protocol over independent and not necessarily\nidentically distributed (INID) Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, we\npresent closed-form expressions for the statistics of the instantaneous output\nsignal-to-noise ratio of four significant relaying schemes with DF; two based\non repetitive transmission and the other two based on relay selection (RS).\nThese expressions are then used to obtain closed-form expressions for the\noutage probability and the average symbol error probability for several\nmodulations of all considered relaying schemes over INID Nakagami-m fading.\nImportantly, it is shown that when the channel state information for RS is\nperfect, RS-based transmission schemes always outperform repetitive ones.\nFurthermore, when the direct link between the source and the destination nodes\nis sufficiently strong, relaying may not result in any gains and in this case\nit should be switched-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 09:37:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alexandropoulos", "George C.", ""], ["Papadogiannis", "Agisilaos", ""], ["Sofotasios", "Paschalis C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1729", "submitter": "Georg Hager", "authors": "Klaus Iglberger, Georg Hager, Jan Treibig, Ulrich Ruede", "title": "Expression Templates Revisited: A Performance Analysis of the Current ET\n  Methodology", "comments": "16 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 34(2), C42-C69 (2012)", "doi": "10.1137/110830125", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the last decade, Expression Templates (ET) have gained a reputation as an\nefficient performance optimization tool for C++ codes.
