As\nInternet evolution makes TCP's use as a substrate likely to grow, we offer\nMinion, an architecture for backward-compatible out-of-order delivery atop TCP\nand TLS. Small OS API extensions allow applications to manage TCP's send buffer\nand to receive TCP segments out-of-order. Atop these extensions, Minion builds\napplication-level protocols offering true unordered datagram delivery, within\nstreams preserving strict wire-compatibility with unsecured or TLS-secured TCP\nconnections. Minion's protocols can run on unmodified TCP stacks, but benefit\nincrementally when either endpoint is upgraded, for a backward-compatible\ndeployment path. Experiments suggest that Minion can noticeably improve\nperformance of applications such as conferencing, virtual private networking,\nand web browsing, while incurring minimal CPU or bandwidth costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 15:55:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 20:27:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2013 14:39:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Nowlan", "Michael F.", ""], ["Tiwari", "Nabin", ""], ["Iyengar", "Janardhan", ""], ["Amin", "Syed Obaid", ""], ["Ford", "Bryan", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1305", "submitter": "Hugo M\\'eric M", "authors": "Hugo M\\'eric, J\\'er\\^ome Lacan, Caroline Amiot-Bazile, Fabrice Arnal\n  and Marie-Laure Boucheret", "title": "Generic Approach for Hierarchical Modulation Performance Analysis:\n  Application to DVB-SH", "comments": "To appear in WTS 2011 proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Broadcasting systems have to deal with channel diversity in order to offer\nthe best rate to the users.

We\ninvestigate cost reduction opportunities that arise by the use of uninterrupted\npower supply (UPS) units as energy storage devices. This represents a deviation\nfrom the usual use of these devices as mere transitional fail-over mechanisms\nbetween utility and captive sources such as diesel generators. We consider the\nproblem of opportunistically using these devices to reduce the time average\nelectric utility bill in a data center. Using the technique of Lyapunov\noptimization, we develop an online control algorithm that can optimally exploit\nthese devices to minimize the time average cost. This algorithm operates\nwithout any knowledge of the statistics of the workload or electricity cost\nprocesses, making it attractive in the presence of workload and pricing\nuncertainties. An interesting feature of our algorithm is that its deviation\nfrom optimality reduces as the storage capacity is increased. Our work opens up\na new area in data center power management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 05:37:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Mar 2011 12:58:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Urgaonkar", "Rahul", ""], ["Urgaonkar", "Bhuvan", ""], ["Neely", "Michael J.", ""], ["Sivasubramaniam", "Anand", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3225", "submitter": "Lars Bergstrom", "authors": "Lars Bergstrom", "title": "Measuring NUMA effects with the STREAM benchmark", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modern high-end machines feature multiple processor packages, each of which\ncontains multiple independent cores and integrated memory controllers connected\ndirectly to dedicated physical RAM.
