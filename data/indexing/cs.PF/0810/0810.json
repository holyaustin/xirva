Considered\nschemes consist of the LCQ policy, which transmits from a longest connected\nqueue in the entire system, and its low-complexity variants that transmit from\na longest queue within a randomly chosen subset of connected queues. A\nMarkovian model is studied where mean packet transmission time is $n^{-1}$ and\npacket arrival rate is $\\lambda<1$ per queue. Transient and equilibrium\ndistributions of queue occupancies are obtained in the limit as the system size\n$n$ tends to infinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2008 15:02:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alanyali", "Murat", ""], ["Dashouk", "Maxim", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.0394", "submitter": "Benedek Kov\\'acs", "authors": "Peter Fulop, Benedek Kovacs, Sandor Imre", "title": "Mobility Management Framework", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates mobility management strategies from the point of view\nof their need of signalling and processing resources on the backbone network\nand load on the air interface. A method is proposed to model the serving\nnetwork and mobile node mobility in order to be able to compare the different\ntypes of mobility management algorithms. To obtain a good description of the\nnetwork we calculate descriptive parameters from given topologies. Most\nmobility approaches derived from existing protocols are analyzed and their\nperformances are numerically compared in various network and mobility\nscenarios. We developed a mobility management framework that is able to give\ngeneral designing guidelines for the next generation mobility managements on\ngiven network, technology and mobility properties. With our model an operator\ncan design the network and tune the parameters to obtain the optimal\nimplementation of course revising existing systems is also possible. We present\na vertical handover decision method as a special application of our model\nframework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2008 11:44:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fulop", "Peter", ""], ["Kovacs", "Benedek", ""], ["Imre", "Sandor", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1571", "submitter": "Rena Bakhshi", "authors": "Rena Bakhshi and Daniela Gavidia and Wan Fokkink and Maarten van Steen", "title": "An Analytical Model of Information Dissemination for a Gossip-based\n  Protocol", "comments": "20 pages, 8 figures, technical report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comnet.2009.03.017", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.DM cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop an analytical model of information dissemination for a gossiping\nprotocol that combines both pull and push approaches.
