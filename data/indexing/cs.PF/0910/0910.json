The idea is\nquestioned in two different ways. Firstly, a class of models used to simulate\nInternet traffic is shown to have important theoretical flaws. It is shown that\nthis behaviour is inconsistent with the behaviour of real traffic traces.\nSecondly, the notion that long-range correlations significantly affects the\nqueuing performance of traffic is investigated by destroying those correlations\nin real traffic traces (by reordering). It is shown that the longer ranges of\ncorrelations are not important except in one case with an extremely high load.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 11:46:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Clegg", "Richard G.", ""], ["Landa", "Raul", ""], ["Rio", "Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0316", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "P.

However, the expressing power of these\n\"single-example\" queries fails when the user's delicate query intent is not\navailable as a single example. Recently, the well-known skyline operator was\nreused in metric similarity search as a \"multi-example\" query type. When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline\noperator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances\n(similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric\nskyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all\nthe examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In\nthis paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use\nof PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the\noriginal M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs. In\nexperiments we also evaluate the partial metric skyline processing, where only\na controlled number of skyline objects is retrieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Skopal", "Tomas", ""], ["Lokoc", "Jakub", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.1719", "submitter": "Federico Calzolari", "authors": "Federico Calzolari", "title": "High availability using virtualization", "comments": "PhD Thesis in Information Technology Engineering: Electronics,\n  Computer Science, Telecommunications, pp. 94, University of Pisa [Italy]", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  High availability has always been one of the main problems for a data center.\nTill now high availability was achieved by host per host redundancy, a highly\nexpensive method in terms of hardware and human costs.
