To\nmodel dynamic aggregations, which are sometimes referred to as ensembles, CARMA\nprovides communication primitives that are based on predicates over the\nexhibited attributes. These predicates are used to select the participants in a\ncommunication. Two communication mechanisms are provided in the CARMA language:\nmulticast-based and unicast-based. In this paper, we first introduce the basic\nprinciples of CARMA and then we show how our language can be used to support\nspecification with a simple but illustrative example of a socio-technical\ncollective adaptive system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 02:10:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bortolussi", "Luca", "", "Saarland University, University of Trieste,\n  ISTI-CNR"], ["De Nicola", "Rocco", "", "IMT Lucca"], ["Galpin", "Vashti", "", "University of\n  Edinburgh"], ["Gilmore", "Stephen", "", "University of Edinburgh"], ["Hillston", "Jane", "", "University of Edinburgh"], ["Latella", "Diego", "", "ISTI-CNR"], ["Loreti", "Michele", "", "Universit\u00e0 di Firenze, IMT Lucca"], ["Massink", "Mieke", "", "ISTI-CNR"]]}, {"id": "1509.08561", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Luca Bortolussi (University of Trieste), Jane Hillston (University of\n  Edinburgh)", "title": "Efficient Checking of Individual Rewards Properties in Markov Population\n  Models", "comments": "In Proceedings QAPL 2015, arXiv:1509.08169", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 194, 2015, pp. 32-47", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.194.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PF cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years fluid approaches to the analysis of Markov populations models\nhave been demonstrated to have great pragmatic value.
