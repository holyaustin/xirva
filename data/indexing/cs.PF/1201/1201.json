This volume gives a\nunified treatment of the TC framework that has been developed by the authors\nand their collaborators over the past decade. The mathematical framework\nunderlying the analysis (reviewed in Ch. 2) is stochastic geometry: Poisson\npoint processes model the locations of interferers, and (stable) shot noise\nprocesses represent the aggregate interference seen at a receiver. Ch. 3\npresents TC results (exact, asymptotic, and bounds) on a simple model in order\nto illustrate a key strength of the framework: analytical tractability yields\nexplicit performance dependence upon key model parameters. Ch. 4 presents\nenhancements to this basic model --- channel fading, variable link distances,\nand multi-hop. Ch. 5 presents four network design case studies well-suited to\nTC: i) spectrum management, ii) interference cancellation, iii) signal\nthreshold transmission scheduling, and iv) power control. Ch. 6 studies the TC\nwhen nodes have multiple antennas, which provides a contrast vs. classical\nresults that ignore interference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2012 15:21:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Steven", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.1090", "submitter": "Hossein Shokri Ghadikolaei", "authors": "Hossein Shokri-Ghadikolaei, Fatemeh Sheikholeslami, Masoumeh\n  Nasiri-Kenari", "title": "Distributed Multiuser Sequential Channel Sensing Schemes in Multichannel\n  Cognitive Radio Networks", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial problem\nassociated with Figs. 2 and 3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2012 09:26:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 06:29:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shokri-Ghadikolaei", "Hossein", ""], ["Sheikholeslami", "Fatemeh", ""], ["Nasiri-Kenari", "Masoumeh", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.1695", "submitter": "Nikzad Babaii-Rizvandi", "authors": "Nikzad Babaii Rizvandi, Javid Taheri, and Albert Y.

In response to this,\nmany energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily using the\ndynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability which has been incorporated\ninto recent commodity processors. Majority of these algorithms involve two\npasses: schedule generation and slack reclamation. The former pass involves the\nredistribution of tasks among DVFS-enabled processors based on a given cost\nfunction that includes makespan and energy consumption; and, while the latter\npass is typically achieved by executing individual tasks with slacks at a lower\nprocessor frequency. In this paper, a new slack reclamation algorithm is\nproposed by approaching the energy reduction problem from a different angle.\nFirstly, the problem of task slack reclamation by using combinations of\nprocessors' frequencies is formulated. Secondly, several proofs are provided to\nshow that (1) if the working frequency set of processor is assumed to be\ncontinues, the optimal energy will be always achieved by using only one\nfrequency, (2) for real processors with a discrete set of working frequencies,\nthe optimal energy is always achieved by using at most two frequencies, and (3)\nthese two frequencies are adjacent/neighbouring when processor energy\nconsumption is a convex function of frequency. Thirdly, a novel algorithm to\nfind the best combination of frequencies to result the optimal energy is\npresented. The presented algorithm has been evaluated based on results obtained\nfrom experiments with three different sets of task graphs: 3000 randomly\ngenerated task graphs, and 600 task graphs for two popular applications\n(Gauss-Jordan and LU decomposition). The results show the superiority of the\nproposed algorithm in comparison with other techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2012 06:31:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rizvandi", "Nikzad Babaii", ""], ["Taheri", "Javid", ""], ["Zomaya", "Albert Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2034", "submitter": "Ram mohan Reddy Ch Mr", "authors": "Ch Ram Mohan Reddy, D.

Rare\nproperties are often very important but pose a particular challenge for\nsimulation-based approaches, hence a key objective under these circumstances is\nto reduce the number and length of simulations necessary to produce a given\nlevel of confidence. Importance sampling is a well-established technique that\nachieves this, however to maintain the advantages of statistical model checking\nit is necessary to find good importance sampling distributions without\nconsidering the entire state space.\n  Motivated by the above, we present a simple algorithm that uses the notion of\ncross-entropy to find the optimal parameters for an importance sampling\ndistribution. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm uses a low\ndimensional vector of parameters to define this distribution and thus avoids\nthe often intractable explicit representation of a transition matrix. We show\nthat our parametrisation leads to a unique optimum and can produce many orders\nof magnitude improvement in simulation efficiency.
