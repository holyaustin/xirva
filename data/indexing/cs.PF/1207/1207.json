QAPL 2012 is a satellite event of the European Joint\nConferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2012). The workshop theme\nis on quantitative aspects of computation. These aspects are related to the use\nof physical quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as\nmathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for reliability,\nsecurity and trust), and play an important (sometimes essential) role in\ncharacterising the behavior and determining the properties of systems. Such\nquantities are central to the definition of both the model of systems\n(architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for\nthe analysis and verification of the systems properties. The aim of this\nworkshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such as\ntime and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the\nanalysis of systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 01:24:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wiklicky", "Herbert", ""], ["Massink", "Mieke", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0873", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Luca Bortolussi (University of Trieste), Vashti Galpin (University of\n  Edinburgh), Jane Hillston (University of Edinburgh)", "title": "Hybrid performance modelling of opportunistic networks", "comments": "In Proceedings QAPL 2012, arXiv:1207.0559", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 85, 2012, pp. 106-121", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.85.8", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.LO cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate the modelling of opportunistic networks using the process\nalgebra stochastic HYPE.
