The flexibility is\nachieved when computing platform designed with heterogeneous resources to\nsupport multifarious tasks of an application where as task scheduling brings\nparallel processing. The efficient task scheduling is critical to obtain\noptimized performance in heterogeneous computing Systems (HCS). In this paper,\nwe brought a review of various application scheduling models which provide\nparallelism for homogeneous and heterogeneous computing systems. In this paper,\nwe made a review of various scheduling methodologies targeted to high speed\ncomputing systems and also prepared summary chart. The comparative study of\nscheduling methodologies for high speed computing systems has been carried out\nbased on the attributes of platform & application as well. The attributes are\nexecution time, nature of task, task handling capability, type of host &\ncomputing platform.

However,\nexisting mmW communications standards are hindered by two problems: deafness\nand single link scheduling. The deafness problem, that is, a misalignment\nbetween transmitter and receiver beams, demands a time consuming beam-searching\noperation, which leads to an alignment-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the\nexisting mmW standards schedule a single link in each time slot and hence do\nnot fully exploit the potential of mmW communications, where directional\ncommunications allow multiple concurrent transmissions. These two problems are\naddressed in this paper, where a joint beamwidth selection and power allocation\nproblem is formulated by an optimization problem for short range mmW networks\nwith the objective of maximizing effective network throughput. This\noptimization problem allows establishing the fundamental alignment-throughput\ntradeoff, however it is computationally complex and requires exact knowledge of\nnetwork topology, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, two\nstandard-compliant approximation solution algorithms are developed, which rely\non underestimation and overestimation of interference. The first one exploits\ndirectionality to maximize the reuse of available spectrum and thereby\nincreases the network throughput, while imposing almost no computational\ncomplexity. The second one is a more conservative approach that protects all\nactive links from harmful interference, yet enhances the network throughput by\n100% compared to the existing standards. Extensive performance analysis\nprovides useful insights on the directionality level and the number of\nconcurrent transmissions that should be pursued. Interestingly, extremely\nnarrow beams are in general not optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 01:06:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Shokri-Ghadikolaei", "Hossein", ""], ["Gkatzikis", "Lazaros", ""], ["Fischione", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.03307", "submitter": "Andrea Tassi", "authors": "Andrew L.

The generation of the\nglobal finite element matrix is performed in two steps, computing the local\nmatrices by numerical integration and assembling them into a global system,\nwhich has traditionally been done in serial computing. This work presents a\nfast technique to construct the global finite element matrix that arises by\nsolving the Poisson's equation in a three-dimensional domain. The proposed\nmethodology consists in computing the numerical integration, due to its\nintrinsic parallel opportunities, in the graphics processing unit (GPU) and\ncomputing the matrix assembly, due to its intrinsic serial operations, in the\ncentral processing unit (CPU). In the numerical integration, only the lower\ntriangular part of each local stiffness matrix is computed thanks to its\nsymmetry, which saves GPU memory and computing time. As a result of symmetry,\nthe global sparse matrix also contains non-zero elements only in its lower\ntriangular part, which reduces the assembly operations and memory usage.
