The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness\nwhen remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB).\nResponsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality.\nMethod. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical\nstochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with\nminimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained\nis a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and\nthe request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole\ncommunication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are\nnecessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource\nmanagement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 11:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pentzaropoulos", "G.

We propose a\nmulti-GPU implementation using a block-structured MPI parallelization, suitable\nfor load balancing and heterogeneous computations on CPUs and GPUs. The\noverhead required for multi-GPU simulations is discussed in detail and it is\ndemonstrated that the kernel performance can be sustained to a large extent.\nWith our GPU implementation, we achieve nearly perfect weak scalability on\nInfiniBand clusters. However, in strong scaling scenarios multi-GPUs make less\nefficient use of the hardware than IBM BG/P and x86 clusters. Hence, a cost\nanalysis must determine the best course of action for a particular simulation\ntask. Additionally, weak scaling results of heterogeneous simulations conducted\non CPUs and GPUs simultaneously are presented using clusters equipped with\nvarying node configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 14:27:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Feichtinger", "Christian", ""], ["Habich", "Johannes", ""], ["Koestler", "Harald", ""], ["Hager", "Georg", ""], ["Ruede", "Ulrich", ""], ["Wellein", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4853", "submitter": "Nadir Farhi", "authors": "Nadir Farhi and Bruno Gaujal", "title": "Performance bounds in wormhole routing, a network calculus approach", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a model of performance bound calculus on feedforward networks\nwhere data packets are routed under wormhole routing discipline.

Our study suggests that OS-OFDMA with subchannel notching\nand channel bonding could provide almost ten times higher throughput compared\nwith the design without those options, when the activity and density of\nwireless microphones is very high. Furthermore, we confirm that OS-OFDMA\nimplementation without subchannel notching, used in the IEEE 802.22, is able to\nsupport real-time and non-real-time quality of service classes, provided that\nwireless microphones temporal activity is moderate (with approximately one\nwireless microphone per 3,000 inhabitants with light urban population density\nand short duty cycles).
