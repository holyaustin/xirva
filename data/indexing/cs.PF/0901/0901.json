With such capabilities at hand, truly distributed task scheduling\nwith minimal latencies would be reachable by internationally distributed\ncollaborations (such as ones in HENP) seeking for scavenging or maximizing on\ngeographically spread computational resources. But it is often not all clear\n(a) how to move data when available from multiple sources or (b) how to move\ndata to multiple compute resources to achieve an optimal usage of available\nresources. We present a method of creating a Constraint Programming (CP) model\nconsisting of sites, links and their attributes such as bandwidth for grid\nnetwork data transfer also considering user tasks as part of the objective\nfunction for an optimal solution. We will explore and explain trade-off between\nschedule generation time and divergence from the optimal solution and show how\nto improve and render viable the solution's finding time by using search tree\ntime limit, approximations, restrictions such as symmetry breaking or grouping\nsimilar tasks together, or generating sequence of optimal schedules by\nsplitting the input problem. Results of data transfer simulation for each case\nwill also include a well known Peer-2-Peer model, and time taken to generate a\nschedule as well as time needed for a schedule execution will be compared to a\nCP optimal solution. We will additionally present a possible implementation\naimed to bring a distributed datasets (multiple sources) to a given site in a\nminimal time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Dec 2008 21:25:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Zerola", "Michal", ""], ["Lauret", "Jerome", ""], ["Bartak", "Roman", ""], ["Sumbera", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1782", "submitter": "Pietro Michiardi Dr.", "authors": "Claudio Casetti, Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini, Marco Fiore, Chi-Anh La,\n  Pietro Michiardi", "title": "A Holistic Approach to Information Distribution in Ad Hoc Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the problem of spreading information contents in a wireless ad\nhoc network with mechanisms embracing the peer-to-peer paradigm. In our vision,\ninformation dissemination should satisfy the following requirements: (i) it\nconforms to a predefined distribution and (ii) it is evenly and fairly carried\nby all nodes in their turn. In this paper, we observe the dissemination effects\nwhen the information moves across nodes according to two well-known mobility\nmodels, namely random walk and random direction. Our approach is fully\ndistributed and comes at a very low cost in terms of protocol overhead; in\naddition, simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve the\naforementioned goals under different network scenarios, provided that a\nsufficient number of information replicas are injected into the network. This\nobservation calls for a further step: in the realistic case where the user\ncontent demand varies over time, we need a content replication/drop strategy to\nadapt the number of information replicas to the changes in the information\nquery rate. We therefore devise a distributed, lightweight scheme that performs\nefficiently in a variety of scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2009 13:12:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Casetti", "Claudio", ""], ["Chiasserini", "Carla-Fabiana", ""], ["Fiore", "Marco", ""], ["La", "Chi-Anh", ""], ["Michiardi", "Pietro", ""]]}]
