This entails the execution of a\nproblem-specific kernel to numerically evaluate an integral for each element in\nthe discretized problem domain. Since the domain size can be huge, executing\nefficient kernels is fundamental. Their op- timization is, however, a\nchallenging issue. Even though affine loop nests are generally present, the\nshort trip counts and the complexity of mathematical expressions make it hard\nto determine a single or unique sequence of successful transformations.\nTherefore, we present the design and systematic evaluation of COF- FEE, a\ndomain-specific compiler for local assembly kernels. COFFEE manipulates\nabstract syntax trees generated from a high-level domain-specific language for\nPDEs by introducing domain-aware composable optimizations aimed at improving\ninstruction-level parallelism, especially SIMD vectorization, and register\nlocality. It then generates C code including vector intrinsics. Experiments\nusing a range of finite-element forms of increasing complexity show that\nsignificant performance improvement is achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 13:01:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2014 09:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Luporini", "Fabio", ""], ["Varbanescu", "Ana Lucia", ""], ["Rathgeber", "Florian", ""], ["Bercea", "Gheorghe-Teodor", ""], ["Ramanujam", "J.", ""], ["Ham", "David A.", ""], ["Kelly", "Paul H.

Fundamental\nproperties of tandem queues with finite buffer capacity are examined. We show\nthat in general system service rate of a dual tandem queue with finite buffer\ncapacity is equal or smaller than its bottleneck service rate, and virtual\ninterruptions, which are the extra idle period at the bottleneck caused by the\nnon-bottlenecks, depend on arrival rates.

PV can also potentially avoid the energy losses\nthat are normally associated with long-range grid distribution. The increased\npenetration of solar panels, however, has introduced a need for solar energy\nmodels that are capable of producing realistic synthetic data with small error\nmargins. Such models, for instance, can be used to design the appropriate size\nof energy storage devices or to determine the maximum charging rate of a\nPV-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station. In this regard, this paper\nproposes a stochastic model for solar generation using a Markov chain approach.\nBased on real data, it is first shown that the solar states are\ninter-dependent, and thus suitable for modeling using a Markov model. Then, the\nprobabilities of transition between states are shown to be heterogeneous over\ndifferent time segments. A model is proposed that captures the inter temporal\ndependency of solar irradiance through segmentation of the Markov chain across\ndifferent times of the day. In the studied model, different state transition\nmatrices are constructed for different time segments, which the proposed\nalgorithm then uses to generate the solar states for different times of the\nday. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed\nsynthetic generator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2014 03:09:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Tushar", "Wayes", "", "Andrew"], ["Huang", "Shisheng", "", "Andrew"], ["Yuen", "Chau", "", "Andrew"], ["Jian", "", "", "Andrew"], ["Zhang", "", ""], ["Smith", "David B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5393", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Herbert Wiklicky (Imperial College London)", "title": "Program Synthesis and Linear Operator Semantics", "comments": "In Proceedings SYNT 2014, arXiv:1407.4937", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 157, 2014, pp. 17-33", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.157.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For deterministic and probabilistic programs we investigate the problem of\nprogram synthesis and program optimisation (with respect to non-functional\nproperties) in the general setting of global optimisation.
