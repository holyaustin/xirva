The approximation is derived from the\noutage event for each hop. The simulation results show the tightness of the\nproposed approximation in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2008 11:45:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Jun Kyoung", ""], ["Yang", "Janghoon", ""], ["Kim", "Dong Ku", ""]]}]
