Mantis integrates techniques from programming\nlanguage and machine learning for performance modeling, and is a radical\ndeparture from traditional approaches. Mantis extracts program features, which\nare information about program execution runs, through program instrumentation.\nIt uses machine learning techniques to select features relevant to performance\nand creates prediction models as a function of the selected features. Through\nprogram analysis, it then generates compact code slices that compute these\nfeature values for prediction. Our evaluation shows that Mantis can achieve\nmore than 93% accuracy with less than 10% training data set, which is a\nsignificant improvement over models that are oblivious to program features. The\nsystem generates code slices that are cheap to compute feature values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 21:02:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Chun", "Byung-Gon", ""], ["Huang", "Ling", ""], ["Lee", "Sangmin", ""], ["Maniatis", "Petros", ""], ["Naik", "Mayur", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0041", "submitter": "Przemyslaw Pawelczak", "authors": "Wesam Gabran, Przemys{\\l}aw Pawe{\\l}czak, and Danijela \\v{C}abri\\'c", "title": "Throughput and Collision Analysis of Multi-Channel Multi-Stage Spectrum\n  Sensing Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transations on Vehicular Technology, vol. 60, no. 7, pp.\n  3309-3323, 2011", "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2011.2160210", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multi-stage sensing is a novel concept that refers to a general class of\nspectrum sensing algorithms that divide the sensing process into a number of\nsequential stages. The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per\nstage can be used to optimize performance with respect to secondary user\nthroughput and the collision probability between primary and secondary users.\nSo far, the impact of multi-stage sensing on network throughput and collision\nprobability for a realistic network model is relatively unexplored. Therefore,\nwe present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation\nof different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for\nOpportunistic Spectrum Access networks. The contribution of our work lies in\nstudying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of\nsensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage,\nsingle and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels,\nprimary and secondary user traffic, buffering of incoming secondary user\ntraffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics\ninclude the average secondary user throughput and the average collision\nprobability between primary and secondary users. Our results show that when the\nprobability of primary user mis-detection is constrained, the performance of\nmulti-stage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single stage sensing\ncounterpart. Besides, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of\nsensing decreases the collision probability considerably, while keeping the\nthroughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic primary user traffic\nscenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between\nsecondary users throughput and collision probability while meeting successful\ndetection constraints subjected by Opportunistic Spectrum Access communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 00:45:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 20:36:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 23:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:37:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gabran", "Wesam", ""], ["Pawe\u0142czak", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["\u010cabri\u0107", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0630", "submitter": "Georgios Paschos", "authors": "Petteri Mannersalo, Georgios S.

The performance of this scheme strongly depends on\nthe network topology and thus on the locations of the wireless nodes. Also, it\nhas been shown previously that finding the encoding strategy, which achieves\nmaximum performance, requires complex calculations to be undertaken by the\nwireless node in real-time.\n  Both deterministic and random point pattern are explored and using the\nBoolean connectivity model we provide upper bounds for the maximum coding\nnumber, i.e., the number of packets that can be combined such that the\ncorresponding receivers are able to decode. For the models studied, this upper\nbound is of order of $\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ denotes the (mean) number of\nneighbors. Moreover, achievable coding numbers are provided for grid-like\nnetworks. We also calculate the multiplicative constants that determine the\ngain in case of a small network. Building on the above results, we provide an\nanalytic expression for the upper bound of the efficiency of local network\ncoding. The conveyed message is that it is favorable to reduce computational\ncomplexity by relying only on small encoding numbers since the resulting\nexpected throughput loss is negligible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Oct 2010 15:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mannersalo", "Petteri", ""], ["Paschos", "Georgios S.", ""], ["Gkatzikis", "Lazaros", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4475", "submitter": "Manoj Panda", "authors": "Manoj K.

Both\namplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies are\nconsidered. Given fixed power allocation to the channels, we show that channel\npairing over multiple hops can be decomposed into independent pairing problems\nat each relay, and a sorted-SNR channel pairing strategy is sum-rate optimal,\nwhere each relay pairs its incoming and outgoing channels by their SNR order.\nFor the joint optimization of channel pairing and power allocation under both\ntotal and individual power constraints, we show that the problem can be\ndecoupled into two subproblems solved separately. This separation principle is\nestablished by observing the equivalence between sorting SNRs and sorting\nchannel gains in the jointly optimal solution. It significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity in finding the jointly optimal solution. It follows\nthat the channel pairing problem in joint optimization can be again decomposed\ninto independent pairing problems at each relay based on sorted channel gains.\nThe solution for optimizing power allocation for DF relaying is also provided,\nas well as an asymptotically optimal solution for AF relaying. Numerical\nresults are provided to demonstrate substantial performance gain of the jointly\noptimal solution over some suboptimal alternatives. It is also observed that\nmore gain is obtained from optimal channel pairing than optimal power\nallocation through judiciously exploiting the variation among multiple\nchannels.
