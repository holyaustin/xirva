Snap-stabilization is a nice approach to design\nprotocols that withstand transient faults. Compared to the well-known\nself-stabilizing approach, snap-stabilization guarantees that the effect of\nfaults is contained immediately after faults cease to occur. Our contribution\nis twofold: we show that (1) snap-stabilization is impossible for a wide class\nof problems if we consider networks with finite yet unbounded channel capacity;\n(2) snap-stabilization becomes possible in the same setting if we assume\nbounded-capacity channels. We propose three snap-stabilizing protocols working\nin fully-connected networks. Our work opens exciting new research perspectives,\nas it enables the snap-stabilizing paradigm to be implemented in actual\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2008 10:51:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2008 08:57:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dela\u00ebt", "Sylvie", "", "LRI"], ["Devismes", "St\u00e9phane", "", "LRI"], ["Nesterenko", "Mikhail", "", "INRIA Futurs, LIP6"], ["Tixeuil", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "INRIA Futurs, LIP6"]]}, {"id": "0802.1176", "submitter": "Thomas Begin", "authors": "Thomas Begin (LIP6), Alexandre Brandwajn (UCSC)", "title": "Note sur les temps de service r\\'esiduels dans les syst\\`emes type M/G/c", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Colloque Francophone sur l'Ing\\'enierie des Protocoles (CFIP), Les\n  Arcs : France (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": null, "abstract": "  Approximations for the mean performance indices for the M/G/c queue rely on\nthe approximate computation of the probability that an arriving request has to\nwait for service and of the minimum of residual service times if all servers\nare found busy.

Proper quality of service policies must guarantee rapid\nreactivity and responsiveness even in such critical situations. Previous\nsolutions fail to meet common performance requirements when the system has to\nface sudden and unpredictable surges of traffic. Indeed they often rely on a\nproper setting of key parameters which requires laborious manual tuning,\npreventing a fast adaptation of the control policies. We contribute an original\nSelf-* Overload Control (SOC) policy. This allows the system to self-configure\na dynamic constraint on the rate of admitted sessions in order to respect\nservice level agreements and maximize the resource utilization at the same\ntime. Our policy does not require any prior information on the incoming traffic\nor manual configuration of key parameters. We ran extensive simulations under a\nwide range of operating conditions, showing that SOC rapidly adapts to time\nvarying traffic and self-optimizes the resource utilization. It admits as many\nnew sessions as possible in observance of the agreements, even under intense\nworkload variations. We compared our algorithm to previously proposed\napproaches highlighting a more stable behavior and a better performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Feb 2008 21:18:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 15:14:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bartolini", "Novella", "", "Department\n  of Computer Science University of Rome Sapienza, Italy"], ["Bongiovanni", "Giancarlo", "", "Department\n  of Computer Science University of Rome Sapienza, Italy"], ["Silvestri", "Simone", "", "Department\n  of Computer Science University of Rome Sapienza, Italy"]]}, {"id": "0802.3448", "submitter": "Haim Kaplan", "authors": "Edith Cohen and Haim Kaplan", "title": "Sketch-Based Estimation of Subpopulation-Weight", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.DS cs.NI cs.PF", "license": null, "abstract": "  Summaries of massive data sets support approximate query processing over the\noriginal data.
