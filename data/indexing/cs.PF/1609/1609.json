This\npaper explores, for the first time, the performance modeling for MANETs under a\ngeneral limited buffer constraint, where each network node maintains a limited\nsource buffer of size $B_s$ to store its locally generated packets and also a\nlimited shared relay buffer of size $B_r$ to store relay packets for other\nnodes. Based on the Queuing theory and birth-death chain theory, we first\ndevelop a general theoretical framework to fully depict the source/relay buffer\noccupancy process in such a MANET, which applies to any distributed MAC\nprotocol and any mobility model that leads to the uniform distribution of\nnodes' locations in steady state. With the help of this framework, we then\nderive the exact expressions of several key network performance metrics,\nincluding achievable throughput, throughput capacity, and expected end-to-end\ndelay. We further conduct case studies under two network scenarios and provide\nthe corresponding theoretical/simulation results to demonstrate the application\nas well as the efficiency of our theoretical framework.

Given that\nInternet content consumption is increasingly entertainment-oriented, we believe\nthat a related content could often lead to complete or at least partial user\nsatisfaction, without the need to retrieve the original content over expensive\nlinks. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal edge caching with\nsoft cache hits, in the context of delayed access, and analyze the expected\ngains. We then show using synthetic and real datasets of related video contents\nthat promising caching gains could be achieved in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 11:52:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Spyropoulos", "Thrasyvoulos", ""], ["Sermpezis", "Pavlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09726", "submitter": "I\\~naki Ucar", "authors": "I\\~naki Ucar, Carlos Donato, Pablo Serrano, Andres Garcia-Saavedra,\n  Arturo Azcorra, Albert Banchs", "title": "Revisiting 802.11 Rate Adaptation from Energy Consumption's Perspective", "comments": "7 pages, 8 figures in ACM International Conference on Modeling,\n  Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM), 2016", "journal-ref": "ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation\n  of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM), Malta, 2016, pp. 27-34", "doi": "10.1145/2988287.2989149", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rate adaptation in 802.11 WLANs has received a lot of attention from the\nresearch community, with most of the proposals aiming at maximising throughput\nbased on network conditions. Considering energy consumption, an implicit\nassumption is that optimality in throughput implies optimality in energy\nefficiency, but this assumption has been recently put into question. In this\npaper, we address via analysis and experimentation the relation between\nthroughput performance and energy efficiency in multi-rate 802.11 scenarios. We\ndemonstrate the trade-off between these performance figures, confirming that\nthey may not be simultaneously optimised, and analyse their sensitivity towards\nthe energy consumption parameters of the device. Our results provide the means\nto design novel rate adaptation schemes that takes energy consumption into\naccount.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 13:39:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ucar", "I\u00f1aki", ""], ["Donato", "Carlos", ""], ["Serrano", "Pablo", ""], ["Garcia-Saavedra", "Andres", ""], ["Azcorra", "Arturo", ""], ["Banchs", "Albert", ""]]}]
