When the mean-field model is a\nfinite-dimensional dynamical system with a unique equilibrium point, an\nanalysis based on Stein's method and the perturbation theory shows that under\nsome mild conditions, the stationary distributions of CTMCs converge (in the\nmean-square sense) to the equilibrium point of the mean-field model if the\nmean-field model is globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially\nstable. In particular, the mean square difference between the $M$th CTMC in the\nsteady state and the equilibrium point of the mean-field system is $O(1/M),$\nwhere $M$ is the size of the $M$th CTMC. This approach based on Stein's method\nprovides a new framework for studying the convergence of CTMCs to their\nmean-field limit by mainly looking into the stability of the mean-field model,\nwhich is a deterministic system and is often easier to analyze than the CTMCs.\nMore importantly, this approach quantifies the rate of convergence, which\nreveals the approximation error of using mean-field models for approximating\nfinite-size systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2015 00:18:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ying", "Lei", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02238", "submitter": "Michel Marot", "authors": "Michel Marot, Adel Mounir Sa\\\"id, Hossam Afifi", "title": "On the Maximal Shortest Path in a Connected Component in V2V", "comments": "Accepted for publication in Performance Evaluation", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.peva.2015.09.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, a VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork) is considered to operate on\na simple lane, without infrastructure.

Since many stencil schemes have low\narithmetic intensity, most optimizations focus on increasing the temporal data\naccess locality, thus reducing the data traffic through the main memory\ninterface with the ultimate goal of decoupling from this bottleneck. There are,\nhowever, only few approaches that explicitly leverage the shared cache feature\nof modern multicore chips. If every thread works on its private, separate cache\nblock, the available cache space can become too small, and sufficient temporal\nlocality may not be achieved.\n  We propose a flexible multi-dimensional intra-tile parallelization method for\nstencil algorithms on multicore CPUs with a shared outer-level cache. This\nmethod leads to a significant reduction in the required cache space without\nadverse effects from hardware prefetching or TLB shortage. Our \\emph{Girih}\nframework includes an auto-tuner to select optimal parameter configurations on\nthe target hardware. We conduct performance experiments on two contemporary\nIntel processors and compare with the state-of-the-art stencil frameworks PLUTO\nand Pochoir, using four corner-case stencil schemes and a wide range of problem\nsizes. \\emph{Girih} shows substantial performance advantages and best\narithmetic intensity at almost all problem sizes, especially on low-intensity\nstencils with variable coefficients. We study in detail the performance\nbehavior at varying grid size using phenomenological performance modeling. Our\nanalysis of energy consumption reveals that our method can save energy by\nreduced DRAM bandwidth usage even at marginal performance gain.
