Neuts opened a key door in numerical computation of stochastic\nmodels by means of phase-type (PH) distributions and Markovian arrival\nprocesses (MAPs). To celebrate his 75th birthday, this paper reports a more\ngeneral framework of Markovian supermarket models, including a system of\ndifferential equations for the fraction measure and a system of nonlinear\nequations for the fixed point. To understand this framework heuristically, this\npaper gives a detailed analysis for three important supermarket examples: M/G/1\ntype, GI/M/1 type and multiple choices, explains how to derive the system of\ndifferential equations by means of density-dependent jump Markov processes, and\nshows that the fixed point may be simply super-exponential through solving the\nsystem of nonlinear equations. Note that supermarket models are a class of\ncomplicated queueing systems and their analysis can not apply popular queueing\ntheory, it is necessary in the study of supermarket models to summarize such a\nmore general framework which enables us to focus on important research issues.\nOn this line, this paper develops matrix-analytical methods of Markovian\nsupermarket models. We hope this will be able to open a new avenue in\nperformance evaluation of supermarket models by means of matrix-analytical\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jun 2011 04:24:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Quan-Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0880", "submitter": "Hossein Shokri Ghadikolaei", "authors": "Hossein Shokri, Mohammad Mozaffari, Adnan Gavili, Masoumeh\n  Nasiri-Kenari", "title": "Performance Analysis of Sequential Method for HandOver in Cognitive\n  Radio Networks", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial problem in Lemma\n3.

We also assume that jobs arrive into the system according to a\nrate-$\\alpha N$ Poisson process, $\\alpha<1$, with rate-1 service at each queue.\nWhen the service at queues is exponentially distributed, it was shown in\nVvedenskaya et al.

A modularized program for treating general service\ntime distributions was introduced in Bramson et al. [In Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS\n(2010) 275-286]. The program relies on an ansatz that asserts, in equilibrium,\nany fixed number of queues become independent of one another as\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$.

In this article, we investigate the limiting behavior,\nas $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, of the equilibrium at a queue when the service\ndiscipline is FIFO and the service time distribution has a power law with a\ngiven exponent $-\\beta$, for $\\beta>1$. We show under the above ansatz that, as\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$, the tail of the equilibrium queue size exhibits a wide\nrange of behavior depending on the relationship between $\\beta$ and $D$. In\nparticular, if $\\beta>D/(D-1)$, the tail is doubly exponential and, if\n$\\beta<D/(D-1)$, the tail has a power law.

This decoupling assumption results from mean\nfield convergence and is generally true in transient regime in the asymptotic\nsense (when the number of wireless nodes tends to infinity), but, contrary to\nwidespread belief, may not necessarily hold in stationary regime. The issue is\noften related with the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a fixed point\nequation; however, it was also recently shown that this condition is not\nsufficient; in contrast, a sufficient condition is a global stability property\nof the associated ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we give a\nsimple condition that establishes the asymptotic validity of the decoupling\nassumption for the homogeneous case. We also discuss the heterogeneous and the\ndifferentiated service cases and formulate a new ordinary differential\nequation.
