EDA as a constituent-based\narchitecture is used to deploy WSNs according to energy dissipation through\ntheir constituents. This view of overall energy consumption in WSNs can be\napplied to optimising and balancing energy consumption and increasing the\nnetwork lifetime. Refer back to the architecture, we introduce a single overall\nmodel and propose a feasible formulation to express the overall energy\nconsumption of a generic wireless sensor network application in terms of its\nenergy constituents. The formulation offers a concrete expression for\nevaluating the performance of WSN application, optimising its constituents\noperations, and designing more energy-efficient applications. The ultimate aim\nis to produce an energy map architecture of a generic WSN application that\ncomprises essential and definable energy constituents and the relationships\nbetween these constituents to explore strategies for minimising the overall\nenergy consumption of the application. Later, parameters affecting energy in\nWSNs are extracted. The dependency between these parameters and the average\nenergy consumption of an application is then investigated. A few statistical\ntools are applied for parameter reduction followed by random forest regression\nto model energy consumption per delivered packet with and without parameter\nreduction to determine the reduction in accuracy due to reduction. Finally, an\nenergy-efficient dynamic topology management algorithm is proposed based on the\nEDA model and the prevalent parameters.
