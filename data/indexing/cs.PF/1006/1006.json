Two forms of monitoring information are considered,\nviz., locally unique transaction identifiers, and arrival and departure\ntimestamps of transactions at each processing queue. The timestamps are assumed\navailable at all the queues but in the absence of identifiers, only enable\nimprecise tracking since parallel processing can result in out-of-order\ndepartures. On the other hand, identifiers enable precise tracking but are not\navailable without proper instrumentation. Given an instrumentation budget, only\na subset of queues can be selected for production of identifiers, while the\nremaining queues have to resort to imprecise tracking using timestamps. The\ngoal is then to optimally allocate the instrumentation budget to maximize the\noverall tracking accuracy. The challenge is that the optimal allocation\nstrategy depends on accuracies of timestamp-based tracking at different queues,\nwhich has complex dependencies on the arrival and service processes, and the\nqueueing discipline. We propose two simple heuristics for allocation by\npredicting the order of timestamp-based tracking accuracies of different\nqueues. We derive sufficient conditions for these heuristics to achieve\noptimality through the notion of stochastic comparison of queues. Simulations\nshow that our heuristics are close to optimality, even when the parameters\ndeviate from these conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 23:45:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 03:14:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Anandkumar", "Animashree", ""], ["He", "Ting", ""], ["Bisdikian", "Chatschik", ""], ["Agrawal", "Dakshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.2183", "submitter": "Aydin Buluc", "authors": "Ayd{\\i}n Bulu\\c{c} and John R.

Thanks to a large body of research following the\nseminal work of Bianchi, WLAN throughput under saturated traffic condition has\nbeen well understood. By contrast, prior investigations on throughput\nperformance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on\nphenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN\ncan support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher,\nunder non-saturation condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous\nanalysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service:\nmean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic\nload is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is\nnot a sound measure of WLAN capacity under non-saturation condition. To bridge\nthe gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively.\n  Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR)\ncapability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability\nof the network. This paper extends the investigation to the non-saturation case\nand shows that super-linear scaling also holds for SBMD and SBDJ throughputs.\nOur results here complete the demonstration of MPR as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique for WLAN under both saturation and\nnon-saturation conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2010 08:40:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Jun", "Ying", "", "Angela"], ["Zhang", "", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""], ["Chen", "Darui", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4824", "submitter": "Ying Cui", "authors": "Rui Wang, Vincent K.

Under FQR-T, customers are served by their own service\npool until a threshold is exceeded. Then, one-way sharing is activated with\ncustomers from one class allowed to be served in both pools.

For the fluid\nlimit, or FWLLN, we consider a sequence of properly scaled X models in overload\noperating under FQR-T. Our proof of the FWLLN follows the compactness approach,\ni.e., we show that the sequence of scaled processes is tight, and then show\nthat all converging subsequences have the specified limit. The characterization\nstep is complicated because the queue-difference processes, which determine the\ncustomer-server assignments, remain stochastically bounded, and need to be\nconsidered without spatial scaling. Asymptotically, these queue-difference\nprocesses operate in a faster time scale than the fluid-scaled processes.
