Recently, millimeter\nwave (mmWave) techniques have been introduced as a means of fulfilling such\nhigh data rate requirements. In this paper, we model a highway communication\nnetwork and characterize its fundamental link budget metrics. In particular, we\nspecifically consider a network where vehicles are served by mmWave Base\nStations (BSs) deployed alongside the road. To evaluate our highway network, we\ndevelop a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario where\nheavy vehicles (such as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct Line-of-Sight\n(LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes and, hence, act as blockages. Using tools\nfrom stochastic geometry, we derive approximations for the\nSignal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) outage probability, as well as\nthe probability that a user achieves a target communication rate (rate coverage\nprobability). Our analysis provides new design insights for mmWave highway\ncommunication networks. In considered highway scenarios, we show that reducing\nthe horizontal beamwidth from $90^\\circ$ to $30^\\circ$ determines a minimal\nreduction in the SINR outage probability (namely, $4 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ at\nmaximum). Also, unlike bi-dimensional mmWave cellular networks, for small BS\ndensities (namely, one BS every $500$ m) it is still possible to achieve an\nSINR outage probability smaller than $0.2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 13:46:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Jun 2017 11:01:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 13:04:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 12:40:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 15:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Tassi", "Andrea", ""], ["Egan", "Malcolm", ""], ["Piechocki", "Robert J.", ""], ["Nix", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00522", "submitter": "Axel Huebl", "authors": "Axel Huebl, Rene Widera, Felix Schmitt, Alexander Matthes, Norbert\n  Podhorszki, Jong Youl Choi, Scott Klasky, Michael Bussmann", "title": "On the Scalability of Data Reduction Techniques in Current and Upcoming\n  HPC Systems from an Application Perspective", "comments": "15 pages, 5 figures, accepted for DRBSD-1 in conjunction with ISC'17", "journal-ref": "J.M.

In this paper, we address via analysis, simulation and\nexperimentation the relation between throughput performance and energy\nefficiency in multi-rate 802.11 scenarios. We demonstrate the trade-off between\nthese performance figures, confirming that they may not be simultaneously\noptimised, and analyse their sensitivity towards the energy consumption\nparameters of the device. We analyse this trade-off in existing rate adaptation\nwith transmission power control algorithms, and discuss how to design novel\nschemes taking energy consumption into account.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 12:28:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Jul 2017 11:24:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ucar", "I\u00f1aki", ""], ["Donato", "Carlos", ""], ["Serrano", "Pablo", ""], ["Garcia-Saavedra", "Andres", ""], ["Azcorra", "Arturo", ""], ["Banchs", "Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09606", "submitter": "Tatsuaki Kimura", "authors": "Tatsuaki Kimura and Hiroshi Saito", "title": "Theoretical Performance Analysis of Vehicular Broadcast Communications\n  at Intersection and their Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose an optimization method for the broadcast rate in\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) broadcast communications at an intersection on the\nbasis of theoretical analysis. We consider a model in which locations of\nvehicles are modeled separately as queuing and running segments and derive key\nperformance metrics of V2V broadcast communications via a stochastic geometry\napproach. Since these theoretical expressions are mathematically intractable,\nwe developed closed-form approximate formulae for them. Using them, we optimize\nthe broadcast rate such that the mean number of successful receivers per unit\ntime is maximized. Because of the closed form approximation, the optimal rate\ncan be used as a guideline for a real-time control-method, which is not\nachieved through time-consuming simulations. We evaluated our method through\nnumerical examples and demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 07:30:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 10:20:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2019 07:37:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kimura", "Tatsuaki", ""], ["Saito", "Hiroshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10283", "submitter": "Davis Blalock", "authors": "Davis W Blalock, John V Guttag", "title": "Bolt: Accelerated Data Mining with Fast Vector Compression", "comments": "Research track paper at KDD 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3097983.3098195", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vectors of data are at the heart of machine learning and data mining.\nRecently, vector quantization methods have shown great promise in reducing both\nthe time and space costs of operating on vectors. We introduce a vector\nquantization algorithm that can compress vectors over 12x faster than existing\ntechniques while also accelerating approximate vector operations such as\ndistance and dot product computations by up to 10x. Because it can encode over\n2GB of vectors per second, it makes vector quantization cheap enough to employ\nin many more circumstances. For example, using our technique to compute\napproximate dot products in a nested loop can multiply matrices faster than a\nstate-of-the-art BLAS implementation, even when our algorithm must first\ncompress the matrices.\n  In addition to showing the above speedups, we demonstrate that our approach\ncan accelerate nearest neighbor search and maximum inner product search by over\n100x compared to floating point operations and up to 10x compared to other\nvector quantization methods. Our approximate Euclidean distance and dot product\ncomputations are not only faster than those of related algorithms with slower\nencodings, but also faster than Hamming distance computations, which have\ndirect hardware support on the tested platforms. We also assess the errors of\nour algorithm's approximate distances and dot products, and find that it is\ncompetitive with existing, slower vector quantization algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 17:31:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Blalock", "Davis W", ""], ["Guttag", "John V", ""]]}]
