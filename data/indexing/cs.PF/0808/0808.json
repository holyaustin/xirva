We\nfocus on the optimization of two design parameters associated with the LA: 1)\ninitial position upon LA update; 2) distance threshold for triggering of LA\nupdate. Based on the popular continuous-time random walk (CTRW) mobility model,\nwe propose a novel analytical framework that uses a diffusion equation to\nminimize the location management cost. In this framework, a number of\nmeasurable physical parameters, such as length of road section, angle between\nroad sections, and road section crossing time, can be integrated into the\nsystem design. This framework allows us to easily evaluate the total cost under\ngeneral call arrival distributions and LA of different shapes. For the\nparticular case of circular LA and small Poisson call-arrival rate, we prove\nthe following: (1) When the drift is weak, the optimal initial position\napproaches the center of the LA; when the drift is strong, it approaches the\nboundary of the LA. (2) Comparing the optimal initial-position and\ncenter-initial-position solutions (which is assumed in most prior work), when\nthe drift is weak, the optimal distance threshold and the minimum total cost\nare roughly equal; when the drift is strong, the optimal distance threshold in\nthe later is about 1.260 times that in the former, and the minimum total cost\nin the later is about 1.587 times that in the former. That is, optimizing on\ninitial position, which previous work did not consider, has the potential of\nreducing the cost measure by 37%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2008 16:32:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Qinglin", ""], ["Liew", "Soung C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1431", "submitter": "Neil J.

In face of its success, it is remarkable that there is\nlittle consensus on the actual degree of fairness achieved, particularly\nbearing its impact on quality of service in mind. In this paper we provide an\naccurate model for the fairness of the DCF. Given M greedy stations we assume\nfairness if a tagged station contributes a share of 1/M to the overall number\nof packets transmitted. We derive the probability distribution of fairness\ndeviations and support our analytical results by an extensive set of\nmeasurements. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement of long-term\nover short-term fairness. Regarding the random countdown values we quantify the\nsignificance of their distribution whereas we discover that fairness is largely\ninsensitive to the distribution parameters. Based on our findings we view the\nDCF as emulating an ideal fair queuing system to quantify the deviations from a\nfair rate allocation. We deduce a stochastic service curve model for the DCF to\npredict packet delays in IEEE 802.11. We show how a station can estimate its\nfair bandwidth share from passive measurements of its traffic arrivals and\ndepartures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Aug 2008 15:35:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bredel", "Michael", ""], ["Fidler", "Markus", ""]]}]
