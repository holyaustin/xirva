We take this\nanalysis a step further by examining the effect of degree-degree correlations\n-- or assortativity -- on neural-network behavior. We make use of a method\nrecently put forward for studying correlated networks and dynamics thereon,\nboth analytically and computationally, which is independent of how the topology\nmay have evolved. We show how the robustness to noise is greatly enhanced in\nassortative (positively correlated) neural networks, especially if it is the\nhub neurons that store the information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 17:33:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["de Franciscis", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Johnson", "Samuel", ""], ["Torres", "Joaqu\u00edn J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5327", "submitter": "Paulo Urriza", "authors": "Paulo Urriza, Eric Rebeiz, Przemys{\\l}aw Pawe{\\l}czak, and Danijela\n  \\v{C}abri\\'c", "title": "Computationally Efficient Modulation Level Classification Based on\n  Probability Distribution Distance Functions", "comments": "3 pages, resubmitted to IEEE Communication Letters (modified based on\n  reviewer comments)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2011.032811.110316", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.PF math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel modulation level classification (MLC) method based on\nprobability distribution distance functions.
