In this paper, we address the\nproblem of queueing theoretic performance modeling and analysis of OFDMA under\nbroad-band wireless networks. We consider a single-cell IEEE 802.16 environment\nin which the base station allocates subchannels to the subscriber stations in\nits coverage area. The subchannels allocated to a subscriber station are shared\nby multiple connections at that subscriber station. To ensure the Quality of\nService (QoS) performances, a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme is\nconsidered at a subscriber station. A queueing analytical framework for these\nadmission control schemes is presented considering OFDMA-based transmission at\nthe physical layer. Then, based on the queueing model, both the\nconnection-level and the packet-level performances are studied and compared\nwith their analogues in the case without CAC. The connection arrival is modeled\nby a Poisson process and the packet arrival for a connection by a two-state\nMarkov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). We determine analytically and\nnumerically different performance parameters, such as connection blocking\nprobability, average number of ongoing connections, average queue length,\npacket dropping probability, queue throughput and average packet delay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 15:16:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchti", "Abdelali El", ""], ["Kafhali", "Said El", ""], ["Haqiq", "Abdelkrim", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.3855", "submitter": "Adam Bachorek", "authors": "Adam Bachorek, Bagavathiannan Palanisamy and Jens B.
