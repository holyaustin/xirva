The dominant cause for instability is the missing piece\nsyndrome, whereby one piece becomes very rare in the network. It is shown that\nstability can be achieved with only a small amount of help from peer\nseeds--even with very little help from a fixed seed, peers need dwell as peer\nseeds on average only long enough to upload one additional piece. The region of\nstability is insensitive to the piece selection policy.
