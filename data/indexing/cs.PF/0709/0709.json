The focus is put\non the performance evaluation of several aspects with a particular emphasis on\nthe parallel efficiency. The performance evaluation is analyzed and compared to\npredictions given by a heuristic model, the so-called Gamma model. A\ntailor-made CFD computation benchmark case is introduced and used to carry out\nthis review, stressing the particular interest for commodity clusters.\nConclusions are drawn from this extensive series of analyses and modeling\nleading to specific recommendations concerning such toolbox development and\nparallel implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2007 08:52:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bouffanais", "Roland", ""], ["Keller", "Vincent", ""], ["Gruber", "Ralf", ""], ["Deville", "Michel O.", ""]]}]
