To do it, we develop a sensor node model based on virtual buffer\nsharing and present a two-layer scheduling model using the network calculus.\nWith the system skeleton, we develop a guaranteed QoS model, such as the upper\nbounds on buffer queue length/delay/effective bandwidth, and single-hop/\nmulti-hops delay/jitter/effective bandwidth. Numerical results show the system\nskeleton and the guaranteed QoS model are scalable for different types of\nflows, including the self-similar traffic flows, and the parameters of flow\nregulators and service curves of sensor nodes affect them.
