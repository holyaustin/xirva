Web services are the\ninseparable part of any web application, as a result enhancing performance of\nweb services will have a great effect on the overall performance of the system.\nThe most widely used communication protocol in the web services model, SOAP, is\na simple protocol for the exchange of messages. The serialization of large SOAP\nresponses is a major performance bottleneck in a SOAP message exchange.\nClearly, some web servers can expect to receive many similar messages for a\nparticular web service as they share the same signature. The idea behind this\npaper is to avoid the redundant serialization stage of SOAP responses for\nrequest which have the same call parameters. The technique exploits the\nsimilarities between call parameters to improve web service Response Time by\navoiding redundant serialization of the same response with the help of a\nmiddleware running on top of web server. The middleware will maintain a trie of\nincoming parameters for every set of current requests. This way request\nprocessing and serialization of the response of same requests will be done only\nonce. In a nutshell, to serialize only the different responses is the simplest\nway to avoid extra work done by a serializer. It might worth noting that\nalthough our approach is to utilize the exact repeating portion parameters, the\nmiddleware can be configured to apply changes made to the result set of\nresponse to the serialized response being maintained in a trie to generate\nvalid results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2009 04:28:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Minaei", "Behrouz", ""], ["Saadat", "Parinaz", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.1504", "submitter": "Sana Ullah", "authors": "Sana Ullah, Yingji Zhong, S.M.Riazul Islam, Ahasanun Nessa, Kyung Sup\n  Kwak", "title": "Throughput Limits of IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.3", "comments": "4 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, 4th International Conference on Wireless\n  Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing, 2008.
