CA is\none of the most important features of HSPA+ and LTE-A networks; it allows\ndevices to be served simultaneously by several carriers. We propose two load\nbalancing schemes, namely Join the Fastest Queue (JFQ) and Volume Balancing\n(VB), that allow the traffic of CA and non-CA users to be distributed over the\naggregated carriers. We then evaluate the performance of these schemes by means\nof analytical modeling. We show that the proposed schemes achieve quasi-ideal\nload balancing. We also investigate the impact of mixing traffic of CA and\nnon-CA users in the same cell and show that performance is practically\ninsensitive to the traffic mix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 18:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e9n\u00e9zit", "F.", ""], ["Elayoubi", "S.", ""], ["Indre", "R-M.", ""], ["Simonian", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.0804", "submitter": "Antonio Fern\\'andez Anta", "authors": "Jordi Arjona, Angelos Chatzipapas, Antonio Fernandez Anta, Vincenzo\n  Mancuso", "title": "A Measurement-based Analysis of the Energy Consumption of Data Center\n  Servers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Energy consumption is a growing issue in data centers, impacting their\neconomic viability and their public image. In this work we empirically\ncharacterize the power and energy consumed by different types of servers. In\nparticular, in order to understand the behavior of their energy and power\nconsumption, we perform measurements in different servers. In each of them, we\nexhaustively measure the power consumed by the CPU, the disk, and the network\ninterface under different configurations, identifying the optimal operational\nlevels. One interesting conclusion of our study is that the curve that defines\nthe minimal CPU power as a function of the load is neither linear nor purely\nconvex as has been previously assumed. Moreover, we find that the efficiency of\nthe various server components can be maximized by tuning the CPU frequency and\nthe number of active cores as a function of the system and network load, while\nthe block size of I/O operations should be always maximized by applications. We\nalso show how to estimate the energy consumed by an application as a function\nof some simple parameters, like the CPU load, and the disk and network\nactivity.

We generalize Sigman's construction to\nthe stable case by comparing the $M/G/c$ queue to a copy run under Random\nAssignment. This allows us to produce a naive perfect simulation algorithm\nbased on running the dominating process back to the time it first empties.
