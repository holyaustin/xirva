The main contribution\nof this paper is a systematic methodology to accurately identify the fastest\nalgorithms in the bunch, without executing them. The goal is instead\naccomplished with the help of a set of cache-aware micro-benchmarks for the\nunderlying BLAS kernels. The predictions we construct from such benchmarks\nallow us to reliably single out the best-performing algorithms in a tiny\nfraction of the time taken by the direct execution of the algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:54:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Peise", "Elmar", ""], ["Fabregat-Traver", "Diego", ""], ["Bientinesi", "Paolo", ""]]}]
