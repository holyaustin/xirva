Under mild assumptions, we show that the result\ncomputed with a fused-multiply-add provides a fully accurate result for many\npossible values of the input with a constant almost accurate to the full\nworking precision. We also present an algorithm for a fully accurate second\nreduction step to reach double full accuracy (all the significand bits of two\nnumbers are significant) even in the worst cases of argument reduction. Our\nwork recalls the common algorithms and presents proofs of correctness. All the\nproofs are formally verified using the Coq automatic proof checker.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2007 07:15:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Boldo", "Sylvie", "", "INRIA Futurs"], ["Daumas", "Marc", "", "LIRMM, Eliaus"], ["Li", "Ren Cang", ""]]}]
