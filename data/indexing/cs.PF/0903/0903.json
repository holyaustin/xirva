In\nthe streaming model the joint distribution is given by a stream of $k$-tuples,\nwith the goal of testing correlations among the components measured over the\nentire stream. In the streaming model, Indyk and McGregor (SODA 08) recently\ngave exciting new results for measuring pairwise independence. The Indyk and\nMcGregor methods provide $\\log{n}$-approximation under statistical distance\nbetween the joint and product distributions in the streaming model. Indyk and\nMcGregor leave, as their main open question, the problem of improving their\n$\\log n$-approximation for the statistical distance metric.\n  In this paper we solve the main open problem posed by of Indyk and McGregor\nfor the statistical distance for pairwise independence and extend this result\nto any constant $k$. In particular, we present an algorithm that computes an\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation of the statistical distance between the\njoint and product distributions defined by a stream of $k$-tuples.

Over the last several years, a significant number of\nperformance analysis and monitoring tools have been built/proposed. However,\nthese tools suffer from several important shortcomings, particularly in\ndistributed environments. In this paper we present ScALPEL, a Scalable Adaptive\nLightweight Performance Evaluation Library for application performance\nmonitoring at the functional level. Our approach provides several distinct\nadvantages. First, ScALPEL is portable across a wide variety of architectures,\nand its ability to selectively monitor functions presents low run-time\noverhead, enabling its use for large-scale production applications. Second, it\nis run-time configurable, enabling both dynamic selection of functions to\nprofile as well as events of interest on a per function basis. Third, our\napproach is transparent in that it requires no source code modifications.\nFinally, ScALPEL is implemented as a pluggable unit by reusing existing\nperformance monitoring frameworks such as Perfmon and PAPI and extending them\nto support both sequential and MPI applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Feb 2009 04:11:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Pyla", "Hari K.", ""], ["Ramesh", "Bharath", ""], ["Ribbens", "Calvin J.", ""], ["Varadarajan", "Srinidhi", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0096", "submitter": "Manoj Panda", "authors": "Manoj K.

Our model applies if the cell radius, $R$, is\nmuch smaller than the carrier sensing range, $R_{cs}$. We argue that, the\ncondition $R_{cs} >> R$ is likely to hold in a dense deployment of Access\nPoints (APs) where, for every client or station (STA), there is an AP very\nclose to the STA such that the STA can associate with the AP at a high physical\nrate. We develop a scalable cell level model for such WLANs with saturated AP\nand STA queues as well as for TCP-controlled long file downloads. The accuracy\nof our model is demonstrated by comparison with ns-2 simulations. We also\ndemonstrate how our analytical model could be applied in conjunction with a\nLearning Automata (LA) algorithm for optimal channel assignment. Based on the\ninsights provided by our analytical model, we propose a simple decentralized\nalgorithm which provides static channel assignments that are Nash equilibria in\npure strategies for the objective of maximizing normalized network throughput.\nOur channel assignment algorithm requires neither any explicit knowledge of the\ntopology nor any message passing, and provides assignments in only as many\nsteps as there are channels.
