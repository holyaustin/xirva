In contrast to the classical PTM transmission which was\nintroduced by the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS), the\nadaptiveness requires user individual feedback channels that allow the\nreceivers to report their radio conditions and send positive or negative\nacknowledgments (ACK/NACK) for a Layer 1 transport block to the eNodeB. In this\nwork, an adaptive PTM scheme based on feedback from multiple users is presented\nand evaluated. Furthermore, a simple NACK-oriented feedback mechanism is\nintroduced to relieve the feedback channel that is used in the uplink. Finally,\nthe performance of different single-cell MBMS transmission modes is evaluated\nby dynamic radio network simulations. It is shown that adaptive PTM\ntransmission outperforms the conventional MBMS configurations in terms of radio\nresource consumption and user satisfaction rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2009 11:21:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Phan", "Mai-Anh", ""], ["Huschke", "J\u00f6rg", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.2563", "submitter": "Ioannis Koukoutsidis", "authors": "Eva Jaho, Ioannis Koukoutsidis, Siyu Tang, Ioannis Stavrakakis, Piet\n  Van Mieghem", "title": "Gossip-based Search in Multipeer Communication Networks", "comments": "preprint (18 pages, 6 figures)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a gossip-based algorithm for searching data objects in a multipeer\ncommunication network.

This\nconcern is due to the new challenges of large scale managed systems, where the\nmanagement plane is integrated within the functional plane and where management\nactivities have to carry accurate and up-to-date information. We defined a set\nof primary and secondary metrics to measure the performance of a management\napproach. Secondary metrics are derived from the primary ones and quantifies\nmainly the efficiency, the scalability and the impact of management activities.\nTo validate our proposals, we have designed and developed a benchmarking\nplatform dedicated to the measurement of the performance of a JMX manager-agent\nbased management system. The second part of our work deals with the collection\nof measurement data sets from our JMX benchmarking platform. We mainly studied\nthe effect of both load and the number of agents on the scalability, the impact\nof management activities on the user perceived performance of a managed server\nand the delays of JMX operations when carrying variables values. Our findings\nshow that most of these delays follow a Weibull statistical distribution. We\nused this statistical model to study the behavior of a monitoring algorithm\nproposed in the literature, under heavy tail delays distribution. In this case,\nthe view of the managed system on the manager side becomes noisy and out of\ndate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2009 11:35:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Lahmadi", "Abdelkader", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"], ["Andrey", "Laurent", "", "INRIA\n  Lorraine - LORIA"], ["Festor", "Olivier", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"]]}, {"id": "0907.3710", "submitter": "Andrei Sukhov M", "authors": "A.V.
