Traditional WLAN\nmedium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit\nat a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station causes the\ndestruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer\nmultiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive\nmultiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket\nreception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In\naddition, it provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to achieve the\nimproved capacity. First, to demonstrate MUD/MPR as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique, we prove a \"super-linearity\" result, which\nstates that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability\nincreases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential\nbackoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR\nsystem, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability:\nthe number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the\nabove insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE\n802.11-like WLAN that incorporates advanced PHY-layer blind detection and MUD\ntechniques to implement MPR\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2007 13:46:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""], ["Zheng", "Peng Xuan", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.1455", "submitter": "Mark Burgin", "authors": "Mark Burgin", "title": "Superrecursive Features of Interactive Computation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": null, "abstract": "  Functioning and interaction of distributed devices and concurrent algorithms\nare analyzed in the context of the theory of algorithms.

Second, it provides a throughput analysis of\nthe IEEE 802.11 protocol at the data link layer in both saturated and\nnon-saturated traffic conditions taking into account the impact of both the\nphysical propagation channel and multirate transmission in Rayleigh fading\nenvironment. The general traffic model assumed is M/M/1/K. Finally, it shows\nthat the behavior of the throughput in non-saturated traffic conditions is a\nlinear combination of two system parameters; the payload size and the packet\nrates, $\\lambda^{(s)}$, of each contending station.
