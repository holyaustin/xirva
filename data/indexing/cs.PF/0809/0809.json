In the computer literature these two laws describing the speedup\nlimits of parallel applications are derived separately. It is shown, that\ntreating the time of the execution of the sequential part of the application as\na constant, in few lines the Gustafson-Barsis law can be obtained from the\nAmdahl's law and that the popular claim, that Gustafson-Barsis law overthrows\nAmdahl's law is a mistake.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Sep 2008 15:06:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Karbowski", "Andrzej", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.2532", "submitter": "Neil J.

It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and\nGustafson linearized scaling as special cases. Using simulation, we show: (i)\nthat the USL is equivalent to synchronous queueing in a load-dependent machine\nrepairman model and (ii) how USL, Amdahl's law, and Gustafson scaling can be\nregarded as boundaries defining three scalability zones. Typical throughput\nmeasurements lie across all three zones. Simulation scenarios provide deeper\ninsight into queueing effects and thus provide a clearer indication of which\napplication features should be tuned to get into the optimal performance zone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Sep 2008 14:51:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Holtman", "Jim", ""], ["Gunther", "Neil J.", ""]]}]
