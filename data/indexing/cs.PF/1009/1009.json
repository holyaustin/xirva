Many research studies have been carried-out to develop\nand evaluate the performance of this mechanism in an error-free (noiseless)\nenvironment. In reality, wireless communication channels in MANETs are an\nerror-prone and suffer from high packet-loss due to presence of noise, i.e.,\nnoisy environment. In this paper, we propose a simulation model that can be\nused to evaluate the performance of probabilistic broadcast for flooding in\nnoisy environment. In the proposed model, the noise-level is represented by a\ngeneric name, probability of reception (pc) (0<=pc<=1), where pc=1 for\nnoiseless and <1 for noisy environment. The effect of noise is determined\nrandomly by generating a random number \\zeta (0<=\\zeta<1); if \\zeta<=pc means\nthe packet is successfully delivered to the receiving node, otherwise,\nunsuccessful delivery occurs. The proposed model is implemented on a MANET\nsimulator, namely, MANSim. The effect of noise on the performance of\nprobabilistic algorithm was investigated in four scenarios. The main\nconclusions of these scenarios are: the performance of probabilistic algorithm\nsuffers in presence of noise. However, this suffering is less in high density\nnetworks, or if the nodes characterized by high retransmission probability or\nlarge radio transmission range. The nodes' speed has no or insignificant effect\non the performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Sep 2010 10:51:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Bahadili", "Hussein", ""], ["Kaabneh", "Khalid", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.0389", "submitter": "Hussein Al-Bahadili Dr.", "authors": "Hussein Al-Bahadili and Rami Jaradat", "title": "Performance Evaluation of an OMPR Algorithm for Route Discovery in Noisy\n  MANETs", "comments": "12 Pages, 8 Figures, 1 Table, Journal", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications\n  (IJCNC), Vol. 2, No. 1, January 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been revealed in the literature that pure multipoint relaying (MPR)\nalgorithms demonstrate both simplicity and outstanding performance, as compared\nto other flooding algorithms in wireless networks.

We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term\naverage revenue for the service provider under each client's long-term average\nbudget constraint, and design an online algorithm which captures the stochastic\nproperties of users' queries and click-through behaviors. We solve the\noptimization problem by making connections to scheduling problems in wireless\nnetworks, queueing theory and stochastic networks. Unlike prior models, we do\nnot assume that the number of query arrivals is known. Due to the stochastic\nnature of the arrival process considered here, either temporary \"free\" service,\ni.e., service above the specified budget or under-utilization of the budget is\nunavoidable. We prove that our online algorithm can achieve a revenue that is\nwithin $O(\\epsilon)$ of the optimal revenue while ensuring that the overdraft\nor underdraft is $O(1/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily small.\nWith a view towards practice, we can show that one can always operate strictly\nunder the budget. In addition, we extend our results to a click-through rate\nmaximization model, and also show how our algorithm can be modified to handle\nnon-stationary query arrival processes and clients with short-term contracts.\n  Our algorithm allows us to quantify the effect of errors in click-through\nrate estimation on the achieved revenue.
