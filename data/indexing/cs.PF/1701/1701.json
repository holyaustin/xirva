Such systems consist of a single server that\nserves multiple queues, and some capacity is lost whenever the server switches\nto serve a different set of queues. The capacity loss due to this switching\noverhead can be significant in many emerging applications, and needs to be\nexplicitly addressed in the design of scheduling policies. For example, in\n60GHz wireless networks with directional antennas, base stations need to train\nand reconfigure their beam patterns whenever they switch from one client to\nanother. Considerable switching overhead can also be observed in many other\nqueueing systems such as transportation networks and manufacturing systems.\nWhile the celebrated Max-Weight policy achieves asymptotically optimal average\ndelay for systems without switching overhead, it fails to preserve\nthroughput-optimality, let alone delay-optimality, when switching overhead is\ntaken into account. We propose a class of Biased Max-Weight scheduling policies\nthat explicitly takes switching overhead into account. The Biased Max-Weight\npolicy can use either queue length or head-of-line waiting time as an indicator\nof the system status. We prove that our policies not only are\nthroughput-optimal, but also can be made arbitrarily close to the asymptotic\nlower bound on average delay. To validate the performance of the proposed\npolicies, we provide extensive simulation with various system topologies and\ndifferent traffic patterns. We show that the proposed policies indeed achieve\nmuch better delay performance than that of the state-of-the-art policy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:10:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Ping-Chun", ""], ["Hou", "I-Hong", ""], ["Liu", "Xi", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.03836", "submitter": "Khaza Anuarul Hoque", "authors": "Khaza Anuarul Hoque, Otmane Ait Mohamed, Yvon Savaria", "title": "Formal Analysis of SEU Mitigation for Early Dependability and\n  Performability Analysis of FPGA-based Space Applications", "comments": "Accepted version for publication in the Journal of Applied Science,\n  Elsevier", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jal.2017.03.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.AR cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  SRAM-based FPGAs are increasingly popular in the aerospace industry due to\ntheir field programmability and low cost.

For example, CUDA programmers must set thread\nand block parameters for a kernel, but might not have the intuition to make a\ngood choice.

Although empirical autotuning addresses some of these\nchallenges, it requires extensive experimentation and search for optimal code\nvariants. This research presents an approach for tuning CUDA kernels based on\nstatic analysis that considers fine-grained code structure and the specific GPU\narchitecture features.
