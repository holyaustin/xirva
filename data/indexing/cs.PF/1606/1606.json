In contrast, such scheduling policies turn out to be\nunstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the scheduling policy\nLIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a\npermanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which\nremains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved.

In this paper we describe FT-GAIA, a\nsoftware-based fault-tolerant extension of the GAIA/ART\\`IS parallel simulation\nmiddleware. FT-GAIA transparently replicates simulation entities and\ndistributes them on multiple execution nodes. This allows the simulation to\ntolerate crash-failures of computing nodes; furthermore, FT-GAIA offers some\nprotection against byzantine failures since synchronization messages are\nreplicated as well, so that the receiving entity can identify and discard\ncorrupted messages. We provide an experimental evaluation of FT-GAIA on a\nrunning prototype. Results show that a high degree of fault tolerance can be\nachieved, at the cost of a moderate increase in the computational load of the\nexecution units.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 13:35:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 13:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angelo", "Gabriele", ""], ["Ferretti", "Stefano", ""], ["Marzolla", "Moreno", ""], ["Armaroli", "Lorenzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09206", "submitter": "Anastasios Giovanidis", "authors": "Apostolos Avranas and Anastasios Giovanidis", "title": "Performance of spatial Multi-LRU caching under traffic with temporal\n  locality", "comments": "6 pages, double column, invited paper in 5G Workshop, part of\n  ISTC'16, Brest, France", "journal-ref": "2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative\n  Information Processing (ISTC)", "doi": "10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593134", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work a novel family of decentralised caching policies for wireless\nnetworks is introduced, referred to as spatial multi-LRU. These improve\ncache-hit probability by exploiting multi-coverage. Two variations are\nproposed, the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas\ninserted in the covering edge-caches. The evaluation is done under spatial\ntraffic that exhibits temporal locality, with varying content catalogue and\ndependent demands. The performance metric is hit probability and the policies\nare compared to (1) the single-LRU and (2) an upper bound for all centralised\npolicies with periodic popularity updates. Numerical results show the multi-LRU\npolicies outperform both comparison policies. The reason is their passive\nadaptability to popularity changes. Between the -One and -All variation, which\none is preferable strongly depends on the available storage space and on\ntraffic characteristics. The performance also depends on the popularity shape.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 18:11:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Avranas", "Apostolos", ""], ["Giovanidis", "Anastasios", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09530", "submitter": "Zheng Wang", "authors": "Zheng Wang", "title": "Modeling and Predicting DNS Server Load", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The DNS relies on caching to ensure high scalability and good performance. In\noptimizing caching, TTL adjustment provides a means of balancing between query\nload and TTL-dependent performances such as data consistency, load balancing,\nmigration time, etc. To gain the desired balance, TTL adjustment depends on\npredictions of query loads under alternative TTLs. This paper proposes a model\nof DNS server load, which employs the uniform aggregate caching model to\nsimplify the complexity of modeling clients' requests and their caching. A\nmethod of predicting DNS server load is developed using that model. The\nprediction method is solely based on the unilateral measurements or\nobservations at authoritative servers. Without reliance on lots of multi-point\nmeasurements nor distributed measuring facilities, the method is best suited\nfor DNS authoritative operators. The proposed model and prediction method are\nvalidated through extensive simulations. Finally, global sensibility analysis\nis conducted to evaluate the impacts of measurement uncertainties or errors on\nthe predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 15:07:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zheng", ""]]}]
