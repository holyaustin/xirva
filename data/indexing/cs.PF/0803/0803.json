We focus on self-stabilizing solutions for the gossip problem, where\nagents may start from arbitrary locations in arbitrary states.\nSelf-stabilization requires (some of the) participating agents to keep moving\nforever, hinting at maximizing the number of agents that could be allowed to\nstop moving eventually. This paper formalizes the self-stabilizing agent gossip\nproblem, introduces the quiescence number (i.e., the maximum number of\neventually stopping agents) of self-stabilizing solutions and investigates the\nquiescence number with respect to several assumptions related to agent\nanonymity, synchrony, link duplex capacity, and whiteboard capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 09:14:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 19:19:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Masuzawa", "Toshimitsu", "", "LIP6, INRIA Futurs"], ["Tixeuil", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "LIP6, INRIA Futurs"]]}, {"id": "0803.1723", "submitter": "Andrei Sukhov M", "authors": "A.

To achieve accountability with\ngood performance, it uses asynchronous signatures; to reduce the space required\nfor storing these signatures, a novel signature pruning mechanism is used.\nSAFIUS has been implemented on a GNU/Linux based system modifying OpenGFS.\nPreliminary performance studies show that SAFIUS has a tolerable overhead for\nproviding secure storage: while it has an overhead of about 50% of OpenGFS in\ndata intensive workloads (due to the overhead of performing\nencryption/decryption in software), it is comparable (or better in some cases)\nto OpenGFS in metadata intensive workloads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Mar 2008 18:24:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sriram", "V", ""], ["Narayan", "Ganesh", ""], ["Gopinath", "K", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3338", "submitter": "Ganesh M.
