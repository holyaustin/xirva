In this paper, we consider a\ndynamic aggregator-EVs system, where an aggregator centrally coordinates a\nlarge number of dynamic EVs to perform regulation service. We propose a\nWelfare-Maximizing Regulation Allocation (WMRA) algorithm for the aggregator to\nfairly allocate the regulation amount among its EVs. Compared to previous\nworks, WMRA accommodates a wide spectrum of vital system characteristics,\nincluding dynamics of EV, limited EV battery size, EV battery degradation cost,\nand the cost of using external energy sources for the aggregator. The algorithm\noperates in real time and does not require any prior knowledge of the\nstatistical information of the system. Theoretically, we demonstrate that WMRA\nis away from the optimum by O(1/V), where V is a controlling parameter\ndepending on EV's battery size. In addition, our simulation results indicate\nthat WMRA can substantially outperform a suboptimal greedy algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2013 03:22:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 00:44:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Sun", ""], ["Dong", "Min", ""], ["Liang", "Ben", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3490", "submitter": "Fabrice Guillemin", "authors": "Fabrice Guillemin, Alain Simonian", "title": "Stationary analysis of the Shortest Queue First service policy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the so-called Shortest Queue First (SQF) queueing discipline\nwhereby a unique server addresses queues in parallel by serving at any time\nthat queue with the smallest workload.
