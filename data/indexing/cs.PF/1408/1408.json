We introduce a new service discipline, mixed gated/exhaustive service,\nthat can be used for queues with two types of customers: high and low priority\ncustomers. At the beginning of a visit of the server to such a queue, a gate is\nset behind all customers. High priority customers receive priority in the sense\nthat they are always served before any low priority customers. But high\npriority customers have a second advantage over low priority customers. Low\npriority customers are served according to the gated service discipline, i.e.\nonly customers standing in front of the gate are served during this visit. In\ncontrast, high priority customers arriving during the visit period of the queue\nare allowed to pass the gate and all low priority customers before the gate.\n  We study the cycle time distribution, the waiting time distributions for each\ncustomer type, the joint queue length distribution of all priority classes at\nall queues at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length\ndistributions for each customer type. Through numerical examples we illustrate\nthat the mixed gated/exhaustive service discipline can significantly decrease\nwaiting times of high priority jobs. In many cases there is a minimal negative\nimpact on the waiting times of low priority customers but, remarkably, it turns\nout that in polling systems with larger switch-over times there can be even a\npositive impact on the waiting times of low priority customers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 10:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Boon", "Marko", ""], ["Adan", "Ivo", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0131", "submitter": "Marko Boon", "authors": "Marko Boon", "title": "A Polling Model with Reneging at Polling Instants", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Annals of Operations Research 198, pp. 5-23, 2012", "doi": "10.1007/s10479-010-0758-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we consider a single-server, cyclic polling system with\nswitch-over times and Poisson arrivals.

In more detail, whenever the server starts or ends a visit to a\nqueue, some of the customers waiting in each queue leave the system before\nhaving received service. The probability that a certain customer leaves the\nqueue, depends on the queue in which the customer is waiting, and on the\nlocation of the server. We show that this system can be analysed by introducing\ncustomer subtypes, depending on their arrival periods, and keeping track of the\nmoment when they abandon the system. In order to determine waiting time\ndistributions, we regard the system as a polling model with varying arrival\nrates, and apply a generalised version of the distributional form of Little's\nlaw. The marginal queue length distribution can be found by conditioning on the\nstate of the system (position of the server, and whether it is serving or\nswitching).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 11:16:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Boon", "Marko", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0134", "submitter": "Marko Boon", "authors": "Marko Boon, Erik Winands, Ivo Adan, Sandra van Wijk", "title": "Closed-Form Waiting Time Approximations for Polling Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Performance Evaluation 68, pp. 290-306, 2011", "doi": "10.1016/j.peva.2010.12.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A typical polling system consists of a number of queues, attended by a single\nserver in a fixed order.
