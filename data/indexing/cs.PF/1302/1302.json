Many scientific applications involve operations on large sparse\nmatrices such as linear solvers, eigensolver, and graph mining algorithms. The\ncore of most of these applications involves the multiplication of a large,\nsparse matrix with a dense vector (SpMV). In this paper, we investigate the\nperformance of the Xeon Phi coprocessor for SpMV. We first provide a\ncomprehensive introduction to this new architecture and analyze its peak\nperformance with a number of micro benchmarks. Although the design of a Xeon\nPhi core is not much different than those of the cores in modern processors,\nits large number of cores and hyperthreading capability allow many application\nto saturate the available memory bandwidth, which is not the case for many\ncutting-edge processors. Yet, our performance studies show that it is the\nmemory latency not the bandwidth which creates a bottleneck for SpMV on this\narchitecture. Finally, our experiments show that Xeon Phi's sparse kernel\nperformance is very promising and even better than that of cutting-edge general\npurpose processors and GPUs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 16:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Saule", "Erik", ""], ["Kaya", "Kamer", ""], ["Catalyurek", "Umit V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.1954", "submitter": "Zheng Li", "authors": "Zheng Li and Liam O'Brien and He Zhang and Rainbow Cai", "title": "On a Catalogue of Metrics for Evaluating Commercial Cloud Services", "comments": "10 pages, Proceedings of the 13th ACM/IEEE International Conference\n  on Grid Computing (Grid 2012), pp. 164-173, Beijing, China, September 20-23,\n  2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/Grid.2012.15", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given the continually increasing amount of commercial Cloud services in the\nmarket, evaluation of different services plays a significant role in\ncost-benefit analysis or decision making for choosing Cloud Computing.

In this paper, we propose a new approach toward\nbetter queueing and delay performance, based on our observation that the\nalgorithm needs not be Markovian, as long as it can be implemented in a\ndistributed manner, achieve the same throughput optimality, while offering far\nbetter delay performance for general network topologies. Our approach hinges\nupon utilizing past state information observed by local link and then\nconstructing a high-order Markov chain for the evolution of the feasible link\nschedules. We show in theory and simulation that our proposed algorithm, named\ndelayed CSMA, adds virtually no additional overhead onto the existing\nCSMA-based algorithms, achieves the throughput optimality under the usual\nchoice of link weight as a function of local queue length, and also provides\nmuch better delay performance by effectively `de-correlating' the link state\nprocess (thus removing link starvation) under any arbitrary network topology.\nFrom our extensive simulations we observe that the delay under our algorithm\ncan be often reduced by a factor of 20 over a wide range of scenarios, compared\nto the standard Glauber-dynamics-based CSMA algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2013 21:39:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Mar 2013 22:54:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 02:26:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 17:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kwak", "Jaewook", ""], ["Lee", "Chul-Ho", ""], ["Eun", "Do Young", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4085", "submitter": "Charng-Da Lu", "authors": "Charng-Da Lu", "title": "Comprehensive Resource Measurement and Analysis for HPC Systems with\n  TACC_Stats", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.PF", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  High-performance computing (HPC) systems are a complex combination of\nsoftware, processors, memory, networks, and storage systems characterized by\nfrequent disruptive technological advances.
