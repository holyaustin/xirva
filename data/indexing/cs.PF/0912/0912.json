For the rate monotonic scheduling policy, we show that\nperiodic workload with utilization less than a threshold $U_{RM}^{*}$ can be\nscheduled almost surely and that all workload with utilization greater than\n$U_{RM}^{*}$ is almost surely not schedulable. We study such sharp threshold\nbehavior in the context of processor scheduling using static task priorities,\nnot only for periodic real-time tasks but for aperiodic real-time tasks as\nwell. The notion of a utilization threshold provides a simple schedulability\ntest for most real-time applications. These results improve our understanding\nof scheduling policies and provide an interesting characterization of the\ntypical behavior of policies. The threshold is sharp (small deviations around\nthe threshold cause schedulability, as a property, to appear or disappear) for\nmost policies; this is a happy consequence that can be used to address the\nlimitations of existing utilization-based tests for schedulability. We\ndemonstrate the use of such an approach for balancing power consumption with\nthe need to meet deadlines in web servers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Dec 2009 01:18:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Sathish", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4506", "submitter": "Georg Hager", "authors": "Markus Wittmann, Georg Hager and Gerhard Wellein", "title": "Multicore-aware parallel temporal blocking of stencil codes for shared\n  and distributed memory", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470813", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  New algorithms and optimization techniques are needed to balance the\naccelerating trend towards bandwidth-starved multicore chips.
