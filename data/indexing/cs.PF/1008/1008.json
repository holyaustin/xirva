In this study, we tackle this\nchallenge for smart grid with integrated wind generation, by leveraging\nmulti-timescale dispatch and scheduling. Specifically, we consider smart grids\nwith two classes of energy users - traditional energy users and opportunistic\nenergy users (e.g., smart meters or smart appliances), and investigate pricing\nand dispatch at two timescales, via day-ahead scheduling and realtime\nscheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, with the statistical information on wind\ngeneration and energy demands, we characterize the optimal procurement of the\nenergy supply and the day-ahead retail price for the traditional energy users;\nin realtime scheduling, with the realization of wind generation and the load of\ntraditional energy users, we optimize real-time prices to manage the\nopportunistic energy users so as to achieve systemwide reliability. More\nspecifically, when the opportunistic users are non-persistent, i.e., a subset\nof them leave the power market when the real-time price is not acceptable, we\nobtain closedform solutions to the two-level scheduling problem. For the\npersistent case, we treat the scheduling problem as a multitimescale Markov\ndecision process. We show that it can be recast, explicitly, as a classic\nMarkov decision process with continuous state and action spaces, the solution\nto which can be found via standard techniques. We conclude that the proposed\nmulti-scale dispatch and scheduling with real-time pricing can effectively\naddress the volatility and uncertainty of wind generation and energy demand,\nand has the potential to improve the penetration of renewable energy into smart\ngrids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Aug 2010 22:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 18:42:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Miao", ""], ["Murugesan", "Sugumar", ""], ["Zhang", "Junshan", ""]]}]
