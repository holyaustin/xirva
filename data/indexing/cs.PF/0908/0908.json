This model is based upon a schedule of\nsensor allocation plans in multiple time intervals subject to coverage and\nconnectivity constraints. By turning off a specific set of redundant sensors in\neach time interval, it is possible to reduce the total energy consumption in\nthe network and, at the same time, avoid partitioning the whole network by\nlosing some strategic sensors too prematurely. Since the network is\nheterogeneous, sensors can sense different phenomena from different demand\npoints, with different sample rates.

The\nwireless and dynamic nature of ad-hoc networks makes them vulnerable to attacks\nespecially in routing protocols. Providing security in mobile ad-hoc networks\nhas been a major issue over the recent years. One of the prominent mesh base\nreactive multicast routing protocols used in ad-hoc networks is On Demand\nMulticast Routing protocol (ODMRP). The security of ODMRP is compromised by a\nprimary routing attack called black hole attack. In this attack a malicious\nnode advertises itself as having the shortest path to the node whose packets it\nwants to intercept. This paper discusses the impact of black hole attack on\nODMRP under various scenarios. The performance is evaluated using metrics such\nas packet delivery ratio and end to end delay for various numbers of senders\nand receivers via simulation.

The\nmajority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has\nfocused on device-based active localization, in which a device is attached to\ntracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been\nproposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor\nparticipate actively in the localization process. DfP systems are based on the\nfact that RF signals are affected by the presence of people and objects in the\nenvironment. The DfP concept enables a wide range of applications including\nintrusion detection and tracking, border protection, and smart buildings\nautomation. Previous studies have focused on small areas with direct line of\nsight and/or controlled environments. In this paper, we present the design,\nimplementation and analysis of Nuzzer, a large-scale device-free passive\nlocalization system for real environments.\n  Without any additional hardware, it makes use of the already installed\nwireless data networks to monitor and process changes in the received signal\nstrength (RSS) transmitted from access points at one or more monitoring points.\nWe present probabilistic techniques for DfP localization and evaluate their\nperformance in a typical office building, rich in multipath, with an area of\n1500 square meters. Our results show that the Nuzzer system gives device-free\nlocation estimates with less than 2 meters median distance error using only two\nmonitoring laptops and three access points. This indicates the suitability of\nNuzzer to a large number of application domains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 15:31:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Seifeldin", "Moustafa", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1057", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Abd El Naser A.
