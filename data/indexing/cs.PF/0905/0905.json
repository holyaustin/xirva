This model\nallows an accurate performance prediction and evaluation for existing\ninstruction codes. It provides an in-depth understanding of how performance for\ndifferent memory hierarchy levels is made up. The performance of raw memory\nload, store and copy operations and a stream vector triad are analyzed and\nbenchmarked on three modern x86-type quad-core architectures in order to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2009 10:55:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Treibig", "Jan", ""], ["Hager", "Georg", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.1738", "submitter": "Predrag Jelenkovic", "authors": "Predrag R.

We believe that these methods may\nbe of independent interest in the analysis of more general weighted branching\nprocesses as well as in the analysis of algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 May 2009 23:57:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 17:39:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2010 22:28:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Jelenkovic", "Predrag R.", ""], ["Olvera-Cravioto", "Mariana", ""]]}]
