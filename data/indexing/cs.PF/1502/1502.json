This leads to an \"online\" charging scheduling\nproblem that is naturally formulated as a finite-horizon dynamic programming\nwith continuous state space and action space. To avoid the prohibitively high\ncomplexity of solving such a dynamic programming problem, we provide a Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) based algorithm with computational complexity\n$O(T^3)$, where $T$ is the total number of time stages. We rigorously analyze\nthe performance gap between the near-optimal solution of the MPC-based approach\nand the optimal solution for any distributions of exogenous random variables.\nFurthermore, our rigorous analysis shows that when the random process\ndescribing the arrival of charging demands is first-order periodic, the\ncomplexity of proposed algorithm can be reduced to $O(1)$, which is independent\nof $T$.

A Multi-RAT DenseNet is characterized by a very dense deployment of\nlow-power base stations (BSs) and by a multi-tier architecture consisting of\nheterogeneous radio access technologies. Such a network aims to guarantee high\ndata-rates, low latency and low energy consumption. Although the usage of a\nMulti RAT DenseNet solves problems such as coverage holes and low performance\nat the cell edge, frequent and unnecessary RAT handovers may occur with a\nconsequent high signaling load. In this work, we propose an effective RAT\nselection algorithm that efficiently manages the RAT handover procedure by\n\\emph{(i)} choosing the most suitable RAT that guarantees high system and user\nperformance, and \\emph{(ii)} reducing unnecessary handover events. In\nparticular, the decision to trigger a handover is based on a new system\nparameter named Reference Base Station Efficiency (RBSE). This parameter takes\ninto account metrics related to both the system and the user: the BS\ntransmitted power, the BS traffic load and the users' spectral efficiency. We\ncompare, by simulation, the proposed scheme with the standardized 3GPP\npolicies.
