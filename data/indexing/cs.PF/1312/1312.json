Although this concept has emerged\nprimarily to enhance spectrum utilization, the importance of energy consumption\nposes new challenges, because energy efficiency and communication performance\ncan be at odds. In this paper, the existing approaches to energy efficiency\nspectrum sensing and handoff are classified. The tradeoff between energy\nconsumption and throughput is established as function of the numerous design\nparameters of cognitive radio networks, both in the case of local and of\ncooperative spectrum sensing. It is argued that a number of important aspects\nstill needs to be researched, such as fairness, dynamic behavior, reactive and\nproactive schemes for energy efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Nov 2013 00:28:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shokri-Ghadikolaei", "Hossein", ""], ["Glaropoulos", "Ioannis", ""], ["Fodor", "Viktoria", ""], ["Fischione", "Carlo", ""], ["Dimou", "Konstantinos", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.1003", "submitter": "Upul Senanayake Mr", "authors": "Upul Senanayake, Rahal Prabuddha, Roshan Ragel", "title": "High Throughput Virtual Screening with Data Level Parallelism in\n  Multi-core Processors", "comments": "Information and Automation for Sustainability (ICIAfS), 2012 IEEE 6th\n  International Conference on", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIAFS.2012.6419885", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Improving the throughput of molecular docking, a computationally intensive\nphase of the virtual screening process, is a highly sought area of research\nsince it has a significant weight in the drug designing process.
