In a\nproposed algorithm (Koukoutsidis and Theologou, 2003), the system can use the\nadditional information of the last interaction cell combined with a mobility\nmodel to predict the short-term location probabilities at the time of an\nincoming call arrival. The short-term location probabilities reduce the\nuncertainty in mobile user position and thus greatly improve the search. In\nthis paper, an analytical model is derived that allows for a general\ndistribution of cell residence times. By considering a Gamma distribution, we\nstudy the effect of the variance of cell residence times and derive useful\nresults on the performance of the algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Apr 2009 13:38:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Koukoutsidis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Papaioannou", "Petros", ""], ["Theologou", "Michael E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2018", "submitter": "Jing Xie Ms.", "authors": "J.Xie and Y.Jiang", "title": "Stochastic Service Guarantee Analysis Based on Time-Domain Models", "comments": "Accepted by 17th Annual Meeting of the IEEE/ACM International\n  Symposium on Modelling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and\n  Telecommunication Systems.

In the current stochastic network\ncalculus literature, its traffic and server models are typically based on the\ncumulative amount of traffic and cumulative amount of service respectively.\nHowever, there are network scenarios where the applicability of such models is\nlimited, and hence new ways of modeling traffic and service are needed to\naddress this limitation. This paper presents time-domain models and results for\nstochastic network calculus. Particularly, we define traffic models, which are\nbased on probabilistic lower-bounds on cumulative packet inter-arrival time,\nand server models, which are based on probabilistic upper-bounds on cumulative\npacket service time. In addition, examples demonstrating the use of the\nproposed time-domain models are provided. On the basis of the proposed models,\nthe five basic properties of stochastic network calculus are also proved, which\nimplies broad applicability of the proposed time-domain approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2009 11:47:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2009 08:51:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "J.", ""], ["Jiang", "Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4155", "submitter": "Jeong-woo Cho", "authors": "Jeong-woo Cho, Yuming Jiang", "title": "Fundamentals of the Backoff Process in 802.11: Dichotomy of the\n  Aggregation", "comments": "15 pages, 4 figures; An abstract version of this paper was presented\n  at ACM SIGMETRICS Workshop on MAthematical performance Modeling and Analysis\n  (MAMA 2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discovers fundamental principles of the backoff process that\ngoverns the performance of IEEE 802.11. A simplistic principle founded upon\nregular variation theory is that the backoff time has a truncated Pareto-type\ntail distribution with an exponent of $(\\log \\gamma)/\\log m$ ($m$ is the\nmultiplicative factor and $\\gamma$ is the collision probability). This reveals\nthat the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for\n$\\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result.\n  The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed\nprocesses is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate\nbackoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scale on which we\nview the backoff processes. While the aggregation on normal time-scales leads\nto a Poisson process, it is approximated by a new limiting process possessing\nlong-range dependence (LRD) on coarse time-scales. This dichotomy turns out to\nbe instrumental in formulating short-term fairness, extending existing formulas\nto arbitrary population, and to elucidate the absence of LRD in practical\nsituations. A refined wavelet analysis is conducted to strengthen this\nargument.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 13:33:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 May 2009 17:02:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2009 05:40:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 7 Apr 2010 11:40:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 20 Aug 2010 14:01:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Jeong-woo", ""], ["Jiang", "Yuming", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4512", "submitter": "Andr\\'as Salamon", "authors": "Andr\\'as Z.
