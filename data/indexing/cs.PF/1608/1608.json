In this work, we provide an\nalternative approach to derive a closed-form expression that characterizes the\ncumulative service process of the 60 GHz channel in terms of the moment\ngenerating function (MGF) of its instantaneous channel capacity.

The computed bounds are validated using simulation.\nWe provide numerical results for different networking scenarios and for\ndifferent traffic and channel parameters and we show that the 60 GHz wireless\nnetwork is capable of satisfying stringent quality-of-Service (QoS)\nrequirements, in terms of network delay and reliability.

For each of these approaches, we present two representative protocol\nvariants. These protocols are then implemented as part of a demo AWN and they\nare then compared based on performance measurements. Most importantly, we have\nevaluated these protocols based on security and operational requirements that\nwe define in this paper for an AWN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 17:10:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 14:27:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Akram", "Raja Naeem", ""], ["Markantonakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Mayes", "Keith", ""], ["Bonnefoi", "Pierre-Francois", ""], ["Sauveron", "Damien", ""], ["Chaumette", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04116", "submitter": "Raja Naeem Akram", "authors": "Raja Naeem Akram, Konstantinos Markantonakis, Keith Mayes,\n  Pierre-Francois Bonnefoi, Damien Sauveron, Serge Chaumette", "title": "An Efficient, Secure and Trusted Channel Protocol for Avionics Wireless\n  Networks", "comments": "10 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, IEEE DASC", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Avionics networks rely on a set of stringent reliability and safety\nrequirements. In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired\ntechnology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology\nsimplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can\nbe safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network,\nand the fact that it is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node\ninto the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently\nunder development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in\nthe complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction\nin the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the\ncapacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts\nsuch as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing\nthese benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are\nat minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper,\nwe propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated\nsecurity and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main\nobjectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance\nthat all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their\ninternal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to\nestablish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to\nprovide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for\nboth the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a\ncold and/or warm restart of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and\nperformance measurements are presented based on this implementation. In\naddition, we formally verify our proposed protocol using CasperFDR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 17:10:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 13:33:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Akram", "Raja Naeem", ""], ["Markantonakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Mayes", "Keith", ""], ["Bonnefoi", "Pierre-Francois", ""], ["Sauveron", "Damien", ""], ["Chaumette", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04295", "submitter": "Jiahao Chen", "authors": "Jiahao Chen and Jarrett Revels", "title": "Robust benchmarking in noisy environments", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures, Proceedings of the 20th Annual IEEE High\n  Performance Extreme Computing Conference, 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a benchmarking strategy that is robust in the presence of timer\nerror, OS jitter and other environmental fluctuations, and is insensitive to\nthe highly nonideal statistics produced by timing measurements.

End users of these applications range from novice to\nexpert depending on how experienced they are in using them. With repeated usage\n(practice) of an application, a user's think time gradually decreases, known as\nlearning phenomenon. In contrast to the popular notion of constant mean think\ntime of users across all practice sessions, decrease in mean think time over\npractice sessions does occur due to learning. This decrease gives rise to a\ndifferent system workload thereby affecting the application's short-term\nperformance. However, such impact of learning on performance has never been\naccounted for. In this work we propose a model that accounts for human learning\nbehavior in analyzing the transient (short-term) performance of a 3-tier cloud\nbased application. Our approach is based on a closed queueing network model. We\nsolve the model using discrete event simulation. In addition to the overall\nmean System Response Time (SRT), our model solution also generates the mean\nSRTs for various types (novice, intermediate, expert) of requests submitted by\nusers at various levels of their expertise. We demonstrate that our model can\nbe used to evaluate various what-if scenarios to decide the number of VMs we\nneed for each tier-a VM configuration-that would meet the response time SLA.\nThe results show that the lack of accountability of learning may lead to a\nselection of an inappropriate VM configuration. The results further show that\nthe mean SRTs for various types of requests are better measures to consider in\nVM allocation process in comparison to the overall mean SRT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Aug 2016 21:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Arindam", ""], ["Das", "Olivia", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08658", "submitter": "Navjot Kukreja", "authors": "Navjot Kukreja, Mathias Louboutin, Felippe Vieira, Fabio Luporini,\n  Michael Lange, Gerard Gorman", "title": "Devito: automated fast finite difference computation", "comments": "Accepted at WolfHPC 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Domain specific languages have successfully been used in a variety of fields\nto cleanly express scientific problems as well as to simplify implementation\nand performance opti- mization on different computer architectures.
