Instead of creating a new system for\neach specific flavor of machine learning task, or hardcoding new optimizations,\nwe argue for the use of recursive queries to program a variety of machine\nlearning systems. By taking this approach, database query optimization\ntechniques can be utilized to identify effective execution plans, and the\nresulting runtime plans can be executed on a single unified data-parallel query\nprocessing engine. As a proof of concept, we consider two programming\nmodels--Pregel and Iterative Map-Reduce-Update---from the machine learning\ndomain, and show how they can be captured in Datalog, tuned for a specific\ntask, and then compiled into an optimized physical plan. Experiments performed\non a large computing cluster with real data demonstrate that this declarative\napproach can provide very good performance while offering both increased\ngenerality and programming ease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 11:43:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 10:14:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bu", "Yingyi", ""], ["Borkar", "Vinayak", ""], ["Carey", "Michael J.", ""], ["Rosen", "Joshua", ""], ["Polyzotis", "Neoklis", ""], ["Condie", "Tyson", ""], ["Weimer", "Markus", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "Raghu", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.0920", "submitter": "Luca Bortolussi", "authors": "Luca Bortolussi and Jane Hillston", "title": "Fluid Model Checking", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate a potential use of fluid approximation\ntechniques in the context of stochastic model checking of CSL formulae.

Two of the\nchallenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for\nMapReduce configuration parameters -e.g., number of mappers, number of\nreducers, and DFS block size-, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that\na user should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both\nchoosing configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely\nthe users' responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision\nthe total CPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a\nMapReduce job, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the\njob past executions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g.,\nnumber of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is\nused to model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU\nusage in clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input\ndata scaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model\nalong with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage\nin clock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate\nthe accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim\nMainLog parsing, and TeraSort).

In our\nmodel, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized\nmanner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction\n$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed\nspecifically to their respective stations.\n  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in\nthe steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of\nstations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the\naverage queue length in steady state scales as $\\log_{1/(1-p)} 1/(1-\\lambda)$\nwhen the traffic intensity $\\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller\nthan the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of $1/(1-\\lambda)$, obtained when all\nresources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a\nstrong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.\n  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient\nand steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of\nstations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length\nprocesses converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time\ninterval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges\nto a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is\nobtained.

An\naspect of graph algorithms that has hitherto not received much interest is the\neffect of memory hierarchy on accesses. A typical system today has multiple\nlevels in the memory hierarchy with differing units of locality; ranging across\ncache lines, TLB entries and DRAM pages. We postulate that it is possible to\nallocate graph structured data in main memory in a way as to improve the\nspatial locality of the data. Previous approaches to improving cache locality\nhave focused only on a single unit of locality, either the cache line or\nvirtual memory page. On the other hand cache oblivious algorithms can optimise\nlayout for all levels of the memory hierarchy but unfortunately need to be\nspecially designed for individual data structures. In this paper we explore\nhierarchical blocking as a technique for closing this gap. We require as input\na specification of the units of locality in the memory hierarchy and lay out\nthe input graph accordingly by copying its nodes using a hierarchy of breadth\nfirst searches. We start with a basic algorithm that is limited to trees and\nthen extend it to arbitrary graphs. Our most efficient version requires only a\nconstant amount of additional space. We have implemented versions of the\nalgorithm in various environments: for C programs interfaced with macros, as an\nextension to the Boost object oriented graph library and finally as a\nmodification to the traversal phase of the semispace garbage collector in the\nJikes Java virtual machine.
