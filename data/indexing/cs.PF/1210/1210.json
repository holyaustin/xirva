Since\ntoday's wireless terminals are typically equipped with multiple network access\ninterfaces such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks, this paper\ninvestigates user terminals cooperating with each other in transmitting their\ndata packets to the base station (BS), by exploiting the multiple network\naccess interfaces, called inter-network cooperation. We also examine the\nconventional schemes without user cooperation and with intra-network\ncooperation for comparison. Given target outage probability and data rate\nrequirements, we analyze the energy consumption of conventional schemes as\ncompared to the proposed inter-network cooperation by taking into account both\nphysical-layer channel impairments (including path loss, fading, and thermal\nnoise) and upper-layer protocol overheads. It is shown that distances between\ndifferent network entities (i.e., user terminals and BS) have a significant\ninfluence on the energy efficiency of proposed inter-network cooperation\nscheme. Specifically, when the cooperating users are close to BS or the users\nare far away from each other, the inter-network cooperation may consume more\nenergy than conventional schemes without user cooperation or with intra-network\ncooperation. However, as the cooperating users move away from BS and the\ninter-user distance is not too large, the inter-network cooperation\nsignificantly reduces the energy consumption over conventional schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Oct 2012 20:27:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zou", "Yulong", ""], ["Zhu", "Jia", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.5975", "submitter": "Tasha Frankie", "authors": "Tasha Frankie, Gordon Hughes, Ken Kreutz-Delgado", "title": "Solid State Disk Object-Based Storage with Trim Commands", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a model of NAND flash SSD utilization and write\namplification when the ATA/ATAPI SSD Trim command is incorporated into\nobject-based storage under a variety of user workloads, including a uniform\nrandom workload with objects of fixed size and a uniform random workload with\nobjects of varying sizes.

Often times, the problems in the\nsequence are linked in a way that allows intermediate results to be reused. A\ncharacteristic example for this class of applications is given by the\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a widely spread tool in computational\nbiology. GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions ($10^{12}$) of correlated\ngeneralized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the\nperformance of petaflops ($10^{15}$ floating-point operations) over terabytes\nof data.\n  In this paper, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multi-core\narchitectures. This is accomplished in three steps. First, we show how to\nexploit the relation among successive problems, thus reducing the overall\ncomputational complexity. Then, through an analysis of the required data\ntransfers, we identify how to eliminate any overhead due to input/output\noperations. Finally, we study how to decompose computation into tasks to be\ndistributed among the available cores, to attain high performance and\nscalability. With our algorithm, a GWAS that currently requires the use of a\nsupercomputer may now be performed in matter of hours on a single multi-core\nnode.\n  The discussion centers around the methodology to develop the algorithm rather\nthan the specific application.

To this end, we provide an explicit and\nuniform characterization of the entire body of the retransmission distribution\nPr[N_b > n] in both n and b.

This\nrigorous approximation clearly demonstrates the coupling of a power law\ndistribution, dominating the main body, and the Gamma distribution, determining\nthe exponential tail. Our results are validated via simulation experiments and\ncan be useful for designing retransmission-based systems with the required\nperformance characteristics.
