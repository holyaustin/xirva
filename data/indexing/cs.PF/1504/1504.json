Modern big-data problems are often well suited for stream\nprocessing's throughput-oriented nature. Realization of efficient stream\nprocessing requires monitoring and optimization of multiple communications\nlinks. Most techniques to optimize these links use queueing network models or\nnetwork flow models, which require some idea of the actual execution rate of\neach independent compute kernel within the system. What we want to know is how\nfast can each kernel process data independent of other communicating kernels.\nThis is known as the \"service rate\" of the kernel within the queueing\nliterature. Current approaches to divining service rates are static. Modern\nworkloads, however, are often dynamic. Shared cloud systems also present\napplications with highly dynamic execution environments (multiple users,\nhardware migration, etc.). It is therefore desirable to continuously re-tune an\napplication during run time (online) in response to changing conditions. Our\napproach enables online service rate monitoring under most conditions,\nobviating the need for reliance on steady state predictions for what are\nprobably non-steady state phenomena. First, some of the difficulties associated\nwith online service rate determination are examined. Second, the algorithm to\napproximate the online non-blocking service rate is described.

We thus need tools to measure the energy consumption of computing\nsystems and to understand how workloads affect it. Significant recent research\neffort has targeted direct power measurements on production computing systems\nusing on-board sensors or external instruments. These direct methods have in\nturn guided studies of software techniques to reduce energy consumption via\nworkload allocation and scaling. Unfortunately, direct energy measurements are\nhampered by the low power sampling frequency of power sensors. The coarse\ngranularity of power sensing limits our understanding of how power is allocated\nin systems and our ability to optimize energy efficiency via workload\nallocation.\n  We present ALEA, a tool to measure power and energy consumption at the\ngranularity of basic blocks, using a probabilistic approach. ALEA provides\nfine-grained energy profiling via statistical sampling, which overcomes the\nlimitations of power sensing instruments. Compared to state-of-the-art energy\nmeasurement tools, ALEA provides finer granularity without sacrificing\naccuracy. ALEA achieves low overhead energy measurements with mean error rates\nbetween 1.4% and 3.5% in 14 sequential and parallel benchmarks tested on both\nIntel and ARM platforms. The sampling method caps execution time overhead at\napproximately 1%. ALEA is thus suitable for online energy monitoring and\noptimization. Finally, ALEA is a user-space tool with a portable,\nmachine-independent sampling method.
