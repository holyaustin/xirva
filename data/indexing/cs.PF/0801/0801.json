The available bandwidth of a link or\ncomplete path is expressed in terms of a {\\em service curve}, which is a\nfunction that appears in the network calculus to express the service available\nto a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a\nsequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of\narrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived\nin the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further\nmathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of\nestimating available bandwidth from measurement of network probes are related\nto potential non-linearities of the underlying network. When networks are\nviewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a non-linear regime, it\nis argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the\nnetwork crosses from a linear to a non-linear regime. Experiments on the Emulab\ntestbed at the University of Utah evaluate the robustness of the system\ntheoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multi-node experiments\nevaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides\nestimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual\nlinks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2008 00:11:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Liebeherr", "Jorg", ""], ["Fidler", "Markus", ""], ["Valaee", "Shahrokh", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.4592", "submitter": "Yue Wang", "authors": "Yue Wang, John C.

In this\nwork, we want to understand this paradox. Specifically, we address the\nfollowing questions: (1)Theoretically, should we increase or decrease\ntransmission power to maximize network capacity? (2) Theoretically, how much\nnetwork capacity gain can we achieve by power control? (3) Under realistic\nsituations, how do power control, link scheduling and routing interact with\neach other? Under which scenarios can we expect a large capacity gain by using\nhigher transmission power? To answer these questions, firstly, we prove that\nthe optimal network capacity is a non-decreasing function of transmission\npower. Secondly, we prove that the optimal network capacity can be increased\nunlimitedly by higher transmission power in some network configurations.\nHowever, when nodes are distributed uniformly, the gain of optimal network\ncapacity by higher transmission power is upper-bounded by a positive constant.\nThirdly, we discuss why network capacity in practice may increase or decrease\nwith higher transmission power under different scenarios using carrier sensing\nand the minimum hop-count routing. Extensive simulations are carried out to\nverify our analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2008 02:51:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Sep 2008 04:03:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yue", ""], ["Lui", "John C.
