Such systems combine disproportionate floating point performance with\nhigh data locality and are thus well suited to implement real-time algorithms.\nWe describe the library design, programming interface and implementation\ndetails in light of this specific problem domain. The core concepts of this\nwork are a novel kind of container abstraction and MPI-like communication\nmethods for intra-system communication. We further demonstrate how MGPU is used\nas a framework for porting existing GPU libraries to multi-device\narchitectures. Putting our library to the test, we accelerate an iterative\nnon-linear image reconstruction algorithm for real-time magnetic resonance\nimaging using multiple GPUs. We achieve a speed-up of about 1.7 using 2 GPUs\nand reach a final speed-up of 2.1 with 4 GPUs. These promising results lead us\nto conclude that multi-GPU systems are a viable solution for real-time MRI\nreconstruction as well as signal-processing applications in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 14:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schaetz", "Sebastian", ""], ["Uecker", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.2750", "submitter": "Mehmet Karaca", "authors": "Mehmet Karaca and Bjorn Landfeldt", "title": "Load-aware Channel Selection for 802.11 WLANs with Limited Measurement", "comments": "accepted to ICT", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been known that load unaware channel selection in 802.11 networks\nresults in high level interference, and can significantly reduce the network\nthroughput. In current implementation, the only way to determine the traffic\nload on a channel is to measure that channel for a certain duration of time.\nTherefore, in order to find the best channel with the minimum load all channels\nhave to be measured, which is costly and can cause unacceptable communication\ninterruptions between the AP and the stations. In this paper, we propose a\nlearning based approach which aims to find the channel with the minimum load by\nmeasuring only limited number of channels. Our method uses Gaussian Process\nRegressing to accurately track the traffic load on each channel based on the\nprevious measured load. We confirm the performance of our algorithm by using\nexperimental data, and show that the time consumed for the load measurement can\nbe reduced up to 46% compared to the case where all channels are monitored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jan 2013 07:49:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 16:22:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 16:47:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Karaca", "Mehmet", ""], ["Landfeldt", "Bjorn", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3599", "submitter": "Ahmed  Bader", "authors": "Ahmed Bader, Karim Abed-Meraim, and Mohamed-Slim Alouini", "title": "Technical Report: Beaconless Geo-Routing Under The Spotlight: Practical\n  Link Models and Application Scenarios", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSYST.2013.2280848", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analysis and simulation of beaconless geo-routing protocols have been\ntraditionally conducted assuming equal communication ranges for the data and\ncontrol packets. In reality, this is not true since the communication range is\nactually function of the packet length. Control packets are typically much\nshorter than data packets. As a consequence, a substantial discrepancy exists\nin practice between their respective communication ranges. In this paper, we\ndevise a practical link model for computing the effective communication range.\nWe further introduce two simple strategies for bridging the gap between the\ncontrol and data packet communication ranges. Our primary objective in this\npaper is to construct a realistic analytical framework describing the\nend-to-end performance of beaconless geo-routing protocols. Two flagship\nprotocols are selected in this paper for further investigation under the\ndeveloped framework. For a better perspective, the two protocols are actually\ncompared to a hypothetical limit case; one which offers optimal energy and\nlatency performance. Finally, we present four different application scenarios.\nFor each scenario, we highlight the geo-routing protocol which performs the\nbest and discuss the reasons behind it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 06:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bader", "Ahmed", ""], ["Abed-Meraim", "Karim", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5793", "submitter": "I\\~naki Ucar", "authors": "I\\~naki Ucar (1), Jorge Navarro-Ortiz (2), Pablo Ameigeiras (2), Juan\n  M.
