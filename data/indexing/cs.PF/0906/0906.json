Depending on the interference model, more or less colors,\ncorresponding to the number of frequencies or time slots, are necessary.

The\nstrength of a signal is assumed to fade polynomially with the distance from the\nsender, depending on the so-called path-loss exponent $\\alpha$.\n  We show that, when all transmitters use the same power, the number of colors\nneeded is constant in one-dimensional grids if $\\alpha>1$ as well as in\ntwo-dimensional grids if $\\alpha>2$.
