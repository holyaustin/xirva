Under heavy\nworkloads, TOFEC automatically reduces the level of chunking (fewer chunks with\nincreased size) and uses fewer parallel connections to reduce overhead,\nresulting in higher throughput and preventing queueing delay. Our trace-driven\nsimulation results show that TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an\nappropriate code that provides the optimal delay-throughput trade-off without\nreducing system capacity. Compared to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for\nthroughput, TOFEC delivers 2.5x lower latency under light workloads; compared\nto a non-adaptive strategy optimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support\nover 3x as many requests.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 18:49:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Liang", "Guanfeng", ""], ["Kozat", "Ulas C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.8199", "submitter": "Sung Sik Nam", "authors": "Sung Sik Nam, Hong-Chuan Yang, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, and Dong In Kim", "title": "Technical Report: An MGF-based Unified Framework to Determine the Joint\n  Statistics of Partial Sums of Ordered i.n.d.

A unified analytical framework to determine the\njoint statistics of partial sums of ordered independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) random variables was recently presented. However, the\nidentical distribution assumption may not be valid in several real-world\napplications. With this motivation in mind, we consider in this paper the more\ngeneral case in which the random variables are independent but not necessarily\nidentically distributed (i.n.d.). More specifically, we extend the previous\nanalysis and introduce a new more general unified analytical framework to\ndetermine the joint statistics of partial sums of ordered i.n.d. RVs. Our\nmathematical formalism is illustrated with an application on the exact\nperformance analysis of the capture probability of generalized selection\ncombining (GSC)-based RAKE receivers operating over frequency-selective fading\nchannels with a non-uniform power delay profile. We also discussed a couple of\nother sample applications of the generic results presented in this work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 03:02:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 06:39:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Nam", "Sung Sik", ""], ["Yang", "Hong-Chuan", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""], ["Kim", "Dong In", ""]]}]
