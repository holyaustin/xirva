For density dependent families\nof MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,\nKurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary\ndifferential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The\ncomputational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,\nbut the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce\nrelevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a\nrecent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump\ndiffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of\nKurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary\nwith non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion\napproximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results\nwhen the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that\nit can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to\novercome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion\napproximation only to those components of the model that are in density\ndependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining\ncomponents are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a\nhybrid switching jump diffusion. We show that the stochastic differential\nequations that characterize this process can be derived automatically both from\nthe description of the original Markov chains or starting from a higher level\ndescription language, like stochastic Petri nets.
