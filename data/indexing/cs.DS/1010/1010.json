Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy.

The Fourier representation is at the heart of\nmany of these processes and the Haar transform is expected to play a major role\nin techniques envisioned to speed up VLSI design. To ensure correct printing of\nthe constantly shrinking transistors and simultaneously handle their\nincreasingly large number, ever more computationally intensive techniques are\nneeded. Therefore, efficient algorithms for the Haar and Fourier transforms are\nvital. We derive the complexity of both algorithms and compare it to that of\ndiscrete transforms traditionally used in VLSI. We find a significant reduction\nin complexity when the number of vertices of the polygons is small, as is the\ncase in VLSI layouts. This analysis is completed by an implementation and a\nbenchmark of the continuous algorithms and their discrete counterpart. We show\nthat on tested VLSI layouts the pruned continuous Haar transform is 5 to 25\ntimes faster, while the fast continuous Fourier series is 1.5 to 3 times\nfaster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Oct 2010 03:45:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Scheibler", "Robin", ""], ["Hurley", "Paul", ""], ["Chebira", "Amina", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5717", "submitter": "Dominik Scheder", "authors": "Dominik Scheder", "title": "PPZ For More Than Two Truth Values - An Algorithm for Constraint\n  Satisfaction Problems", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the so-called ppz algorithm for (d,k)-CSP problems for general\nvalues of d (number of values a variable can take) and k (number of literals\nper constraint).

In multirate anypath\nrouting, each node uses both a set of next hops and a selected transmission\nrate to reach a destination. Using this rate, a packet is broadcast to the\nnodes in the set and one of them forwards the packet on to the destination. To\ndate, there has been no theory capable of jointly optimizing both the set of\nnext hops and the transmission rate used by each node. We solve this by\nintroducing two polynomial-time routing algorithms and provide the proof of\ntheir optimality. The proposed algorithms run in roughly the same running time\nas regular shortest-path algorithms, and are therefore suitable for deployment\nin routing protocols. We conducted measurements in an 802.11b testbed network,\nand our trace-driven analysis shows that multirate anypath routing performs on\naverage 80% and up to 6.4 times better than anypath routing with a fixed rate\nof 11 Mbps. If the rate is fixed at 1 Mbps instead, performance improves by up\nto one order of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 09:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Laufer", "Rafael", ""], ["Dubois-Ferri\u00e8re", "Henri", ""], ["Kleinrock", "Leonard", ""]]}]
