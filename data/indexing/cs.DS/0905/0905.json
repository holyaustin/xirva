This paper presents an\nextensible parallel library for $N$-body interactions utilizing the FMM\nalgorithm, built on the framework of PETSc. A prominent feature of this library\nis that it is designed to be extensible, with a view to unifying efforts\ninvolving many algorithms based on the same principles as the FMM and enabling\neasy development of scientific application codes. The paper also details an\nexhaustive model for the computation of tree-based $N$-body algorithms in\nparallel, including both work estimates and communications estimates. With this\nmodel, we are able to implement a method to provide automatic, a priori load\nbalancing of the parallel execution, achieving optimal distribution of the\ncomputational work among processors and minimal inter-processor communications.\nUsing a client application that performs the calculation of velocity induced by\n$N$ vortex particles, ample verification and testing of the library was\nperformed. Strong scaling results are presented with close to a million\nparticles in up to 64 processors, including both speedup and parallel\nefficiency. The library is currently able to achieve over 85% parallel\nefficiency for 64 processors.

Especially in the case of Shellsort the uses of Kolmogorov\ncomplexity surprisingly easily resolved problems that had stayed open for a\nlong time despite strenuous attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2009 15:30:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Vitanyi", "Paul M.

We develop three approximation algorithms\nfor matrices with arbitrarily many rows. Our first two algorithms improve the\napproximation factor from the previous best of $1+\\log_2 h $ to (roughly) $3/2\n\\cdot (1+\\log_3 h)$ and $11/6\\cdot(1+\\log_4{h})$, respectively, where $h$ is\nthe largest entry in the intensity matrix. We illustrate the limitations of the\nspecific approach used to obtain these two algorithms by proving a lower bound\nof $\\frac{(2b-2)}{b}\\cdot\\log_b{h} + \\frac{1}{b}$ on the approximation\nguarantee. Our third algorithm improves the approximation factor from $2 \\cdot\n(\\log D+1)$ to $24/13 \\cdot (\\log D+1)$, where $D$ is (roughly) the largest\ndifference between consecutive elements of a row of the intensity matrix.\nFinally, experimentation with these algorithms shows that they perform well\nwith respect to the optimum and outperform other approximation algorithms on\n77% of the 122 test cases we consider, which include both real world and\nsynthetic data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 17:56:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2009 23:26:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Biedl", "Therese", ""], ["Durocher", "Stephane", ""], ["Hoos", "Holger H.", ""], ["Luan", "Shuang", ""], ["Saia", "Jared", ""], ["Young", "Maxwell", ""]]}]
