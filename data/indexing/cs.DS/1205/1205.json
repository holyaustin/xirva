This is the first exact algorithm that runs in time\nsingly-exponential in $r$. This algorithm (and earlier algorithms) are built on\nmethods for finding a solution to a system of polynomial inequalities (if one\nexists). Notably, the best algorithms for this task run in time exponential in\nthe number of variables but polynomial in all of the other parameters (the\nnumber of inequalities and the maximum degree).\n  Hence these algorithms motivate natural algebraic questions whose solution\nhave immediate {\\em algorithmic} implications: How many variables do we need to\nrepresent the decision problem, does $M$ have nonnegative rank at most $r$? A\nnaive formulation uses $nr + mr$ variables and yields an algorithm that is\nexponential in $n$ and $m$ even for constant $r$. (Arora, Ge, Kannan, Moitra,\nSTOC 2012) recently reduced the number of variables to $2r^2 2^r$, and here we\nexponentially reduce the number of variables to $2r^2$ and this yields our main\nalgorithm. In fact, the algorithm that we obtain is nearly-optimal (under the\nExponential Time Hypothesis) since an algorithm that runs in time $(nm)^{o(r)}$\nwould yield a subexponential algorithm for 3-SAT .\n  Our main result is based on establishing a normal form for nonnegative matrix\nfactorization - which in turn allows us to exploit algebraic dependence among a\nlarge collection of linear transformations with variable entries. Additionally,\nwe also demonstrate that nonnegative rank cannot be certified by even a very\nlarge submatrix of $M$, and this property also follows from the intuition\ngained from viewing nonnegative rank through the lens of systems of polynomial\ninequalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 22:26:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Moitra", "Ankur", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0144", "submitter": "Michael Dinitz", "authors": "Eden Chlamtac, Michael Dinitz, Robert Krauthgamer", "title": "Everywhere-Sparse Spanners via Dense Subgraphs", "comments": "39 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The significant progress in constructing graph spanners that are sparse\n(small number of edges) or light (low total weight) has skipped spanners that\nare everywhere-sparse (small maximum degree).

Marginal queries enable a\nrich class of statistical analyses of a dataset, and designing efficient\nalgorithms for privately releasing marginal queries has been identified as an\nimportant open problem in private data analysis (cf. Barak et. al., PODS '07).\n  We give an algorithm that runs in time $d^{O(\\sqrt{k})}$ and releases a\nprivate summary capable of answering any $k$-way marginal query with at most\n$\\pm .01$ error on every query as long as $n \\geq d^{O(\\sqrt{k})}$. To our\nknowledge, ours is the first algorithm capable of privately releasing marginal\nqueries with non-trivial worst-case accuracy guarantees in time substantially\nsmaller than the number of $k$-way marginal queries, which is $d^{\\Theta(k)}$\n(for $k \\ll d$).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2012 17:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2012 14:59:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Mar 2014 13:56:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Thaler", "Justin", ""], ["Ullman", "Jonathan", ""], ["Vadhan", "Salil", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.1900", "submitter": "Luisa Gargano", "authors": "Luisa Gargano, Adele A.

Here, the goal is to minimize the total power consumption of\nnodes, where the power of a node v is the maximum cost of any edge of S\nincident to v. Intuitively, nodes are antennas (part of which are terminals\nthat we need to connect) and edge costs define the power to connect their\nendpoints via bidirectional links (so as to support protocols with ack\nmessages). Differently from its min-cost counterpart, min-power Steiner tree is\nNP-hard even in the spanning tree case, i.e. when all nodes are terminals.\nSince the power of any tree is within once and twice its cost, computing a rho\n\\leq ln(4)+eps [Byrka et al.'10] approximate min-cost Steiner tree provides a\n2rho<2.78 approximation for the problem. For min-power spanning tree the same\napproach provides a 2 approximation, which was improved to 5/3+eps with a\nnon-trivial approach in [Althaus et al.'06]. Here we present an improved\napproximation algorithm for min-power Steiner tree. Our result is based on two\nmain ingredients. We prove the first decomposition theorem for min-power\nSteiner tree, in the spirit of analogous structural results for min-cost\nSteiner tree and min-power spanning tree. Based on this theorem, we define a\nproper LP relaxation, that we exploit within the iterative randomized rounding\nframework in [Byrka et al.'10]. A careful analysis provides a 3ln\n4-9/4+eps<1.91 approximation factor. The same approach gives an improved\n1.5+eps approximation for min-power spanning tree as well, matching the\napproximation factor in [Nutov and Yaroshevitch'09] for the special case of\nmin-power spanning tree with edge weights in {0,1}.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2012 09:16:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Grandoni", "Fabrizio", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.3728", "submitter": "Ignasi Sau", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet, Daniel Gon\\c{c}alves, George B.

In gossip, or more generally, $k$-gossip, there are $k$ pieces of\ninformation (or tokens) that are initially present in some nodes and the\nproblem is to disseminate the $k$ tokens to all nodes. We present a random-walk\nbased algorithm that runs in $\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{n^{1/3}k^{2/3}(\\tau \\Phi)^{1/3},\nnk\\})$ rounds (with high probability). To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first $o(nk)$-time fully-distributed token forwarding algorithm that\nimproves over the previous-best $O(nk)$ round distributed algorithm [Kuhn et\nal., STOC 2010], although in an oblivious adversary model.\n  Our final contribution is a simple and fast distributed algorithm for\nestimating the dynamic mixing time and related spectral properties of the\nunderlying dynamic network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2012 18:36:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sarma", "Atish Das", ""], ["Molla", "Anisur Rahaman", ""], ["Pandurangan", "Gopal", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.5653", "submitter": "Manuel Arora", "authors": "Manuel Arora, G\\'abor Ivanyos, Marek Karpinski, Nitin Saxena", "title": "Deterministic Polynomial Factoring and Association Schemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "LMS J.

In this paper\nwe consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such\nas certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at\nwill, but typically cannot add links without the other player's permission. In\nthe deletion-model players are free to delete any of their bidirectional links\nbut may not add links. We study the problem of determining whether the given\ngraph represents a Nash equilibrium or not in this model. We give an $O(n^{2})$\ntime algorithm for a tree, and a parametric $O(2^{k}n^{4})$ time algorithm for\ngeneral graphs, where $k$ is the maximum vertex degree in any biconnected\ncomponent of the graph. In the request- delete-model players are free to delete\nany bidirectional links and add any directed links, since these additions can\nbe done unilaterally and can be viewed as requests for bidirected links. For\nthis model we give an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in\ntrees. Finally, in the add-delete- model we allow a node to make arbitrary\ndeletions and the addition of a single bidirectional link if it would increase\nthe page rank of the other player also. In this model we give a parametric\nalgorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in general graphs and characterize so\ncalled $\\alpha$-insensitive Nash Equilibria.
