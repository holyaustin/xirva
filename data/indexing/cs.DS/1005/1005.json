The nodes in the\nnetwork are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks\ncan vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can\nobtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our\ngoal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node such that the\nlogical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain\nclose to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than\ndistant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.\n  Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting,\nwhere the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically\noptimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic\nsetting: if two nodes remain at distance $d$ from each other for sufficiently\nlong, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values\nby $O(d \\log (D / d))$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. This is known\nto be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm\nhas optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two\nnodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced\nto $O(d \\log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal.

In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory from\nthe perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework for\nobtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.\n  Two of the most widely used approaches to obtain PTASs on planar graphs are\nthe Lipton-Tarjan separator based approach, and Baker's approach. Demaine and\nHajiaghayi strengthened both approaches using bidimensionality and obtained\nEPTASs for a multitude of problems. We unify the two strenghtened approaches to\ncombine the best of both worlds. At the heart of our framework is a\ndecomposition lemma which states that for \"most\" bidimensional problems, there\nis a polynomial time algorithm which given an H-minor-free graph G as input and\nan e > 0 outputs a vertex set X of size e * OPT such that the treewidth of G n\nX is f(e). Here, OPT is the objective function value of the problem in question\nand f is a function depending only on e.
