The linear coloring of a graph $G$ is\na vertex coloring such that two vertices can be assigned the same color, if\ntheir corresponding clique sets are associated by the set inclusion relation (a\nclique set of a vertex $u$ is the set of all maximal cliques containing $u$);\nthe linear chromatic number $\\mathcal{\\lambda}(G)$ of $G$ is the least integer\n$k$ for which $G$ admits a linear coloring with $k$ colors. We show that linear\ngraphs are those graphs $G$ for which the linear chromatic number achieves its\ntheoretical lower bound in every induced subgraph of $G$. We prove inclusion\nrelations between these two classes of graphs and other subclasses of chordal\nand co-chordal graphs, and also study the structure of the forbidden induced\nsubgraphs of the class of linear graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jul 2008 12:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ioannidou", "Kyriaki", ""], ["Nikolopoulos", "Stavros D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4368", "submitter": "Dimitris Papamichail", "authors": "Dimitris Papamichail and Georgios Papamichail", "title": "Improved Algorithms for Approximate String Matching (Extended Abstract)", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of approximate string matching is important in many different\nareas such as computational biology, text processing and pattern recognition. A\ngreat effort has been made to design efficient algorithms addressing several\nvariants of the problem, including comparison of two strings, approximate\npattern identification in a string or calculation of the longest common\nsubsequence that two strings share.\n  We designed an output sensitive algorithm solving the edit distance problem\nbetween two strings of lengths n and m respectively in time\nO((s-|n-m|)min(m,n,s)+m+n) and linear space, where s is the edit distance\nbetween the two strings. This worst-case time bound sets the quadratic factor\nof the algorithm independent of the longest string length and improves existing\ntheoretical bounds for this problem. The implementation of our algorithm excels\nalso in practice, especially in cases where the two strings compared differ\nsignificantly in length.
