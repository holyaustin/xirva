The goal of the leader election\nproblem is to elect a unique leader from among distributed parties. The paper\nconsiders this problem for anonymous networks, in which each party has the same\nidentifier. It is well-known that no classical algorithm can solve exactly\n(i.e., in bounded time without error) the leader election problem in anonymous\nnetworks, even if it is given the number of parties. This paper gives two\nquantum algorithms that, given the number of parties, can exactly solve the\nproblem for any network topology in polynomial rounds and polynomial\ncommunication/time complexity with respect to the number of parties, when the\nparties are connected by quantum communication links.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2007 10:52:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tani", "Seiichiro", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hirotada", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Keiji", ""]]}]
