It has been shown that for a graph to be navigable, its\nconstruction needs to meet strict criteria. Since such graphs nevertheless seem\nto appear in nature, it is of interest to understand why these criteria should\nbe fulfilled.\n  In this paper we present a simple method for constructing graphs based on a\nmodel where nodes vertices are ``similar'' in two different ways, and tend to\nconnect to those most similar to them - or cluster - with respect to both. We\nprove that this leads to navigable networks for several cases, and hypothesize\nthat it also holds in great generality.
