In the offline case, I present a novel, heuristic, algorithm\nfor scheduling files with divisible sizes on multiple disjoint paths, in order\nto maximize the total profit (the problem is equivalent to the multiple\nknapsack problem with divisible item sizes). I then consider a cost\noptimization problem for transferring a sequence of identical files, subject to\ntime constraints imposed by the data transfer providers. For the online case I\npropose an algorithmic framework based on the block partitioning method, which\ncan speed up the process of resource allocation and reservation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jun 2008 07:16:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2012 08:42:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Andreica", "Mugurel Ionut", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4073", "submitter": "Frank Gurski", "authors": "Frank Gurski", "title": "A comparison of two approaches for polynomial time algorithms computing\n  basic graph parameters", "comments": "25 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we compare and illustrate the algorithmic use of graphs of\nbounded tree-width and graphs of bounded clique-width.
