Primary computational\nalgorithms are implemented for such problems using the pressure equation. In\nthis paper, we highlight the basic properties of the pressure problem and\ndiscuss the necessity of their fulfillment at the discrete level. The resulting\nelliptic problem for the pressure equation is characterized by a\nnon-selfadjoint operator.

Such and\nsimilar problems routinely arise in numerous areas of applied sciences,\nincluding optical imaging, laser interferometry, computer vision, remote\nsensing and control. Though being ill-posed in nature, the above problem can be\nsolved in a unique and stable manner, provided proper regularization and\nrelevant boundary conditions. In this paper, however, a more challenging setup\nis addressed, in which one has to recover an image of interest from its noisy\nand blurry version, while the only information available about the imaging\nsystem at hand is the amplitude of the generalized pupil function (GPF) along\nwith partial observations of the gradient of GPF's phase. In this case, the\nphase-related information is collected using a simplified version of the\nShack-Hartmann interferometer, followed by recovering the entire phase by means\nof derivative compressed sensing. Subsequently, the estimated phase can be\ncombined with the amplitude of the GPF to produce an estimate of the point\nspread function (PSF), whose knowledge is essential for subsequent image\ndeconvolution. In summary, the principal contribution of this work is twofold.\nFirst, we demonstrate how to simplify the construction of the Shack-Hartmann\ninterferometer so as to make it less expensive and hence more accessible.\nSecond, it is shown by means of numerical experiments that the above\nsimplification and its associated solution scheme produce image reconstructions\nof the quality comparable to those obtained using dense sampling of the GPF\nphase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 18:52:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rostami", "Mohammad", ""], ["Michailovich", "Oleg", ""], ["Wang", "Zhou", ""]]}]
