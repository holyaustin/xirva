Furthermore, we have\nestablished the fundamental characteristics of the derived ODEs, such as the\nexistence, uniqueness, boundedness and nonnegativeness of the solution. The\nconvergence of the solution as time tends to infinity for several classes of\nPEPA models, has been proved under some mild conditions. For general PEPA\nmodels, the convergence is proved under a particular condition, which has been\nrevealed to relate to some famous constants of Markov chains such as the\nspectral gap and the Log-Sobolev constant. This thesis has established the\nconsistency between the fluid approximation and the underlying CTMCs for PEPA,\ni.e. the limit of the solution is consistent with the equilibrium probability\ndistribution corresponding to a family of underlying density dependent CTMCs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Aug 2010 16:09:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Jie", ""], ["Hillston", "Jane", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.4870", "submitter": "Hassan Kingravi", "authors": "M.
