GIGAQBX is a fast\nhigh-order scheme for evaluation of layer potentials based on Quadrature by\nExpansion (`QBX') using local expansions formed via the Fast Multipole Method\n(FMM). Target-specific expansions serve to lower the cost of the formation and\nevaluation of QBX local expansions, reducing the associated computational\neffort from $O((p+1)^{2})$ to $O(p+1)$ in three dimensions, without any\naccuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of\nsource/target separation in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global'\nQBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated entirely through expansions\nfor points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global\nexpansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one part\nincorporating near-field contributions using target-specific expansions, and\none part using conventional spherical harmonic expansions of far-field\ncontributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the sum of the\ntwo sub-expansions. By contrast, target-specific expansions were originally\nintroduced as an acceleration mechanism for `local' QBX schemes, in which the\nfar-field does not contribute to the QBX expansion.

Given a large and dense matrix ${\\bf A} \\in \\mathbb R^{m \\times\nn}$ whose numerical rank is $k$, where $k$ is much smaller than $m$ and $n$,\nRRR-UZVD constructs an approximation $\\hat{\\bf A}$ such as $\\hat{\\bf A}={\\bf\nUZV}^T$, where ${\\bf U}$ and ${\\bf V}$ have orthonormal columns, the\nleading-diagonal block of ${\\bf Z}$ reveals the rank of $\\bf A$, and its\noff-diagonal blocks have small $\\ell_2$-norms. RRR-UZVD is simple, accurate,\nand only requires a few passes through $\\bf A$ with an arithmetic cost of\n$O(mnk)$ floating-point operations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, we conduct experiments on synthetic data, as well as real data\nin applications of image reconstruction and robust principal component\nanalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2018 04:50:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kaloorazi", "Maboud F.", ""], ["de Lamare", "Rodrigo C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.08631", "submitter": "Marco Tezzele", "authors": "Fabrizio Garotta, Nicola Demo, Marco Tezzele, Massimo Carraturo,\n  Alessandro Reali and Gianluigi Rozza", "title": "Reduced Order Isogeometric Analysis Approach for PDEs in Parametrized\n  Domains", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-48721-8_7", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this contribution, we coupled the isogeometric analysis to a reduced order\nmodelling technique in order to provide a computationally efficient solution in\nparametric domains.

The efficiency of strategies for finding optimal\nexperimental set-ups is particularly important for experiments that are\ntime-consuming or expensive to perform. For instance, in the situation when the\nexperiments are modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), multilevel\nmethods have been proven to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of\ntheir single-level counterparts when estimating expected values. For a setting\nwhere PDEs can model experiments, we propose two multilevel methods for\nestimating a popular design criterion known as the expected information gain in\nsimulation-based Bayesian optimal experimental design. The expected information\ngain criterion is of a nested expectation form, and only a handful of\nmultilevel methods have been proposed for problems of such form. We propose a\nMultilevel Double Loop Monte Carlo (MLDLMC), which is a multilevel strategy\nwith Double Loop Monte Carlo (DLMC), and a Multilevel Double Loop Stochastic\nCollocation (MLDLSC), which performs a high-dimensional integration by\ndeterministic quadrature on sparse grids. For both methods, the Laplace\napproximation is used for importance sampling that significantly reduces the\ncomputational work of estimating inner expectations. The optimal values of the\nmethod parameters are determined by minimizing the average computational work,\nsubject to satisfying the desired error tolerance. The computational\nefficiencies of the methods are demonstrated by estimating the expected\ninformation gain for Bayesian inference of the fiber orientation in composite\nlaminate materials from an electrical impedance tomography experiment.
