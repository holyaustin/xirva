The growth condition is satisfied in many applications\nand includes functions with quadratic growth and weakly sharp minima as special\ncases. To this end there are three main contributions. First, for a constant\nand sufficiently small stepsize, we show that the subgradient method achieves\nlinear convergence up to a certain region including the optimal set, with error\nof the order of the stepsize. Second, if appropriate problem parameters are\nknown, we derive a decaying stepsize which obtains a much faster convergence\nrate than is suggested by the classical $O(1/\\sqrt{k})$ result for the\nsubgradient method. Thirdly we develop a novel \"descending stairs\" stepsize\nwhich obtains this faster convergence rate and also obtains linear convergence\nfor the special case of weakly sharp functions. We also develop an adaptive\nvariant of the \"descending stairs\" stepsize which achieves the same convergence\nrate without requiring an error bound constant which is difficult to estimate\nin practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 16:28:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:33:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 21:34:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Johnstone", "Patrick R.", ""], ["Moulin", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.00568", "submitter": "Ajinkya Kadu", "authors": "Ajinkya Kadu, Tristan van Leeuwen and K.

First of all, agents use uncoordinated step-sizes, and\nthe stable upper bounds on step-sizes are independent of network topologies.\nThe step-sizes depend on local objective functions, and they can be as large as\nthose of the gradient descent. Secondly, for the special case without\nnon-smooth terms, linear convergence can be achieved under the strong convexity\nassumption. The dependence of the convergence rate on the objective functions\nand the network are separated, and the convergence rate of the new algorithm is\nas good as one of the two convergence rates that match the typical rates for\nthe general gradient descent and the consensus averaging.

While early\napproaches focused on matrix and vector based methods to represent these\nhigher-order data, more recently it has been shown that tensor decomposition\nmethods are better equipped to capture couplings across their different modes.\nFor these reasons, tensor decomposition methods have found applications in many\ndifferent signal processing problems including dimensionality reduction, signal\nseparation, linear regression, feature extraction, and classification. However,\nmost of the existing tensor decomposition methods are based on the principle of\nfinding a low-rank approximation in a linear subspace structure, where the\ndefinition of the rank may change depending on the particular decomposition.\nSince many datasets are not necessarily low-rank in a linear subspace, this\noften results in high approximation errors or low compression rates. In this\npaper, we introduce a new adaptive, multi-scale tensor decomposition method for\nhigher order data inspired by hybrid linear modeling and subspace clustering\ntechniques. In particular, we develop a multi-scale higher-order singular value\ndecomposition (MS-HoSVD) approach where a given tensor is first permuted and\nthen partitioned into several sub-tensors each of which can be represented as a\nlow-rank tensor with increased representational efficiency. The proposed\napproach is evaluated for dimensionality reduction and classification for\nseveral different real-life tensor signals with promising results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 14:02:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 16:07:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:48:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ozdemir", "Alp", ""], ["Zare", "Ali", ""], ["Iwen", "Mark A.", ""], ["Aviyente", "Selin", ""]]}]
