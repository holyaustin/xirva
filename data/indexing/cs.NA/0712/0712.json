An inner-shell of Canonical Momenta Indicators (CMI) is adaptively fit\nto incoming market data. A parameterized trading-rule outer-shell uses the\nglobal optimization code Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) to fit the trading\nsystem to historical data. A simple fitting algorithm, usually not requiring\nASA, is used for the inner-shell fit. An additional risk-management\nmiddle-shell has been added to create a three-shell recursive\noptimization/sampling/fitting algorithm. Portfolio-level distributions of\ncopula-transformed multivariate distributions (with constituent markets\npossessing different marginal distributions in returns space) are generated by\nMonte Carlo samplings. ASA is used to importance-sample weightings of these\nmarkets.\n  The core code, Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD), processes Training and\nTesting trading systems on historical data, and consistently interacts with\nRealTime trading platforms at minute resolutions, but this scale can be\nmodified. This approach transforms constituent probability distributions into a\ncommon space where it makes sense to develop correlations to further develop\nprobability distributions and risk/uncertainty analyses of the full portfolio.\nASA is used for importance-sampling these distributions and for optimizing\nsystem parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2007 18:11:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 03:32:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ingber", "Lester", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4126", "submitter": "Chandan Reddy", "authors": "Chandan K.

Optimization problems are inherent in machine learning\nalgorithms and hence many methods in machine learning were inherited from the\noptimization literature. Popularly known as the initialization problem, the\nideal set of parameters required will significantly depend on the given\ninitialization values. The recently developed TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under\nSTability-reTaining Equilibria CHaracterization) methodology systematically\nexplores the subspace of the parameters to obtain a complete set of local\noptimal solutions. In this thesis work, we propose TRUST-TECH based methods for\nsolving several optimization and machine learning problems. Two stages namely,\nthe local stage and the neighborhood-search stage, are repeated alternatively\nin the solution space to achieve improvements in the quality of the solutions.\nOur methods were tested on both synthetic and real datasets and the advantages\nof using this novel framework are clearly manifested. This framework not only\nreduces the sensitivity to initialization, but also allows the flexibility for\nthe practitioners to use various global and local methods that work well for a\nparticular problem of interest. Other hierarchical stochastic algorithms like\nevolutionary algorithms and smoothing algorithms are also studied and\nframeworks for combining these methods with TRUST-TECH have been proposed and\nevaluated on several test systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Dec 2007 03:14:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Reddy", "Chandan K.", ""]]}]
