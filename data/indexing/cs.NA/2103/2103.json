Alternative formulations using a partial differential\nequation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also\nbeen introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful\ndescriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new\nvariation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The\ndynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to\nincubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a\nnatural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering\nadvantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the\nneed for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed\nindividuals) to incorporate time delays.

Here, a phase-field formulation is used to\nresolve failure mechanisms by regularizing the sharp crack topology on the\nlocal state. The coupling of plasticity to the crack phase-field is realized by\na constitutive work density function, which is characterized through a degraded\nstored elastic energy and the accumulated dissipated energy due to plasticity\nand damage. Two different Global-Local approaches based on the idea of\nmultiplicative Schwarz' alternating method are proposed: (i) A global\nconstitutive model with an elastic-plastic behavior is first proposed, while it\nis enhanced with a single local domain, which, in turn, describes an\nelastic-plastic fracturing response. (ii) The main objective of the second\nmodel is to introduce an adoption of the Global-Local approach toward the\nmultilevel local setting. To this end, an elastic-plastic global constitutive\nmodel is augmented with two distinct local domains; in which, the first local\ndomain behaves as an elastic-plastic material and the next local domain is\nmodeled due to the fracture state. To further reduce the computational cost,\npredictor-corrector adaptivity within Global-Local concept is introduced. An\nadaptive scheme is devised through the evolution of the effective global\nplastic flow (for only elastic-plastic adaptivity), and through the evolution\nof the local crack phase-field state (for only fracture adaptivity). Thus, two\nlocal domains are dynamically updated during the computation, resulting with\ntwo-way adaptivity procedure. The overall response of the Global-Local approach\nin terms of accuracy/robustness and efficiency is verified using single-scale\nproblems.

Usual spaces, such\nas polynomial-based ones, cannot properly represent high-contrast channelized\nfeatures such as fractures (high permeability) and barriers (low permeability)\nfor flows in heterogeneous porous media. We propose here new interface spaces,\nwhich are based on physics, to deal with permeability fields in the\nsimultaneous presence of fractures and barriers, accommodated respectively, by\nthe pressure and flux spaces. Existing multiscale methods based on mixed\nformulations can take advantage of the proposed interface spaces, however, in\norder to present and test our results, we use the newly developed Multiscale\nRobin Coupled Method (MRCM) [Guiraldello, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 355 (2018)\npp. 1-21], which generalizes most well-known multiscale mixed methods, and\nallows for the independent choice of the pressure and flux interface spaces. An\nadaptive version of the MRCM [Rocha, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 409 (2020),\n109316] is considered that automatically selects the physics-based pressure\nspace for fractured structures and the physics-based flux space for regions\nwith barriers, resulting in a procedure with unprecedented accuracy. The\nfeatures of the proposed approach are investigated through several numerical\nsimulations of single-phase and two-phase flows, in different heterogeneous\nporous media. The adaptive MRCM combined with the interface spaces based on\nphysics provides promising results for challenging problems with the\nsimultaneous presence of fractures and barriers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:18:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Rocha", "Franciane F.", ""], ["Sousa", "Fabricio S.", ""], ["Ausas", "Roberto F.", ""], ["Pereira", "Felipe", ""], ["Buscaglia", "Gustavo C.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.07380", "submitter": "Adam Andrzej Sliwiak", "authors": "Adam A.

This hinders reproducibility of experimental results.\n  In this paper, we propose a way to reduce such differences by optimising the\nfilter used in analytical algorithms. These filters can be computed using a\nwrapper routine around a black-box implementation of a reconstruction\nalgorithm, and lead to quantitatively similar reconstructions. We demonstrate\nuse cases for our approach by computing implementation-adapted filters for\nseveral open-source implementations and applying it to simulated phantoms and\nreal-world data acquired at the synchrotron. Our contribution to a reproducible\nreconstruction step forms a building block towards a fully reproducible\nsynchrotron tomography data processing pipeline.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2021 11:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ganguly", "Poulami Somanya", ""], ["Pelt", "Dani\u00ebl M.", ""], ["G\u00fcrsoy", "Doga", ""], ["de Carlo", "Francesco", ""], ["Batenburg", "K.

However, this comes at a cost. Despite\nbeing mathematically equivalent, the $s$-step variant is known to behave quite\ndifferently in finite precision, with potential for greater loss of accuracy\nand a decrease in the convergence rate relative to the classical algorithm. It\nhas previously been shown that the errors that occur in the $s$-step version\nfollow the same structure as the errors in the classical algorithm, but with\nthe addition of an amplification factor that depends on the square of the\ncondition number of the $O(s)-$dimensional Krylov bases computed in each outer\nloop. As the condition number of these $s$-step bases grows (in some cases very\nquickly) with $s$, this limits the parameter $s$ that can be chosen and thus\nlimits the performance that can be achieved. In this work we show that if a\nselect few computations in $s$-step Lanczos are performed in double the working\nprecision, the error terms then depend only linearly on the conditioning of the\n$s$-step bases. This has the potential for drastically improving the numerical\nbehavior of the algorithm with little impact on per-iteration performance.

The interface is well defined as a\nsurface in form of a high-order polynomial, so-called the polynomial surface of\ninterface\n  (PSI). The THINC reconstruction function is then used to update the VOF field\nvia a finite volume method, and the level set field via a semi-Lagrangian\nmethod. Seeing the VOF field and the level set field as two different aspects\nof the THINC reconstruction function, the THINC-scaling scheme preserves at the\nsame time the advantages of both VOF and level set methods, i.e. the\nmass/volume conservation of the VOF method and the geometrical faithfulness of\nthe level set method, through a straightforward solution procedure. The\nTHINC-scaling scheme allows to represent an interface with high-order\npolynomials and has algorithmic simplicity which largely eases its\nimplementation in unstructured grids.

The proposed procedure is based on domain decomposition and combines\nthe Multiscale Perturbation Method (MPM) with the Multiscale Robin Coupled\nMethod (MRCM).

However, there are practical\nsituations where the load acting on the crack boundaries is singular.

As a result, it is promising that a\ncombination of a two-level domain decomposition preconditioner with inexact\nsubdomain solves could provide more economical and memory efficient numerical\nsolutions to large-scale Helmholtz problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 13:54:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bootland", "Niall", ""], ["Dwarka", "Vandana", ""], ["Jolivet", "Pierre", ""], ["Dolean", "Victorita", ""], ["Vuik", "Cornelis", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.17092", "submitter": "Ly Viet Hoang", "authors": "Ly Viet Hoang, Evgeny Spodarev", "title": "Inversion of $\\alpha$-sine and $\\alpha$-cosine transforms on\n  $\\mathbb{R}$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1361-6420/ac1327", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.FA cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the $\\alpha$-sine transform of the form $T_\\alpha\nf(y)=\\int_0^\\infty\\vert\\sin(xy)\\vert^\\alpha f(x)dx$ for $\\alpha>-1$, where $f$\nis an integrable function on $\\mathbb{R}_+$.
