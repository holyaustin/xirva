The lack of convenience\noften prevents these alternatives from replacing classical spectral methods -\neven in applications that suffer from the limitation of static resolution.\n  This work demonstrates that, contrary to the generally accepted belief, the\nFourier Transform can be generalized to the case of adaptive resolution.

This is useful for certain numerical algorithms\nthat prefer such primal-dual mesh pairs. We prove that well-centered meshes\nalso have optimality properties and relationships to Delaunay and minmax angle\ntriangulations. We present an iterative algorithm that seeks to transform a\ngiven triangulation in two or three dimensions into a well-centered one by\nminimizing a cost function and moving the interior vertices while keeping the\nmesh connectivity and boundary vertices fixed. The cost function is a direct\nresult of a new characterization of well-centeredness in arbitrary dimensions\nthat we present. Ours is the first optimization-based heuristic for\nwell-centeredness, and the first one that applies in both two and three\ndimensions. We show the results of applying our algorithm to small and large\ntwo-dimensional meshes, some with a complex boundary, and obtain a\nwell-centered tetrahedralization of the cube. We also show numerical evidence\nthat our algorithm preserves gradation and that it improves the maximum and\nminimum angles of acute triangulations created by the best known previous\nmethod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Feb 2008 23:04:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2009 21:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Aug 2009 16:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["VanderZee", "Evan", ""], ["Hirani", "Anil N.", ""], ["Guoy", "Damrong", ""], ["Ramos", "Edgar", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.2856", "submitter": "Pascal Weil", "authors": "Javier Esparza, Stefan Kiefer, Michael Luttenberger", "title": "Convergence Thresholds of Newton's Method for Monotone Polynomial\n  Equations", "comments": "version 2 deposited February 29, after the end of the STACS\n  conference.

The question of\ncomputing the least non-negative solution of a given MSPE $\\vec X = \\vec f(\\vec\nX)$ arises naturally in the analysis of stochastic models such as stochastic\ncontext-free grammars, probabilistic pushdown automata, and back-button\nprocesses. Etessami and Yannakakis have recently adapted Newton's iterative\nmethod to MSPEs. In a previous paper we have proved the existence of a\nthreshold $k_{\\vec f}$ for strongly connected MSPEs, such that after $k_{\\vec\nf}$ iterations of Newton's method each new iteration computes at least 1 new\nbit of the solution. However, the proof was purely existential. In this paper\nwe give an upper bound for $k_{\\vec f}$ as a function of the minimal component\nof the least fixed-point $\\mu\\vec f$ of $\\vec f(\\vec X)$. Using this result we\nshow that $k_{\\vec f}$ is at most single exponential resp. linear for strongly\nconnected MSPEs derived from probabilistic pushdown automata resp. from\nback-button processes. Further, we prove the existence of a threshold for\narbitrary MSPEs after which each new iteration computes at least $1/w2^h$ new\nbits of the solution, where $w$ and $h$ are the width and height of the DAG of\nstrongly connected components.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2008 14:24:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 07:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Esparza", "Javier", ""], ["Kiefer", "Stefan", ""], ["Luttenberger", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3013", "submitter": "Denys Dutykh Mr.", "authors": "Frederic Dias (1), Denys Dutykh (1), Jean-Michel Ghidaglia (1) ((1)\n  CMLA, ENS de Cachan)", "title": "Simulation of Free Surface Compressible Flows Via a Two Fluid Model", "comments": "8 pages, 10 figures; OMAE2008, 27th International Conference on\n  Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering.
