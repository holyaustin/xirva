This problem\naggregates two existing problems: (i) nonnegative matrix factorization where\nall entries of M are given, and (ii) low-rank matrix completion where\nnonnegativity is not required. By taking the advantages of both nonnegativity\nand low-rankness, one can generally obtain superior results than those of just\nusing one of the two properties. We propose to solve the non-convex constrained\nleast-squares problem using an algorithm based on the classic alternating\ndirection augmented Lagrangian method. Preliminary convergence properties of\nthe algorithm and numerical simulation results are presented. Compared to a\nrecent algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization, the proposed algorithm\nproduces factorizations of similar quality using only about half of the matrix\nentries. On tasks of recovering incomplete grayscale and hyperspectral images,\nthe proposed algorithm yields overall better qualities than those produced by\ntwo recent matrix-completion algorithms that do not exploit nonnegativity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Mar 2011 22:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Dec 2011 22:43:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Yangyang", ""], ["Yin", "Wotao", ""], ["Wen", "Zaiwen", ""], ["Zhang", "Yin", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.2056", "submitter": "Yaroslav Sergeyev", "authors": "Yaroslav D.
