PDE-constrained optimization is used to determine\nunknown parameters in a wave equation that represent geophysical properties.\nThe objective function measures the misfit between the observed data and the\ncalculated synthetic data, and it has traditionally been the least-squares\nnorm. In a sequence of papers, we introduced the Wasserstein metric from\noptimal transport as an alternative misfit function for mitigating the\nso-called cycle skipping, which is the trapping of the optimization process in\nlocal minima. In this paper, we first give a sharper theorem regarding the\nconvexity of the Wasserstein metric as the objective function. We then focus on\ntwo new issues. One is the necessary normalization of turning seismic signals\ninto probability measures such that the theory of optimal transport applies.\nThe other, which is beyond cycle skipping, is the inversion for parameters\nbelow reflecting interfaces. For the first, we propose a class of\nnormalizations and prove several favorable properties for this class. For the\nlatter, we demonstrate that FWI using optimal transport can recover geophysical\nproperties from domains where no seismic waves travel through. We finally\nillustrate these properties by the realistic application of imaging salt\ninclusions, which has been a significant challenge in exploration geophysics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:24:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:34:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 20:10:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Engquist", "Bjorn", ""], ["Yang", "Yunan", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00074", "submitter": "Victor DeCaria", "authors": "Victor DeCaria and Michael Schneier", "title": "An embedded variable step IMEX scheme for the incompressible\n  Navier-Stokes equations", "comments": "25 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cma.2020.113661", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This report presents a series of implicit-explicit (IMEX) variable timestep\nalgorithms for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSE).

To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear\nequation for the prognostic variables has to be solved at every timestep.

Numerical results are reported to confirm the efficiency of the\nproposed preconditioner and to show that the generalization improves the\nperformance of block circulant preconditioner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2020 03:43:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2021 03:10:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "X. -L.", ""], ["Ng", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.01181", "submitter": "Matthias Kunik Dr.", "authors": "Matthias Kunik, Hailiang Liu, Gerald Warnecke", "title": "Radially symmetric solutions of the ultra-relativistic Euler equations", "comments": "25 pages, 11 figures, in part in color.

A solution is to use randomized low-rank\nmatrix approximation methods such as randomized SVD , and randomized LU\ndecomposition on extremely large data sets. In this paper, we focus on the\nrandomized LU decomposition method. First, we employ a reorthogonalization\nprocedure to perform the power iteration of the existing randomized LU\nalgorithm to compensate for the rounding errors caused by the power method.\nThen we propose a novel randomized LU algorithm, called PowerLU, for the fixed\nlow-rank approximation problem. PowerLU allows for an arbitrary number of\npasses of the input matrix, $v \\geq 2$. Recall that the existing randomized LU\ndecomposition only allows an even number of passes. We prove the theoretical\nrelationship between PowerLU and the existing randomized LU. Numerical\nexperiments show that our proposed PowerLU is generally faster than the\nexisting randomized LU decomposition, while remaining accurate. We also propose\na version of PowerLU, called PowerLU_FP, for the fixed precision low-rank\nmatrix approximation problem. PowerLU_FP is based on an efficient blocked\nadaptive rank determination Algorithm 4.1 proposed in this paper. We present\nnumerical experiments that show that PowerLU_FP can achieve almost the same\naccuracy and is faster than the randomized blocked QB algorithm by Martinsson\nand Voronin. We finally propose a single-pass algorithm based on LU\nfactorization. Tests show that the accuracy of our single-pass algorithm is\ncomparable with the existing single-pass algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 18:56:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Bolong", ""], ["Mascagni", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.07148", "submitter": "Sai Sidhardh", "authors": "Sai Sidhardh, Sansit Patnaik, and Fabio Semperlotti", "title": "Geometrically Nonlinear Response of a Fractional-Order Nonlocal Model of\n  Elasticity", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2001.06885 In\n  the updated version Figures 3 and 9, additional details in section 4.3 and\n  appendix 1 were added following comments from reviewers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2020.103529", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This study presents the analytical and finite element formulation of a\ngeometrically nonlinear and fractional-order nonlocal model of an\nEuler-Bernoulli beam.

The second technique is an extension of the\nhyperbolic Generalized Lagrangian Multiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning\napproach, forwarded by Munz et al in applications to the Maxwell and MHD\nequations.\n  We solve the resulting nonconservative hyperbolic PDE systems with high order\nADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with a posteriori Finite Volume\nsubcell limiting and carry out a set of numerical tests concerning flows\ndominated by surface tension as well as shock-driven flows. We also provide a\nnew exact solution to the equations, show convergence of the schemes for orders\nof accuracy up to ten in space and time, and investigate the role of\nhyperbolicity and of curl constraints in the long-term stability of the\ncomputations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:54:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chiocchetti", "Simone", ""], ["Peshkov", "Ilya", ""], ["Gavrilyuk", "Sergey", ""], ["Dumbser", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.08831", "submitter": "Don March", "authors": "Don March and Vandy Tombs", "title": "Efficiently updating a covariance matrix and its LDL decomposition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA stat.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Equations are presented which efficiently update or downdate the covariance\nmatrix of a large number of $m$-dimensional observations.

The\nimproved computational efficiency of the Newton's method originates from the\nusage of the electrostatic potential as the iteration variable, rather than the\nunknowns of the nonlinear system that involves both the potential and\nconcentration of multiple ionic species. Numerical analysis proves that the\nnumerical schemes respect three desired analytical properties (conservation,\npositivity preserving, and energy dissipation) fully discretely. Based on\nadvantages brought by the harmonic-mean approximations, we are able to\nestablish estimate on the upper bound of condition numbers of coefficient\nmatrices in linear systems that are solved iteratively. The solvability and\nstability of the linearized problem in the Newton's method are rigorously\nestablished as well. Numerical tests are performed to confirm the anticipated\nnumerical accuracy, computational efficiency, and structure-preserving\nproperties of the developed schemes. Adaptive time stepping is implemented for\nfurther efficiency improvement. Finally, the proposed numerical approaches are\napplied to characterize ion transport subject to a sinusoidal applied\npotential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 16:03:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Jie", ""], ["Wang", "Zhongming", ""], ["Zhou", "Shenggao", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.09600", "submitter": "Shousheng Luo", "authors": "Shousheng Luo and Xue-Cheng Tai and Yang Wang", "title": "Convex Shape Representation with Binary Labels for Image Segmentation:\n  Models and Fast Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.CV cs.NA eess.IV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel and effective binary representation for convex shapes.

The mixture is governed by a filter function $F$ and by a switching\nparameter $\\varepsilon^n=\\varepsilon^n({\\Delta t,\\Delta x})>0$ which goes to 0\nas $(\\Delta t,\\Delta x)$ is going to 0. The adaptivity is related to the\nsmoothness indicators and allows to tune automatically the switching parameter\n$\\varepsilon^n_j$ in time and space. Several numerical tests on critical\nsituations in 1D and 2D are presented and confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed indicators and the efficiency of our scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:52:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Falcone", "Maurizio", ""], ["Paolucci", "Giulio", ""], ["Tozza", "Silvia", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.10811", "submitter": "Angel Duran", "authors": "Eduardo Abreu, Angel Dur\\'an", "title": "On the use of spectral discretizations with time strong stability\n  preserving properties to Dirichlet pseudo-parabolic problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with the approximation of linear and\nnonlinearinitial-boundary-value problems of pseudo-parabolic equations with\nDirichlet boundary conditions.

Such methods aim at accelerating the convergence\nof any fixed-point iteration method by combining several previous iterates in\norder to generate the next one at each step. The size of the set of stored\niterates is characterised by its depth, which is a crucial parameter for the\nefficiency of the process. It is generally fixed to an empirical value in most\napplications. In the present work, we consider two parameter-driven mechanisms\nto let the depth vary along the iterations. One way to do so is to let the set\ngrow until the stored iterates (save for the last one) are discarded and the\nmethod \"restarts\". Another way is to \"adapt\" the depth by eliminating some of\nthe older, less relevant, iterates at each step. In an abstract and general\nsetting, we prove under natural assumptions the local convergence and\nacceleration of these two types of Anderson-Pulay acceleration methods and\ndemonstrate how to theoretically achieve a superlinear convergence rate.
