Researchers have begun to\nconnect DPP sampling to $LDL^H$ factorizations as a means of avoiding the\ninitial spectral decomposition, but existing approaches have only outperformed\nthe spectral decomposition approach in special circumstances, where the number\nof kept modes is a small percentage of the ground set size.\n  This article proves that trivial modifications of $LU$ and $LDL^H$\nfactorizations yield efficient direct sampling schemes for non-Hermitian and\nHermitian DPP kernels, respectively. Further, it is experimentally shown that\neven dynamically-scheduled, shared-memory parallelizations of high-performance\ndense and sparse-direct factorizations can be trivially modified to yield DPP\nsampling schemes with essentially identical performance.\n  The software developed as part of this research, Catamari,\nhttps://hodgestar.com/catamari, is released under the Mozilla Public License\nv2.0.

To motivate our\nideas, we present examples of problems that are discontinuous at a given input\nand have infinite classical and stochastic condition number, but where the\nsolution is still computed to machine precision without relying on structured\nalgorithms. Stimulated by the failure of classical and stochastic perturbation\ntheory in capturing such phenomena, we define and analyse a weak worst-case and\na weak stochastic condition number. This new theory is a more powerful\npredictor of the accuracy of computations than existing tools, especially when\nthe worst-case and the expected sensitivity of a problem to perturbations of\nthe input is not finite. We apply our analysis to the computation of simple\neigenvalues of matrix polynomials, including the more difficult case of\nsingular matrix polynomials. In addition, we show how the weak condition\nnumbers can be estimated in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2019 08:59:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2020 13:41:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lotz", "Martin", ""], ["Noferini", "Vanni", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.05802", "submitter": "Zhibao Zheng", "authors": "Zhibao Zheng", "title": "A sample-based spectral method approach for solving high-dimensional\n  SPDEs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Uncertainty quantification appears today as a crucial point in numerous\nbranches of science and engineering. In the past two decades, a growing\ninterest has been devoted to stochastic finite element method (SFEM) for the\npropagation of uncertainties through physical models governed by stochastic\npartial differential equations (SPDEs). Despite its success and applications,\nthe SFEM is mainly limited to small-scale and low-dimensional stochastic\nproblems due to the extreme computational cost. In this article, by developing\nan universal construct of stochastic solution and a general algorithm for\nlinear/nonlinear SFE equation, we explore a new strategy for the solution of\nhigh-dimensional stochastic problems, where stochastic problems are transformed\ninto deterministic problems and stochastic algebraic equations. Since\ncomputational cost is almost proportional to the stochastic dimensionality of\nthe problem, our method beats the so-called Curse of Dimensionality with great\nsuccess. Numerical examples, including linear, nonlinear and high-dimensional\nstochastic problems, are used to demonstrate the method.

To this end, we propose a novel statistical construction of the\nfinite element method that provides the means of synthesising measurement data\nand finite element models. The Bayesian statistical framework is adopted to\ntreat all the uncertainties present in the data, the mathematical model and its\nfinite element discretisation. From the outset, we postulate a data-generating\nmodel which additively decomposes data into a finite element, a model\nmisspecification and a noise component. Each of the components may be uncertain\nand is considered as a random variable with a respective prior probability\ndensity. The prior of the finite element component is given by a conventional\nstochastic forward problem. The prior probabilities of the model\nmisspecification and measurement noise, without loss of generality, are assumed\nto have zero-mean and known covariance structure. Our proposed statistical\nmodel is hierarchical in the sense that each of the three random components may\ndepend on non-observable random hyperparameters. Because of the hierarchical\nstructure of the statistical model, Bayes rule is applied on three different\nlevels in turn to infer the posterior densities of the three random components\nand hyperparameters. On level one, we determine the posterior densities of the\nfinite element component and the true system response using the prior finite\nelement density given by the forward problem and the data likelihood. On the\nnext level, we infer the hyperparameter posterior densities from their\nrespective priors and the marginal likelihood of the first inference problem.\nFinally, on level three we use Bayes rule to choose the most suitable finite\nelement model in light of the observed data by computing the model posteriors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2019 19:00:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:35:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2021 12:30:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Girolami", "Mark", ""], ["Febrianto", "Eky", ""], ["Yin", "Ge", ""], ["Cirak", "Fehmi", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.06395", "submitter": "Juan Pablo Borthagaray", "authors": "Juan Pablo Borthagaray, Wenbo Li, Ricardo H.

The first one, named DuFort-Frankel (DF), is the\nclassical heat diffusion equation combined with the DuFort-Frankel numerical\nscheme. The second is the so-called RC lumped approach, based on a simple\nordinary differential equation to compute the temperature within the wall. The\nreliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of\nobservations are generated using a pseudo-spectral numerical model for the heat\ndiffusion equation with known input parameters. The results are then modified\nby adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements. Then, for each sample\nof observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the two\nmathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the\napproach to recover the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered\nfor the estimation of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal conductivity or\n(iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the wall and the\nambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory\nreliability to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the\nRC model lacks of fidelity and reliability.
