A\nnew density-matrix-based algorithm has been proposed recently and a software\npackage FEAST has been developed. The density-matrix approach allows FEAST's\nimplementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer architectures,\nnamely, multiple levels of parallelism. Consequently, the software package has\nbeen well received, especially in the electronic structure community.\nNevertheless, theoretical analysis of FEAST has lagged. For instance, the FEAST\nalgorithm has not been proven to converge. This paper offers a detailed\nnumerical analysis of FEAST. In particular, we show that the FEAST algorithm\ncan be understood as an accelerated subspace iteration algorithm in conjunction\nwith the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. The novelty of FEAST lies in its accelerator\nwhich is a rational matrix function that approximates the spectral projector\nonto the eigenspace in question. Analysis of the numerical nature of this\napproximate spectral projector and the resulting subspaces generated in the\nFEAST algorithm establishes the algorithm's convergence. This paper shows that\nFEAST is resilient against rounding errors and establishes properties that can\nbe leveraged to enhance the algorithm's robustness. Finally, we propose an\nextension of FEAST to handle non-Hermitian problems and suggest some future\nresearch directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Feb 2013 22:30:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 14:55:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 18:41:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 02:18:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Ping Tak Peter", ""], ["Polizzi", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.1161", "submitter": "Julian Rimoli", "authors": "Julian J.
