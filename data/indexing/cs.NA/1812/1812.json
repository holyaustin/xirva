Adaptive\nsparse grid approximations are an established approach to overcome these\nchallenges. However, standard adaptivity is based on global information, thus\nproperties such as lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality or anisotropic\ncoupling of the input directions, which are common in practical applications,\nare not fully exploited. We propose a novel structure-exploiting\ndimension-adaptive sparse grid approximation methodology using Sobol'\ndecompositions in each subspace to introduce a sensitivity scoring system to\ndrive the adaptive process. By employing local sensitivity information, we\nexplore and exploit the anisotropic coupling of the stochastic inputs as well\nas the lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality. The proposed approach is\ngeneric, i.e., it can be formulated in terms of arbitrary approximation\noperators and point sets. In particular, we consider sparse grid interpolation\nand pseudo-spectral projection constructed on (L)-Leja sequences. The power and\nusefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to the\nanalysis of gyrokinetic microinstabilities in fusion plasmas, one of the key\nscientific problems in plasma physics and fusion research. In this context, it\nis shown that a 12D parameter space can be scanned very efficiently, gaining\nmore than an order of magnitude in computational cost over the standard\nadaptive approach. Moreover, it allows for the uncertainty propagation and\nsensitivity analysis in higher-dimensional plasma microturbulence problems,\nwhich would be almost impossible to tackle with standard screening approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 22:41:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:28:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Farcas", "Ionut-Gabriel", ""], ["G\u00f6rler", "Tobias", ""], ["Bungartz", "Hans-Joachim", ""], ["Jenko", "Frank", ""], ["Neckel", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.00272", "submitter": "Andrea Aspri", "authors": "Andrea Aspri, Sebastian Banert, Ozan \\\"Oktem, Otmar Scherzer", "title": "A data-driven iteratively regularized Landweber iteration", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/01630563.2020.1740734", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive and analyse a new variant of the iteratively regularized Landweber\niteration, for solving linear and nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems.

The singularity\nremoval is based on a solution splitting of the reservoir pressure, where it is\ndecomposed into two terms: an explicitly given, lower regularity term capturing\nthe solution singularity and some smooth background pressure. The singularities\ncan then be removed from the system by subtracting them from the governing\nequations. Finally, the coupled 1D-3D flow equations can be reformulated so\nthey are given in terms of the well pressure and the background reservoir\npressure.

The hydraulic fracture model is based on\nthe poroelastic formulation of the displacement discontinuity method (DDM)\nwhich is a special formulation of the boundary element method (BEM). DDM is a\npowerful and efficient method for problems involving fractures. However, this\nmethod becomes slow as the number of temporal, or spatial elements increases,\nor necessary details such as poroelasticity, that makes the solution\nhistory-dependent, are added to the model. FMM is a technique to expedite\nmatrix-vector multiplications within a controllable error without forming the\nmatrix explicitly. Fully-coupled poroelastic formulation of DDM involves the\nmultiplication of a dense matrix with a vector in several places. A crucial\nmodification to DDM is suggested in two places in the algorithm to leverage the\nspeed efficiency of FMM for carrying out these multiplications. The first\nmodification is in the time-marching scheme, which accounts for the solution of\nprevious time steps to compute the current time step. The second modification\nis in the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) to iteratively solve for\nthe problem unknowns.

The immersed boundary(IB) method is a widely recognized and\neffective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure interaction(FSI) in\nsuch systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation is that the pressure and\nviscous stress are generally discontinuous at the interface. The conventional\nIB method regularizes these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order\naccuracy at these interfaces. The immersed interface method(IIM) is an IB-like\napproach to FSI that sharply imposes stress jump conditions, enabling\nhigher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely\nrestricted to methods that rely on smooth representations of the interface\ngeometry. This paper introduces an IIM that uses only a C0 representation of\nthe interface,such as those provided by standard nodal Lagrangian FE methods.\nVerification examples for models with prescribed motion demonstrate that the\nmethod sharply resolves stress discontinuities along the IB while avoiding the\nneed for analytic information of the interface geometry. We demonstrate that\nonly the lowest-order jump conditions for the pressure and velocity gradient\nare required to realize global 2nd-order accuracy. Specifically,we show\n2nd-order global convergence rate along with nearly 2nd-order local convergence\nin the Eulerian velocity, and between 1st-and 2nd-order global convergence\nrates along with 1st-order local convergence for the Eulerian pressure. We also\nshow 2nd-order local convergence in the interfacial displacement and velocity\nalong with 1st-order local convergence in the fluid traction.

We\nstudy two variants that are based on non-reversible Langevin diffusions: the\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) and the Langevin dynamics with a\nnon-symmetric drift (NLD).

Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for\nthe entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of\nboundary conditions are coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable\ndiscrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy\nestimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are\nweakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a\nsimultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables\nand the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation\noperators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators), on high-order\nunstructured grids, are used for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness\nand efficacy of the new procedure for weakly enforcing boundary conditions.\nNumerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed\ntechnique, with applications to three-dimensional subsonic and supersonic\nflows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm\nsummation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite\ndifference, finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction\nschemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 17:28:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2019 09:48:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2019 13:11:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Dalcin", "Lisandro", ""], ["Rojas", "Diego B.", ""], ["Zampini", "Stefano", ""], ["Fernandez", "David C.

These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate\nbetween releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire\naction potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute\nanalytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the\naverage neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the\nconcentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is\nindependent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first\nterm is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural\nfiring correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The\nsecond term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order.\nInterestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild\nassumptions.
