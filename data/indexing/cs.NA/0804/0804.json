In compressed sensing we are interested in finding the\nsparsest solution to the system of equations A x = y for a given y. In general,\nwhenever the sparsity of x is smaller than half the dimension of y then with\noverwhelming probability over A the sparsest solution is unique and can be\nfound by an exhaustive search over x with an exponential time complexity for\nany y. The recent work of Cand\\'es, Donoho, and Tao shows that minimization of\nthe L_1 norm of x subject to A x = y results in the sparsest solution provided\nthe sparsity of x, say K, is smaller than a certain threshold for a given\nnumber of measurements. Specifically, if the dimension of y approaches the\ndimension of x, the sparsity of x should be K < 0.239 N. Here, we consider the\ncase where x is d-block sparse, i.e., x consists of n = N / d blocks where each\nblock is either a zero vector or a nonzero vector. Instead of L_1-norm\nrelaxation, we consider the following relaxation min x \\| X_1 \\|_2 + \\| X_2\n\\|_2 + ... + \\| X_n \\|_2, subject to A x = y where X_i = (x_{(i-1)d+1},\nx_{(i-1)d+2}, ..., x_{i d}) for i = 1,2, ..., N. Our main result is that as n\n-> \\infty, the minimization finds the sparsest solution to Ax = y, with\noverwhelming probability in A, for any x whose block sparsity is k/n < 1/2 -\nO(\\epsilon), provided M/N > 1 - 1/d, and d = \\Omega(\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon).\nThe relaxation can be solved in polynomial time using semi-definite\nprogramming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2008 23:00:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Stojnic", "Mihailo", ""], ["Parvaresh", "Farzad", ""], ["Hassibi", "Babak", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0581", "submitter": "Oliver Schuetze", "authors": "Oliver Schuetze (INRIA Futurs), Carlos A.

The aim of this paper is to take the\nFrequency Analysis a step further. It will be shown that keeping the same\nreconstruction algorithm as the Fourier Theorem but changing to a new computing\nmethod for the analysis phase allows the generalization of the Fourier Theorem\nto a large class of nonorthogonal bases. New methods and algorithms can be\nemployed in function decomposition on such generic bases. It will be shown that\nthese algorithms are a generalization of the Fourier analysis, i.e. they are\nreduced to the familiar Fourier tools when using orthogonal bases. The\ndifferences between this tool and the wavelets and frames theories will be\ndiscussed.

It will be shown that, thanks to the novel\niterative analysis, any function satisfying a rather loose requisite is\nontologically a basis. This in turn generalizes the polar version of the\nFourier theorem to an ample class of nonorthogonal bases. The main advantage of\nthis generalization is that it inherits some of the properties of the original\nFourier theorem. As a result the new transform has a wide range of applications\nand some remarkable consequences. The new tool will be compared with wavelets\nand frames.
