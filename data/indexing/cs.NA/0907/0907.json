This\nallows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where\ndifferent scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of\nthe Markov chain. The proposed method exploits the Riemannian structure of the\nparameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the\nlocal manifold structure at each step based on the metric tensor. A\nsemi-explicit second order symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonians\nis derived for simulating paths across this manifold which provides highly\nefficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of\nthe Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is assessed by\nperforming posterior inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox\npoint processes, stochastic volatility models, and Bayesian estimation of\nparameter posteriors of dynamical systems described by nonlinear differential\nequations. Substantial improvements in the time normalised Effective Sample\nSize are reported when compared to alternative sampling approaches.

Each unknown vector passes through a different\nsystem matrix and the results are added to yield a single observation vector.\nGiven the matrices and lone observation, the objective is to find a\nsimultaneously sparse set of unknown vectors that solves the system. We will\nrefer to this as the multiple-system single-output (MSSO) simultaneous sparsity\nproblem. This manuscript contrasts the MSSO problem with other simultaneous\nsparsity problems and conducts a thorough initial exploration of algorithms\nwith which to solve it. Seven algorithms are formulated that approximately\nsolve this NP-Hard problem. Three greedy techniques are developed (matching\npursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and least squares matching pursuit) along\nwith four methods based on a convex relaxation (iteratively reweighted least\nsquares, two forms of iterative shrinkage, and formulation as a second-order\ncone program). The algorithms are evaluated across three experiments: the first\nand second involve sparsity profile recovery in noiseless and noisy scenarios,\nrespectively, while the third deals with magnetic resonance imaging\nradio-frequency excitation pulse design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2009 01:38:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zelinski", "Adam C.", ""], ["Goyal", "Vivek K", ""], ["Adalsteinsson", "Elfar", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.2423", "submitter": "Afra Zomorodian", "authors": "Gunnar Carlsson, Gurjeet Singh, and Afra Zomorodian", "title": "Computing Multidimensional Persistence", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.
