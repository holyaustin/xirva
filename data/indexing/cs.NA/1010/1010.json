The method uses an embedded boundary\napproach on staggered Cartesian grids, avoiding the need for expensive\nremeshing operations, and can be applied to flows in both two and three\ndimensions. It uses fully implicit backwards Euler integration to provide\nstability and supports spatially varying density and viscosity, while requiring\nthe solution of just a single sparse, symmetric positive-definite linear system\nper time step. By expressing the problem in a variational form, challenging\nirregular domains are supported implicitly through the use of natural boundary\nconditions. In practice, the discretization requires only centred finite\ndifference stencils and per-cell volume fractions, and is straightforward to\nimplement. The variational form further permits generalizations to coupling\nother mechanics, all the while reducing to a sparse symmetric positive definite\nmatrix. We demonstrate consistent first order convergence of velocity in L1 and\nLinf norms on a range of analytical test cases in two dimensions. Furthermore,\nwe apply our method as part of a simple Navier-Stokes solver to illustrate that\nit can reproduce the characteristic jet buckling phenomenon of Newtonian\nliquids at moderate viscosities, in both two and three dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Oct 2010 06:07:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 23:33:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Batty", "Christopher", ""], ["Bridson", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5290", "submitter": "Andri Mirzal", "authors": "Andri Mirzal", "title": "Converged Algorithms for Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations", "comments": "55 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes uni-orthogonal and bi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix\nfactorization algorithms with robust convergence proofs.
