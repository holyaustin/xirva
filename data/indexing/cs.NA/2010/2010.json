The transient\nconvection-diffusion problem leads to issues in classical FE methods as the\ndifferential operator can be considered singular perturbation in both space and\ntime. The unconditional stability of the AVS-FE method, regardless of the\nunderlying differential operator, allows us significant flexibility in the\nconstruction of FE approximations. We take two distinct approaches to the FE\ndiscretization of the convection-diffusion problem: i) considering a space-time\napproach in which the temporal discretization is established using finite\nelements, and ii) a method of lines approach in which we employ the AVS-FE\nmethod in space whereas the temporal domain is discretized using the\ngeneralized-alpha method. In the generalized-alpha method, we discretize the\ntemporal domain into finite sized time-steps and adopt the generalized-alpha\nmethod as time integrator. Then, we derive a corresponding norm for the\nobtained operator to guarantee the temporal stability of the method.\n  We present numerical verifications for both approaches, including numerical\nasymptotic convergence studies highlighting optimal convergence properties.\nFurthermore, in the spirit of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method by\nDemkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, the AVS-FE method also leads to readily available\na posteriori error estimates through a Riesz representer of the residual of the\nAVS-FE approximations. Hence, the norm of the resulting local restrictions of\nthese estimates serve as error indicators in both space and time for which we\npresent multiple numerical verifications adaptive strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 19:00:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2021 16:02:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Valseth", "Eirik", ""], ["Behnoudfar", "Pouria", ""], ["Dawson", "Clint", ""], ["Romkes", "Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00118", "submitter": "Ketan Mittal", "authors": "Ketan Mittal, Som Dutta, Paul Fischer", "title": "Stability analysis of a singlerate and multirate predictor-corrector\n  scheme for overlapping grids", "comments": "34 pages, 18 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use matrix stability analysis for a singlerate and multirate\npredictor-corrector scheme (PC) used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations (INSE) in overlapping grids.

This is demonstrated in examples\nwhere $\\kappa$-cycles are used for the solution of rotated anisotropic\ndiffusion problems, both as a stand-alone solver and as a preconditioner.\nMoreover, a simple model is presented for predicting the approximate run-time\nof the $\\kappa$-cycle, which is useful in pre-selecting an appropriate cycle\ncounter for a given problem on a given platform. Implementing the\n$\\kappa$-cycle requires making just a small change in the classical multigrid\ncycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 18:10:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Avnat", "Or", ""], ["Yavneh", "Irad", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00736", "submitter": "Fei Lu", "authors": "Fei Lu", "title": "Data-driven model reduction for stochastic Burgers equations", "comments": "22 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Entropy 2020, 22(12), 1360", "doi": "10.3390/e22121360", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a class of efficient parametric closure models for 1D stochastic\nBurgers equations.

TopOpt offers material layouts that control the flow of\nfluids through porous materials, providing desired functionalities. Many prior\nstudies in this application area have used Darcy equations for primal analysis\nand the minimum power theorem (MPT) to drive the optimization problem. But both\nthese choices (Darcy equations and MPT) are restrictive and not valid for\ngeneral working conditions of modern devices. Being simple and linear, Darcy\nequations are often used to model flow of fluids through porous media. However,\ntwo inherent assumptions of the Darcy model are: the viscosity of a fluid is a\nconstant, and inertial effects are negligible. There is irrefutable\nexperimental evidence that viscosity of a fluid, especially organic liquids,\ndepends on the pressure. Given the typical small pore-sizes, inertial effects\nare dominant in micro-fluidic devices. Next, MPT is not a general principle and\nis not valid for (nonlinear) models that relax the assumptions of the Darcy\nmodel.

On its own, Richards equation is already a nonlinear partial\ndifferential equation, and it is exceedingly difficult to solve numerically due\nto the extra nonlinear dependencies involving the soil water. To deal with\nmultiple scales, our strategy is that starting from a microscopic scale, we\nupscale the coupled system of dual-continuum Richards equations via\nhomogenization by the two-scale asymptotic expansion, to obtain a homogenized\nsystem, at an intermediate scale (level). Based on a hierarchical approach, the\nhomogenization's effective coefficients are computed through solving the\narising cell problems. To tackle the nonlinearity, after time discretization,\nwe use Picard iteration procedure for linearization of the homogenized Richards\nequations. At each Picard iteration, some degree of multiscale still remains\nfrom the intermediate level, so we utilize the generalized multiscale finite\nelement method (GMsFEM) combining with a multi-continuum approach, to upscale\nthe homogenized system to a macroscopic (coarse-grid) level.

P-PDEs arise in many important\napplication areas and the computational cost using traditional numerical\nschemes can be exorbitant, especially when the parameters fall into a\nparticular range and the underlying PDE is required to be solved with high\naccuracy. Recently, solving PDEs with DL has become an emerging field. Existing\nworks demonstrate great potentials of the DL based approach in speeding up\nnumerical solutions of PDEs. However, there is still limited research on the DL\napproach for P-PDEs. If we directly apply existing supervised learning models\nto P-PDEs, the models need to be constantly fine-tuned or retrained when the\nparameters change. This drastically limits the applicability and utility of\nthese models in practice. To resolve this issue, we propose a\nmeta-learning-based method that can efficiently solve P-PDEs with a wide range\nof parameters without retraining. Our key observation is to regard training a\nsolver for the P-PDE with a given set of parameters as a learning task. Then,\ntraining a solver for the P-PDEs with varied parameters can be viewed as a\nmulti-task learning problem, to which meta-learning is one of the most\neffective approaches. This new perspective can be applied to many existing PDE\nsolvers. As an example, we adopt the Multigrid Network (MgNet) as the base\nsolver.

In Merkurjev, Kosti\\'c, and Bertozzi (2013), a\nMerriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme with fidelity forcing was used instead, as\nthe MBO scheme is heuristically similar to the ACE. This paper rigorously\nestablishes the graph MBO scheme with fidelity forcing as a special case of an\nSDIE scheme for the graph ACE with fidelity forcing. This connection requires\nusing the double-obstacle potential in the ACE, as was shown in Budd and Van\nGennip (2020) for ACE without fidelity forcing. We also prove that solutions of\nthe SDIE scheme converge to solutions of the graph ACE with fidelity forcing as\nthe SDIE time step tends to zero.\n  Next, we develop the SDIE scheme as a classification algorithm. We also\nintroduce some innovations into the algorithms for the SDIE and MBO schemes.\nFor large graphs, we use a QR decomposition method to compute an\neigendecomposition from a Nystr\\\"om extension, which outperforms the method\nused in e.g. Bertozzi and Flenner (2012) in accuracy, stability, and speed.\nMoreover, we replace the Euler discretisation for the scheme's diffusion step\nby a computation based on the Strang formula for matrix exponentials.

We find that whilst the general SDIE\nscheme does not perform better than the MBO special case at this task, our\nother innovations lead to a significantly better segmentation than that from\nprevious literature.
