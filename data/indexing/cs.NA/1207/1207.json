NMF\nand its extensions minimize either the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the\nEuclidean distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ to model the Poisson noise or the\nGaussian noise. In practice, when the noise distribution is heavy tailed, they\ncannot perform well. This paper presents Manhattan NMF (MahNMF) which minimizes\nthe Manhattan distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ for modeling the heavy tailed\nLaplacian noise. Similar to sparse and low-rank matrix decompositions, MahNMF\nrobustly estimates the low-rank part and the sparse part of a non-negative\nmatrix and thus performs effectively when data are contaminated by outliers. We\nextend MahNMF for various practical applications by developing box-constrained\nMahNMF, manifold regularized MahNMF, group sparse MahNMF, elastic net inducing\nMahNMF, and symmetric MahNMF. The major contribution of this paper lies in two\nfast optimization algorithms for MahNMF and its extensions: the rank-one\nresidual iteration (RRI) method and Nesterov's smoothing method. In particular,\nby approximating the residual matrix by the outer product of one row of W and\none row of $H$ in MahNMF, we develop an RRI method to iteratively update each\nvariable of $W$ and $H$ in a closed form solution. Although RRI is efficient\nfor small scale MahNMF and some of its extensions, it is neither scalable to\nlarge scale matrices nor flexible enough to optimize all MahNMF extensions.\nSince the objective functions of MahNMF and its extensions are neither convex\nnor smooth, we apply Nesterov's smoothing method to recursively optimize one\nfactor matrix with another matrix fixed. By setting the smoothing parameter\ninversely proportional to the iteration number, we improve the approximation\naccuracy iteratively for both MahNMF and its extensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Jul 2012 16:19:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Guan", "Naiyang", ""], ["Tao", "Dacheng", ""], ["Luo", "Zhigang", ""], ["Shawe-Taylor", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.3450", "submitter": "Petr Vabishchevich N.", "authors": "Petr N.
