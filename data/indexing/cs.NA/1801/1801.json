The Riesz (or\nintegral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where\nthe value of a function u(x) must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the\ndomain in order to compute its fractional Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral\ndefinition requires only the standard local boundary condition. These\ndifferences, among others, lead us to ask the question: \"What is the fractional\nLaplacian?\" We compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional\nLaplacian (the Riesz, spectral, directional, and horizon-based nonlocal\ndefinitions), and we use a joint theoretical and computational approach to\nexamining their different characteristics by studying solutions of related\nfractional Poisson equations formulated on bounded domains.\n  In this work, we provide new numerical methods as well as a self-contained\ndiscussion of state-of-the-art methods for discretizing the fractional\nLaplacian, and we present new results on the differences in features,\nregularity, and boundary behaviors of solutions to equations posed with these\ndifferent definitions. We present stochastic interpretations and demonstrate\nthe equivalence between some recent formulations. Through our efforts, we aim\nto further engage the research community in open problems and assist\npractitioners in identifying the most appropriate definition and computational\napproach to use for their mathematical models in addressing anomalous transport\nin diverse applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 21:28:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Nov 2018 16:30:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:05:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lischke", "Anna", ""], ["Pang", "Guofei", ""], ["Gulian", "Mamikon", ""], ["Song", "Fangying", ""], ["Glusa", "Christian", ""], ["Zheng", "Xiaoning", ""], ["Mao", "Zhiping", ""], ["Cai", "Wei", ""], ["Meerschaert", "Mark M.", ""], ["Ainsworth", "Mark", ""], ["Karniadakis", "George Em", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.09794", "submitter": "Eric Polizzi", "authors": "Brendan Gavin, Agnieszka Mi\\k{e}dlar, Eric Polizzi", "title": "FEAST Eigensolver for Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The linear FEAST algorithm is a method for solving linear eigenvalue\nproblems. It uses complex contour integration to calculate the eigenvectors\nwhose eigenvalues that are located inside some user-defined region in the\ncomplex plane. This makes it possible to parallelize the process of solving\neigenvalue problems by simply dividing the complex plane into a collection of\ndisjoint regions and calculating the eigenpairs in each region independently of\nthe eigenpairs in the other regions. In this paper we present a generalization\nof the linear FEAST algorithm that can be used to solve nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblems. Like its linear progenitor, the nonlinear FEAST algorithm can be used\nto solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems for the eigenpairs whose eigenvalues lie\nin a user-defined region in the complex plane, thereby allowing for the\ncalculation of large numbers of eigenpairs in parallel.
