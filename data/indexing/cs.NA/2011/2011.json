These\nmethods often work by augmenting a solution subspace generated iteratively by a\nknown algorithm with a fixed subspace of vectors which are ``useful'' for\nsolving the problem. Often, this has the effect of inducing a projected version\nof the original linear system to which the known iterative method is then\napplied, and this projection can act as a deflation preconditioner,\naccelerating convergence. Most often, these methods have been applied for the\nsolution of well-posed problems.

We show that\nunder suitable assumptions, a recycling method satisfies the formal definition\nof a regularization, as long as the underlying scheme is itself a\nregularization.

In addition, our framework utilizes a simple and efficient procedure\nfor updating differentiation matrices on moving domains tiled by node sets of\ntime-varying cardinality. Finally, advection-diffusion in time-varying domains\nis handled through a combination of rapid node set modification, a new\nhigh-order semi-Lagrangian method that utilizes the new tuning-free overlapped\nRBF-FD method, and a high-order time-integration method. The resulting\nframework has no tuning parameters and has $O(N \\log N)$ time complexity. We\ndemonstrate high-orders of convergence for advection-diffusion equations on\ntime-varying 2D and 3D domains for both small and large Peclet numbers. We also\npresent timings that verify our complexity estimates. Finally, we utilize our\nmethod to solve a coupled 3D problem motivated by models of platelet\naggregation and coagulation, once again demonstrating high-order convergence\nrates on a moving domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2020 01:31:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Shankar", "Varun", ""], ["Wright", "Grady B.", ""], ["Fogelson", "Aaron L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.06756", "submitter": "Jessica Crawshaw Ms", "authors": "Jessica R.

The main idea is to reduce the stiffness of the problem by\nsubtracting a least-squares penalty on the gradient jumps across the mesh\ninterfaces from the standard stiffness bilinear form. This penalty bilinear\nform is similar to the known technique used to stabilize finite element\napproximations in various contexts. The penalty term is designed to dampen the\nhigh frequencies in the spectrum and so it is weighted here by a negative\ncoefficient. The resulting approximation technique is called softFEM since it\nreduces the stiffness of the problem. The two key advantages of softFEM over\nthe standard Galerkin FEM are to improve the approximation of the eigenvalues\nin the upper part of the discrete spectrum and to reduce the condition number\nof the stiffness matrix. We derive a sharp upper bound on the softness\nparameter weighting the stabilization bilinear form so as to maintain\ncoercivity for the softFEM bilinear form. Then we prove that softFEM delivers\nthe same optimal convergence rates as the standard Galerkin FEM approximation\nfor the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors. We next compare the discrete\neigenvalues obtained when using Galerkin FEM and softFEM. Finally, a detailed\nanalysis of linear softFEM for the 1D Laplace eigenvalue problem delivers a\nsensible choice for the softness parameter. With this choice, the stiffness\nreduction ratio scales linearly with the polynomial degree.

Indeed, despite more than half a\ncentury of research, it is still unknown which classes of operators allow for\ncomputation of spectra and eigenvectors with convergence rates and error\ncontrol. Recent progress in classifying the difficulty of spectral problems\ninto complexity hierarchies has revealed that the most difficult spectral\nproblems are so hard that one needs three limits in the computation, and no\nconvergence rates nor error control is possible. This begs the question: which\nclasses of operators allow for computations with convergence rates and error\ncontrol? In this paper we address this basic question, and the algorithm used\nis an infinite-dimensional version of the QR algorithm. Indeed, we generalise\nthe QR algorithm to infinite-dimensional operators. We prove that not only is\nthe algorithm executable on a finite machine, but one can also recover the\nextremal parts of the spectrum and corresponding eigenvectors, with convergence\nrates and error control. This allows for new classification results in the\nhierarchy of computational problems that existing algorithms have not been able\nto capture. The algorithm and convergence theorems are demonstrated on a wealth\nof examples with comparisons to standard approaches (that are notorious for\nproviding false solutions).We also find that in some cases the IQR algorithm\nperforms better than predicted by theory and make conjectures for future study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:57:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Colbrook", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Hansen", "Anders C.", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.08360", "submitter": "Yuetian Luo", "authors": "Yuetian Luo, Wen Huang, Xudong Li, Anru R.

Such models are usually\ncombined with non-conforming discretizations as they avoid the inherent\ndifficulties associated with the generation of meshes that explicitly resolve\nfractures-matrix interfaces. However, non-conforming discretizations demand a\nmore complicated coupling of different sub-models and may require special care\nto ensure conservative fluxes. We propose a novel approach for the simulation\nof flow and transport problems in fractured porous media based on an\nequi-dimensional representation of the fractures. The major challenge for these\ntypes of representation is the creation of meshes which resolve the several\ncomplex interfaces between the fractures and the embedding matrix. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we employ a strategy based on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).\nThe idea at the base of the proposed AMR is to start from an initially uniform\ncoarse mesh and refine the elements which have non-empty overlaps with at least\none of the fractures. Iterating this process allows to create non-uniform\nnon-conforming meshes, which do not resolve the interfaces but can approximate\nthem with arbitrary accuracy. We demonstrate that low-order finite element (FE)\ndiscretizations on adapted meshes are globally and locally conservative and we\nsuitably adapt an algebraic flux correction technique to ensure the discrete\nmaximum principle. In particular, we show that the notorious conditions on\nM-matrices have to be adapted to the basis functions defined on non-conforming\nmeshes. Although the proposed applications come from geophysical applications,\nthe obtained results could be applied to any diffusion and transport problems,\non both conforming and non-conforming meshes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2020 18:00:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nestola", "Maria Giuseppina Chiara", ""], ["Favino", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.08933", "submitter": "Maksim Dolgopolik", "authors": "M.V.

We present an algebraic framework for the\nmathematical description and classification of reaction networks, types of\nelementary reaction, and chemical species. Under this framework, we demonstrate\nthat the simultaneous training of neural nets and kinetic model parameters in a\nregularized multiobjective optimization setting leads to the solution of the\ninverse problem through the estimation of kinetic parameters from synthetic\nexperimental data. We probe the limits at which kinetic parameters can be\nretrieved as a function of knowledge about the chemical system states over\ntime, and assess the robustness of the methodology with respect to statistical\nnoise.

Unstructured meshes are frequently used to solve partial\ndifferential equations and are particularly suitable for problems that require\nthe mesh to conform to complex geometries or for problems that require variable\nmesh resolution. Central to the approach are space-filling curves, which\ntraverse the nodes or cells of a mesh tracing out a path that is as short as\npossible (in terms of numbers of edges) and that visits each node or cell\nexactly once. The space-filling curves (SFCs) are used to find an ordering of\nthe nodes or cells that can transform multi-dimensional solutions on\nunstructured meshes into a one-dimensional (1D) representation, to which 1D\nconvolutional layers can then be applied. Although developed in two dimensions,\nthe approach is applicable to higher dimensional problems.\n  To demonstrate the approach, the network we choose is a convolutional\nautoencoder (CAE) although other types of CNN could be used.
