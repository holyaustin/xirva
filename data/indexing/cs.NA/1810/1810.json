The basic approach in the\nliterature relies on a forward model where the so called traffic assignment\nmatrix maps OD flows to link flows.

A key role is played by\nstable Petrov--Galerkin type variational formulations of parametric transport\nequations and corresponding radiative transfer equations.

The numerical\nscheme is then based on approximately realizing this iteration within\ndynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence to the\nexact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed\nwithin suitably tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering\noperator needs to be approximately applied to the current iterate within a\ntolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second, parameter dependent\nlinear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy of\nthe iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one\nhas to employ rigorous a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a\nDiscontinuous Petrov--Galerkin (DPG) scheme. These a posteriori bounds are not\nonly crucial for guaranteeing the convergence of the perturbed iteration but\nare also used to generate adapted parameter dependent spatial meshes.

Two different cases are considered for parameter uncertainty\npropagation and global sensitivity analysis. In case A, stochastic variation is\nintroduced in the two non-dimensional parameters (Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers)\nwith an assumption that the boundary temperature is uniform. Being a two\ndimensional stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is\nused as a surrogate model. Case B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the\nboundary temperature. Instead of the traditional Gaussian process model with\nthe Karhunen-Lo$\\grave{e}$ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully\nimplemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is\ndivided into multiple domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is\nassumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random\nvariable. Deep neural networks are trained with the boundary temperatures as\ninputs and Nusselt number, internal temperature or velocities as outputs. The\nnumber of domains which is essentially the stochastic dimension is 4, 8, 16 or\n32. Rigorous training and testing process shows that the neural network is able\nto approximate the outputs to a reasonable accuracy. For a high stochastic\ndimension such as 32, it is computationally expensive to fit the PCE. This\npaper demonstrates a novel way of using the deep neural network as a surrogate\nmodeling method for uncertainty quantification with the number of simulations\nmuch fewer than that required for fitting the PCE, thus, saving the\ncomputational cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2018 03:24:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Jan 2019 15:41:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Shahane", "Shantanu", ""], ["Aluru", "Narayana R.", ""], ["Vanka", "Surya Pratap", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.12817", "submitter": "Jalal Fadili", "authors": "Yosra Hafiene, Jalal Fadili, Abderrahim Elmoataz", "title": "Nonlocal $p$-Laplacian Variational problems on graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA eess.IV eess.SP math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study a nonlocal variational problem which consists of\nminimizing in $L^2$ the sum of a quadratic data fidelity and a regularization\nterm corresponding to the $L^p$-norm of the nonlocal gradient.

We show that\nthe MDFEM can be used to reduce the computational complexity of estimating the\nexpected value of a linear functional of the solution of the PDE. The proposed\nalgorithm combines the multivariate decomposition method (MDM), to compute\ninfinite dimensional integrals, with the finite element method (FEM), to solve\ndifferent instances of the PDE. The strategy of the MDFEM is to decompose the\ninfinite-dimensional problem into multiple finite-dimensional ones which lends\nitself to easier parallelization than to solve a single large dimensional\nproblem. Our first result adjusts the analysis of the multivariate\ndecomposition method to incorporate the log-factor which typically appears in\nerror bounds for multivariate quadrature, i.e., cubature, methods; and we take\ncare of the fact that the number of points $n$ needs to come, e.g., in powers\nof 2 for higher order approximations. For the further analysis we specialize\nthe cubature methods to be two types of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules, being\ndigitally shifted polynomial lattice rules and interlaced polynomial lattice\nrules. The second and main contribution then presents a bound on the error of\nthe MDFEM and shows higher-order convergence w.r.t. the total computational\ncost in case of the interlaced polynomial lattice rules in combination with a\nhigher-order finite element method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2018 13:04:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2021 07:18:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Dong T.
