It is well understood in other\nproblems of numerical computation that nonlinear methods such as adaptive\napproximation, $n$-term approximation, and certain tree-based methods may\nprovide improved numerical efficiency. For model reduction, a nonlinear method\nwould replace the linear space $V_n$ by a nonlinear space $\\Sigma_n$. This idea\nhas already been suggested in recent papers on model reduction where the\nparameter domain is decomposed into a finite number of cells and a linear space\nof low dimension is assigned to each cell.\n  Up to this point, little is known in terms of performance guarantees for such\na nonlinear strategy. Moreover, most numerical experiments for nonlinear model\nreduction use a parameter dimension of only one or two. In this work, a step is\nmade towards a more cohesive theory for nonlinear model reduction.

A recent\nmodel, called REAPER, aims to find the principal components by solving a convex\noptimization problem. Usually the number of principal components must be\ndetermined in advance and the minimization is performed over symmetric positive\nsemi-definite matrices having the size of the data, although the number of\nprincipal components is substantially smaller. This prohibits its use if the\ndimension of the data is large which is often the case in image processing.\n  In this paper, we propose a regularized version of REAPER which enforces the\nsparsity of the number of principal components by penalizing the nuclear norm\nof the corresponding orthogonal projector. This has the advantage that only an\nupper bound on the number of principal components is required.
