Principle\namong these limitations are the convergence of associated Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these\nlimitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are\nremoved from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman\ngenerators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for\ncertain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of\nthe operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a\nviable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of\neigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to\nbe achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is\nembedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a\nmore typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank\nrepresentation that converges in norm.

The prediction of desiccation cracking\nin soils is challenging due to the lack of insights into the complex coupled\nhydro-mechanical process at the grain scale. In this paper, a new hybrid\ndiscrete-continuum numerical framework, capable of capturing hydro-mechanical\nbehaviour of soil at both grain and macro scales, is proposed for predicting\ndesiccation cracking in clayey soil. In this framework, a soil layer is\nrepresented by an assembly of DEM particles, each occupies an equivalent\ncontinuum space and carries physical properties governing unsaturated flow.\nThese particles move freely in the computational space following the discrete\nelement method (DEM), while their contact network and the continuum mixture\ntheory are used to model the unsaturated flow. The dependence of\nparticle-to-particle contact behaviour on water content is represented by a\ncohesive-frictional contact model, whose material properties are governed by\nthe water content. In parallel with the theoretical development is a series of\nexperiments on 3D soil desiccation cracking to determine essential properties\nand provide data for the validation of mechanical and physical behaviour. Very\ngood agreement in both physical behaviour (e.g. evolution of water content) and\nmechanical behaviour (e.g. occurrence and development of cracks, and\ndistribution of compressive and tensile strains) demonstrates that the proposed\nframework is capable of capturing the hydro-mechanical behaviour of soil during\ndesiccation.

This paper considers and analyzes a fully discrete\nfinite element method for a class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations, where\nthe diffusion term is globally Lipschitz continuous while the drift term is\nonly assumed to satisfy weaker conditions as in [11]. The novelties of this\npaper are threefold. First, the error estimates cannot not be directly obtained\nif the numerical scheme in primal form is used. The numerical scheme in mixed\nform is introduced and several H\\\"{o}lder continuity results of the strong\nsolution are proved, which are used to establish the error estimates in both\n$L^2$ norm and energy norms. Second, two types of discretization of the\nnonlinear term are proposed to establish the $L^2$ stability and energy\nstability results of the discrete solutions. These two types of discretization\nand proper test functions are designed to overcome the challenges arising from\nthe stochastic scaling in time issues and the nonlinear interaction. These\nstability results play key roles in proving the probability of the set on which\nthe error estimates hold approaches one.

Discretization of such geometries and\nsolution of the contact problem on the internal interfaces can be\ncomputationally challenging. We employ an unfitted Finite Element (FE)\nframework for the discretization of the domains and develop a tailored,\nglobally convergent, and efficient multigrid method for solving contact\nproblems on the internal interfaces. In the unfitted FE methods, structured\nbackground meshes are used and only the underlying finite element space has to\nbe modified to incorporate the discontinuities. The non-penetration conditions\non the embedded interfaces of the domains are discretized using the method of\nLagrange multipliers. We reformulate the arising variational inequality problem\nas a quadratic minimization problem with linear inequality constraints. Our\nmultigrid method can solve such problems by employing a tailored multilevel\nhierarchy of the FE spaces and a novel approach for tackling the discretized\nnon-penetration conditions. We employ pseudo-$L^2$ projection-based transfer\noperators to construct a hierarchy of nested FE spaces from the hierarchy of\nnon-nested meshes. The essential component of our multigrid method is a\ntechnique that decouples the linear constraints using an orthogonal\ntransformation of the basis. The decoupled constraints are handled by a\nmodified variant of the projected Gauss-Seidel method, which we employ as a\nsmoother in the multigrid method. These components of the multigrid method\nallow us to enforce linear constraints locally and ensure the global\nconvergence of our method.
