However, the floating-point evaluation of a Remez polynomial\nsometimes leads to catastrophic cancellations. This happens when some of the\npolynomial coefficients are very small in magnitude with respects to others. In\nthis case, it is better to force these coefficients to zero, which also reduces\nthe operation count. This technique, classically used for odd or even\nfunctions, may be generalized to a much larger class of functions. An algorithm\nis presented that forces to zero the smaller coefficients of the initial\npolynomial thanks to a modified Remez algorithm targeting an incomplete\nmonomial basis. One advantage of this technique is that it is purely numerical,\nthe function being used as a numerical black box. This algorithm is implemented\nwithin a larger polynomial implementation tool that is demonstrated on a range\nof examples, resulting in polynomials with less coefficients than those\nobtained the usual way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 13:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["De Dinechin", "Florent", "", "LIP"], ["Lauter", "Christoph Quirin", "", "LIP"]]}, {"id": "0803.0811", "submitter": "Wei Dai", "authors": "Wei Dai and Olgica Milenkovic", "title": "Subspace Pursuit for Compressive Sensing Signal Reconstruction", "comments": "The first version was submitted on Mar. 6th, 2008.

A generalized flow is one in which the flow out of an edge differs\nfrom the flow into the edge by a constant factor.

The system of linear equations\nthat arises at each step of the interior-point algorithm takes the form of a\nsymmetric M-matrix.
