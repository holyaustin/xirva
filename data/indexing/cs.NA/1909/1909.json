We construct a \"test function\noperator function\" $T(\\cdot)$ so that $A(\\lambda)$ is weakly\n$T(\\lambda)$-coercive for all suitable $\\lambda$, i.e. $T(\\lambda)^*A(\\lambda)$\nis a compact perturbation of a coercive operator. The construction of\n$T(\\cdot)$ relies on a suitable decomposition of the function space into\nsubspaces and an apt sign change on each subspace.\n  For the approximation analysis, we apply the framework of T-compatible\nGalerkin approximations. For the modified problem, we prove that convenient\ncommuting projection operators imply T-compatibility and hence convergence. For\nthe original problem, we require the projection operators to satisfy an\nadditional commutator property involving the tangential trace. The existence\nand construction of such projection operators remain open questions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2019 12:38:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2019 09:13:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Halla", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.00698", "submitter": "Denis Belomestny", "authors": "Denis Belomestny and Leonid Iosipoi", "title": "Fourier transform MCMC, heavy tailed distributions and geometric\n  ergodicity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO cs.NA math.NA q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods become increasingly popular in applied\nmathematics as a tool for numerical integration with respect to complex and\nhigh-dimensional distributions.

We provide error estimates between the approximation and the exact\nsolution under canonical source condition, and interpret the approach in the\nlens of convex duality.

We show that the scheme is conditionally stable, and under\nconditions on the coupling strength, the scheme can be unconditionally stable.\nWe demonstrate the performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on several\nclasses of multiphysics problems including a simple linear system of ODEs,\nadvection-diffusion-reaction systems, and fluid-structure interaction problems\nwith both incompressible and compressible flows, where we verify the design\norder of the SDC schemes and study various stability properties.

A massively parallel\nsimulation framework (PFLOTRAN-SIP) was built to couple SIP data to fluid flow\nand solute transport processes. This framework built on the PFLOTRAN-E4D\nsimulator that couples PFLOTRAN and E4D, without sacrificing computational\nperformance. PFLOTRAN solves the coupled flow and solute transport process\nmodels to estimate solute concentrations, which were used in Archie's model to\ncompute bulk electrical conductivities at near-zero frequency.

Rigid-body assumptions are commonly used\nto approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead\nto challenging-to-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other\nhand, robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact,\ncombined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding\nNCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff\ndynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially\nduring slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit\nintegration for these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search\n(TALS), which greatly improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations\nperformed by implicit integrators.

Usually, solving these equations consists of computing the first\nstatistics of the response process, and that task has been an essential goal in\nthe literature. A more ambitious objective is the computation of the solution\nprobability density function. We present advances on these two aspects in the\ncase of general random non-autonomous second order linear differential\nequations with analytic data processes. The Fr\\\"obenius method is employed to\nobtain the stochastic solution in the form of a mean square convergent power\nseries. We demonstrate that the convergence requires the boundedness of the\nrandom input coefficients. Further, the mean square error of the Fr\\\"obenius\nmethod is proved to decrease exponentially with the number of terms in the\nseries, although not uniformly in time. Regarding the probability density\nfunction of the solution at a given time, we rely on the law of total\nprobability to express it in closed-form as an expectation. For the computation\nof this expectation, a sequence of approximating density functions is\nconstructed by reducing the dimensionality of the problem using the truncated\npower series of the fundamental set. We prove several theoretical results\nregarding the pointwise convergence of the sequence of density functions and\nthe convergence in total variation. The pointwise convergence turns out to be\nexponential under a Lipschitz hypothesis. As the density functions are\nexpressed in terms of expectations, we propose a symbolic Monte Carlo sampling\nalgorithm for their estimation.

This easy interpretability\nplaces the nonnegative factorization as a uniquely suitable method for\nexploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning. The standard Canonical\nPolyadic Decomposition (CPD) algorithm for tensor factorization experiences\ndifficulties when applied to tensors with rank deficient factors. For example,\nthe rank deficiency, or linear dependence in the factors, cannot be easily\nreproduced by the standard PARAFAC because the presence of noise in the\nreal-world data can force the algorithm to extract linearly independent\nfactors. Methods for low-rank approximation and extraction of latent features\nin the rank deficient case, such as PARALIND family of models, have been\nsuccessfully developed for general tensors. In this paper, we propose a similar\napproach for factorization of nonnegative tensors with rank deficiency.\nFirstly, we determine the minimal nonnegative cones containing the initial\ntensor and by using a nonnegative Tucker decomposition determine its\nnonnegative multirank. Secondly, by a nonnegative Tucker decomposition we\nderived the core tensor and factor matrices corresponding to this multirank.\nThirdly, we apply a nonnegative CPD to the derived core tensor to avoid the\nproblematic rank deficiency. Finally, we combine both factorizations to obtain\nthe final CPD factors and demonstrate our approach in several synthetic and\nreal-world examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:20:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alexandrov", "Boian", ""], ["DeSantis", "Derek", ""], ["Manzini", "Gianmarco", ""], ["Skau", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.07680", "submitter": "Fabian Wagner", "authors": "Fabian Wagner, Jonas Latz, Iason Papaioannou, Elisabeth Ullmann", "title": "Multilevel Sequential Importance Sampling for Rare Event Estimation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "SIAM J.

We consider failure events that are expressed\nin terms of a limit state function, which depends on the solution of a partial\ndifferential equation (PDE). Since numerical evaluations of PDEs are\ncomputationally expensive, estimating such probabilities of failure by Monte\nCarlo sampling is intractable. More efficient sampling methods from reliability\nanalysis, such as Subset Simulation, are popular, but can still be\nimpracticable if the PDE evaluations are very costly. In this article, we\ndevelop a novel, highly efficient estimator for probabilities of rare events.\nOur method is based on a Sequential Importance sampler using discretizations of\nPDE-based limit state functions with different accuracies. A twofold adaptive\nalgorithm ensures that we obtain an estimate based on the desired\ndiscretization accuracy. In contrast to the Multilevel Subset Simulation\nestimator of [Ullmann, Papaioannou 2015; SIAM/ASA J. Uncertain. Quantif.\n3(1):922-953], our estimator overcomes the nestedness problem. Of particular\nimportance in Sequential Importance sampling algorithms is the correct choice\nof the MCMC kernel. Instead of the popular adaptive conditional sampling\nmethod, we propose a new algorithm that uses independent proposals from an\nadaptively constructed von Mises-Fischer-Nakagami distribution.

The robust H-infinity norm is the worst case value of the\nH-infinity norm over the realisations of the system and hence an important\nmeasure of robust performance in control engineering. However this robust\nH-infinity norm is a fragile measure, as for a particular realization of the\nuncertainties the H-infinity norm might be sensitive to arbitrarily small\nperturbations on the delays.

The geometry of\nthe design is represented implicitly by the iso-contour of a level set\nfunction. An immersed boundary technique, here the extended finite element\nmethod, is used to predict the structural response. Both the level set function\nand the state variable fields are discretized by hierarchical B-splines. While\nonly first-order B-splines are used for the state variable fields, up to third\norder B-splines are considered for discretizing the level set function. The\ndiscretizations of the level set function and the state variable fields are\nlocally refined along the material interfaces and selectively coarsened within\nthe bulk phases. For locally refined/coarsened meshes, truncated B-splines are\nconsidered. The properties of the proposed mesh adaptation strategy are studied\nfor level set topology optimization where either the initial design is\ncomprised of a uniform array of inclusions or inclusions are generated during\nthe optimization process. Numerical studies employing static linear elastic\nmaterial/void problems in 2D and 3D demonstrate the ability of the proposed\nmethod to start from a coarse mesh and converge to designs with complex\ngeometries and fine features, reducing the overall computational cost.\nComparing optimization results for different B-spline orders suggests that\nhigher order basis functions promote the development of smooth designs and\nsuppress the emergence of small features, without providing an explicit feature\nsize control. A distinct advantage of cubic over quadratic B-splines is not\nobserved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 20:31:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Noel", "L.", ""], ["Schmidt", "M.", ""], ["Messe", "C.", ""], ["Evans", "J.

Implicit time-stepping schemes are often favored in mechanics due to\ntheir ability to take larger time steps in quasistatic and moderate dynamic\nproblems. Furthermore, initially rigid cohesive models are typically preferred\nwhen the location of the crack is not known in advance, since initially elastic\nmodels artificially lower the material stiffness. It is challenging to include\nan initially rigid cohesive model in an implicit scheme because the initiation\nof fracture corresponds to a nondifferentiability of the underlying potential.\nIn this work, an interior-point method is proposed for implicit time stepping\nof initially rigid cohesive fracture. It uses techniques developed for convex\nsecond-order cone programming for the nonconvex problem at hand. The underlying\ncohesive model is taken from Papoulia (2017) and is based on a\nnondifferentiable energy function. That previous work proposed an algorithm\nbased on successive smooth approximations to the nondifferential objective for\nsolving the resulting optimization problem. It is argued herein that cone\nprogramming can capture the nondifferentiability without smoothing, and the\nresulting cone formulation is amenable to interior-point algorithms. A further\nbenefit of the formulation is that other conic inequality constraints are\nstraightforward to incorporate. Computational results are provided showing that\ncertain contact constraints can be easily handled and that the method is\npractical.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 22:13:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Vavasis", "Stephen A.", ""], ["Papoulia", "Katerina D.", ""], ["Hirmand", "M.

Second, by exploiting the fact\nthat the multigrid prolongator for this operator is rich in components toward\nthe lower part of the singular spectrum. We show experimentally that the\ninexact eigensolver can approximate the lower part of the spectrum even for\nill-conditioned operators.
