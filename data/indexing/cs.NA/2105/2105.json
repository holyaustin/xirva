Hence, we develop a new theory for nonlinear Steklov-Poincar\\'e\noperators based on the $p$-structure and the $L^p$-generalization of the\nLions-Magenes spaces. This framework allows the reformulation of the\nRobin-Robin method into a Peaceman-Rachford splitting on the interfaces of the\nsubdomains, and the convergence analysis then follows by employing elements of\nthe abstract theory for monotone operators. The analysis is performed on\nLipschitz domains and without restrictive regularity assumptions on the\nsolutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2021 06:51:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Engstr\u00f6m", "Emil", ""], ["Hansen", "Eskil", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.00661", "submitter": "Fatemeh Pourahmadian", "authors": "Fatemeh Pourahmadian and Kevish Napal", "title": "Poroelastic near-field inverse scattering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math-ph math.AP math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A multiphysics data analytic platform is established for imaging poroelastic\ninterfaces of finite permeability (e.g., hydraulic fractures) from elastic\nwaveforms and/or acoustic pore pressure measurements.

Alternatively, in this work, deterministic\nmatrix sketches which generate coarse representations, compatible with the\ncorresponding PDE solve, are considered in the computation of the singular\nvalue decomposition and matrix interpolative decomposition. The deterministic\nsketching approaches in this work have many advantages over randomized\nsketches. Broadly, randomized sketches are data-agnostic, whereas the proposed\nsketching methods exploit structures within data generated in complex PDE\nsystems. These deterministic sketches are often faster, require access to a\nsmall fraction of the input matrix, and do not need to be explicitly\nconstructed. A novel single-pass, i.e., requiring one read over the input,\npower iteration algorithm is also presented. The power iteration method is\nparticularly effective in improving low-rank approximations when the singular\nvalue decay of data is slow. Finally, theoretical error bounds and estimates,\nas well as numerical results across three application problems, are provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2021 03:36:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Dunton", "Alec Michael", ""], ["Doostan", "Alireza", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.01285", "submitter": "Jun Geol Ahn", "authors": "Jun-Geol Ahn, Hyun-Ik Yang, Jin-Gyun Kim", "title": "Online adaptive basis construction for nonlinear model reduction through\n  local error optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The accuracy of the reduced-order model (ROM) mainly depends on the selected\nbasis.

The degrees-of-freedom of Hermite\nmethods are tensor-product Taylor polynomials of degree $m$ in each coordinate\ndirection.

This task, among others, is frequently encountered in the\nnumerical simulation of three-phase flows when resorting to the geometric\nVolume-of-Fluid method. For two-phase flows, the recent work of Kromer and\nBothe (arXiv:2101.03861) addresses the positioning of a single plane by\ncombining an implicit bracketing of the sought position with up to third-order\nderivatives of the volume fraction.

The present\nmanuscript achieves this by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence\ntheorem in appropriate form, which allows to compute the volume as a sum of\nquantities associated to the faces of the original polyhedron. With a suitable\nchoice of the coordinate origin, accounting for the sequential character of the\ntruncation, the volume parametrization becomes co-moving with respect to the\nplanes. This eliminates the necessity to establish topological connectivity and\ntetrahedron decomposition after each truncation.

The computational cost of\nthis proposed flow-driven stochastic chaos (FSC) method is an order of\nmagnitude lower than TD-gPC for comparable solution accuracy. This gain in\ncomputational cost is realized because, unlike most existing methods, the\nnumber of basis vectors required to track the stochastic part of the solution\nspace, and consequently the computational cost associated with the solution of\nthe resulting system of equations, does not depend upon the dimensionality of\nthe probability space.

Our approach using the multiquadric radial\nbasis function allows us to reduce the computational time and provide accurate\nnumerical solutions. The proposed method does not require mesh generation.\nPicard's iterations are used to linearize the resulting nonlinear problem\nobtained using the Kirchhoff transformation technique. The numerical\nsimulations show the capability of the proposed numerical techniques in\npredicting the dynamics of water through unsaturated soils.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2021 18:06:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Boujoudar", "Mohamed", ""], ["Beljadid", "Abdelaziz", ""], ["Taik", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.13134", "submitter": "Andre Laestadius", "authors": "Mih\\'aly Andr\\'as Csirik and Andre Laestadius", "title": "Coupled-Cluster Theory Revisited", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math-ph math.MP physics.chem-ph quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a comprehensive mathematical framework for Coupled-Cluster-type\nmethods.

One prominent example is the real-time\ntime-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), a widely used framework\nfor the first principle description of many-electron dynamics in chemical and\nmaterials systems. Practical rt-TDDFT calculations often avoid the direct\nsimulation of the von Neumann equation, and solve instead a set of\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, of which the dynamics is equivalent to that of the von\nNeumann equation. However, the time step size employed by the Schr\\\"odinger\ndynamics is often much smaller. In order to improve the time step size and the\noverall efficiency of the simulation, we generalize a recent work of the\nparallel transport (PT) dynamics for simulating pure states [An, Lin,\nMultiscale Model. Simul. 18, 612, 2020] to general quantum states. The PT\ndynamics provides the optimal gauge choice, and can employ a time step size\ncomparable to that of the von Neumann dynamics. Going beyond the linear and\nnear adiabatic regime in previous studies, we find that the error of the PT\ndynamics can be bounded by certain commutators between Hamiltonians, density\nmatrices, and their derived quantities. Such a commutator structure is not\npresent in the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics. We demonstrate that the parallel\ntransport-implicit midpoint (PT-IM) method is a suitable method for simulating\nthe PT dynamics, especially when the spectral radius of the Hamiltonian is\nlarge. The commutator structure of the error bound, and numerical results for\nmodel rt-TDDFT calculations in both linear and nonlinear regimes, confirm the\nadvantage of the PT dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 07:37:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["An", "Dong", ""], ["Fang", "Di", ""], ["Lin", "Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14776", "submitter": "Mirko Trisolini", "authors": "Simone Limonta, Mirko Trisolini, Stefan Frey, Camilla Colombo", "title": "Fragmentation model and strewn field estimation for meteoroids entry", "comments": "29 pages, 26 figures, published in Icarus", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114553", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Everyday thousands of meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere.

In\nthis work, a methodology to describe meteoroids entry, fragmentation, descent,\nand strewn field is presented by means of a continuum approach. At breakup, a\nmodified version of the NASA Standard Breakup Model is used to generate the\ndistribution of the fragments in terms of their area-to-mass ratio and ejection\nvelocity. This distribution, combined with the meteoroid state, is directly\npropagated using the continuity equation coupled with the non-linear entry\ndynamics. At each time step, the probability density evolution of the fragments\nis reconstructed using GMM interpolation. Using this information is then\npossible to estimate the meteoroid's ground impact probability. This approach\ndeparts from the current state-of-the-art models: it has the flexibility to\ninclude large fragmentation events while maintaining a continuum formulation\nfor a better physical representation of the phenomenon. The methodology is also\ncharacterised by a modular structure, so that updated asteroids fragmentation\nmodels can be readily integrated into the framework, allowing a continuously\nimproving prediction of re-entry and fragmentation events. The propagation of\nthe fragments' density and its reconstruction, currently considering only one\nfragmentation point, is first compared against Monte Carlo simulations, and\nthen against real observations.
