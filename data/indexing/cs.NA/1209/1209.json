Secondly, we use entropy-\nvariable based matrix dissipation flux which leads to kinetic energy and\nentropy stable schemes. These schemes are shown to be free of entropy violating\nsolutions unlike the original Roe scheme. For hypersonic flows a blended scheme\nis proposed which gives carbuncle free solutions for blunt body flows.\nNumerical results for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are presented to\ndemonstrate the performance of the different schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2012 13:09:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chandrashekar", "Praveen", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5173", "submitter": "Robert Pich\\'e", "authors": "Robert Pich\\'e", "title": "On the Parametric Instability Caused by Step Size Variation in\n  Runge-Kutta-Nystr\\\"om Methods", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Tampere University of Technology Department of Information\n  Technology Mathematics Report 73", "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The parametric instability arising when ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) are numerically integrated with Runge-Kutta-Nystr\\\"om (RKN) methods with\nvarying step sizes is investigated.
