Special attention is paid to families of\ntraveling wave solutions. Conditions for existence of front-impulse,\nimpulse-front, and front-front traveling wave solutions are formulated. In\nparticular, the simplest mathematical model is presented that has an\nimpulse-impulse solution; we also show that a non-isolated singular point in\nthe ordinary differential equation (ODE) wave system implies existence of\nfree-boundary fronts.

This paper presents some preliminary investigations on the\nproblem of mesh numbering using Evolutionary Algorithms. Three conclusions can\nbe drawn from these experiments. First, the results of the up-to-date method\nused in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second,\nnone of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem\nspecific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary\nComputation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or\nheuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The\ngood news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the\nstandard heuristic method between 12% and 20% for both the 1545 and 5453-nodes\nmeshes used as test-bed. Finally, some strange interaction between the\nselection scheme and the use of problem specific mutation operator was\nobserved, which appeals for further investigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2007 12:17:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sourd", "Francis", "", "CMAP"], ["Schoenauer", "Marc", "", "CMAP"]]}]
