State-of-the-art algorithms that are efficient on the\nexplicit case cannot be straightforwardly transformed to the implicit case if\nscalability should be maintained. There are few if any implicit feedback\nbenchmark datasets, therefore new ideas are usually experimented on explicit\nbenchmarks. In this paper, we propose a generic context-aware implicit feedback\nrecommender algorithm, coined iTALS. iTALS apply a fast, ALS-based tensor\nfactorization learning method that scales linearly with the number of non-zero\nelements in the tensor. The method also allows us to incorporate diverse\ncontext information into the model while maintaining its computational\nefficiency. In particular, we present two such context-aware implementation\nvariants of iTALS. The first incorporates seasonality and enables to\ndistinguish user behavior in different time intervals. The other views the user\nhistory as sequential information and has the ability to recognize usage\npattern typical to certain group of items, e.g. to automatically tell apart\nproduct types or categories that are typically purchased repetitively\n(collectibles, grocery goods) or once (household appliances).
