The fast reconstruction of the full flow can be performed\nwith state estimation methods that have been introduced in recent years and\nthat involve reduced order models. One simple and efficient strategy is the\nso-called Parametrized Background Data-Weak approach (PBDW). It is a linear\nmapping that consists in a least squares fit between the measurement data and a\nlinear reduced model to which a certain correction term is added. However, in\nthe original approach, the reduced model is built a priori and independently of\nthe reconstruction task (typically with a proper orthogonal decomposition or a\ngreedy algorithm).
