Existing approaches\ninclude optimization algorithms such as gradient descent and simulated\nannealing, but these typically only find local minima. One novel approach\nimplemented in REDcRAFT is to instead of folding a protein all at the same\ntime, fold it residue by residue. This simulates a protein folding as each\nresidue exits from the generating ribosome. While REDcRAFT exponentially\nreduces the problem space so it can be explored in polynomial time, it is still\nextremely computationally demanding. This algorithm does have the advantage\nthat most of the execution time is spent in inherently parallelizable code.\nHowever, preliminary results from parallel execution indicate that\napproximately two-thirds of execution time is dedicated to system overhead.\nAdditionally, by carefully analyzing and timing the structure of the program\nthe major bottlenecks can be identified.

This causes a strong increase in the\nnumber of lattice configurations that have to be generated to obtain\nstatistically significant results. This paper discusses hierarchical sampling\nmethods to tame the growth in autocorrelations. Combined with multilevel\nvariance reduction, this significantly reduces the computational cost of\nsimulations for given tolerances $\\epsilon_{\\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation\nerror and $\\epsilon_{\\text{stat}}$ on the statistical error.

On fine lattices, the new methods\nare orders of magnitude faster than standard Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. For\nhigh resolutions, MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for\nthe topological oscillator.

Many\napplications depend on matrix decomposition algorithms that provide accurate\nlow-rank representations of data. In modern problems, however, various factors\nmake this hard to accomplish. One solution to these problems is the use of\nrandom projections. Instead of directly computing the matrix factorization, we\nrandomly project the matrix onto a lower-dimensional subspace and then compute\nthe factorization. Often, we are able to do this without significant loss of\naccuracy. We describe how randomization can be used to create more efficient\nalgorithms to perform low-rank matrix approximation, as well as introducing a\nnovel randomized algorithm for matrix decomposition. Compared to standard\napproaches, random algorithms are often faster and more robust. With these\nrandomized algorithms, analyzing massive data sets becomes tractable.\n  Kernel methods are almost diametrically opposite from low-rank approximation.\nThe idea is to project low-dimensional data into a higher-dimensional 'feature\nspace,' such that it is linear separable in the feature space. This enables the\nmodel to learn a nonlinear separation of the data. As before, with large data\nmatrices, computing the kernel matrix can be expensive, so we use randomized\nmethods to approximate the matrix. In addition, we propose an extension of the\nrandom Fourier features kernel in which hyperparameter values are randomly\nsampled from an interval or Borel set.\n  The experiments discussed in this paper can be found on our website at\nhttps://rishi1999.github.io/random-projections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2020 07:02:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Advani", "Rishi", ""], ["Crim", "Madison", ""], ["O'Hagan", "Sean", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.04656", "submitter": "Qiaoqiao Ding Ms.", "authors": "Qiaoqiao Ding, Yuesong Nan, Hao Gao, Hui Ji", "title": "AHP-Net: adaptive-hyper-parameter deep learning based image\n  reconstruction method for multilevel low-dose CT", "comments": "7 figures, 5 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.IV cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging is desirable in many clinical applications to\nreduce X-ray radiation dose to patients.

We deal with this issue by observing that the problem is\nuniformly stable, irrespective of all parameters, in a suitable nonsymmetric\nvariational setting. Guided by this result, we design a novel nonconforming\ndiscretization, which employs Crouzeix-Raviart and discontinuous elements.

Our\nnewly developed numerical method is based on generalized Robin boundary\nconditions, as well as on the refactorization of the Cauchy's one-legged\n`theta-like' method, written as a sequence of Backward Euler-Forward Euler\nsteps used to discretize the problem in time. This family of methods,\nparametrized by theta, is B-stable for any theta in [0.5,1] and second-order\naccurate for theta=0.5+O(tau), where tau is the time step. In the proposed\nalgorithm, the fluid and structure subproblems, discretized using the Backward\nEuler scheme, are first solved iteratively until convergence. Then, the\nvariables are linearly extrapolated, equivalent to solving Forward Euler\nproblems. We prove that the iterative procedure is convergent, and that the\nproposed method is stable provided theta in [0.5,1]. Numerical examples, based\non the finite element discretization in space, explore convergence rates using\ndifferent values of parameters in the problem, and compare our method to other\nstrongly-coupled partitioned schemes from the literature. We also compare our\nmethod to both a monolithic and a non-iterative partitioned solver on a\nbenchmark problem with parameters within the physiological range of blood flow,\nobtaining an excellent agreement with the monolithic scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Aug 2020 14:02:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 09:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bukac", "Martina", ""], ["Seboldt", "Anyastassia", ""], ["Trenchea", "Catalin", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.12990", "submitter": "Xiantao Li", "authors": "Shi Jin and Xiantao Li", "title": "Random Batch Algorithms for Quantum Monte Carlo simulations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Random batch algorithms are constructed for quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe main objective is to alleviate the computational cost associated with the\ncalculations of two-body interactions, including the pairwise interactions in\nthe potential energy, and the two-body terms in the Jastrow factor.
