We propose an algorithm based on Newton's method\nand subdivision for this problem. Our algorithm is intended only for\nnondegenerate cases, in which case the solution is a 1-dimensional curve. Our\nfirst main contribution is a definition of a condition number measuring\nreciprocal distance to degeneracy that can distinguish poor and well\nconditioned instances of this problem. (Degenerate problems would be infinitely\nill conditioned in our framework.) Our second contribution, which is the main\nnovelty of our algorithm, is an analysis showing that its running time is\nbounded in terms of the condition number of the problem instance as well as $n$\nand the polynomial degrees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 06:02:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2009 04:08:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Srijuntongsiri", "Gun", ""], ["Vavasis", "Stephen A.", ""]]}]
