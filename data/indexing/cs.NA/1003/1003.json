In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to filter an image with a Gaussian-like\nelliptic window of varying size, elongation and orientation using a fixed\nnumber of computations per pixel. The associated algorithm, which is based on a\nfamily of smooth compactly supported piecewise polynomials, the\nradially-uniform box splines, is realized using pre-integration and local\nfinite-differences. The radially-uniform box splines are constructed through\nthe repeated convolution of a fixed number of box distributions, which have\nbeen suitably scaled and distributed radially in an uniform fashion. The\nattractive features of these box splines are their asymptotic behavior, their\nsimple covariance structure, and their quasi-separability. They converge to\nGaussians with the increase of their order, and are used to approximate\nanisotropic Gaussians of varying covariance simply by controlling the scales of\nthe constituent box distributions. Based on the second feature, we develop a\ntechnique for continuously controlling the size, elongation and orientation of\nthese Gaussian-like functions. Finally, the quasi-separable structure, along\nwith a certain scaling property of box distributions, is used to efficiently\nrealize the associated space-variant elliptical filtering, which requires O(1)\ncomputations per pixel irrespective of the shape and size of the filter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2010 05:53:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2011 22:16:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhury", "Kunal Narayan", ""], ["Munoz-Barrutia", "Arrate", ""], ["Unser", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2441", "submitter": "Kien Nguyen", "authors": "Kien C.
