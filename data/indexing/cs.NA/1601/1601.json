For\nexample, each of $s$ servers may have an $n \\times d$ matrix $A^t$, and we may\nbe interested in computing a low rank approximation to $A = f(\\sum_{t=1}^s\nA^t)$, where $f$ is a function which is applied entrywise to the matrix\n$\\sum_{t=1}^s A^t$. We show for a wide class of functions $f$ it is possible to\nefficiently compute a $d \\times d$ rank-$k$ projection matrix $P$ for which\n$\\|A - AP\\|_F^2 \\leq \\|A - [A]_k\\|_F^2 + \\varepsilon \\|A\\|_F^2$, where $AP$\ndenotes the projection of $A$ onto the row span of $P$, and $[A]_k$ denotes the\nbest rank-$k$ approximation to $A$ given by the singular value decomposition.\nThe communication cost of our protocols is $d \\cdot (sk/\\varepsilon)^{O(1)}$,\nand they succeed with high probability. Our framework allows us to efficiently\ncompute a low rank approximation to an entry-wise softmax, to a Gaussian kernel\nexpansion, and to $M$-Estimators applied entrywise (i.e., forms of robust low\nrank approximation). We also show that our additive error approximation is best\npossible, in the sense that any protocol achieving relative error for these\nproblems requires significantly more communication. Finally, we experimentally\nvalidate our algorithms on real datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2016 10:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Woodruff", "David P.", ""], ["Zhong", "Peilin", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07800", "submitter": "Gabriel Hollander", "authors": "Gabriel Hollander, Philippe Dreesen, Mariya Ishteva and Johan\n  Schoukens", "title": "Weighted tensor decomposition for approximate decoupling of multivariate\n  polynomials", "comments": "17 pages, 8 figures.

Attenuation functions describe the damping in\nlayers, and provide a matching of the wave impedance at the interface between\nthe domain of interest and the absorbing region. Selecting parameters in the\nattenuation functions is non-trivial. In this work, an optimisation procedure\nfor automatically calibrating matched layers is presented. The procedure is\nbased on solving optimisation problems constrained by partial differential\nequations with polynomial and piecewise-constant attenuation functions. We show\nexperimentally that, for finite element time domain simulations,\npiecewise-constant attenuation function are at least as efficient as quadratic\nattenuation functions. This observation leads us to introduce consecutive\nmatched layers as an alternative to perfectly matched layers, which can easily\nbe employed for problems with arbitrary geometries. Moreover, the use of\nconsecutive matched layers leads to a reduction in computational cost compared\nto perfectly matched layers. Examples are presented for acoustic, elastodynamic\nand electromagnetic problems.

However, the potential advantage of these methods depends critically\non the availability of efficient elliptic solvers. With spectral-element\nmethods, static condensation is a common approach to reduce the number of\ndegree of freedoms and to improve the condition of the algebraic equations. The\nresulting system is block-structured and the face-based operator well suited\nfor matrix-matrix multiplications. However, a straight-forward implementation\nscales super-linearly with the number of unknowns and, therefore, prohibits the\napplication to high polynomial degrees.

In comparison to\nprevious work it saves a factor larger than 3 and clearly outpaces unfactored\nvariants for all polynomial degrees.
