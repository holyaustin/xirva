This work proposes a class of adaptive sparse grid (also called\nadaptive multiresolution) local discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving\nHamilton-Jacobi equations in high dimensions. By using the sparse grid\ntechniques, we can treat moderately high dimensional cases. Adaptivity is\nincorporated to capture kinks and other local structures of the solutions. Two\nclasses of multiwavelets are used to achieve multiresolution, which are the\northonormal Alpert's multiwavelets and the interpolatory multiwavelets.\nNumerical tests in up to four dimensions are provided to validate the\nperformance of the method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 14:13:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Wei", ""], ["Huang", "Juntao", ""], ["Tao", "Zhanjing", ""], ["Cheng", "Yingda", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.05294", "submitter": "Lina Zhao", "authors": "Lina Zhao, Eric Chung", "title": "Adaptive staggered DG method for Darcy flows in fractured porous media", "comments": "20 pages, 16 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:2005.10955", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modeling flows in fractured porous media is important in applications.

The philosophy behind it is to\napproximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep\nneural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network.

In particular, both the\ndisplacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the\nhybrid finite element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and\ntrainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all\nthe residual loss components in a \"soft\" manner with Lagrange multipliers, the\nweakly imposed I/BCs cannot not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs\nare present.

Standard approaches, such as Ewald summation or the\nnaive application of the classical Fast Multipole Method, result in a cost per\nMetropolis-Hastings step which grows in proportion to some positive power of\nthe number of particles $N$ in the system. This prohibitively large cost\nprevents accurate simulations of systems with a sizeable number of particles.\nCurrently, large systems are often simulated by truncating the Coulomb\npotential which introduces uncontrollable systematic errors. In this paper we\npresent a new multilevel method which reduces the computational complexity to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(N))$ per Metropolis-Hastings step, while maintaining errors\nwhich are comparable to direct Ewald summation. We show that compared to\nrelated previous work, our approach reduces the overall cost by better\nbalancing time spent in the proposal- and acceptance- stages of each\nMetropolis-Hastings step. By simulating large systems with up to $N=10^5$\nparticles we demonstrate that our implementation is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art MC packages and allows the simulation of very large systems of\ncharged particles with accurate electrostatics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 09:21:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2021 13:14:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Saunders", "William Robert", ""], ["Grant", "James", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Eike Hermann", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16790", "submitter": "Philip Saltenberger", "authors": "Ralph John de la Cruz, Philip Saltenberger", "title": "Generic canonical forms for perplectic and symplectic normal matrices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.RA cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $B$ be some invertible Hermitian or skew-Hermitian matrix.

In the frequency domain, one solves a discretized\nHelmholtz equation, while in the time domain, the periodic solutions to a\ndiscretized wave equation are sought, e.g. by simulating for a long time with a\ntime-harmonic forcing term. Disadvantages of the time-domain method are that\nthe solutions are affected by temporal discretization errors and that the\nspatial discretization cannot be freely chosen, since it is inherited from the\ntime-domain scheme. In this work we address these issues. Given an indefinite\nlinear system satisfying certain properties, a matrix recurrence relation is\nconstructed, such that in the limit the exact discrete solution is obtained. By\niterating a large, finite number of times, an approximate solution is obtained,\nsimilarly as in a time-domain method for the Helmholtz equation. To improve the\nconvergence, the process is used as a preconditioner for GMRES, and the\ntime-harmonic forcing term is multiplied by a smooth window function. The\nconstruction is applied to a compact-stencil finite-difference discretization\nof the Helmholtz equation, for which previously no time-domain solver was\navailable.
