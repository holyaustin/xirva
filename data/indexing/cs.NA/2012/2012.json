The\nsubmatrix $W^k$ is obtained computing the affinity between all triangles and\nonly a few special triangles: those which are farthest in the defined metric.\nThis is equivalent to select a sample of columns of $W$ without constructing it\ncompletely. The proposed method is computationally cheaper than other\nsegmentation algorithms, since it only calculates few columns of $W$ and it\ndoes not require the eigendecomposition of $W$ or of any submatrix of $W$.\n  We prove that the orthogonal projection of $W$ on the space generated by the\ncolumns of $W^k$ coincides with the orthogonal projection of $W$ on the space\ngenerated by the $k$ eigenvectors computed by Nystr\\\"om's method using the\ncolumns of $W^k$ as a sample of $W$.

The goal of this paper is to introduce a\nnew approach having both properties of full accuracy and regularity. In order\nto obtain it, we propose a three-stage algorithm: first, the data is smoothed\nby subtracting an appropriate non-smooth data sequence; then a chosen high\norder linear approximation operator is applied to the smoothed data and\nfinally, an approximation with the proper singularity structure is reinstated\nby correcting the smooth approximation with the non-smooth element used in the\nfirst stage. We apply this approach to both cases of point-value data and of\ncell-average data, using the 4-point subdivision algorithm in the second stage.\nUsing the proposed approach we are able to construct approximations with high\nprecision, with high piecewise regularity, and without diffusion nor\noscillations in the presence of discontinuities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2020 22:23:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:32:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Amat", "Sergio", ""], ["Levin", "David", ""], ["Ruiz-\u00c1lvarez", "Juan", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.01666", "submitter": "Qiaohua Liu", "authors": "Qiaohua Liu, Qian Zhang, Dongmei Shen", "title": "Condition numbers of the mixed least squares-total least squares\n  problem: revisited", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new closed formula for the first order perturbation estimate of the mixed\nleast squares-total least squares (MTLS) solution is presented.

The purpose of this work is to construct special approximations in\ntime when the transition to a new level in time provided a set of standard\nproblems for the operator and not for the fractional power operator. Stable\nsplitting schemes with weights parameters are proposed for the additive\nrepresentation of rational approximation for a fractional power operator.\nPossibilities of using similar time approximations for other problems are\nnoted. The numerical solution of a two-dimensional non-stationary problem with\na fractional power of the Laplace operator is also presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Dec 2020 15:43:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Vabishchevich", "Petr N.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.03092", "submitter": "Yuning Yang", "authors": "Xianpeng Mao and Yuning Yang", "title": "Approximation Algorithms for Sparse Best Rank-1 Approximation to\n  Higher-Order Tensors", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.LG cs.NA math.OC stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Sparse tensor best rank-1 approximation (BR1Approx), which is a sparsity\ngeneralization of the dense tensor BR1Approx, and is a higher-order extension\nof the sparse matrix BR1Approx, is one of the most important problems in sparse\ntensor decomposition and related problems arising from statistics and machine\nlearning.

A lot of problems in applications\nare defined on bounded intervals or domains. Therefore, it is important in both\ntheory and application to construct all possible wavelets on intervals with\nsome desired properties from (bi)orthogonal (multi)wavelets on the real line.\nVanishing moments of compactly supported wavelets are the key property for\nsparse wavelet representations and are closely linked to polynomial\nreproduction of their underlying refinable (vector) functions. Boundary\nwavelets with low order vanishing moments often lead to undesired boundary\nartifacts as well as reduced sparsity and approximation orders near boundaries\nin applications.

WST-LSPG is a generalization of the space-time least-squares\nPetrov-Galerkin method (ST-LSPG). The main drawback of ST-LSPG is that it\nrequires solving a dense space-time system with a space-time basis that is\ncalculated over the entire global time domain, which can be unfeasible for\nlarge-scale applications. Instead of using a temporally-global space-time trial\nsubspace and minimizing the discrete-in-time full-order model (FOM) residual\nover an entire time domain, the proposed WST-LSPG approach addresses this\nweakness by (1) dividing the time simulation into time windows, (2) devising a\nunique low-dimensional space-time trial subspace for each window, and (3)\nminimizing the discrete-in-time space-time residual of the dynamical system\nover each window. This formulation yields a problem with coupling confined\nwithin each window, but sequential across the windows. To enable high-fidelity\ntrial subspaces characterized by a relatively minimal number of basis vectors,\nthis work proposes constructing space-time bases using tensor decompositions\nfor each window.

This discretization setting is motivated by the\nobservation that wave speeds of earth media tend to increase with depth due to\nsedimentation and consolidation processes. We demonstrate that the layer-wise\nfinite difference discretization approach has the potential to significantly\nreduce the simulation cost, compared to its counterpart that uses holistically\nuniform grids. Such discretizations are enabled by summation-by-parts finite\ndifference operators, which are standard finite difference operators with\nspecial adaptations near boundaries or interfaces, and simultaneous\napproximation terms, which are penalty terms appended to the discretized system\nto weakly impose boundary or interface conditions. Combined with specially\ndesigned interpolation operators, the discretized system is shown to preserve\nthe energy-conserving property of the continuous elastic wave equation, and a\nfortiori ensure the stability of the simulation. Numerical examples are\npresented to corroborate these analytical developments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Dec 2020 04:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Longfei", ""], ["Ghattas", "Omar", ""], ["Keyes", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.13870", "submitter": "Xueshuang Xiang", "authors": "Ziming Wang, Tao Cui, and Xueshuang Xiang", "title": "A Neural Network with Plane Wave Activation for Helmholtz Equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes a plane wave activation based neural network (PWNN) for\nsolving Helmholtz equation, the basic partial differential equation to\nrepresent wave propagation, e.g. acoustic wave, electromagnetic wave, and\nseismic wave.

To handle such negative physical parameters in the\ntime-domain, a two-step strategy is used: (i) assuming resonant (Drude-type)\neffective parameters in the frequency-domain; (ii) returning to the time-domain\nby applying the formalism of the auxiliary fields. We numerically show that, at\nthe designed central frequency, scattering of a cylindrical pressure wave\nincident upon a finite set of small rigid obstacles is drastically reduced\nafter a lapse of time, when they are placed in the close neighborhood of the\nexternal cloak. However, at short times, the external cloak behaves rather like\na superscatterer: the cloak itself scatters more than the set of scatterers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 21:14:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Guenneau", "Sebastien", ""], ["Lombard", "Bruno", ""], ["Bellis", "Cedric", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15433", "submitter": "Guozhi Dong", "authors": "Guozhi Dong, Hailong Guo, Zuoqiang Shi", "title": "Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on\n  point cloud", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A generic geometric error analysis framework for numerical solution of PDEs\non sub-manifolds is established.
