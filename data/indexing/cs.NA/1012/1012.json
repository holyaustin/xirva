As\nrank minimization problems are often converted to nuclear norm minimization\n(NNM) problems, they have to be solved iteratively and each iteration requires\ncomputing a singular value decomposition (SVD). Therefore, their solution\nsuffers from the high computation cost of multiple SVDs. To relieve this issue,\nwe propose using the block Lanczos method to compute the partial SVDs, where\nthe principal singular subspaces obtained in the previous iteration are used to\nstart the block Lanczos procedure. To avoid the expensive reorthogonalization\nin the Lanczos procedure, the block Lanczos procedure is performed for only a\nfew steps. Our block Lanczos with warm start (BLWS) technique can be adopted by\ndifferent algorithms that solve NNM problems. We present numerical results on\napplying BLWS to Robust PCA and Matrix Completion problems. Experimental\nresults show that our BLWS technique usually accelerates its host algorithm by\nat least two to three times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Dec 2010 01:59:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Dec 2010 07:39:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Zhouchen", ""], ["Wei", "Siming", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0736", "submitter": "Irene Vignon Clementel", "authors": "Irene Vignon-Clementel (INRIA Rocquencourt), C.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, named log-sum\nheuristic recovery (LHR), to learn the essential low-rank structure from\ncorrupted data. Different from traditional approaches, which directly utilize\n$\\ell_1$ norm to measure the sparseness, LHR introduces a more reasonable\nlog-sum measurement to enhance the sparsity in both the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure and in the sparse corruptions. Although the proposed LHR optimization\nis no longer convex, it still can be effectively solved by a\nmajorization-minimization (MM) type algorithm, with which the non-convex\nobjective function is iteratively replaced by its convex surrogate and LHR\nfinally falls into the general framework of reweighed approaches. We prove that\nthe MM-type algorithm can converge to a stationary point after successive\niteration. We test the performance of our proposed model by applying it to\nsolve two typical problems: robust principal component analysis (RPCA) and\nlow-rank representation (LRR).\n  For RPCA, we compare LHR with the benchmark Principal Component Pursuit (PCP)\nmethod from both the perspectives of simulations and practical applications.\nFor LRR, we apply LHR to compute the low-rank representation matrix for motion\nsegmentation and stock clustering. Experimental results on low rank structure\nlearning demonstrate that the proposed Log-sum based model performs much better\nthan the $\\ell_1$-based method on for data with higher rank and with denser\ncorruptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Dec 2010 03:54:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Apr 2011 15:28:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2012 15:37:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Deng", "Yue", ""], ["Dai", "Qionghai", ""], ["Liu", "Risheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Zengke", ""], ["Hu", "Sanqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2674", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Braeunig", "authors": "Jerome Guterl (IRMA), Jean-Philippe Braeunig (CEA DIF, INRIA Lorraine\n  / IECN / LSIIT / IRMA, LRC MESO), Nicolas Crouseilles (IRMA, INRIA Lorraine /\n  IECN / LSIIT / IRMA), Virginie Grandgirard (IRFM), Guillaume Latu (IRFM),\n  Michel Mehrenberger (IRMA, INRIA Lorraine / IECN / LSIIT / IRMA), Eric\n  Sonnendr\\\"ucker (IRMA, INRIA Lorraine / IECN / LSIIT / IRMA)", "title": "Test of some numerical limiters for the conservative PSM scheme for 4D\n  Drift-Kinetic simulations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-7467", "categories": "cs.NA math-ph math.MP math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this work is simulation of magnetised plasmas in the ITER\nproject framework.
