However, many applications require the incorporation\nof additional constraints on the parameters, e.g. arising due to physical\nconstraints. We propose a new variant of the ensemble Kalman inversion to\ninclude box constraints on the unknown parameters motivated by the theory of\nprojected preconditioned gradient flows. Based on the continuous time limit of\nthe constrained ensemble Kalman inversion, we discuss a complete convergence\nanalysis for linear forward problems. We adopt techniques from filtering which\nare crucial in order to improve the performance and establish a correct\ndescent, such as variance inflation. These benefits are highlighted through a\nnumber of numerical examples on various inverse problems based on partial\ndifferential equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2019 04:03:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Oct 2019 05:33:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chada", "Neil K.", ""], ["Schillings", "Claudia", ""], ["Weissmann", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.00728", "submitter": "Sebastian Franz Dr.", "authors": "Sebastian Franz", "title": "Continuous time integration for changing type systems", "comments": "14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider variational time integration using continuous Galerkin Petrov\nmethods applied to evolutionary systems of changing type.

It also has a long history in physics, ranging from the\nminimal action principle to finding ground states of disordered systems such as\nspin glasses. Proximal algorithms form a class of methods that are broadly\napplicable and are particularly well-suited to nonsmooth, constrained,\nlarge-scale, and distributed optimization problems. There are essentially five\nproximal algorithms currently known: Forward-backward splitting, Tseng\nsplitting, Douglas-Rachford, alternating direction method of multipliers, and\nthe more recent Davis-Yin. These methods sit on a higher level of abstraction\ncompared to gradient-based ones, with deep roots in nonlinear functional\nanalysis. We show that all of these methods are actually different\ndiscretizations of a single differential equation, namely, the simple gradient\nflow which dates back to Cauchy (1847). An important aspect behind many of the\nsuccess stories in machine learning relies on \"accelerating\" the convergence of\nfirst-order methods. We show that similar discretization schemes applied to\nNewton's equation with an additional dissipative force, which we refer to as\naccelerated gradient flow, allow us to obtain accelerated variants of all these\nproximal algorithms -- the majority of which are new although some recover\nknown cases in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these methods to\nstochastic settings, allowing us to make connections with Langevin and\nFokker-Planck equations.

Assuming it\nis given as a level set, the surface is represented by a set of points at which\nit intersects the intervals between grid points in a three-dimensional grid.\nThey are designated as primary or secondary. Discrete functions on the surface\nhave independent values at primary points, with values at secondary points\ndetermined by an equilibration process.

The notion \"safe\" means that\nthe objective function $f(x)$ during optimization should not violate a \"safety\"\nthreshold, for instance, a certain a priori given value $h$ in a maximization\nproblem. Thus, any new function evaluation (possibly corrupted by noise) must\nbe performed at \"safe points\" only, namely, at points $y$ for which it is known\nthat the objective function $f(y) > h$. The main difficulty here consists in\nthe fact that the used optimization algorithm should ensure that the safety\nconstraint will be satisfied at a point $y$ before evaluation of $f(y)$ will be\nexecuted. Thus, it is required both to determine the safe region $\\Omega$\nwithin the search domain~$D$ and to find the global maximum within $\\Omega$. An\nadditional difficulty consists in the fact that these problems should be solved\nin the presence of the noise. This paper starts with a theoretical study of the\nproblem and it is shown that even though the objective function $f(x)$\nsatisfies the Lipschitz condition, traditional Lipschitz minorants and\nmajorants cannot be used due to the presence of the noise. Then, a\n$\\delta$-Lipschitz framework and two algorithms using it are proposed to solve\nthe safe global maximization problem. The first method determines the safe area\nwithin the search domain and the second one executes the global maximization\nover the found safe region. For both methods a number of theoretical results\nrelated to their functioning and convergence is established. Finally, numerical\nexperiments confirming the reliability of the proposed procedures are\nperformed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2019 16:20:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Aug 2020 14:31:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sergeyev", "Yaroslav D.", "", "1 and 2"], ["Candelieri", "Antonio", "", "1 and 2"], ["Kvasov", "Dmitri E.", "", "1 and 2"], ["Perego", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.06016", "submitter": "Davide Palitta", "authors": "Davide Palitta and Valeria Simoncini", "title": "Optimality properties of Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin methods for linear\n  matrix equations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin methods are some of the most successful solution\nprocedures in numerical analysis.

Thereby we\nreduce the number of unknowns on each step from $n$ to $O(1)$, where $n$ is the\ndimension of the ODE system. We call this type of methods Minimal Residual\nMultistep (MRMS) methods.

We show that the order of the method and its\nzero-stability properties coincide with those of the used underlying BDF\nformula.

Therefore,\nour approach gives a painless way to extend these to high order accurate in\ntime schemes while maintaining their unconditional stability. In this sense, it\ncan be viewed as a variational analogue of Richardson extrapolation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:53:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:30:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zaitzeff", "Alexander", ""], ["Esedoglu", "Selim", ""], ["Garikipati", "Krishna", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.10251", "submitter": "Hehu Xie", "authors": "Fei Xu, Hehu Xie, Ning Zhang", "title": "A Parallel Augmented Subspace Method for Eigenvalue Problems", "comments": "23 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A type of parallel augmented subspace scheme for eigenvalue problems is\nproposed by using coarse space in the multigrid method.

The potential due to charges embedded in layered\nmedia is decomposed into a free space component and four types of reaction\nfield components, and the latter can be associated with the potential of a\npolarization source defined for each type. New multipole expansions (MEs) and\nlocal expansions (LEs), as well as the multipole to local (M2L) translation\noperators are derived for the reaction components, based on which the FMMs for\nreaction components are then proposed. The resulting FMM for charge\ninteractions in layered media is a combination of using the classic FMM for the\nfree space components and the new FMMs for the reaction field components. With\nthe help of a recurrence formula for the run-time computation of the\nSommerfeld-type integrals used in M2L translation operators, pre-computations\nof a large number of tables are avoided.

The choice of a representation fitting an optimization\nproblem can considerably simplify solving the problem. We consider the\nNonlinear Rotation-Invariant Coordinates (NRIC) that represent the nodal\npositions of a discrete triangular surface with fixed combinatorics as a vector\nthat stacks all edge lengths and dihedral angles of the mesh. It is known that\nthis representation associates a unique vector to an equivalence class of nodal\npositions that differ by a rigid body motion. Moreover, integrability\nconditions that ensure the existence of nodal positions that match a given\nvector of edge lengths and dihedral angles have been established. The goal of\nthis paper is to develop the machinery needed to use the NRIC for solving\ngeometric optimization problems. First, we use the integrability conditions to\nderive an implicit description of the space of discrete surfaces as a\nsubmanifold of an Euclidean space and a corresponding description of its\ntangent spaces. Secondly, we reformulate the integrability conditions using\nquaternions and provide explicit formulas for their first and second\nderivatives facilitating the use of Hessians in NRIC-based optimization\nproblems. Lastly, we introduce a fast and robust algorithm that reconstructs\nnodal positions from almost integrable NRIC. We demonstrate the benefits of\nthis approach on a collection of geometric optimization problems. Comparisons\nto alternative approaches indicate that NRIC-based optimization is particularly\neffective for problems involving near-isometric deformations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 13:27:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:25:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sassen", "Josua", ""], ["Heeren", "Behrend", ""], ["Hildebrandt", "Klaus", ""], ["Rumpf", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.11746", "submitter": "Constantin Popa", "authors": "A.
