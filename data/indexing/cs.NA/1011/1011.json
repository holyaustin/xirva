It is assumed that\neach coefficient of $F$ can be approximated to any specified error bound. The\npresented method is exact, complete and deterministic. Due to its similarities\nto the Descartes method, we also consider it practical and easy to implement.\nCompared to previous approaches, our new method achieves a significantly better\nbit complexity. It is further shown that the hardness of isolating the real\nroots of $F$ is exclusively determined by the geometry of the roots and not by\nthe complexity or the size of the coefficients. For the special case where $F$\nhas integer coefficients of maximal bitsize $\\tau$, our bound on the bit\ncomplexity writes as $\\tilde{O}(n^3\\tau^2)$ which improves the best bounds\nknown for existing practical algorithms by a factor of $n=deg F$. The crucial\nidea underlying the new approach is to run an approximate version of the\nDescartes method, where, in each subdivision step, we only consider\napproximations of the intermediate results to a certain precision. We give an\nupper bound on the maximal precision that is needed for isolating the roots of\n$F$. For integer polynomials, this bound is by a factor $n$ lower than that of\nthe precision needed when using exact arithmetic explaining the improved bound\non the bit complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 15:29:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 13:26:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sagraloff", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1599", "submitter": "Hiroshi Abe", "authors": "Hiroshi Abe", "title": "A Stable Explicit Scheme for Solving Non-Homogeneous Constant\n  Coefficients Equation using Green's Function", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author. 15 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A numerical explicit method to evaluates transient solutions of linear\npartial differential non-homogeneous equation with constant coefficients is\nproposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Nov 2010 00:47:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Nov 2010 02:24:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Abe", "Hiroshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1716", "submitter": "Anil Hirani", "authors": "Anil N.

The vertices are the\nalternatives, and the edge values comprise the comparison data. The basic idea\nis very simple and old: come up with values on vertices such that their\ndifferences match the given edge data. Since an exact match will usually be\nimpossible, one settles for matching in a least squares sense. This formulation\nwas first described by Leake in 1976 for rankingfootball teams and appears as\nan example in Professor Gilbert Strang's classic linear algebra textbook. If\none is willing to look into the residual a little further, then the problem\nreally comes alive, as shown effectively by the remarkable recent paper of\nJiang et al. With or without this twist, the humble least squares problem on\ngraphs has far-reaching connections with many current areas ofresearch. These\nconnections are to theoretical computer science (spectral graph theory, and\nmultilevel methods for graph Laplacian systems); numerical analysis (algebraic\nmultigrid, and finite element exterior calculus); other mathematics (Hodge\ndecomposition, and random clique complexes); and applications (arbitrage, and\nranking of sports teams). Not all of these connections are explored in this\npaper, but many are. The underlying ideas are easy to explain, requiring only\nthe four fundamental subspaces from elementary linear algebra. One of our aims\nis to explain these basic ideas and connections, to get researchers in many\nfields interested in this topic. Another aim is to use our numerical\nexperiments for guidance on selecting methods and exposing the need for further\ndevelopment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Nov 2010 06:41:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2011 19:57:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 5 Sep 2011 18:19:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 14:08:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hirani", "Anil N.", ""], ["Kalyanaraman", "Kaushik", ""], ["Watts", "Seth", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.2306", "submitter": "AbdelRahman Karawia Dr.", "authors": "A.

Accordingly, the SVD can\nimprove retrieval performance of an information retrieval system since queries\nmade to the approximate matrix can retrieve more relevant documents and filter\nout more irrelevant documents than the same queries made to the original\nmatrix. By utilizing this fact, we will devise an LSI algorithm that mimicks\nSVD capability in clustering related vertices. Convergence analysis shows that\nthe algorithm is convergent and produces a unique solution for each input.\nExperimental results using some standard datasets in LSI research show that\nretrieval performances of the algorithm are comparable to the SVD's.
