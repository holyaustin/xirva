The\nlogarithmic norm was originally introduced by G. Dahlquist in 1958 as a tool to\nstudy the growth of solutions to ordinary differential equations and for\nestimating the error growth in discretization methods for their approximate\nsolutions. We extend the concept to the stability analysis of It\\^o stochastic\ndifferential equations with multiplicative noise. Stability estimates for\nlinear It\\^o SDEs using the one, two and $\\infty$-norms in the $l$-th mean,\nwhere $1 \\leq l < \\infty $, are derived and the application of the stochastic\nlogarithmic norm is illustrated with examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2008 14:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmad", "Sk.
