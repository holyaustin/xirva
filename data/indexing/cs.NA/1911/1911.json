Recently, so-called full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP)\napproximation methods have been introduced to tackle the problem of\napproximately solving high-dimensional PDEs. MLP approximation methods\ncurrently are, to the best of our knowledge, the only methods for parabolic\nsemi-linear PDEs with general time horizons and general initial conditions for\nwhich there is a rigorous proof that they are indeed able to beat the curse of\ndimensionality. The main purpose of this work is to investigate MLP\napproximation methods in more depth, to reveal more clearly how these methods\ncan overcome the curse of dimensionality, and to propose a generalised class of\nMLP approximation schemes, which covers previously analysed MLP approximation\nschemes as special cases. In particular, we develop an abstract framework in\nwhich this class of generalised MLP approximations can be formulated and\nanalysed and, thereafter, apply this abstract framework to derive a\ncomputational complexity result for suitable MLP approximations for semi-linear\nheat equations. These resulting MLP approximations for semi-linear heat\nequations essentially are generalisations of previously introduced MLP\napproximations for semi-linear heat equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2019 11:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Giles", "Michael B.", ""], ["Jentzen", "Arnulf", ""], ["Welti", "Timo", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.03550", "submitter": "Genevi\\`eve Dusson", "authors": "Genevieve Dusson, Markus Bachmayr, Gabor Csanyi, Ralf Drautz, Simon\n  Etter, Cas van der Oord, Christoph Ortner", "title": "Atomic Cluster Expansion: Completeness, Efficiency and Stability", "comments": "Title has changed in v3", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Atomic Cluster Expansion (Drautz, Phys.

This\nrelationship, together with a corresponding connection to negative-norm\nleast-squares, is described in detail.

The\nleast-squares functional is continuous and coercive in an $H^{-1}$-type norm,\nbut not $L^2$-coercive. Nevertheless, the $L^2$ convergence properties of the\nmethod are discussed. Convergence can be obtained either by an explicit\nregularization of the functional, that provides control of the $L^2$ norm, or\nby properly choosing the finite element spaces, providing implicit control of\nthe $L^2$ norm. Numerical results for the inviscid Burgers equation with\ndiscontinuous source terms are shown, demonstrating the $L^2$ convergence of\nthe obtained approximations to the physically admissible solution. The\nnumerical method utilizes a least-squares functional, minimized on finite\nelement spaces, and a Gauss-Newton technique with nested iteration.

The key contribution of the main result of\nthis article is to develop the techniques to obtain error estimates between\nsolutions of PDEs and approximating ANNs in the uniform $L^\\infty$-sense. In\nparticular, we prove that the number of parameters of an ANN to uniformly\napproximate the classical solution of the heat equation in a region $ [a,b]^d $\nfor a fixed time point $ T \\in (0,\\infty) $ grows at most polynomially in the\ndimension $ d \\in \\mathbb{N} $ and the reciprocal of the approximation\nprecision $ \\varepsilon > 0 $. This shows that ANNs can overcome the curse of\ndimensionality in the numerical approximation of the heat equation when the\nerror is measured in the uniform $L^\\infty$-norm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:29:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 08:00:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 05:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Gonon", "Lukas", ""], ["Grohs", "Philipp", ""], ["Jentzen", "Arnulf", ""], ["Kofler", "David", ""], ["\u0160i\u0161ka", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.09843", "submitter": "Jin Woo Jang", "authors": "Hyung Ju Hwang, Jin Woo Jang, Hyeontae Jo, Jae Yong Lee", "title": "Trend to Equilibrium for the Kinetic Fokker-Planck Equation via the\n  Neural Network Approach", "comments": "31 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109665", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.LG cs.NA physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The issue of the relaxation to equilibrium has been at the core of the\nkinetic theory of rarefied gas dynamics.

However, the previous multilevel ILU techniques still lacked\nrobustness and efficiency for some large-scale saddle-point problems, which\noften arise from systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).

As a multilevel preconditioner, HILUCSI statically and\ndynamically permutes individual rows and columns to the next level for deferred\nfactorization. Unlike ILUPACK, HILUCSI applies symmetric preprocessing\ntechniques at the top levels but always uses unsymmetric preprocessing and\nunsymmetric factorization at the coarser levels. The deferring combined with\nmixed preprocessing enabled a unified treatment for nearly or partially\nsymmetric systems, and simplified the implementation by avoiding mixed $1\\times\n1$ and $2\\times 2$ pivots for symmetric indefinite systems. We show that this\ncombination improves robustness for indefinite systems without compromising\nefficiency. Furthermore, to enable superior efficiency for large-scale systems\nwith millions or more unknowns, HILUCSI introduces a scalability-oriented\ndropping in conjunction with a variant of inverse-based dropping.

The mathematical problem of inverse wave\nscattering is to recover the scatterer field of a medium based on the boundary\nmeasurement of the scattered wave from the medium, which is high-dimensional\nand nonlinear. For the far field pattern problem under the circular\nexperimental setup, a perturbative analysis shows that the forward map can be\napproximated by a vectorized convolution operator in the angular direction.\nMotivated by this and filtered back-projection, we propose an effective neural\nnetwork architecture for the inverse map using the recently introduced BCR-Net\nalong with the standard convolution layers. Analogously for the seismic imaging\nproblem, we propose a similar neural network architecture under the rectangular\ndomain setup with a depth-dependent background velocity.
