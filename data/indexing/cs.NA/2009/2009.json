The model equations can be regarded as a hyperbolic regularization\nand are derived from kinetic equations. So far, the research on QGD models has\nbeen focused on problems with constant coefficients. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the QGD model in multiscale media, which can be used in porous\nmedia applications. This multiscale problem is interesting from a multiscale\nmethodology point of view as the model problem has a hyperbolic multiscale\nterm, and designing multiscale methods for hyperbolic equations is challenging.\nIn the paper, we apply the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale\nfinite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) combined with the leapfrog scheme in time to\nsolve this problem. The CEM-GMsFEM provides a flexible and systematical\nframework to construct crucial multiscale basis functions for approximating the\nsolution to the problem with reduced computational cost. With this approach of\nspatial discretization, we establish the stability of the fully discretized\nscheme under a relaxed version of the so-called CFL condition.

In this\narticle we clarify a common misperception of the EIM as originally introduced\nand used in practice in GW science. Namely, we prove that the EIM at each\niteration chooses the interpolation nodes so as to make the related\nVandermonde-type matrix as invertible as possible; not necessarily optimizing\nits conditioning or accuracy of the interpolant as is sometimes thought. In\nfact, we introduce two new variations of the EIM, nested as well, which do\noptimize with respect to conditioning and the Lebesgue constant, respectively,\nand compare them through numerical experiments with the original EIM using GWs.\nOur analyses and numerical results suggest a subtle relationship between\nsolving for the original EIM, conditioning, and the Lebesgue constant, in\nconsonance with active research in rigorous approximation theory and related\nfields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 02:08:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Apr 2021 23:24:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Tiglio", "Manuel", ""], ["Villanueva", "Aar\u00f3n", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06178", "submitter": "Chaoyu Quan", "authors": "Chaoyu Quan, Tao Tang, and Jiang Yang", "title": "Numerical Energy Dissipation for Time-Fractional Phase-Field Equations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The numerical integration of phase-field equations is a delicate task which\nneeds to recover at the discrete level intrinsic properties of the solution\nsuch as energy dissipation and maximum principle.

The intensities of the\norders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on\nunobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control\nproblem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering,\ncontrol and PDMPs theory. The value function is characterized as the unique\ncontinuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation and\nnumerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal full\ninformation spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is\nunknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty\nin terms of PnL sensitivity and observable order flow volatility.\n  The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic impulse\ncontrol games.

A\npolicy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of\nquasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring\nresults.\n  Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and an\nimproved algorithm is put forward.

The rIGA framework conserves the\ndesirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA)\ndiscretizations while reducing the computation cost of the solution through\npartitioning the computational domain by adding zero-continuity basis\nfunctions. As a result, rIGA enriches the approximation space and decreases the\ninterconnection between degrees of freedom. We compare computational costs of\nrIGA versus those of IGA when employing a Lanczos eigensolver with a\nshift-and-invert spectral transformation. When all eigenpairs within a given\ninterval ${[\\lambda_s,\\lambda_e]}$ are of interest, we select several shifts\n${\\sigma_k\\in[\\lambda_s,\\lambda_e]}$ using a spectrum slicing technique. For\neach shift $\\sigma_k$, the cost of factorization of the spectral transformation\nmatrix ${K-\\sigma_k M}$ drives the total computational cost of the\neigensolution. Several multiplications of the operator matrices ${(K-\\sigma_k\nM)^{-1} M}$ by vectors follow this factorization. Let $p$ be the polynomial\ndegree of basis functions and assume that IGA has maximum continuity of\n${p-1}$, while rIGA introduces $C^0$ separators to minimize the factorization\ncost. For this setup, our theoretical estimates predict computational savings\nto compute a fixed number of eigenpairs of up to ${O(p^2)}$ in the asymptotic\nregime, that is, large problem sizes.

Three forms\nof loss functions are investigated based on vorticity-velocity-pressure,\nvelocity-stress-pressure, and velocity-gradient of velocity-pressure\nformulations of the Stokes equation. We first conduct a systematic study of the\nMscaleDNN methods with various loss functions on the Kovasznay flow in\ncomparison with normal fully connected DNNs. Then, Stokes flows with highly\noscillatory solutions in a 2-D domain with six randomly placed holes are\nsimulated by the MscaleDNN. The results show that MscaleDNN has faster\nconvergence and consistent error decays in the simulation of Kovasznay flow for\nall four tested loss functions. More importantly, the MscaleDNN is capable of\nlearning highly oscillatory solutions when the normal DNNs fail to converge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Sep 2020 02:18:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:24:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Bo", ""], ["Zhang", "Wenzhong", ""], ["Cai", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.12768", "submitter": "Kaihang Guo", "authors": "Kaihang Guo and Jesse Chan", "title": "High order weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin methods for wave\n  propagation on moving curved meshes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jcp.2019.108971", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents high order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods\nfor wave problems on moving curved meshes with general choices of basis and\nquadrature.

Our hope is to put things into a perspective that will\nhelp to integrate machine learning with computational mathematics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 23:16:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["E", "Weinan", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14713", "submitter": "Ralf Kornhuber", "authors": "Tobias Kies and Carsten Gr\\\"aser and Luigi Delle Site and Ralf\n  Kornhuber", "title": "Free energy computation of particles with membrane-mediated interactions\n  via Langevin dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We apply well-established concepts of Langevin sampling to derive a new class\nof algorithms for the efficient computation of free energy differences of\nfluctuating particles embedded in a 'fast' membrane, i.e., a membrane that\ninstantaneously adapts to varying particle positions.
