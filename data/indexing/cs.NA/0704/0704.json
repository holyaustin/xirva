An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)\noptimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple\nProjects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability\ndistributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability\ndistributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on\nschedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to\ndevelop a relative risk analysis among projects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2007 14:35:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ingber", "Lester", ""]]}]
