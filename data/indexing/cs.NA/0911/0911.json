All possible cases pertaining to the number\nof variables, n, and the number of equations, m, are dealt with. A solution is\nsought not as a fuzzy vector, as usual, but as a fuzzy set of vectors. Each\nvector in the solution set solves the given fuzzy linear system with a certain\npossibility. Assuming that the coefficient matrix is a full rank matrix, three\ncases are considered: For m = n (square system), the solution set is shown to\nbe a parallelepiped in coordinate space and is expressed by an explicit\nformula. For m > n (overdetermined system), the solution set is proved to be a\nconvex polyhedron and a novel geometric method is proposed to compute it. For m\n< n (underdetermined system), by determining the contribution of free\nvariables, general solution is computed. From the results of three cases\nmentioned above, a method is proposed to handle the general case, in which the\ncoefficient matrix is not necessarily a full rank matrix.
