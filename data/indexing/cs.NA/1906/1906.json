RIOT is tested using the standard\nLorenz-96 model (L-96) as well as two realistic high-dimensional atmospheric\nsource inversion problems based on aircraft observations of black carbon\nconcentrations. A new outer-loop preconditioning technique tailored to RSVD was\nintroduced to improve convergence stability and performance. Results obtained\nwith the L-96 system show that the performance improvement from RIOT compared\nto standard CG algorithms increases significantly with non-linearities.\nOverall, in the realistic black carbon source inversion experiments, RIOT\nreduces the wall-time of the 4D-Var minimization by a factor 2-3, at the cost\nof a factor 4-10 increase in energy cost due to the large number of parallel\ncores used. Furthermore, RIOT enables reduction of the wall-time computation of\nthe analysis error covariance matrix by a factor 40 compared to a standard\niterative Lanczos approach.

In this scheme, each\nproblem is treated individually using various DD approaches and specialized\nnumerical methods. The coupling between the different problems is explicit and\nthe time-marching is with no iterations. To adapt to different time scales of\nproblem components and different rock types, the novel scheme uses a multirate\ntime stepping strategy, by taking multiple finer time steps for\nsaturation-advection within one coarse time step for saturation-diffusion and\npressure, and permits independent time steps for the advection step in the\ndifferent rocks. In the second scheme, we review the classical Implicit\nPressure--Explicit Saturation (IMPES) method (by decoupling only pressure and\nsaturation) in the context of multirate coupling schemes and\nnonconforming-in-time DD approaches. For the discretization, the\nsaturation-advection problem is approximated with the explicit Euler method in\ntime, and in space with the cell-centered finite volume method of first order\nof Godunov type.

One of the approaches is\nmulti-continuum technique, where every process in each continuum is modeled\nseparately and an interaction term is added. Direct numerical simulation in\nmulti scale media is usually not practicable. For this reason, one constructs\nthe corresponding homogenized equations. The paper develops a hierarchical\napproach for solving cell problems at a dense network of macroscopic points\nwith an essentially optimal computation cost. The method employs the fact that\nneighboring representative volume elements (RVEs) share similar features; and\neffective properties of the neighboring RVEs are close to each other. The\nhierarchical approach reduces computation cost by using different levels of\nresolution for cell problems at different macroscopic points. The method\nrequires a hierarchy of macroscopic grid points and a corresponding nested\napproximation spaces with different levels of resolution. Each level of\nmacroscopic points is assigned to an approximation finite element (FE) space\nwhich is used to solve the cell problems at the macroscopic points in that\nlevel. We prove rigorously that this hierarchical method achieves the same\nlevel of accuracy as that of the full solve where cell problems at every\nmacroscopic point are solved using the FE spaces with the highest level of\nresolution, but at the essentially optimal computation cost. Numerical\nimplementation that computes effective permeabilities of a two scale\nmulticontinuum system via the numerical solutions of the cell problems supports\nthe analytical results.

When the counts of the species are sufficiently\nlarge, the dynamics of their concentrations are typically modeled via a system\nof differential equations. However, when the counts of some species are small,\nthe dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete\nstate, continuous time Markov chain. A key quantity of interest for such models\nis the probability mass function of the process at some fixed time. Since paths\nof such models are relatively straightforward to simulate, we can estimate the\nprobabilities by constructing an empirical distribution. However, the support\nof the distribution is often diffuse across a high-dimensional state space,\nwhere the dimension is equal to the number of species. Therefore generating an\naccurate empirical distribution can come with a large computational cost.

This is of special importance in an\nindustrial environment because in the online phase of the PGD ROM the\ndescription of the flow for a specific set of parameters is obtained simply via\ninterpolation of the generalised solution, without the need of any extra\nsolution step. On the one hand, the spatial problems arising from the PGD\nseparation of the unknowns are treated using the classical solution strategies\nof OpenFOAM, namely the semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations\n(SIMPLE) algorithm. On the other hand, the parametric iteration is solved via a\ncollocation approach. The resulting ROM is applied to several benchmark tests\nof laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes flows, in two and three dimensions,\nwith different parameters affecting the flow features.

With a mathematically rigorous error estimator, RBM seeks a\nsurrogate solution in a carefully-built subspace of the parameter-induced high\nfidelity solution manifold. It can improve efficiency by several orders of\nmagnitudes leveraging an offline-online decomposition procedure.

These are stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency\ndegradation inherent to a direct application of EIM. There are two ingredients\nof these methods. First is a strategy to collocate at about twice as many\nlocations as the number of bases for the surrogate space. The second is an\nefficient approach for the strategic selection of the parameter values to build\nthe reduced solution space for which we study two choices, a recent empirical\nL1 approach and a new indicator based on the reduced residual.

The\nindependent fields of the mixed formulations are the displacement, the\ndisplacement gradient, and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress. A pressure-like\nfield is also introduced in the case of incompressible elasticity.

Historically, one of the prevalent methods to\naccount for this uncertainty has been the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method.\nRecently, improved sampling methods have been proposed, based on the idea of\nvariance reduction by employing a hierarchy of mesh refinements. We combine an\nh- and p-refinement hierarchy with the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) and\nMultilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC) method.

The\nuncertainty is either modeled by means of one random variable sampled from a\nunivariate Gamma distribution or with multiple random variables sampled from a\ngamma random field.

To overcome the difficulties associated with this\nhighly nonlinear operator, we design numerical algorithms based on the\nstructures of the individual energy terms. A Fourier pseudo-spectral\napproximation is taken in space, in such a way that the energy structure is\nrespected, and summation-by-parts formulae enable us to study the discrete\nenergy stability for such a high-order spatial discretization. In the temporal\napproximation, a second order BDF stencil is applied, combined with an\nappropriate extrapolation for the concave diffusion term(s). A second order\nartificial Douglas-Dupont-type regularization term is added to ensure energy\nstability, and a careful analysis leads to the artificial linear diffusion\ncoming at an order lower that that of surface diffusion term. Such a choice\nleads to reduced numerical dissipation. At a theoretical level, the unique\nsolvability, energy stability are established, and an optimal rate convergence\nanalysis is derived in the $\\ell^\\infty (0,T; \\ell^2) \\cap \\ell^2 (0,T; H_N^3)$\nnorm. In the numerical implementation, the preconditioned steepest descent\n(PSD) iteration is applied to solve for the composition of the highly nonlinear\n4-Laplacian term and the standard Laplacian term, and a geometric convergence\nis assured for such an iteration.
