NMF attempts to approximate a matrix with\nnonnegative entries by a product of two low-rank matrices, also with\nnonnegative entries. We propose an algorithm called rank-one downdate (R1D) for\ncomputing a NMF that is partly motivated by singular value decomposition. This\nalgorithm computes the dominant singular values and vectors of adaptively\ndetermined submatrices of a matrix. On each iteration, R1D extracts a rank-one\nsubmatrix from the dataset according to an objective function. We establish a\ntheoretical result that maximizing this objective function corresponds to\ncorrectly classifying articles in a nearly separable corpus. We also provide\ncomputational experiments showing the success of this method in identifying\nfeatures in realistic datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2008 17:59:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Biggs", "Michael", ""], ["Ghodsi", "Ali", ""], ["Vavasis", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0510", "submitter": "Thomas Blumensath", "authors": "Thomas Blumensath and Mike E.

Previous work has considered the WTM\nproblem in the high signal to interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) regime, where\nthe problem can be approximated and transformed into a convex optimization\nproblem through proper change of variables. In the general SINR regime,\nhowever, the approximation and transformation approach does not work. This\npaper proposes an algorithm, MAPEL, which globally converges to a global\noptimal solution of the WTM problem in the general SINR regime. The MAPEL\nalgorithm is designed based on three key observations of the WTM problem: (1)\nthe objective function is monotonically increasing in SINR, (2) the objective\nfunction can be transformed into a product of exponentiated linear fraction\nfunctions, and (3) the feasible set of the equivalent transformed problem is\nalways normal although not necessarily convex. The MAPLE algorithm finds the\ndesired optimal power control solution by constructing a series of polyblocks\nthat approximate the feasible SINR region in increasing precision. Furthermore,\nby tuning the approximation factor in MAPEL, we could engineer a desirable\ntradeoff between optimality and convergence time. MAPEL provides an important\nbenchmark for performance evaluation of other heuristic algorithms targeting\nthe same problem. With the help of MAPEL, we evaluate the performance of\nseveral respective algorithms through extensive simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 May 2008 15:04:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 12:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Liping", ""], ["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}]
