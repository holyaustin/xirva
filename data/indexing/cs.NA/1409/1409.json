In Boris-SDC, the Boris method, a second-order Lorentz force\nintegrator based on velocity-Verlet, is used as a sweeper/preconditioner. The\npresented method provides a generic way to extend the classical Boris\nintegrator, which is widely used in essentially all particle-based plasma\nphysics simulations involving magnetic fields, to a high-order method.\nStability, convergence order and conservation properties of the method are\ndemonstrated for different simulation setups. Boris-SDC reproduces the expected\nhigh order of convergence for a single particle and for the center-of-mass of a\nparticle cloud in a Penning trap and shows good long-term energy stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 14:28:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:33:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Winkel", "Mathias", ""], ["Speck", "Robert", ""], ["Ruprecht", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.7852", "submitter": "Sivaram Ambikasaran", "authors": "Sivaram Ambikasaran", "title": "Generalized Rybicki Press algorithm", "comments": "13 pages, 11 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.DS cs.NA stat.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article discusses a more general and numerically stable Rybicki Press\nalgorithm, which enables inverting and computing determinants of covariance\nmatrices, whose elements are sums of exponentials.

The only access to these\nfunctions is through stochastic gradient oracles, each of which is only\navailable at a different node, and a limited number of gradient oracle calls is\nallowed at each node. In this framework, we introduce a convex optimization\nalgorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates. Particularly,\nwe use a carefully designed time-dependent weighted averaging of the SGD\niterates, which yields a convergence rate of\n$O\\left(\\frac{N\\sqrt{N}}{T}\\right)$ after $T$ gradient updates for each node on\na network of $N$ nodes. We then show that after $T$ gradient oracle calls, the\naverage SGD iterate achieves a mean square deviation (MSD) of\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{T}\\right)$. This rate of convergence is optimal as it\nmatches the performance lower bound up to constant terms. Similar to the SGD\nalgorithm, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm also scales\nlinearly with the dimensionality of the data. Furthermore, the communication\nload of the proposed method is the same as the communication load of the SGD\nalgorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in terms of\ncomplexity and communication load. We illustrate the merits of the algorithm\nwith respect to the state-of-art methods over benchmark real life data sets and\nwidely studied network topologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 15:17:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 15:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Vanli", "N.
