The number nu\nquantifies the \"degree of incoherence\" between the unknown matrix and the\nbasis.

The proof\nconsists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast\nto the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable\nresults. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are\nslightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all\nlow-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that O(n r nu log n)\nrandomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix\nwith high probability.
