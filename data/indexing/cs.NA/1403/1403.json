Bayesian inference\nprovides a principled way for regularizing the problem using prior knowledge. A\nfundamental choice is how one measures \"distances\" between shapes in an image.\nIt has been shown that the straightforward geometric L2 distance is degenerate\nand leads to pathological situations. This is avoided when using Sobolev\ngradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high\ncomputational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however,\nhave hampered practical applications. We show how particle methods as applied\nto image segmentation allow for a simple and computationally efficient\nimplementation of Sobolev gradients. We show that the evaluation of Sobolev\ngradients amounts to particle-particle interactions along the contour in an\nimage. We extend an existing particle-based segmentation algorithm to using\nSobolev gradients. Using synthetic and real-world images, we benchmark the\nresults for both 2D and 3D images using piecewise smooth and piecewise constant\nregion models. The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8\nto 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the\nknown favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by\nusing local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson\nequation at each iteration. The computational time per iteration is higher for\nSobolev gradients than for L2 gradients. Since Sobolev gradients precondition\nthe optimization problem, however, a smaller number of overall iterations may\nbe necessary for the algorithm to converge, which can in some cases amortize\nthe higher per-iteration cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 16:58:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sbalzarini", "Ivo F.", ""], ["Schneider", "Sophie", ""], ["Cardinale", "Janick", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0952", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Oded Maler (CNRS-VERIMAG)", "title": "Algorithmic Verification of Continuous and Hybrid Systems", "comments": "In Proceedings INFINITY 2013, arXiv:1402.6610", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 140, 2014, pp. 48-69", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.140.4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.FL cs.LO cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a tutorial introduction to reachability computation, a class of\ncomputational techniques that exports verification technology toward continuous\nand hybrid systems.
