We analyze the Random Pursuit algorithm, which iteratively computes\nan approximate solution to the optimization problem by repeated optimization\nover a randomly chosen one-dimensional subspace. This randomized method only\nuses zeroth-order information about the objective function and does not need\nany problem-specific parametrization. We prove convergence and give convergence\nrates for smooth objectives assuming that the one-dimensional optimization can\nbe solved exactly or approximately by an oracle. A convenient property of\nRandom Pursuit is its invariance under strictly monotone transformations of the\nobjective function. It thus enjoys identical convergence behavior on a wider\nfunction class. To support the theoretical results we present extensive\nnumerical performance results of Random Pursuit, two gradient-free algorithms\nrecently proposed by Nesterov, and a classical adaptive step-size random search\nscheme. We also present an accelerated heuristic version of the Random Pursuit\nalgorithm which significantly improves standard Random Pursuit on all numerical\nbenchmark problems. A general comparison of the experimental results reveals\nthat (i) standard Random Pursuit is effective on strongly convex functions with\nmoderate condition number, and (ii) the accelerated scheme is comparable to\nNesterov's fast gradient method and outperforms adaptive step-size strategies.\n  The appendix contains additional supporting online material.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2011 13:08:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2012 19:00:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Stich", "Sebastian U.", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Christian L.", ""], ["G\u00e4rtner", "Bernd", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1491", "submitter": "Sushant Sachdeva", "authors": "Lorenzo Orecchia, Sushant Sachdeva, Nisheeth K.

This settles\nthe question of designing asymptotically optimal spectral algorithms for\nbalanced separator. Our algorithm relies on a variant of the heat kernel random\nwalk and requires, as a subroutine, an algorithm to compute \\exp(-L)v where L\nis the Laplacian of a graph related to G and v is a vector. Algorithms for\ncomputing the matrix-exponential-vector product efficiently comprise our next\nset of results. Our main result here is a new algorithm which computes a good\napproximation to \\exp(-A)v for a class of PSD matrices A and a given vector u,\nin time roughly \\tilde{O}(m_A), where m_A is the number of non-zero entries of\nA. This uses, in a non-trivial way, the result of Spielman and Teng on\ninverting SDD matrices in \\tilde{O}(m_A) time. Finally, we prove e^{-x} can be\nuniformly approximated up to a small additive error, in a non-negative interval\n[a,b] with a polynomial of degree roughly \\sqrt{b-a}.
