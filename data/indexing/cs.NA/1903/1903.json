The\ngeometry of a domain element is approximated by a complete Pascal polynomial.\nThe interpolation procedure is formulated in a natural coordinate system. It\nalso presents the methodology of constructing shape functions of Pascal type\nand establishing a transformation relation between natural and Cartesian\nvariables. The performance of the presented approach is investigated firstly by\ncalculating the geometrical properties of an arbitrary quadrilateral\ncross-section like area and moments of inertia and comparing the results with\nthe exact values and with those provided by the standard linear approach and a\nserendipity family approach. Secondly, the assessment of the scheme follows\nusing a straight-sided, compatible quadrilateral finite element for plate\nbending of which geometry is approximated by a complete set of second order\nwith six free parameters. Triangular and quadrilateral shaped plates with\ndifferent boundary conditions are computed and compared with well-known results\nin the literature. The presented procedure is of general applicability for\nelements with curved edges and not limited to straight-sided edges in the\nframework of numerical methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 20:46:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Diab", "Sulaiman Y.

The volume-penalty method is a kind of\nfictitious-domain method that approximates no-slip boundary conditions with\nrapid linear damping inside the object. The method can then simulate complex,\nmoving objects in general numerical solvers without specialised algorithms or\nboundary-conforming grids. Volume penalisation pays for this simplicity by\nintroducing an equation-level error, the $\\textit{model error}$, that is\nrelated to the damping time $\\eta \\ll 1$. While the model error has been proven\nto vanish as the damping time tends to zero, previous work suggests convergence\nat a slow rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\eta^{1/2})$. The stiffness of the damping\nimplies conventional volume penalisation only achieves first order numerical\naccuracy. We analyse the volume-penalty method using multiple-scales\nmatched-asymptotics with a signed-distance coordinate system valid for\narbitrary smooth geometries. We show the dominant model error stems from a\ndisplacement length that is proportional to a Reynolds number $\\text{Re}$\ndependent boundary layer of size $\\mathcal{O}(\\eta^{1/2}\\text{Re}^{-1/2})$. The\nrelative size of the displacement length and damping time leads to multiple\nerror regimes. Our key finding derives a simple smoothing prescription for the\ndamping that eliminates the displacement length and reduces the model error to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\eta)$ in all regimes. This translates to second order numerical\naccuracy. We validate our findings in several comprehensive benchmark problems\nand finally combine Richardson extrapolation of the model error with our\ncorrection to further improve convergence to $\\mathcal{O}(\\eta^{2})$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 12:27:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 04:10:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 08:43:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2020 02:09:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hester", "Eric W.", ""], ["Vasil", "Geoffrey M.", ""], ["Burns", "Keaton J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.12234", "submitter": "Thomas Richter", "authors": "Stefan Frei and Thomas Richter", "title": "Efficient approximation of flow problems with multiple scales in time", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation 18(2), 2020", "doi": "10.1137/19M1258396", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we address flow problems that carry a multiscale character in\ntime.

We derive an averaging scheme that is of\nfirst order with respect to the ratio of time-scales $\\epsilon$. In order to\ncope with the problem of unknown initial data for the fast scale problem, we\nassume near-periodicity in time. Moreover, we construct a second-order accurate\ntime discretisation scheme and derive a complete error analysis for a\ncorresponding simplified ODE system. The resulting multiscale scheme does not\nask for the continuous simulation of the fast scale variable and shows powerful\nspeed-ups up to 1:10000 compared to a resolved simulation. Finally, we present\nsome numerical examples for the full Navier-Stokes system to illustrate the\nconvergence and performance of the approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 19:38:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 08:36:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Frei", "Stefan", ""], ["Richter", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.12278", "submitter": "Gianluca Frasca-Caccia", "authors": "Gianluca Frasca-Caccia, Peter E.
