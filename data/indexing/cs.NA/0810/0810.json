In particular,\nwe address non-negative solutions (which is a special case of the\nmaximum-minimum principle) of mixed finite element formulations. The discrete\nmaximum-minimum principle is the discrete version of the maximum-minimum\nprinciple.\n  In this paper we present two non-negative mixed finite element formulations\nfor tensorial diffusion equations based on constrained optimization techniques\n(in particular, quadratic programming). These proposed mixed formulations\nproduce non-negative numerical solutions on arbitrary meshes for low-order\n(i.e., linear, bilinear and trilinear) finite elements. The first formulation\nis based on the Raviart-Thomas spaces, and is obtained by adding a non-negative\nconstraint to the variational statement of the Raviart-Thomas formulation. The\nsecond non-negative formulation based on the variational multiscale\nformulation.\n  For the former formulation we comment on the affect of adding the\nnon-negative constraint on the local mass balance property of the\nRaviart-Thomas formulation. We also study the performance of the active set\nstrategy for solving the resulting constrained optimization problems. The\noverall performance of the proposed formulation is illustrated on three\ncanonical test problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2008 01:39:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Feb 2009 03:14:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 16 May 2009 20:37:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2009 22:25:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nakshatrala", "K.

A\nwell-known overarching principle used to improve the performance of many PL\nalgorithms is the bias-variance tradeoff. This tradeoff has been used to\nimprove PL algorithms ranging from Monte Carlo estimation of integrals, to\nlinear estimation, to general statistical estimation. Moreover, as described\nby, MCO is very closely related to PL. Owing to this similarity, the\nbias-variance tradeoff affects MCO performance, just as it does PL performance.\n  In this article, we exploit the bias-variance tradeoff to enhance the\nperformance of MCO algorithms. We use the technique of cross-validation, a\ntechnique based on the bias-variance tradeoff, to significantly improve the\nperformance of the Cross Entropy (CE) method, which is an MCO algorithm. In\nprevious work we have confirmed that other PL techniques improve the perfomance\nof other MCO algorithms. We conclude that the many techniques pioneered in PL\ncould be investigated as ways to improve MCO algorithms in general, and the CE\nmethod in particular.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Oct 2008 04:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Rajnarayan", "Dev", ""], ["Wolpert", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3434", "submitter": "Anil Hirani", "authors": "Anil N.

Exterior calculus is a generalization of vector calculus to smooth\nmanifolds and DEC is one of its discretizations on simplicial complexes such as\ntriangle and tetrahedral meshes. DEC is a coordinate invariant discretization,\nin that it does not depend on the embedding of the simplices or the whole mesh.\nWe start by rewriting the governing equations of Darcy flow using the language\nof exterior calculus. This yields a formulation in terms of flux differential\nform and pressure. The numerical method is then derived by using the framework\nprovided by DEC for discretizing differential forms and operators that act on\nforms. We also develop a discretization for spatially dependent Hodge star that\nvaries with the permeability of the medium. This also allows us to address\ndiscontinuous permeability. The matrix representation for our discrete\nnon-homogeneous Hodge star is diagonal, with positive diagonal entries. The\nresulting linear system of equations for flux and pressure are saddle type,\nwith a diagonal matrix as the top left block. The performance of the proposed\nnumerical method is illustrated on many standard test problems. These include\npatch tests in two and three dimensions, comparison with analytically known\nsolution in two dimensions, layered medium with alternating permeability\nvalues, and a test with a change in permeability along the flow direction. We\nalso show numerical evidence of convergence of the flux and the pressure. A\nconvergence experiment is also included for Darcy flow on a surface. A short\nintroduction to the relevant parts of smooth and discrete exterior calculus is\nincluded in this paper. We also include a discussion of the boundary condition\nin terms of exterior calculus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Oct 2008 21:26:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Apr 2010 04:38:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 12 Nov 2010 04:25:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:24:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hirani", "Anil N.", ""], ["Nakshatrala", "Kalyana B.", ""], ["Chaudhry", "Jehanzeb H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4196", "submitter": "M.
