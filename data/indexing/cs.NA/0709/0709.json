This model uses a moving-grid technique to solve the\nNavier--Stokes equations expressed in the arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian\nkinematics. The discretization in space is based on the spectral element\nmethod. The coupling of the fluid equations and the moving-grid equations is\nessentially done through the conditions on the moving boundaries. Two- and\nthree-dimensional simulations are presented: translation and rotation of a\ncylinder in a fluid, and large-amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank. The\naccuracy and robustness of the present numerical model is studied and\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 14:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bodard", "Nicolas", ""], ["Bouffanais", "Roland", ""], ["Deville", "Michel O.", ""]]}]
