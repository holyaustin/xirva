More explicitly, we investigate how to deterministically identify B of the\nlargest magnitude frequencies of $\\hat{\\textbf{A}}$, and estimate their\ncoefficients, in polynomial$(B,\\log N)$ time. Randomized sub-linear time\nalgorithms which have a small (controllable) probability of failure for each\nprocessed signal exist for solving this problem. However, for failure\nintolerant applications such as those involving mission-critical hardware\ndesigned to process many signals over a long lifetime, deterministic algorithms\nwith no probability of failure are highly desirable. In this paper we build on\nthe deterministic Compressed Sensing results of Cormode and Muthukrishnan (CM)\n\\cite{CMDetCS3,CMDetCS1,CMDetCS2} in order to develop the first known\ndeterministic sub-linear time sparse Fourier Transform algorithm suitable for\nfailure intolerant applications. Furthermore, in the process of developing our\nnew Fourier algorithm, we present a simplified deterministic Compressed Sensing\nalgorithm which improves on CM's algebraic compressibility results while\nsimultaneously maintaining their results concerning exponential decay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2007 04:07:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Iwen", "M.

Asymptotically, the operation count is reduced\nfrom ~2NlogN to ~(17/9)NlogN for a power-of-two transform size N, and the exact\ncount is strictly lowered for all N > 4. These results are derived by\nconsidering the DCT to be a special case of a DFT of length 8N, with certain\nsymmetries, and then pruning redundant operations from a recent improved fast\nFourier transform algorithm (based on a recursive rescaling of the\nconjugate-pair split radix algorithm).
