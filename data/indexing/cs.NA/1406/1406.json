The two key ideas are the location of the interface\neither by solving a lower-dimensional partial differential equation or by using\ndata functions and the subsequent removal of the interface of the solution by\nchoosing the determined interface as the lifting function of the Dirichlet\nboundary conditions. We demonstrate in numerical experiments for linear\nelliptic equations and the reduced basis-hierarchical model reduction approach\nthat the proposed procedure locates the interface well and yields a\nsignificantly improved convergence behavior even in the case when we only\nconsider an approximation of the interface.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 18:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2016 16:33:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ohlberger", "Mario", ""], ["Smetana", "Kathrin", ""]]}]
