Here we show that Euler's equations\nposses a natural, intrinsic splitting of the vorticity function. This canonical\nsplitting is remarkable in four ways: (i) it is defined only in terms of the\nPoisson bracket and the Hamiltonian, (ii) it characterizes steady flows\n(equilibria), (iii) it genuinely, without imposition, evolves into a separation\nof scales, thus enabling the quantitative dynamics behind Kraichnan's\nqualitative description, and (iv) it accounts for the \"broken line\" in the\npower law for the energy spectrum (observed in both experiments and numerical\nsimulations). The splitting originates from a quantized version of Euler's\nequations in combination with a standard quantum-tool: the spectral\ndecomposition of Hermitian matrices.

According to the human perception, image\nsegmentation is the process of dividing an image into non-overlapping regions.\nThese regions, which may correspond, e.g., to different objects, are\nfundamental for the correct interpretation and classification of the scene\nrepresented by the image. The division into regions is not unique, but it\ndepends on the application, i.e., it must be driven by the final goal of the\nsegmentation and hence by the most significant features with respect to that\ngoal. Image segmentation can be regarded as an ill-posed problem. A classical\napproach to deal with ill posedness consists in the use of regularization,\nwhich allows us to incorporate in the model a-priori information about the\nsolution. In this work we provide a brief overview of regularized mathematical\nmodels for image segmentation, considering edge-based and region-based\nvariational models, as well as statistical and machine-learning approaches. We\nalso sketch numerical methods that are applied in computing solutions of those\nmodels.

Next, the\nsignificance of each learned terms is further evaluated and the coefficients of\nPDE terms are optimized by minimizing the L2 residuals.

It honors the mass\nconservation, defines the volume fractions of individual phases unambiguously,\nand therefore captures the volume change due to phase change. The momentum is\nconserved when the solid phase is absent, but it changes when the solid phase\nappears due to the no-slip condition at the solid boundary.

Phase averaging is a technique to filter fast motions from the\ndynamics whilst still accounting for their effect on the slow dynamics. Phase\naveraging is useful for deriving reduced models that can be solved numerically\nwith more efficiency, since larger timesteps can be taken. Recently, Haut and\nWingate (2014) introduced the idea of computing finite window numerical phase\naverages in parallel as the basis for a coarse propagator for a\nparallel-in-time algorithm. In this contribution, we provide a framework for\nhigher order phase averages that aims to better approximate the unaveraged\nsystem whilst still filtering fast motions. Whilst the basic phase average\nassumes that the solution is independent of changes of phase, the higher order\nmethod expands the phase dependency in a basis which the equations are\nprojected onto. We illustrate the properties of this method on an ODE that\ndescribes the dynamics of a swinging spring due to Lynch (2002). Although\nidealized, this model shows an interesting analogy to geophysical flows as it\nexhibits a slow dynamics that arises through the resonance between fast\noscillations. On this example, we show convergence to the non-averaged (exact)\nsolution with increasing approximation order also for finite averaging windows.\nAt zeroth order, our method coincides with a standard phase average, but at\nhigher order it is more accurate in the sense that solutions of the phase\naveraged model track the solutions of the unaveraged equations more accurately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 11:53:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Jul 2021 20:47:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Werner", ""], ["Cotter", "Colin J.", ""], ["Wingate", "Beth", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11670", "submitter": "Daniel Ruprecht", "authors": "Sebastian Goetschel and Michael Minion and Daniel Ruprecht and Robert\n  Speck", "title": "Twelve Ways To Fool The Masses When Giving Parallel-In-Time Results", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.CE cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Getting good speedup -- let alone high parallel efficiency -- for\nparallel-in-time (PinT) integration examples can be frustratingly difficult.\nThe high complexity and large number of parameters in PinT methods can easily\n(and unintentionally) lead to numerical experiments that overestimate the\nalgorithm's performance.

Computing accurate and\nefficient numerical solutions to TRT is challenging for several reasons, the\nfirst of which is that TRT is defined on a high-dimensional phase space. In\norder to reduce the dimensionality, classical approaches such as the P$_N$\n(spherical harmonics) or the S$_N$ (discrete ordinates) ansatz are often used\nin the literature. In this work, we introduce a novel approach: the hybrid\ndiscrete (H$^T_N$) approximation.

We prove that H$^T_N$ results in a system of hyperbolic\nequations. Another challenge in solving the TRT system is the inherent\nstiffness due to the large timescale separation between propagation and\ncollisions. This can be partially overcome via implicit time integration,\nalthough fully implicit methods may become expensive due to the strong\nnonlinearity and system size.
