This result suggests that amongst\nconstant orthogonal CP-rank tensors, the set of computationally hard instances\nto estimate are in fact a small subset of all possible tensors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 20:28:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Christina Lee", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.00781", "submitter": "Anyastassia Seboldt", "authors": "Anyastassia Seboldt, Martina Buka\\v{c}", "title": "A non-iterative domain decomposition method for the interaction between\n  a fluid and a thick structure", "comments": "32 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work focuses on the development and analysis of a partitioned numerical\nmethod for moving domain, fluid-structure interaction problems.

Unfortunately, for Kirchhoff-Love shells,\nstrong enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions is difficult because both\nfunctional and derivative boundary conditions must be applied. A popular\nalternative is to employ Nitsche's method to weakly enforce all boundary\nconditions. However, while many Nitsche-based formulations have been proposed\nin the literature, they lack comprehensive error analyses and verifications. In\nfact, existing formulations are variationally inconsistent and yield\nsub-optimal convergence rates when used with common boundary condition\nspecifications. In this paper, we present a novel Nitsche-based formulation for\nthe linear Kirchhoff-Love shell that is provably stable and optimally\nconvergent for general sets of admissible boundary conditions. To arrive at our\nformulation, we first present a framework for constructing Nitsche's method for\nany abstract variational constrained minimization problem. We then apply this\nframework to the linear Kirchhoff-Love shell and, for the particular case of\nNURBS-based isogeometric analysis, we prove that the resulting formulation\nyields optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard\n$L^2$-norm. In the process, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for general\nsets of admissible boundary conditions and show that the Euler-Lagrange\nboundary conditions typically presented in the literature is incorrect.

Here we\nextend our Weak SINDy (WSINDy) framework introduced in (arXiv:2005.04339) to\nthe setting of partial differential equations (PDEs). The elimination of\npointwise derivative approximations via the weak form enables effective\nmachine-precision recovery of model coefficients from noise-free data (i.e.\nbelow the tolerance of the simulation scheme) as well as robust identification\nof PDEs in the large noise regime (with signal-to-noise ratio approaching one\nin many well-known cases). This is accomplished by discretizing a convolutional\nweak form of the PDE and exploiting separability of test functions for\nefficient model identification using the Fast Fourier Transform. The resulting\nWSINDy algorithm for PDEs has a worst-case computational complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{D+1}\\log(N))$ for datasets with $N$ points in each of $D+1$\ndimensions (i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(N))$ operations per datapoint).

Together with neural network structures\ncarefully designed in this paper, the new regularized optimization can converge\nto new solutions efficiently. Due to the mesh-free nature of deep learning, the\nproposed method is capable of solving high-dimensional problems on complicated\ndomains with multiple solutions, while existing methods focus on merely one or\ntwo-dimensional regular domains and are more expensive in operation counts.\nNumerical experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method could find more\nsolutions than exiting methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 16:45:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2021 23:22:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Yiqi", ""], ["Wang", "Chunmei", ""], ["Yang", "Haizhao", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.03618", "submitter": "Tuyen Truong", "authors": "Tuyen Trung Truong, Tuan Hang Nguyen", "title": "Asymptotic behaviour of learning rates in Armijo's condition", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.LG cs.NA math.DS math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fix a constant $0<\\alpha <1$.

The first method relies on the normal form theory that\nallows one to obtain a nonlinear change of coordinates for expressing the\nreduced-order dynamics in an invariant-based span of the phase space. The\nsecond method is the modal derivative (MD) approach, and more specifically the\nquadratic manifold defined in order to derive a second-order nonlinear change\nof coordinates. Both methods share a common point of view, willing to introduce\na nonlinear mapping to better define a reduced order model that could take more\nproperly into account the nonlinear restoring forces. However the calculation\nmethods are different and the quadratic manifold approach has not the\ninvariance property embedded in its definition. Modal derivatives and static\nmodal derivatives are investigated, and their distinctive features in the\ntreatment of the quadratic nonlinearity is underlined. Assuming a slow/fast\ndecomposition allows understanding how the three methods tend to share\nequivalent properties. While they give proper estimations for flat symmetric\nstructures having a specific shape of nonlinearities and a clear slow/fast\ndecomposition between flexural and in-plane modes, the treatment of the\nquadratic nonlinearity makes the predictions different in the case of curved\nstructures such as arches and shells.

Based on the so-called energy or\n$A$ norm, which is the natural norm for many problems involving SPD matrices,\nwe provide a normwise forward error analysis, and introduce the notion of\nprogressive precision for multigrid solvers.

The theoretical results\ndeveloped here in the energy norm differ notably from previous theory based on\nthe Euclidean norm in important ways.

It results due to the possible decomposition of an arbitrary $n$-volume\ninto an integral of statistically weighted volumes of $n$-spheres. We establish\nits dimensional scaling, and extend it for evaluation of arbitrary integrals\nover non-convex domains. Our results also show that this method is\nsignificantly more efficient than the MCMC approach even when restricted to\nconvex domains, for $n$ $\\sim <$ 100.

The need for offline data collection is bypassed by training the GP\nmodels online based on data coming from a small set of fully-solved anchor\nmicromodels that undergo the same strain history as their associated macro\nintegration points. The Bayesian formalism inherent to GP models provides a\nnatural tool for uncertainty estimation through which new observations or\ninclusion of new anchors are triggered. The surrogate constitutive manifold is\nconstructed with as few micromechanical evaluations as possible by enhancing\nthe GP models with gradient information and the solution scheme is made robust\nthrough a greedy data selection approach embedded within the conventional\nfinite element solution loop for nonlinear analysis. The sensitivity to model\nparameters is studied with a tapered bar example with plasticity, while the\napplicability of the model to more complex cases is demonstrated with the\nelastoplastic analysis of a plate with multiple cutouts and a crack growth\nexample for mixed-mode bending. Significant efficiency gains are obtained\nwithout resorting to offline training.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jul 2020 10:29:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rocha", "I.

This manuscript develops similar guarantees showing that\n$m\\times n$ matrices that can be expressed as the sum of a rank-$r$ matrix and\na $s$-sparse matrix can be recovered by computationally tractable methods from\n$\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n-r)+s)\\log(mn/s)$ linear measurements. More specifically, we\nestablish that the restricted isometry constants for the aforementioned\nmatrices remain bounded independent of problem size provided $p/mn$, $s/p$, and\n$r(m+n-r)/p$ reman fixed. Additionally, we show that semidefinite programming\nand two hard threshold gradient descent algorithms, NIHT and NAHT, converge to\nthe measured matrix provided the measurement operator's RIC's are sufficiently\nsmall. Numerical experiments illustrating these results are shown for synthetic\nproblems, dynamic-foreground/static-background separation, and multispectral\nimaging.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2020 15:36:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Tanner", "Jared", ""], ["Vary", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.09531", "submitter": "Maxim Olshanskii", "authors": "Maxim Olshanskii and Xianmin Xu and Vladimir Yushutin", "title": "A finite element method for Allen-Cahn equation on deforming surface", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computers & Mathematics with Applications, V. 90 (2021), p.148-158", "doi": "10.1016/j.camwa.2021.03.018", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The paper studies an Allen-Cahn-type equation defined on a time-dependent\nsurface as a model of phase separation with order-disorder transition in a thin\nmaterial layer.

We\ndescribe a new method for rapidly computing the dynamics of inextensible\nslender filaments in periodically-sheared Stokes flow. The dynamics of the\nfilaments are governed by a nonlocal slender body theory which we partially\nreformulate in terms of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa hydrodynamic tensor.

For this reason, the coupled\nmodel is commonly solved as a unique system using Newton type algorithms, at\nthe price, however, of high computational costs.
