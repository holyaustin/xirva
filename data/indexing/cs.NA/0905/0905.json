In 2004 Irony, Toledo and Tiskin gave a new proof of this result and\nextended it to the parallel case. In both cases the lower bound may be\nexpressed as $\\Omega$(#arithmetic operations / $\\sqrt{M}$), where M is the size\nof the fast memory (or local memory in the parallel case). Here we generalize\nthese results to a much wider variety of algorithms, including LU\nfactorization, Cholesky factorization, $LDL^T$ factorization, QR factorization,\nalgorithms for eigenvalues and singular values, i.e., essentially all direct\nmethods of linear algebra. The proof works for dense or sparse matrices, and\nfor sequential or parallel algorithms. In addition to lower bounds on the\namount of data moved (bandwidth) we get lower bounds on the number of messages\nrequired to move it (latency). We illustrate how to extend our lower bound\ntechnique to compositions of linear algebra operations (like computing powers\nof a matrix), to decide whether it is enough to call a sequence of simpler\noptimal algorithms (like matrix multiplication) to minimize communication, or\nif we can do better. We give examples of both. We also show how to extend our\nlower bounds to certain graph theoretic problems.\n  We point out recently designed algorithms for dense LU, Cholesky, QR,\neigenvalue and the SVD problems that attain these lower bounds; implementations\nof LU and QR show large speedups over conventional linear algebra algorithms in\nstandard libraries like LAPACK and ScaLAPACK. Many open problems remain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 07:26:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ballard", "Grey", ""], ["Demmel", "James", ""], ["Holtz", "Olga", ""], ["Schwartz", "Oded", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3564", "submitter": "Cristian Constantin Lalescu", "authors": "Cristian Constantin Lalescu", "title": "Two hierarchies of spline interpolations.
