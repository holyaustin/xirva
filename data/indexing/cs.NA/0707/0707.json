This algorithm can be used to find the\nintersections between a line and a surface. The main features of KTS are that\nit can operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies certain\nconditions and that its efficiency has an upper bound that depends only on the\nconditioning of the problem and the choice of the basis representing the\npolynomial system.\n  This article explores in detail the dependence of the efficiency of the KTS\nalgorithm on the choice of basis. Three bases are considered: the power, the\nBernstein, and the Chebyshev bases. These three bases satisfy the basis\nproperties required by KTS. Theoretically, Chebyshev case has the smallest\nupper bound on its running time. The computational results, however, do not\nshow that Chebyshev case performs better than the other two.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2007 18:56:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2007 00:37:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2007 03:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 8 Sep 2008 09:18:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2009 10:43:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Srijuntongsiri", "Gun", ""], ["Vavasis", "Stephen A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.1716", "submitter": "Luis Antonio da Mota", "authors": "B.O.Rodrigues, L.A.C.P.da Mota and L.G.S.Duarte", "title": "Numerical Calculation With Arbitrary Precision", "comments": "contribution to X hadron Physics - 2007 to appear on International\n  Journal of Modern Physics E", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0218301307009014", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA cs.MS", "license": null, "abstract": "  The vast use of computers on scientific numerical computation makes the\nawareness of the limited precision that these machines are able to provide us\nan essential matter.
