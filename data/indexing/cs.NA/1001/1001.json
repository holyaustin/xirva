In vector form we denote such an equation system by X = f(X) and\ncall f a system of positive polynomials, short SPP. Equation systems of this\nkind appear naturally in the analysis of stochastic models like stochastic\ncontext-free grammars (with numerous applications to natural language\nprocessing and computational biology), probabilistic programs with procedures,\nweb-surfing models with back buttons, and branching processes. The least\nnonnegative solution mu f of an SPP equation X = f(X) is of central interest\nfor these models. Etessami and Yannakakis have suggested a particular version\nof Newton's method to approximate mu f.\n  We extend a result of Etessami and Yannakakis and show that Newton's method\nstarting at 0 always converges to mu f. We obtain lower bounds on the\nconvergence speed of the method. For so-called strongly connected SPPs we prove\nthe existence of a threshold k_f such that for every i >= 0 the (k_f+i)-th\niteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu f. The proof\nyields an explicit bound for k_f depending only on syntactic parameters of f.\nWe further show that for arbitrary SPP equations Newton's method still\nconverges linearly: there are k_f>=0 and alpha_f>0 such that for every i>=0 the\n(k_f+alpha_f i)-th iteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu\nf. The proof yields an explicit bound for alpha_f; the bound is exponential in\nthe number of equations, but we also show that it is essentially optimal.\nConstructing a bound for k_f is still an open problem. Finally, we also provide\na geometric interpretation of Newton's method for SPPs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2010 17:44:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2010 11:49:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Mar 2010 16:57:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Esparza", "Javier", ""], ["Kiefer", "Stefan", ""], ["Luttenberger", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0829", "submitter": "Simone Fiori", "authors": "Simone Fiori", "title": "Least-Squares on the Real Symplectic Group", "comments": "The paper has been published in 2011, hence I think that it is time\n  to withdraw it from the arXiv", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present paper discusses the problem of least-squares over the real\nsymplectic group of matrices Sp(2n,R)$.

In turn, gradient steepest descent on manifold may be implemented through\na geodesic-based stepping method. As the space Sp(2n,R) is a non-compact Lie\ngroup, it is convenient to endow it with a pseudo-Riemannian geometry.
