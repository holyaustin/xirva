The method consists of two multilevel\nphases. In the first, multiplicative phase (setup phase), tentative singular\ntriplets are calculated along with a multigrid hierarchy of interpolation\noperators that approximately fit the tentative singular vectors in a collective\nand self-learning manner, using multiplicative update formulas. In the second,\nadditive phase (solve phase), the tentative singular triplets are improved up\nto the desired accuracy by using an additive correction scheme with fixed\ninterpolation operators, combined with a Ritz update. A suitable generalization\nof the singular value decomposition is formulated that applies to the coarse\nlevels of the multilevel cycles. The proposed algorithm combines and extends\ntwo existing multigrid approaches for symmetric positive definite eigenvalue\nproblems to the case of dominant and minimal singular triplets. Numerical tests\non model problems from different areas show that the algorithm converges to\nhigh accuracy in a modest number of iterations, and is flexible enough to deal\nwith a variety of problems due to its self-learning properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Feb 2011 14:08:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["De Sterck", "Hans", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.4205", "submitter": "Henning Thielemann", "authors": "Henning Thielemann", "title": "An algebra for signal processing", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, Accepted at International Conference on\n  Algebraic Informatics, CAI2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our paper presents an attempt to axiomatise signal processing.
