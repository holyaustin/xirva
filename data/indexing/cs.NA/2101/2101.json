The\nproposed methods eliminate the coupled effect of mesh size and time step on the\nalgorithmic stability. A residual based a posteriori error estimate that\nprovides an upper bound of the natural error norm is derived. The availability\nof such estimate which can be obtained with minimal computational effort and\nthe hierarchical construction of the finite element spaces allow for the\nformulation of an efficient p-adaptive algorithm. A series of numerical\nexamples demonstrate the performance of the approach. It is shown that the\nmethod with the p-adaptive strategy accurately solves problems involving\ntravelling waves, and those with discontinuities and singularities. The\nflexibility of the formulation is also illustrated via selected applications in\npattern formation and electrophysiology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jan 2021 18:21:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wakeni", "Mebratu", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Ankush", ""], ["Kaczmarczyk", "Lukasz", ""], ["McBride", "Andrew", ""], ["Athanasiadis", "Ignatios", ""], ["Pearce", "Chris", ""], ["Steinmann", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00684", "submitter": "Jacek Cyranka", "authors": "Jacek Cyranka and Jean-Philippe Lessard", "title": "Validated forward integration scheme for parabolic PDEs via Chebyshev\n  series", "comments": "submitted, supplementary material github.com/dzako/chebyshev", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a new approach to compute rigorously solutions of\nCauchy problems for a class of semi-linear parabolic partial differential\nequations.

Specifically, we develop and test a hybrid\nOpenMP and MPI parallelized implementation of DoGPack with the goal of\nexploring the efficiency and scalability of RIDG in comparison to the popular\nstrong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (SSP-RKDG)\nmethod. We demonstrate that RIDG methods are able to hide communication latency\nassociated with distributed memory parallelism, due to the fact that almost all\nof the work involved in the method is highly localized to each element,\nproducing a localized prediction for each region. We demonstrate the enhanced\nefficiency and scalability of the of the RIDG method and compare it to SSP-RKDG\nmethods and show extensibility to very high order schemes.

(J Comput Phys, 2019) presented a flux-based volume\npenalization (VP) approach for imposing inhomogeneous Neumann boundary\nconditions on embedded interfaces. The flux-based VP method modifies the\ndiffusion coefficient of the original elliptic (Poisson) equation and uses a\nflux-forcing function as a source term in the equation to impose the desired\nNeumann boundary conditions. As such, the flux-based VP method can be easily\nincorporated into existing fictitious domain codes. Sakurai et al. relied on\nanalytical construction of flux-forcing functions, which limits the\npracticality of the approach. Because of the analytical approach taken in the\nprior work, only (spatially) constant flux values along simple interfaces were\nconsidered. In this paper, we present a numerical approach to construct\nflux-forcing functions for arbitrarily complex boundaries. The imposed flux\nvalues are also allowed to vary spatially in our approach. Furthermore, the\nflux-based VP method is extended to include (spatially varying) Robin boundary\nconditions, which makes the flux-based method even more general. We consider\nseveral two- and three-dimensional test examples to access the spatial accuracy\nof the numerical solutions. We formally derive flux-based volume penalized\nPoisson equation satisfying Neumann/Robin boundary condition in strong form;\nsuch a derivation was not presented in Sakurai et al., where the equation first\nappeared for the Neumann problem. The derivation reveals that the flux-based VP\napproach relies on a surface delta function to impose inhomogeneous\nNeumann/Robin boundary conditions.

We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar\nto those of least-square curve fittings (LS-fit) with true latent parameters'\ninitial guesses, in spite of the DNN needing no initial guesses at all. We then\nexplore applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful\nfor time-series processing in physics, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As\nan example, we employ DNNs as a tool to inform LS-fits when initial guesses are\nunknown. We show that the regression can be performed on some latent\nparameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder\nneeds no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown\nlatent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior\nknowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2021 12:39:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Garcon", "Antoine", ""], ["Vexler", "Julian", ""], ["Budker", "Dmitry", ""], ["Kramer", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03903", "submitter": "Ben Ashby", "authors": "Ben Ashby, Cassiano Bortolozo, Alex Lukyanov, Tristan Pryer", "title": "Adaptive modelling of variably saturated seepage problems", "comments": "Accepted for publication in The Quarterly Journal of Mechanics and\n  Applied Mathematics Published by Oxford University Press", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we present a goal-oriented adaptive finite element method for\na class of subsurface flow problems in porous media, which exhibit seepage\nfaces.

We present\na new method for this task that produces an implicit surface (zero-level set)\napproximation for an oriented point cloud using only information about\n(approximate) normals to the surface. The technique exploits the fundamental\nresult from vector calculus that the normals to an implicit surface are\ncurl-free. By using a curl-free radial basis function (RBF) interpolation of\nthe normals, we can extract a potential for the vector field whose zero-level\nsurface approximates the point cloud. We use curl-free RBFs based on\npolyharmonic splines for this task, since they are free of any shape or support\nparameters. Furthermore, to make this technique efficient and able to better\nrepresent local sharp features, we combine it with a partition of unity (PU)\nmethod. The result is the curl-free partition of unity (CFPU) method. We show\nhow CFPU can be adapted to enforce exact interpolation of a point cloud and can\nbe regularized to handle noise in both the normal vectors and the point\npositions. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate how the method\nconverges for a known surface as the sampling density increases, how\nregularization handles noisy data, and how the method performs on various\nproblems found in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2021 02:26:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Drake", "Kathryn P.", ""], ["Fuselier", "Edward J.", ""], ["Wright", "Grady B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.06006", "submitter": "Binxu Wang", "authors": "Binxu Wang, Carlos R.

These networks are trained to map random inputs in\ntheir latent space to new samples representative of the learned data. However,\nthe structure of the latent space is hard to intuit due to its high\ndimensionality and the non-linearity of the generator, which limits the\nusefulness of the models. Understanding the latent space requires a way to\nidentify input codes for existing real-world images (inversion), and a way to\nidentify directions with known image transformations (interpretability). Here,\nwe use a geometric framework to address both issues simultaneously. We develop\nan architecture-agnostic method to compute the Riemannian metric of the image\nmanifold created by GANs. The eigen-decomposition of the metric isolates axes\nthat account for different levels of image variability. An empirical analysis\nof several pretrained GANs shows that image variation around each position is\nconcentrated along surprisingly few major axes (the space is highly\nanisotropic) and the directions that create this large variation are similar at\ndifferent positions in the space (the space is homogeneous). We show that many\nof the top eigenvectors correspond to interpretable transforms in the image\nspace, with a substantial part of eigenspace corresponding to minor transforms\nwhich could be compressed out. This geometric understanding unifies key\nprevious results related to GAN interpretability. We show that the use of this\nmetric allows for more efficient optimization in the latent space (e.g. GAN\ninversion) and facilitates unsupervised discovery of interpretable axes.

In\naddition, we demonstrate that for spacetime tensor product discretizations, one\ncan recover the multisymplectic integrators of Bridges and Reich, and show that\na variational multisymplectic discretization of a Hamiltonian multisymplectic\nfield theory using spacetime tensor product Runge--Kutta discretizations is\nwell-defined if and only if the partitioned Runge--Kutta methods are symplectic\nin space and time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 09:47:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tran", "Brian", ""], ["Leok", "Melvin", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.07560", "submitter": "Federica Pes", "authors": "Federica Pes, Giuseppe Rodriguez", "title": "A doubly relaxed minimal-norm Gauss-Newton method for underdetermined\n  nonlinear least-squares problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  When a physical system is modeled by a nonlinear function, the unknown\nparameters can be estimated by fitting experimental observations by a\nleast-squares approach.

Emphasis is placed on optimality,\nas well as the curse of dimensionality and approaches that might have the\npromise of beating it. We also review most of the state of the art of GW\nsurrogates. Some numerical algorithms, conditioning details, scalability,\nparallelization and other practical points are discussed. The approaches\npresented are to large extent non-intrusive and data-driven and can therefore\nbe applicable to other disciplines. We close with open challenges in high\ndimension surrogates, which are not unique to GW science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2021 18:58:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tiglio", "Manuel", ""], ["Villanueva", "Aar\u00f3n", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.11649", "submitter": "Quan Bui", "authors": "Quan M.

These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned.\nBecause of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved--e.g.\nformation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium,\nviscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well\nsources and sinks, etc.--it is difficult to develop general-purpose but\nscalable linear solver frameworks. This challenge is further aggravated by the\nrange of different discretization schemes that may be adopted, which have a\ndirect impact on the linear system structure. To address this obstacle, we\ndescribe a flexible framework based on multigrid reduction that can produce\npurely algebraic preconditioners for a wide spectrum of relevant physics and\ndiscretizations. We demonstrate its broad applicability by constructing\nscalable preconditioners for several problems, notably: a hybrid discretization\nof single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and\nhydraulic fracturing simulations.

Using the\ni2b2 Challenge Data, we trained, then analyzed the model to assess whether the\noutput of the LSTM, before the compression layer of the classifier, could be\nused to estimate the membership of the training data. Furthermore, we used\ndifferent attacks including membership inference attack method to attack the\nmodel. Results indicate that the attacks could not identify whether members of\nthe training data were distinguishable from non-members based on the model\noutput. This indicates that the model does not provide any strong evidence into\nthe identification of the individuals in the training data set and there is not\nyet empirical evidence it is unsafe to distribute the model for general use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:38:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 May 2021 13:23:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Seyedi", "Salman", ""], ["Xiong", "Li", ""], ["Nemati", "Shamim", ""], ["Clifford", "Gari D.", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12164", "submitter": "Hussam Al Daas", "authors": "Hussam Al Daas, Tyrone Rees and Jennifer Scott", "title": "Two-level Nystr\\\"om--Schur preconditioner for sparse symmetric positive\n  definite matrices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Randomized methods are becoming increasingly popular in numerical linear\nalgebra.
