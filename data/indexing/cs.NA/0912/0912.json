Because such operations are the building blocks of most scientific\napplications, conventional supercomputers are still strongly predominant in\nhigh-performance computing and the use of grids for speeding up large-scale\nscientific problems is limited to applications exhibiting parallelism at a\nhigher level. We have identified two performance bottlenecks in the distributed\nmemory algorithms implemented in ScaLAPACK, a state-of-the-art dense linear\nalgebra library. First, because ScaLAPACK assumes a homogeneous communication\nnetwork, the implementations of ScaLAPACK algorithms lack locality in their\ncommunication pattern. Second, the number of messages sent in the ScaLAPACK\nalgorithms is significantly greater than other algorithms that trade flops for\ncommunication. In this paper, we present a new approach for computing a QR\nfactorization -- one of the main dense linear algebra kernels -- of tall and\nskinny matrices in a grid computing environment that overcomes these two\nbottlenecks. Our contribution is to articulate a recently proposed algorithm\n(Communication Avoiding QR) with a topology-aware middleware (QCG-OMPI) in\norder to confine intensive communications (ScaLAPACK calls) within the\ndifferent geographical sites. An experimental study conducted on the Grid'5000\nplatform shows that the resulting performance increases linearly with the\nnumber of geographical sites on large-scale problems (and is in particular\nconsistently higher than ScaLAPACK's).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 04:01:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Agullo", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Coti", "Camille", ""], ["Dongarra", "Jack", ""], ["Herault", "Thomas", ""], ["Langou", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3927", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "A.
