In order to improve\nreliability (increase the mean time to failure) of computing systems, a lot of\nefforts have been devoted to developing techniques to forecast, prevent, and\nrecover from errors at different levels, including architecture, application,\nand algorithm. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic error resilient iterative\nlinear solvers and introduce a redundant subspace correction method. Using a\ngeneral framework of redundant subspace corrections, we construct iterative\nmethods, which have the following properties: (1) Maintain convergence when\nerror occurs assuming it is detectable; (2) Introduce low computational\noverhead when no error occurs; (3) Require only small amount of local\n(point-to-point) communication compared to traditional methods and maintain\ngood load balance; (4) Improve the mean time to failure.

The problem of single\nparticle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-EM is to use the resulting set of noisy\n2D projection images taken at unknown directions to reconstruct the 3D\nstructure of the molecule. In some situations, the molecule under examination\nexhibits structural variability, which poses a fundamental challenge in SPR.\nThe heterogeneity problem is the task of mapping the space of conformational\nstates of a molecule. It has been previously suggested that the leading\neigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the 3D molecules can be used to solve\nthe heterogeneity problem. Estimating the covariance matrix is challenging,\nsince only projections of the molecules are observed, but not the molecules\nthemselves. In this paper, we formulate a general problem of covariance\nestimation from noisy projections of samples. This problem has intimate\nconnections with matrix completion problems and high-dimensional principal\ncomponent analysis. We propose an estimator and prove its consistency. When\nthere are finitely many heterogeneity classes, the spectrum of the estimated\ncovariance matrix reveals the number of classes. The estimator can be found as\nthe solution to a certain linear system. In the cryo-EM case, the linear\noperator to be inverted, which we term the projection covariance transform, is\nan important object in covariance estimation for tomographic problems involving\nstructural variation. Inverting it involves applying a filter akin to the ramp\nfilter in tomography. We design a basis in which this linear operator is sparse\nand thus can be tractably inverted despite its large size.

Several algorithms have been proposed for finding low-WAFOM point\nsets. In the existing algorithms, the number of points is fixed in advance, but\nextensible point sets are preferred in some applications. In this paper, we\npropose a random search algorithm for extensible low-WAFOM point sets. For\nthis, we introduce a method that uses lookup tables to compute WAFOM faster.\nNumerical results show that our extensible low-WAFOM point sets are comparable\nwith Niederreiter--Xing sequences for some low-dimensional and smooth test\nfunctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 13:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2013 06:40:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 16:07:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Harase", "Shin", ""]]}]
