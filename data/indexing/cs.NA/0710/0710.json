The\nmethod combines the vector-valued Allen-Cahn phase field equation with initial\ndata fitting terms. This method is known to be closely related to the\nMumford-Shah problem and the level set segmentation by Chan and Vese. Our\nnumerical solution is performed using a multigrid splitting of a finite element\nspace, thereby producing an efficient and robust method for the segmentation of\nlarge images.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2007 08:51:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kay", "David A", "", "Oxford University Computational Laboratory"], ["Tomasi", "Alessandro", "", "University of Sussex"]]}, {"id": "0710.3170", "submitter": "Louis Yu Lu", "authors": "Louis Yu Lu", "title": "Fast Intrinsic Mode Decomposition of Time Series Data with Sawtooth\n  Transform", "comments": "Add details to extend the sawtooth function for boundary points\n  calculation", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA", "license": null, "abstract": "  An efficient method is introduced in this paper to find the intrinsic mode\nfunction (IMF) components of time series data. This method is faster and more\npredictable than the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method devised by the\nauthor of Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT). The approach is to transforms the\noriginal data function into a piecewise linear sawtooth function (or triangle\nwave function), then directly constructs the upper envelope by connecting the\nmaxima and construct lower envelope by connecting minima with straight line\nsegments in the sawtooth space, the IMF is calculated as the difference between\nthe sawtooth function and the mean of the upper and lower envelopes. The\nresults found in the sawtooth space are reversely transformed into the original\ndata space as the required IMF and envelopes mean. This decomposition method\nprocess the data in one pass to obtain a unique IMF component without the time\nconsuming repetitive sifting process of EMD method. An alternative\ndecomposition method with sawtooth function expansion is also presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Oct 2007 20:19:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2007 15:58:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Louis Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4486", "submitter": "Michel Fliess", "authors": "Michel Fliess (INRIA Futurs), C\\'edric Join (INRIA Futurs, CRAN),\n  Hebertt Sira-Ramirez", "title": "Non-linear estimation is easy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Int.
