Recent work has\nmade great strides combining stochastic estimation with iterative numerical\ntechniques, essentially boiling down GP inference to the cost of (many)\nmatrix-vector multiplies. Preconditioning -- a highly effective step for any\niterative method involving matrix-vector multiplication -- can be used to\naccelerate convergence and thus reduce bias in hyperparameter optimization.\nHere, we prove that preconditioning has an additional benefit that has been\npreviously unexplored. It not only reduces the bias of the $\\log$-marginal\nlikelihood estimator and its derivatives, but it also simultaneously can reduce\nvariance at essentially negligible cost. We leverage this result to derive\nsample-efficient algorithms for GP hyperparameter optimization requiring as few\nas $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\varepsilon^{-1}))$ instead of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples to achieve error $\\varepsilon$. Our\ntheoretical results enable provably efficient and scalable optimization of\nkernel hyperparameters, which we validate empirically on a set of large-scale\nbenchmark problems.

One approach to alleviate this and achieve\nparallelism in time is with multigrid. In this work, we consider\nmultigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT), a multilevel method applied to the time\ndimension that computes multiple time-steps in parallel. Like all multigrid\nmethods, MGRIT relies on the complementary relationship between relaxation on a\nfine-grid and a correction from the coarse grid to solve the problem.

We derive new\nconvergence bounds for weighted relaxation, and use this analysis to guide the\nselection of relaxation weights.

The evolution of opening microcracks in tension\nleads to brittle behavior and mode I fracture, while the evolution of closed\nmicrocracks under frictional sliding in compression/shear leads to ductile\nbehavior and mode II fracture. Frictional sliding is endowed with a\nnon-associative law, a crucial aspect of the model that considers the effect of\ndilation and allows for realistic material responses with non-vanishing\nfrictional energy dissipation.

Given the high computational cost of\nmesh deformation, state-of-the-art radial basis function techniques are used\nfor data reduction. The principle procedures adopted are multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection and volume point reduction. The multi-level greedy\nsurface point selection reduces the control point list to increase the\nefficiency of the interpolation operation and the volume point reduction\nimproves the computational cost of the volume mesh update operation which is\nimportant for large data sets. The study demonstrates the capabilities of\nradial basis function mesh deformation in both two and three-dimensions.\nFurthermore, it compares localised ice deformation to more standardized test\ncases with global deformation. The convergence history of the multi-level\ngreedy point selection is assessed in terms of number of control points and\ncomputational cost for all the test cases. The location of the selected control\npoints near the ice accretion illustrates the effectiveness of the method for\nlocalised deformation. The results show that the radial basis function mesh\ndeformation performs well for both the two and three-dimensional test cases.\nThe reduction of the relative surface error for the three-dimensional test\ncases understandably requires a larger number of control points and thus\nresults in a higher computational cost.
