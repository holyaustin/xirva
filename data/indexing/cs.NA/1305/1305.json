It can be expressed as a linear program, and, with\nappropriate preprocessing, interior-point methods can be used to find a\nsolution for moderately large problems. Dealing with very large problems,\n\\emph(e.g.), involving data up to and beyond the terabyte regime, remains a\nchallenge. Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in nearly linear\ntime in the size of the input and that, with constant probability, computes a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile regression\nproblem. As a key step, our algorithm computes a low-distortion\nsubspace-preserving embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile\nregression. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is\ncompetitive with the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and\nthat in addition it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and\napplied to terabyte-sized problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 05:21:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Oct 2013 18:18:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 00:33:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jiyan", ""], ["Meng", "Xiangrui", ""], ["Mahoney", "Michael W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0161", "submitter": "Francesco Mainardi", "authors": "Francesco Mainardi", "title": "On some properties of the Mittag-Leffler function $E_\\alpha(-t^\\alpha)$,\n  completely monotone for $t > 0$ with $0 < \\alpha < 1$", "comments": "17 pages, 12 figures.

Several approximate and hybrid methods have\nappeared that enable more efficient simulation of the RDME. A common feature to\nmost of them is that they rely on splitting the system into its reaction and\ndiffusion parts and updating them sequentially over a discrete timestep. This\nuse of operator splitting enables more efficient simulation but it comes at the\nprice of a temporal discretization error that depends on the size of the\ntimestep.

In this paper, we propose a modification that\nspeeds up the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for systems of\nlinear equations with sparse solutions. The speedup is achieved by projecting\nevery iterate onto a weighted row of the linear system while maintaining the\nrandom row selection criteria of Strohmer and Vershynin. The weights are chosen\nto attenuate the contribution of row elements that lie outside of the estimated\nsupport of the sparse solution. While the Kaczmarz algorithm and its variants\ncan only find solutions to overdetermined linear systems, our algorithm\nsurprisingly succeeds in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear\nsystems as well. We present empirical studies which demonstrate the\nacceleration in convergence to the sparse solution using this modified approach\nin the overdetermined case. We also demonstrate the sparse recovery\ncapabilities of our approach in the underdetermined case and compare the\nperformance with that of $\\ell_1$ minimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 May 2013 13:44:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mansour", "Hassan", ""], ["Yilmaz", "Ozgur", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4081", "submitter": "Patrick Hop", "authors": "Patrick Hop, Xinghao Pan", "title": "Conditions for Convergence in Regularized Machine Learning Objectives", "comments": "3 Pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NA math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analysis of the convergence rates of modern convex optimization algorithms\ncan be achived through binary means: analysis of emperical convergence, or\nanalysis of theoretical convergence.

This advantage comes, however,\nwith a cost: the solution of a system of nonlinear equations is required at\neach time step. In this work, the nonlinear system results from the\ndiscretization of the hydrodynamical equations with the Crank-Nicholson scheme.\nWe compare the cost of different methods, based on Newton-Raphson iterations,\nto solve this nonlinear system, and benchmark their performances against\ntime-explicit schemes.

Focusing on 2D simulations, we show\nthat the best performances are obtained with the quasi-Newton method proposed\nby Broyden. Another important concern is the accuracy of implicit calculations.\nBased on the study of an idealized problem, namely the advection of a single\nvortex by a uniform flow, we show that there are two aspects: i) the nonlinear\nsolver has to be accurate enough to resolve the truncation error of the\nnumerical discretization, and ii) the time step has be small enough to resolve\nthe advection of eddies. We show that with these two conditions fulfilled, our\nimplicit methods exhibit similar accuracy to time-explicit schemes, which have\nlower values for the time step and higher computational costs.
