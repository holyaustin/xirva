First we generalize this method by adding dimension type free\nparameters. Then we deal with the optimization problem of the free parameters.\nTo this order, based on the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO)\nalgorithm, we develop the multi-dimensional hyperbolic PSO algorithm. It is\ndesigned especially for the rational transforms in question. As a result, the\nsystem along with its dimension is dynamically optimized during the process.\nThe main motivation was to increase the adaptivity while keeping the\ncomputational complexity manageable.

It establishes a connection between three important, seemingly\nunrelated, classes of iterative methods, namely: the linearization methods, the\nrelaxation methods (finite difference methods), and the shooting methods. It\nhas recently been demonstrated that using finite differences to discretize the\nsequence of linear problems obtained by quasi-linearization, Picard\nlinearization, or constant-slope linearization, leads to the usual iteration\nformula of the respective relaxation method. Thus, the linearization methods\ncan be used as a basis to derive the relaxation methods. In this work we\ndemonstrate that the shooting methods can be derived from the linearization\nmethods, too. We show that relaxing a shooting trajectory, i.e. an initial\nvalue problem solution, is in fact a projection transformation. The obtained\nfunction, called projection trajectory, can be used to correct the initial\ncondition. Using the new initial condition, we can find a new shooting\ntrajectory, and so on. The described procedure is called shooting-projection\niteration (SPI). We show that using the quasi-linearization equation to relax\n(project) the shooting trajectory leads to the usual shooting by Newton method,\nthe constant-slope linearization leads to the usual shooting by constant-slope\nmethod, while the Picard linearization leads to the recently proposed\nshooting-projection method.

Such model lead to systems\nof forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are\nsupplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular\nNeumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the\nunderlying controled stochastic processes.

This friction plays a critical role in the growth of these\nshear fractures, as revealed by the fracture mechanics theory of Palmer and\nRice decades ago. In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model of shear\nfracture in pressure-sensitive geomaterials, honoring the role of friction in\nthe fracture propagation mechanism. Building on a recently proposed phase-field\nmethod for frictional interfaces, we formulate a set of governing equations for\ndifferent contact conditions (or lack thereof) in which frictional energy\ndissipation emerges in the crack driving force during slip. We then derive the\ndegradation function and the threshold fracture energy of the phase-field model\nsuch that the stress-strain behavior is insensitive to the length parameter for\nphase-field regularization. This derivation procedure extends a methodology\nused in recent phase-field models of cohesive tensile fracture to shear\nfracture in frictional materials in which peak and residual strengths coexist\nand evolve by confining pressure. The resulting phase-field formulation is\ndemonstrably consistent with the theory of Palmer and Rice.

This method uses harmonic inputs which\nestablish a natural way for data acquisition. For the general class of\nnonlinear problems with VS representation, the growing exponential approach\nallows the derivation of the generalized kernels, namely symmetric generalized\nfrequency response functions - (GFRFs). In addition, the homogeneity of the\nVolterra operator determines the accuracy in terms of how many kernels are\nconsidered. For the weakly nonlinear setup, only a few kernels are needed to\nobtain a good approximation. In this direction, the proposed adaptive scheme is\nable to improve the estimations of the computationally non-zero kernels. The\nFourier transform associates these measurements with the derived GFRFs and the\nLF makes the connection with system theory.

The goal of the proposed method is to\nextend identification to the case of bilinear systems from time-domain\nmeasurements and to approximate other general nonlinear systems (by means of\nthe Carleman bilinearizarion scheme).

For the two kinds of problems, we prove that LSQR\nfinds 2-norm filtering best possible regularized solutions at semi-convergence.\nParticularly, we consider some important and untouched issues on best, near\nbest and general rank $k$ approximations to $A$ for the ill-posed problems with\nthe singular values $\\sigma_k=\\mathcal{O}(k^{-\\alpha})$ with $\\alpha>0$, and\nthe relationships between them and their nonzero singular values. Numerical\nexperiments confirm our theory. The results on general rank $k$ approximations\nand the properties of their nonzero singular values apply to several Krylov\nsolvers, including LSQR, CGME, MINRES, MR-II, GMRES and RRGMRES.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 09:39:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Jia", "Zhongxiao", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.09318", "submitter": "Ana Carpio", "authors": "Ana Carpio, Sergei Iakunin, Georg Stadler", "title": "Bayesian approach to inverse scattering with topological priors", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Inverse Problems 36, 105001, 2020", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6420/abaa30", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.OC math.ST physics.data-an stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a Bayesian inference framework to estimate uncertainties in\ninverse scattering problems.

The\nnumerical approach developed herein, which we refer to as an immersed\nLagrangian-Eulerian method, integrates aspects of partitioned and immersed FSI\nformulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid and solid\nsubdomains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using non-conforming\ndiscretizations of the dynamic fluid and structure regions, as in an immersed\nformulation. A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the motion\nof the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along the\nfluid-structure interface, and the motion of the fluid along that interface is\nconstrained to match the solid velocity and thereby satisfy the no-slip\ncondition. To develop a practical numerical method, we adopt a penalty approach\nthat approximately imposes the no-slip condition along the fluid-structure\ninterface. Our fluid-structure interaction scheme relies on an immersed\ninterface method for discrete geometries, which enables the accurate\ndetermination of both velocities and stresses along complex fluid-structure\ninterfaces. Unlike commonly used partitioned FSI methods, which can suffer from\nso-called added mass effect instabilities, our methodology retains stability\nfor test cases involving extremely small, nearly equal, equal, and large\nsolid-fluid density ratios without requiring subiterations or complex handling\nof the pressure. Biomedical FSI demonstration cases are also presented\nincluding the dynamics of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve in a pulse\nduplicator, and transport of blood clots in a patient-averaged anatomical model\nof the inferior vena cava.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:23:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2020 04:24:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:38:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2020 03:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2021 04:35:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kolahdouz", "Ebrahim M.", ""], ["Bhalla", "Amneet P.

The methods are based on fully compatible SBP operators.\nAlthough this paper focuses on classical SBP finite difference operators, the\npresented boundary and interface treatments are general and apply to a range of\nmethods that satisfy an SBP property. We demonstrate the stability and accuracy\nproperties of a particular set of fully compatible SBP-SAT schemes using the\nmethod of manufactured solutions. We also demonstrate the utility of the new\nmethod in elastodynamic cloaking and seismic imaging in mountainous regions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Mar 2020 15:14:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:32:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 26 Sep 2020 05:20:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Almquist", "Martin", ""], ["Dunham", "Eric M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.12983", "submitter": "Patrik Knopf", "authors": "Patrik Knopf, Kei Fong Lam, Chun Liu, Stefan Metzger", "title": "Phase-field dynamics with transfer of materials: The Cahn--Hilliard\n  equation with reaction rate dependent dynamic boundary conditions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis 55(1):\n  229-282, 2021", "doi": "10.1051/m2an/2020090", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP cs.NA math-ph math.MP math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Cahn--Hilliard equation is one of the most common models to describe\nphase separation processes of a mixture of two materials.
