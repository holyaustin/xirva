In a THU-spline construction, an unstructured\nquadrilateral mesh is taken as the input control mesh, where the\ndegenerated-patch method [18] is adopted in irregular regions to define\n$C^1$-continuous bicubic splines, whereas regular regions only involve $C^2$\nB-splines. Irregular regions are then smoothly joined with regular regions\nthrough the truncation mechanism [29], leading to a globally smooth spline\nconstruction. Subsequently, local refinement is performed following the\ntruncated hierarchical B-spline construction [10] to achieve a flexible\nrefinement without propagating to unanticipated regions. Challenges lie in\nrefining transition regions where a mixed types of splines play a role.\nTHU-spline basis functions are globally $C^1$-continuous and are non-negative\neverywhere except near extraordinary vertices, where slight negativity is\ninevitable to retain refinability of the spline functions defined using the\ndegenerated-patch method.

This has led to the development of\nimplicit schemes that are increasingly favoured by practitioners for their\ncomputational efficiency. The transport equation requires knowledge of the\nvelocity field, which results from an elliptic problem (Darcy problem) that is\nthe most expensive part of the computation. When considering large reservoirs,\na cost-effective way of approximating the Darcy problems is using multiscale\ndomain decomposition (MDD) methods.

The advantages of the SAV approach,\nsuch as linearity, unconditionally energy stability, and easy-to-implement, are\nprevalent. However, there is still an open issue unresolved, i.e., the\nnumerical schemes resulted from the SAV method preserve a \"modified\" energy law\naccording to the auxiliary variables instead of the original variables.\nTruncation errors are introduced during numerical calculations so that the\nnumerical solutions of the auxiliary variables are no longer equivalent to\ntheir original continuous definitions. In other words, even though the SAV\nscheme satisfies a modified energy law, it does not necessarily satisfy the\nenergy law of the original PDE models. This paper presents one essential\nrelaxation technique to overcome this issue, which we named the relaxed-SAV\n(RSAV) method. Our RSAV method penalizes the numerical errors of the auxiliary\nvariables by a relaxation technique. In general, the RSAV method keeps all the\nadvantages of the baseline SAV method and improves its accuracy and consistency\nnoticeably. Several examples have been presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the RSAV approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Apr 2021 04:37:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Maosheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Zengyan", ""], ["Zhao", "Jia", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.06659", "submitter": "Carolin Penke", "authors": "Peter Benner, Yuji Nakatsukasa, Carolin Penke", "title": "Stable and Efficient Computation of Generalized Polar Decompositions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present methods for computing the generalized polar decomposition of a\nmatrix based on the dynamically weighted Halley (DWH) iteration.

Prior\nIB/MLS methods have used isotropic kernel functions that coupled fluid\nvariables on both sides of the boundary to the interfacial degrees of freedom.\nThe original IB/MLS approach converts the cubic spline weights typically\nemployed in MLS reconstruction into an IB kernel function that satisfies\nparticular discrete moment conditions. This paper shows that the same approach\ncan be used to construct one-sided kernel functions (kernel functions are\nreferred to as generating functions in the MLS literature). We also examine the\nperformance of the new approach for a family of kernel functions introduced by\nPeskin. It is demonstrated that the one-sided MLS construction tends to\ngenerate non-monotone interpolation kernels with large over- and undershoots.\nWe present two simple weight shifting strategies to construct generating\nfunctions that are positive and monotone, which enhances the stability of the\nresulting IB methodology. Benchmark cases are used to test the order of\naccuracy and verify the one-sided IB/MLS simulations in both two and three\nspatial dimensions. This new IB/MLS method is also used to simulate flow over\nthe Ahmed car model, which highlights the applicability of this methodology for\nmodeling complex engineering flows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:37:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bale", "Rahul", ""], ["Bhalla", "Amneet Pal Singh", ""], ["Griffith", "Boyce E.", ""], ["Tsubokura", "Makoto", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.07866", "submitter": "Qiwei Feng", "authors": "Qiwei Feng, Bin Han and Peter Minev", "title": "Sixth Order Compact Finite Difference Scheme for Poisson Interface\n  Problem with Singular Sources", "comments": "27 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $\\Gamma$ be a smooth curve inside a two-dimensional rectangular region\n$\\Omega$.

In this paper, we introduce a deep\nrecurrent framework for solving time-dependent PDEs without generating large\nscale data sets. We provide a new perspective, that is, a different type of\narchitecture through exploring the possible connections between traditional\nnumerical methods (such as finite difference schemes) and deep neural networks,\nparticularly convolutional and fully-connected neural networks. Our proposed\napproach will show its effectiveness and efficiency in solving PDE models with\nan integral form, in particular, we test on one-way wave equations and system\nof conservation laws.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 16:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Cheng", ""], ["Liu", "Liu", ""], ["Zeng", "Tieyong", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.09637", "submitter": "Paola Boito", "authors": "Paola Boito, Roberto Grena", "title": "Quantum hub and authority centrality measures for directed networks\n  based on continuous-time quantum walks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we introduce, test and discuss three quantum methods for\ncomputing hub and authority centrality scores in directed networks.
