To converge in a small number of iterations, however, they\nhave to be coupled with an efficient preconditioner. The efficiency of the\npreconditioner depends largely on its accuracy on the eigenvectors\ncorresponding to small eigenvalues, and unfortunately, black-box methods\ntypically cannot guarantee sufficient accuracy on these eigenvectors. Thus,\nconstructing the preconditioner becomes a problem-dependent task. However, for\na large class of problems, including many elliptic equations, the eigenvectors\ncorresponding to small eigenvalues are smooth functions of the PDE grid. In\nthis paper, we describe a hierarchical approximate factorization approach which\nfocuses on improving accuracy on the smooth eigenvectors. The improved accuracy\nis achieved by preserving the action of the factorized matrix on piecewise\npolynomial functions of the grid. Based on the factorization, we propose a\nfamily of sparse preconditioners with $O(n)$ or $O(n \\log{n})$ construction\ncomplexities. Our methods exhibit the optimal $O(n)$ solution times in\nbenchmarks run on large elliptic problems of different types, arising for\nexample in flow or mechanical simulations. In the case of the linear elasticity\nequation the preconditioners are exact on the near-kernel rigid body modes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 05:20:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 22:11:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2020 22:09:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Klockiewicz", "Bazyli", ""], ["Darve", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03429", "submitter": "Shun Zhang", "authors": "Shun Zhang", "title": "On Approximating Discontinuous Solutions of PDEs by Adaptive Finite\n  Elements", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For singularly perturbed problems with a small diffusion, when the transient\nlayer is very sharp and the computational mesh is relatively coarse, the\nsolution can be viewed as discontinuous.

Could its analysis through these\ncombined perspectives be used as a Rosetta stone for deciphering mechanisms at\nplay in deep learning? Motivated by this question we introduce programmable and\ninterpretable regression networks for pattern recognition and address mode\ndecomposition as a prototypical problem. The programming of these networks is\nachieved by assembling elementary modules decomposing and recomposing kernels\nand data. These elementary steps are repeated across levels of abstraction and\ninterpreted from the equivalent perspectives of optimal recovery, game theory\nand Gaussian process regression (GPR). The prototypical mode/kernel\ndecomposition module produces an optimal approximation $(w_1,w_2,\\cdots,w_m)$\nof an element $(v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_m)$ of a product of Hilbert subspaces of a\ncommon Hilbert space from the observation of the sum $v:=v_1+\\cdots+v_m$. The\nprototypical mode/kernel recomposition module performs partial sums of the\nrecovered modes $w_i$ based on the alignment between each recovered mode $w_i$\nand the data $v$. We illustrate the proposed framework by programming\nregression networks approximating the modes $v_i=\na_i(t)y_i\\big(\\theta_i(t)\\big)$ of a (possibly noisy) signal $\\sum_i v_i$ when\nthe amplitudes $a_i$, instantaneous phases $\\theta_i$ and periodic waveforms\n$y_i$ may all be unknown and show near machine precision recovery under\nregularity and separation assumptions on the instantaneous amplitudes $a_i$ and\nfrequencies $\\dot{\\theta}_i$. The structure of some of these networks share\nintriguing similarities with convolutional neural networks while being\ninterpretable, programmable and amenable to theoretical analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:42:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2020 19:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Owhadi", "Houman", ""], ["Scovel", "Clint", ""], ["Yoo", "Gene Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.08660", "submitter": "XiaoMei Yang", "authors": "Zhiliang Deng, Xiaomei Yang and Jiangfeng Huang", "title": "A parametric Bayesian level set approach for acoustic source\n  identification using multiple frequency information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The reconstruction of the unknown acoustic source is studied using the noisy\nmultiple frequency data on a remote closed surface.
