In this work, we consider the trapezoidal family of\nschemes for integrating the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each\nsubdomain and present four different coupling methods, corresponding to\ndifferent algebraic constraints, for enforcing kinematic continuity on the\ninterface between the subdomains.\n  Method 1 (d-continuity) is based on the conventional approach using\ncontinuity of the primary variable and we show that this method is unstable for\na lot of commonly used time integrators including the mid-point rule. To\nalleviate this difficulty, we propose a new Method 2 (Modified d-continuity)\nand prove its stability for coupling all time integrators in the trapezoidal\nfamily (except the forward Euler). Method 3 (v-continuity) is based on\nenforcing the continuity of the time derivative of the primary variable.\nHowever, this constraint introduces a drift in the primary variable on the\ninterface. We present Method 4 (Baumgarte stabilized) which uses Baumgarte\nstabilization to limit this drift and we derive bounds for the stabilization\nparameter to ensure stability.\n  Our stability analysis is based on the ``energy'' method, and one of the main\ncontributions of this paper is the extension of the energy method (which was\npreviously introduced in the context of numerical methods for ODEs) to assess\nthe stability of numerical formulations for index-2 differential-algebraic\nequations (DAEs).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jul 2008 08:10:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2009 21:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nakshatrala", "K.
