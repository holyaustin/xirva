One may need to guarantee that a\nvalue stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value\nis well bounded. Such work may require several lines of proof for each line of\ncode, and will usually be broken by the smallest change to the code (e.g. for\nmaintenance or optimization purpose). Certifying these programs by hand is\ntherefore very tedious and error-prone. This article discusses the use of the\nGappa proof assistant in this context. Gappa has two main advantages over\nprevious approaches: Its input format is very close to the actual C code to\nvalidate, and it automates error evaluation and propagation using interval\narithmetic. Besides, it can be used to incrementally prove complex mathematical\nproperties pertaining to the C code. Yet it does not require any specific\nknowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus is accessible to a wide\ncommunity. Moreover, Gappa may generate a formal proof of the results that can\nbe checked independently by a lower-level proof assistant like Coq, hence\nproviding an even higher confidence in the certification of the numerical code.\nThe article demonstrates the use of this tool on a real-size example, an\nelementary function with correctly rounded output.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2008 13:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["De Dinechin", "Florent", "", "LIP"], ["Lauter", "Christoph Quirin", "", "LIP"], ["Melquiond", "Guillaume", "", "LIP"]]}, {"id": "0801.2398", "submitter": "Zuoqiang Shi", "authors": "Thomas Y.

On the other\nhand, the Immersed Boundary method is also known to suffer from a severe\ntimestep stability restriction when using an explicit time discretization. In\nthis paper, we propose several efficient semi-implicit schemes to remove this\nstiffness from the Immersed Boundary method for the two-dimensional Stokes\nflow. First, we obtain a novel unconditionally stable semi-implicit\ndiscretization for the immersed boundary problem. Using this unconditionally\nstable discretization as a building block, we derive several efficient\nsemi-implicit schemes for the immersed boundary problem by applying the Small\nScale Decomposition to this unconditionally stable discretization. Our\nstability analysis and extensive numerical experiments show that our\nsemi-implicit schemes offer much better stability property than the explicit\nscheme. Unlike other implicit or semi-implicit schemes proposed in the\nliterature, our semi-implicit schemes can be solved explicitly in the spectral\nspace. Thus the computational cost of our semi-implicit schemes is comparable\nto that of an explicit scheme, but with a much better stability property.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 22:22:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2008 21:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Thomas Y.", ""], ["Shi", "Zuoqiang", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3199", "submitter": "Ngoc-Diep Ho", "authors": "Ngoc-Diep Ho (1), Paul Van Dooren (1) and Vincent D.
