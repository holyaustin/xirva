In this paper we define a class of stochastic\nvolatility models that uses opening and closing prices along with the minimum\nand maximum prices within a trading period to infer the dynamics underlying the\nvolatility process of asset prices and compares it with similar models that\nhave been previously presented in the literature. The paper also discusses\nsequential Monte Carlo algorithms to fit this class of models and illustrates\nits features using both a simulation study and data form the SP500 index.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Jan 2009 21:08:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Abel", ""], ["Gzyl", "Henryk", ""], ["Molina", "German", ""], ["ter Horst", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1462", "submitter": "Jerome Jaffre", "authors": "Guy Chavent (INRIA Rocquencourt, Ceremade)", "title": "A Fully Equivalent Global Pressure Formulation for Three-Phase\n  Compressible Flow", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-6788", "categories": "cs.NA math.AP physics.class-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a new global pressure formulation for immiscible three-phase\ncompressible flows in porous media which is fully equivalent to the original\nequations, unlike the one introduced in \\cite{CJ86}.

In real life settings, sensor measurements are subject to varying\nenvironmental conditions and to measurement noise.\n  We present a simple iterative scheme called SS-Iterative for solving systems\nof linear equations, and examine its properties in the self-stabilizing\nperspective.
