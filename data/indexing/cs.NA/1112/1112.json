In many\napplied problems the individual components of the vector of unknowns are\ncoupled together and then splitting schemes are applied in order to get a\nsimple problem for evaluating components at a new time level. Typically, the\nadditive operator-difference schemes for systems of evolutionary equations are\nconstructed for operators coupled in space. In this paper we investigate more\ngeneral problems where coupling of derivatives in time for components of the\nsolution vector takes place. Splitting schemes are developed using an additive\nrepresentation for both the primary operator of the problem and the operator at\nthe time derivative. Splitting schemes are based on a triangular two-component\nrepresentation of the operators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2011 14:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Vabishchevich", "Petr N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.2160", "submitter": "Octavio Andres Gonzalez Estrada", "authors": "Octavio A.

The first is a recently developed superconvergent patch recovery\nprocedure with equilibration and enrichment (SPR-CX). The second is known as\nthe extended moving least squares recovery (XMLS), which enriches the recovered\nsolutions but does not enforce equilibrium constraints. Both are extended\nrecovery techniques as the polynomial basis used in the recovery process is\nenriched with singular terms for a better description of the singular nature of\nthe solution. Findings: Numerical results comparing the convergence and the\neffectivity index of both techniques with those obtained without the enrichment\nenhancement clearly show the need for the use of extended recovery techniques\nin Zienkiewicz-Zhu type error estimators for this class of problems. The\nresults also reveal significant improvements in the effectivities yielded by\nstatically admissible recovered solutions. Originality/value: This work shows\nthat both extended recovery procedures and statical admissibility are key to an\naccurate assessment of the quality of enriched finite element approximations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 17:41:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Gonz\u00e1lez-Estrada", "Octavio A.", ""], ["R\u00f3denas", "Juan Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Bordas", "St\u00e9phane P.
