A fast convergent iterative\nmethod is introduced in this paper to find the IMF components of the data, the\nmethod is faster and more predictable than the Empirical Mode Decomposition\nmethod devised by the author of Hilbert Huang Transform. The approach is to\niteratively adjust the control points on the data function corresponding to the\nextrema of the refining IMF, the control points of the residue function are\ncalculated as the median of the straight line segments passing through the data\ncontrol points, the residue function is then constructed as the cubic spline\nfunction of the median points. The initial residue function is simply\nconstructed as the straight line segments passing through the extrema of the\nfirst derivative of the data function. The refining IMF is the difference\nbetween the data function and the improved residue function. The IMF found\nreveals all the riding waves in the whole data set. A new data filtering method\non frequency and amplitude of IMF is also presented with the similar approach\nof finding the residue on the part to be filtered out.
