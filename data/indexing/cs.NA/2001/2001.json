The traditional\nworkhorse for data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the\nmatrix SVD, which presupposes that the data has been arranged in matrix format.\nOur main goal in this study is to show that high-dimensional data sets are more\ncompressible when treated as tensors (aka multiway arrays) and compressed via\ntensor-SVDs under the tensor-tensor product structures in (Kilmer and Martin,\n2011; Kernfeld et al., 2015). We begin by proving Eckart Young optimality\nresults for families of tensor-SVDs under two different truncation strategies.\nAs such optimality properties can be proven in both matrix and tensor-based\nalgebras, a fundamental question arises: does the tensor construct subsume the\nmatrix construct in terms of representation efficiency? The answer is yes, as\nshown when we prove that a tensor-tensor representation of an equal dimensional\nspanning space can be superior to its matrix counterpart. We then investigate\nhow the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor-SVD is\nrelated both theoretically and in compression performance to its closest\ntensor-based analogue, truncated HOSVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000; De Lathauwer\nand Vandewalle, 2004), thereby showing the potential advantages of our\ntensor-based algorithms.

The\nphysics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded\nby partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden\nphysics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying\nsuch systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer\nMethods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019).

However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving\nmicrostructure in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern\nevolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time\ninstants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales\nthat dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for\nevolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from\ndifferent physical specimens.

A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a\nminimal set of the spatial operators at steady state.

These effective data need to be computed by running\nlocal microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic\ninformation. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common\npractice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing\nhomogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a\nfirst order error $O(\\varepsilon/\\delta)$, where $\\varepsilon$ represents the\nwavelength of the microscale variations and $\\delta$ is the size of the\nmicroscopic simulation boxes. This error, called \"resonance error\", originates\nfrom the boundary conditions used in the micro-problem and typically dominates\nall other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the\nresonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting\napproaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last\ntwo decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of\nthe resonance error.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2020 14:02:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Mar 2021 21:07:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Abdulle", "Assyr", ""], ["Arjmand", "Doghonay", ""], ["Paganoni", "Edoardo", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.06319", "submitter": "Olexandr Polishchuk", "authors": "Olexandr Polishchuk", "title": "About Three Dimensional Double-Sided Dirichlet and Neumann Boundary\n  Value Problems for the Laplacian", "comments": "7 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1910.01301", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The orthogonality of Hilbert spaces whose elements can be represented as\nsimple and double layer potentials is determined.

These approaches explore the entire\ncoarse block resolution and one can obtain optimal convergence results\nindependent of contrast and scales. However, these approaches are not amenable\nto many multiscale simulations, where the subgrid effects are much smaller than\nthe coarse-mesh resolution. For example, the molecular dynamics of shale gas\noccurs in much smaller length scales compared to the coarse-mesh size, which is\nof orders of meters.

Although this approach\nis widely used and effective on many problems, there remain some practical\nissues with DSA preconditioning, particularly on highly heterogeneous domains.\nFor large-scale parallel simulation, it is critical that both (i)\npreconditioned source iteration converges rapidly, and (ii) the action of the\nDSA preconditioner can be applied using fast, scalable solvers, such as\nalgebraic multigrid (AMG). For heterogeneous domains, these two interests can\nbe at odds. In particular, there exist DSA diffusion discretizations that can\nbe solved rapidly using AMG, but they do not always yield robust/fast\nconvergence of the larger source iteration. Conversely, there exist robust DSA\ndiscretizations where source iteration converges rapidly on difficult\nheterogeneous problems, but fast parallel solvers like AMG tend to struggle\napplying the action of such operators. Moreover, very few current methods for\nthe solution of deterministic transport are compatible with voids.

The model is a simplified case of the seven-equation\nBaer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows, and results in a\nnonlinear hyperbolic system with non-conservative products. The geometry of the\nsolid bodies is simply specified via a scalar field that represents the volume\nfraction of the fluid present in each control volume.

We generalize the approach initially introduced for the\nrank-structured grid-based calculation of the collective potentials on 3D\nlattices [39] to the case of many-particle systems with variable charges placed\non $L^{\\otimes d}$ lattices and discretized on fine $n^{\\otimes d}$ Cartesian\ngrids for arbitrary dimension $d$. As result, the interaction potential is\nrepresented in a parametric low-rank canonical format in $O(d L n)$ complexity.\nThe energy is then calculated in $O(d L)$ operations. Electrostatics in large\nbiomolecules is modeled by using the novel range-separated (RS) tensor format\n[2], which maintains the long-range part of the 3D collective potential of the\nmany-body system represented on $n\\times n \\times n$ grid in a parametric\nlow-rank form in $O(n)$-complexity. We show that the force field can be easily\nrecovered by using the already precomputed electric field in the low-rank RS\nformat. The RS tensor representation of the discretized Dirac delta [45]\nenables the efficient energy preserving regularization scheme for solving the\n3D elliptic PDEs with strongly singular right-hand side arising in\nbio-sciences. We conclude that the rank-structured tensor-based approximation\ntechniques provide the promising numerical tools for applications to many-body\ndynamics, protein docking and classification problems and for low-parametric\ninterpolation of scattered data in data science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:24:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Khoromskaia", "Venera", ""], ["Khoromskij", "Boris N.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11441", "submitter": "Philipp Petersen", "authors": "Fabian Laakmann, Philipp Petersen", "title": "Efficient Approximation of Solutions of Parametric Linear Transport\n  Equations by ReLU DNNs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.AP math.FA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate that deep neural networks with the ReLU activation function\ncan efficiently approximate the solutions of various types of parametric linear\ntransport equations.
