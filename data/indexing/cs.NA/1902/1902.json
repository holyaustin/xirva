It has also achieved great success in\nvariation-aware design automation. However, almost all existing techniques\nassume that the parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian correlated,\nwhich is rarely true in real applications. For instance, in chip manufacturing,\nmany process variations are actually correlated. Recently, some techniques have\nbeen developed to handle non-Gaussian correlated random parameters, but they\nare time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. We present a new framework to\nsolve uncertainty quantification problems with many non-Gaussian correlated\nuncertainties. Firstly, we propose a set of smooth basis functions to well\ncapture the impact of non-Gaussian correlated process variations. We develop a\ntensor approach to compute these basis functions in a high-dimension setting.\nSecondly, we investigate the theoretical aspect and practical implementation of\na sparse solver to compute the coefficients of all basis functions. We provide\nsome theoretical analysis for the exact recovery condition and error bound of\nthis sparse solver in the context of uncertainty quantification. We present\nthree adaptive sampling approaches to improve the performance of the sparse\nsolver. Finally, we validate our methods by synthetic and practical\nelectronic/photonic ICs with 19 to 57 non-Gaussian correlated variation\nparameters. Our approach outperforms Monte Carlo by thousands of times in terms\nof efficiency. It can also accurately predict the output density functions with\nmultiple peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which are hard to capture\nby existing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:34:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2019 04:58:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cui", "Chunfeng", ""], ["Zhang", "Zheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00095", "submitter": "Thomas Roy", "authors": "Thomas Roy, Tom B.

The\nmethod is based on removal of basis functions associated with badly cut cells\nby introducing carefully designed constraints, which results in well-posed\nsystems of linear algebraic equations, while preserving the optimal\napproximation order of the underlying finite element spaces. The specific goal\nof this work is to present the implementation and performance of the method on\ndistributed-memory platforms aiming at the efficient solution of large-scale\nproblems. In particular, we show that, by considering AgFEM, the resulting\nsystems of linear algebraic equations can be effectively solved using standard\nalgebraic multigrid preconditioners. This is in contrast with previous works\nthat consider highly customized preconditioners in order to allow one the usage\nof iterative solvers in combination with unfitted techniques. Another novelty\nwith respect to the methods available in the literature is the problem sizes\nthat can be handled with the proposed approach. While most of previous\nreferences discussing linear solvers for unfitted methods are based on serial\nnon-scalable algorithms, we propose a parallel distributed-memory method able\nto efficiently solve problems at large scales. This is demonstrated by means of\na weak scaling test defined on complex 3D domains up to 300M degrees of freedom\nand one billion cells on 16K CPU cores in the Marenostrum-IV platform. The\nparallel implementation of the AgFEM method is available in the large-scale\nfinite element package FEMPAR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2019 13:24:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Aug 2019 06:05:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Verdugo", "Francesc", ""], ["Mart\u00edn", "Alberto F.", ""], ["Badia", "Santiago", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01169", "submitter": "Pascal de Koster", "authors": "Pascal de Koster, Roel Tielen, Elizaveta Wobbes, Matthias M\\\"oller", "title": "Extension of B-spline Material Point Method for unstructured triangular\n  grids using Powell-Sabin splines", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Material Point Method (MPM) is a numerical technique that combines a\nfixed Eulerian background grid and Lagrangian point masses to simulate\nmaterials which undergo large deformations.

Most traditional TOuU methods use gradient-based optimization\nalgorithms and rely on accurate estimates of the statistical moments and their\ngradients, e.g., via adjoint calculations.

However, there is no a priori assurance\nthat these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends on the\nability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a\nresult, ROMs can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM\nsolution at the online prediction point is not well represented by training\ndata used to construct the trial basis. To address this fundamental deficiency\nof standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel\nonline-adaptive mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner\nthat ensures convergence of the ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM\nsolves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed adaptive\n$h$-refinement method for ROMs [12], but improves upon this work in two crucial\nways. First, the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any\northogonal basis (not just the Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the\nrefinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored to the physics\ncharacterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast\nonline algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an\nefficient proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur\nany operations that scale with the FOM dimension. These two features allow the\nproposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs, as the method\nenables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the\ncase of inadequate training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation\nmechanism, as the combination of basis enrichment and compression enables the\nbasis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:47:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:14:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Etter", "Philip A.", ""], ["Carlberg", "Kevin T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10664", "submitter": "Danny Panknin", "authors": "Danny Panknin, Shinichi Nakajima, Thanh Binh Bui, Klaus-Robert\n  M\\\"uller", "title": "Estimating Local Function Complexity via Mixture of Gaussian Processes", "comments": "19 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Real world data often exhibit inhomogeneity, e.g., the noise level, the\nsampling distribution or the complexity of the target function may change over\nthe input space.
