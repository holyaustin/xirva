The new understanding allows us to design a new reduction\nalgorithm which is more efficient than the well-known LLL reduction algorithm.\nNumerical stability is taken into account in designing the new reduction\nalgorithm. For the ellipsoid-constrained ILS problem, we propose a new\nreduction algorithm which, unlike existing algorithms, uses all the available\ninformation.

This\nmethod uses the quasi-two-layer model of hydrodynamic flows over a stepwise\nboundary with advanced consideration of the flow features near the step. A\ndistinctive feature of the suggested model is a separation of a studied flow\ninto two layers in calculating flow quantities near each step, and improving by\nthis means approximation of depth-averaged solutions of the initial\nthree-dimensional Euler equations. We are solving the shallow-water equations\nfor one layer, introducing the fictitious lower layer only as an auxiliary\nstructure in setting up the appropriate Riemann problems for the upper layer.\nBesides quasi-two-layer approach leads to appearance of additional terms in\none-layer finite-difference representation of balance equations. These terms\nprovide the mechanical work made by nonhomogeneous bed interacting with flow. A\nnotable advantage of the proposed method is the consideration of the properties\nof the process of the waterfall, namely the fluid flow on the step in which the\nfluid does not wet part of the vertical wall of the step. The presence of dry\nzones in the vertical part of the step indicates violation of the conditions of\nhydrostatic flow. The quasi-two-layer approach determines the size of the dry\nzone of the vertical component of the step. Consequently it gives an\nopportunity to figure out the amount of flow kinetic energy dissipation on\ncomplex boundary.
