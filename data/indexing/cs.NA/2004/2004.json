Previous work had established\nnear-linear runtimes either only for $\\ell_2$ accuracy (a weaker criterion\nwhich is less relevant for applications), or through an entirely different\nalgorithm based on (currently) impractical Laplacian solvers.\n  We further show that if the graph with adjacency matrix $K$ is moderately\nconnected--e.g., if $K$ has at least one positive row/column pair--then\nOsborne's algorithm initially converges exponentially fast, yielding an\nimproved runtime $O(m\\epsilon^{-1}\\log\\kappa)$. We also address numerical\nprecision by showing that these runtime bounds still hold when using\n$O(\\log(n\\kappa/\\epsilon))$-bit numbers.\n  Our results are established through an intuitive potential argument that\nleverages a convex optimization perspective of Osborne's algorithm, and relates\nthe per-iteration progress to the current imbalance as measured in Hellinger\ndistance. Unlike previous analyses, we critically exploit log-convexity of the\npotential. Our analysis extends to other variants of Osborne's algorithm: along\nthe way, we establish significantly improved runtime bounds for cyclic, greedy,\nand parallelized variants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:31:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2021 22:49:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Altschuler", "Jason M.", ""], ["Parrilo", "Pablo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.03029", "submitter": "Sergio Gonz\\'alez-Andrade", "authors": "Sergio Gonz\\'alez-Andrade", "title": "A BDF2-Semismooth Newton Algorithm for the Numerical Solution of the\n  Bingham Flow with Temperature Dependent Parameters", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, 2020", "doi": "10.1016/j.jnnfm.2020.104380", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is devoted to the numerical solution of the non-isothermal\ninstationary Bingham flow with temperature dependent parameters by semismooth\nNewton methods.

However, detailed microscale fiber network\nmodels must be resolved with efficient numerical methods. In this work, a\nnumerical multiscale method for discrete network models is proposed that is\nbased on the localized orthogonal decomposition method [arXiv:1810.05059]. The\nmethod is ideal for these network problems, because it reduces the maximum size\nof the problem, it is suitable for parallelization, and it can effectively\nsolve fracture propagation.\n  The problem analyzed in this work is the nodal displacement of a fiber\nnetwork given an applied load. This problem is formulated as a linear system\nthat is solved by using the aforementioned multiscale method. To solve the\nlinear system, the multiscale method constructs a low-dimensional solution\nspace with good approximation properties. The method is observed to work well\nfor unstructured fiber networks, with optimal rates of convergence obtainable\nfor highly localized configurations of the method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00f6rtz", "Morgan", ""], ["Kettil", "Gustav", ""], ["M\u00e5lqvist", "Axel", ""], ["Mark", "Andreas", ""], ["Edelvik", "Fredrik", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.13357", "submitter": "Wolfgang Erb", "authors": "Ga\\\"el Bringout, Wolfgang Erb, J\\\"urgen Frikel", "title": "A new 3D model for magnetic particle imaging using realistic magnetic\n  field topologies for algebraic reconstruction", "comments": "27 pages, 11 figure, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1361-6420/abb446", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive a new 3D model for magnetic particle imaging (MPI) that is able to\nincorporate realistic magnetic fields in the reconstruction process.

A variable friction coefficient\nbased on the $\\mu(I)$ rheology is considered. The model is obtained from an\nasymptotic analysis in a local reference system, where the non-hydrostatic\ncontribution is supposed to be small compared to the hydrostatic one. The\nnon-hydrostatic counterpart of the pressure may be written as the sum of two\nterms: one corresponding to the stress tensor and the other to the vertical\nacceleration. The model introduced here is weakly non-hydrostatic, in the sense\nthat the non-hydrostatic contribution related to the stress tensor is not taken\ninto account due to its complex implementation. A simple and efficient\nnumerical scheme is proposed. It consists of a three-step splitting procedure,\nand it is based on a hydrostatic reconstruction. Two key points are: (i) the\nfriction force has to be taken into account before solving the non-hydrostatic\npressure. Otherwise, the incompressibility condition is not ensured; (ii) both\nthe hydrostatic and the non-hydrostatic pressure are taken into account when\ndealing with the friction force. The model and numerical scheme are then\nvalidated based on several numerical tests, including laboratory experiments of\ngranular collapse. The influence of non-hydrostatic terms and of the choice of\nthe coordinate system (Cartesian or local) is analyzed. We show that\nnon-hydrostatic models are less sensitive to the choice of the coordinate\nsystem. In general, the non-hydrostatic model introduced here much better\nreproduces granular collapse experiments compared to hydrostatic models. An\nimportant result is that the simulated mass profiles up to the deposit and the\nfront velocity are greatly improved. As expected, the influence of the\nnon-hydrostatic pressure is shown to be larger for small values of the slope.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Apr 2020 09:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Garres-D\u00edaz", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez-Nieto", "Enrique D.", ""], ["Mangeney", "Anne", ""], ["de Luna", "Tom\u00e1s Morales", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14229", "submitter": "Raphael Watschinger", "authors": "G\\\"unther Of, Raphael Watschinger", "title": "Complexity Analysis of a Fast Directional Matrix-Vector Multiplication", "comments": "20 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science, volume 12456, p.39 - 59 (2021)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-67077-1_3", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a fast, data-sparse directional method to realize matrix-vector\nproducts related to point evaluations of the Helmholtz kernel.
