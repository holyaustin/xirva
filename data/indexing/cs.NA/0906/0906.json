First results are promising with nRMSE < 21% and\nRMSE < 998 Wh/m2. Our optimized MLP presents prediction similar to or even\nbetter than conventional methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian inference,\nMarkov chains and k-Nearest-Neighbors approximators.

The interface can be physical, as in multi-physics and contact\nproblems, or purely numerical, as in the coupling of non-conforming meshes. The\nmost critical part of the modeling process is to ensure geometric compatibility\nand a complete transfer of surface tractions between the different components\nat the connecting interfaces. Popular contact modeling techniques rely on\ngeometric projections to detect and resolve overlapping or mass\ninterpenetration between two or more contacting bodies. Such approaches have\nbeen shown to have two major drawbacks: they are not suitable for contact at\nhighly nonlinear surfaces and sharp corners where smooth normal projections are\nnot feasible, and they fail to guarantee a complete and accurate transfer of\npressure across the interface. This dissertation presents a novel formulation\nfor the modeling of contact problems that possesses the ability to resolve\ncomplicated contact scenarios effectively, while being simpler to implement and\nmore widely applicable than currently available methods. We show that the\nformulation boils down to a node-to-surface gap function that works effectively\nfor non-smooth contact. The numerical implementation using the midpoint rule\nshows the need to guarantee the conservation of the total energy during impact,\nfor which a Lagrange multiplier method is used. We propose a local enrichment\nof the interface and a simple stabilization procedure based on the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method to guarantee an accurate transfer of the pressure\nfield. The result is a robust interface formulation for contact problems and\nthe coupling of non-conforming meshes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 01:49:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 12:59:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 13:35:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Haikal", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.0687", "submitter": "Olga Holtz", "authors": "Olga Holtz, Noam Shomron", "title": "Computational Complexity and Numerical Stability of Linear Problems", "comments": "16 pages; updated to reflect referees' remarks; to appear in\n  Proceedings of the 5th European Congress of Mathematics", "journal-ref": "European Congress of Mathematics Amsterdam, 14-18 July, 2008, EMS\n  Publishing House, pp. 381-400", "doi": "10.4171/077-1/16", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DS cs.NA math.HO math.NA math.RA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We survey classical and recent developments in numerical linear algebra,\nfocusing on two issues: computational complexity, or arithmetic costs, and\nnumerical stability, or performance under roundoff error.

It is a\nparticularly popular approach in genomic and proteomic sequence analysis.\nNumerous mappings of symbolic sequences have been proposed for various\napplications. It is unclear however whether the processing of symbolic data\nprovides an artifact of the numerical mapping or is an inherent property of the\nsymbolic data. This issue has been long ignored in the engineering and\nscientific literature. It is possible that many of the results obtained in\nsymbolic signal processing could be a byproduct of the mapping and might not\nshed any light on the underlying properties embedded in the data. Moreover, in\nmany applications, conflicting conclusions may arise due to the choice of the\nmapping used for numerical representation of symbolic data. In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework for the analysis of the equivalence of the mappings\nused for numerical representation of symbolic data. We present strong and weak\nequivalence properties and rely on signal correlation to characterize\nequivalent mappings. We derive theoretical results which establish conditions\nfor consistency among numerical mappings of symbolic data. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an abstract mapping model for symbolic sequences and extend the\nnotion of equivalence to an algebraic framework. Finally, we illustrate our\ntheoretical results by application to DNA sequence analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2009 01:10:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Liming", ""], ["Schonfeld", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3155", "submitter": "Takayuki Tsuchida", "authors": "Takayuki Tsuchida", "title": "A systematic method for constructing time discretizations of integrable\n  lattice systems: local equations of motion", "comments": "61 pages; (v2)(v3) many minor corrections", "journal-ref": "An abridged half-length version was published as J.
