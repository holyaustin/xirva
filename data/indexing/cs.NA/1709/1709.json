In particular, we deal with misspecified settings where a test\nintegrand is less smooth than a Sobolev RKHS based on which a quadrature rule\nis constructed. We provide convergence guarantees based on two different\nassumptions on a quadrature rule: one on quadrature weights, and the other on\ndesign points. More precisely, we show that convergence rates can be derived\n(i) if the sum of absolute weights remains constant (or does not increase\nquickly), or (ii) if the minimum distance between design points does not\ndecrease very quickly. As a consequence of the latter result, we derive a rate\nof convergence for Bayesian quadrature in misspecified settings. We reveal a\ncondition on design points to make Bayesian quadrature robust to\nmisspecification, and show that, under this condition, it may adaptively\nachieve the optimal rate of convergence in the Sobolev space of a lesser order\n(i.e., of the unknown smoothness of a test integrand), under a slightly\nstronger regularity condition on the integrand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 04:08:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2018 16:12:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kanagawa", "Motonobu", ""], ["Sriperumbudur", "Bharath K.", ""], ["Fukumizu", "Kenji", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00483", "submitter": "Tao Sun", "authors": "Tao Sun, Hao Jiang, Lizhi Cheng, Wei Zhu", "title": "Iteratively Linearized Reweighted Alternating Direction Method of\n  Multipliers for a Class of Nonconvex Problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2018.2868269", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA cs.CV math.NA math.OC stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider solving a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth\nproblems frequently appearing in signal processing and machine learning\nresearch.

Popular and effective measures of importance of a node or a\nset of nodes are defined in terms of suitable entries of functions of matrices\n$f(A)$. These kinds of measures are particularly relevant as they are able to\ncapture the global structure of connections involving a node. However,\ncomputing the entries of $f(A)$ requires a significant computational effort. In\nthis work we address the problem of estimating the changes in the entries of\n$f(A)$ with respect to changes in the edge structure. Intuition suggests that,\nif the topology of connections in the new graph $\\tilde G$ is not significantly\ndistorted, relevant components in $G$ maintain their leading role in $\\tilde\nG$. We propose several bounds giving mathematical reasoning to such intuition\nand showing, in particular, that the magnitude of the variation of the entry\n$f(A)_{k\\ell}$ decays exponentially with the shortest-path distance in $G$ that\nseparates either $k$ or $\\ell$ from the set of nodes touched by the edges that\nare perturbed.
