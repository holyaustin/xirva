This paper introduces a meta-procedure, called Non-Euclidean\nUpgrading (NEU), which learns feature maps that are expressive enough to embed\nthe universal approximation property (UAP) into most model classes while only\noutputting feature maps that preserve any model class's UAP. We show that NEU\ncan learn any feature map with these two properties if that feature map is\nasymptotically deformable into the identity. We also find that the\nfeature-representations learned by NEU are always submanifolds of the feature\nspace. NEU's properties are derived from a new deep neural model that is\nuniversal amongst all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms on the input space.\nWe derive qualitative and quantitative approximation guarantees for this\narchitecture. We quantify the number of parameters required for this new\narchitecture to memorize any set of input-output pairs while simultaneously\nfixing every point of the input space lying outside some compact set, and we\nquantify the size of this set as a function of our model's depth.

The approach is based on the rank-structured approximation of the matrix\nvalued functions of the corresponding fractional finite difference Laplacian.\nWe solve the equation for the control function, where the system matrix\nincludes the sum of the fractional $d$-dimensional Laplacian and its inverse.\nThe matrix valued functions of discrete Laplace operator on a tensor grid are\ndiagonalized by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then the low rank\napproximation of the $d$-dimensional tensors obtained by folding of the\ncorresponding large diagonal matrices of eigenvalues are computed, which allows\nto solve the governing equation for the control function in a tensor-structured\nformat. The existence of low rank canonical approximation to the class of\nmatrix valued functions involved is justified by using the sinc quadrature\napproximation method applied to the Laplace transform of the generating\nfunction. The linear system of equations for the control function is solved by\nthe PCG iterative method with the rank truncation at each iteration step, where\nthe low Kronecker rank preconditioner is precomputed. The right-hand side, the\nsolution vector, and the governing system matrix are maintained in the\nrank-structured tensor format which beneficially reduces the numerical cost to\n$O(n\\log n)$, outperforming the standard FFT based methods of complexity\n$O(n^3\\log n)$ for 3D case. Numerical tests for the 2D and 3D control problems\nconfirm the linear complexity scaling of the method in the univariate grid size\n$n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 13:25:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2018 17:18:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 16:07:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Heidel", "Gennadij", ""], ["Khoromskaia", "Venera", ""], ["Khoromskij", "Boris N.", ""], ["Schulz", "Volker", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.02341", "submitter": "Zhize Li", "authors": "Zhize Li, Jian Li", "title": "A Fast Anderson-Chebyshev Acceleration for Nonlinear Optimization", "comments": "To appear in AISTATS 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.LG cs.NA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Anderson acceleration (or Anderson mixing) is an efficient acceleration\nmethod for fixed point iterations $x_{t+1}=G(x_t)$, e.g., gradient descent can\nbe viewed as iteratively applying the operation $G(x) \\triangleq x-\\alpha\\nabla\nf(x)$.

This\ndecomposition is a powerful tool that is the workhorse of many methods both in\nmathematics and applied fields. A prominent application in recent years is the\napproximation of high-dimensional functions in a low-rank format. This is based\non the fact that, under certain conditions, a tensor can be identified with a\ncompact operator and SVD applies to the latter. One key assumption for this\napplication is that the tensor product norm is not weaker than the injective\nnorm. This assumption is not fulfilled in Sobolev spaces, which are widely used\nin the theory and numerics of partial differential equations. Our goal is the\nanalysis of the SVD in Sobolev spaces. This work consists of two parts. In this\nmanuscript (part I), we address low-rank approximations and minimal subspaces\nin H1. We analyze the H1-error of the SVD performed in the ambient L2-space. In\npart II, we will address variants of the SVD in norms stronger than the\nL2-norm. We will provide a few numerical examples that support our theoretical\nfindings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 13:00:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2019 09:51:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 25 Dec 2019 12:05:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ali", "Mazen", ""], ["Nouy", "Anthony", ""]]}]
