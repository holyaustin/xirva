The originality lies in the introduction of a\nviscoelastic tube law in PDE form, valid for both arterial and venous networks,\nleading to an augmented FSI system. In contrast to well established\nmathematical models, the proposed one is natively hyperbolic. The model is\nsolved with a 2nd-order numerical scheme based on an IMEX RK scheme conceived\nfor applications to hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms. The\nvalidation of the model is performed on different tests. Results obtained in\nRiemann problems, adopting a simple elastic tube law for the characterization\nof the vessel wall, are compared with available exact solutions. To validate\nthe contribution given by the viscoelastic term, the Method of Manufactured\nSolutions is applied. Specific tests are designed to verify the well-balancing\nand the AP property of the scheme. A specific test with an inlet pulse pressure\nwave is designed to assess the effects of viscoelasticity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Dec 2019 14:57:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bertaglia", "Giulia", ""], ["Caleffi", "Valerio", ""], ["Valiani", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.03195", "submitter": "Michael Schmischke", "authors": "Daniel Potts and Michael Schmischke", "title": "Learning multivariate functions with low-dimensional structures using\n  polynomial bases", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a method for the approximation of high-dimensional\nfunctions over finite intervals with respect to complete orthonormal systems of\npolynomials.

A popular approach to tackle this problem, known as random Fourier\nfeatures (RFFs), samples from a distribution to obtain the data-independent\nbasis of a higher finite-dimensional feature space, where its dot product\napproximates the kernel function. Recently, deterministic, rather than random\nconstruction has been shown to outperform RFFs, by approximating the kernel in\nthe frequency domain using Gaussian quadrature. In this paper, we view the dot\nproduct of these explicit mappings not as an approximation, but as an\nequivalent positive-definite kernel that induces a new finite-dimensional\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This opens the door to no-trick (NT)\nonline kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) that is scalable and robust. Random\nfeatures are prone to large variances in performance, especially for smaller\ndimensions. Here, we focus on deterministic feature-map construction based on\npolynomial-exact solutions and show their superiority over random\nconstructions. Without loss of generality, we apply this approach to classical\nadaptive filtering algorithms and validate the methodology to show that\ndeterministic features are faster to generate and outperform state-of-the-art\nkernel methods based on random Fourier features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2019 06:39:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Kan", ""], ["Principe", "Jose C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.04582", "submitter": "Aleksandr Chikitkin", "authors": "A.V.

In this\npaper, we illustrate the mathematical framework of the SDM and the associated\nerror factors in detail. We then analyze a homogeneous temperature field using\nthe SDM, the standard finite difference method, and the conventional domain\ndecomposition method (DDM) to compare the convergence properties of these\nmethods. In addition, to compare their computational accuracies and time\nrequirements, we also simulated a nonperiodic temperature field with a\nnonuniform thermal conductivity distribution using the three methods. The\naccuracy of the SDM is very high and is approximately equivalent to that of the\nDDM. The mean temperature error is less than 0.02% of the maximum temperature\nin the simulated field. The total central processing unit (CPU) times required\nfor the analyses using the most efficient SDM model and the DDM model represent\n13% and 17% of that of the finite difference model, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 13:54:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Suzuki", "Yoshiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.08022", "submitter": "Anna Ochal", "authors": "Weimin Han, Michal Jureczka and Anna Ochal", "title": "Numerical Studies of a Hemivariational Inequality for a Viscoelastic\n  Contact Problem with Damage", "comments": "22 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is devoted to the study of a hemivariational inequality modeling\nthe quasistatic bilateral frictional contact between a viscoelastic body and a\nrigid foundation.

Traditionally they are\napplied to solve for the state given the dynamics (the forward problem), but\nhere we consider their application for learning the dynamics given the state\n(the inverse problem). This repurposing of LMMs is largely motivated by growing\ninterest in data-driven modeling of dynamics, but the behavior and analysis of\nLMMs for discovery turn out to be significantly different from the well-known,\nexisting theory for the forward problem. Assuming a highly idealized setting of\nbeing given the exact state with a zero residual of the discrete dynamics, we\nestablish for the first time a rigorous framework based on refined notions of\nconsistency and stability to yield convergence using LMMs for discovery. When\napplying these concepts to three popular $M-$step LMMs, the Adams-Bashforth,\nAdams-Moulton, and Backwards Differentiation Formula schemes, the new theory\nsuggests that Adams-Bashforth for $M$ ranging from $1$ and $6$, Adams-Moulton\nfor $M=0$ and $M=1$, and Backwards Differentiation Formula for all positive $M$\nare convergent, and, otherwise, the methods are not convergent in general.

The GenEO coarse space has been\nshown to lead to a fully robust two-level Schwarz preconditioner which scales\nwell over multiple cores [27, 19] as has been proved rigorously in [27]. The\nrobustness is due to its good approximation properties for problems with highly\nheterogeneous material parameters. It is available in the finite element\npackages FreeFem++, Feel++ and recently in Dune and is implemented as a\nstandalone library in HPDDM But the coarse component of the preconditioner can\nultimately become a bottleneck if the number of subdomains is very large and\nexact solves are used. It is therefore interesting to consider the effect of\napproximate coarse solves. In this paper, robustness of GenEO methods is\nanalyzed with respect to approximate coarse solves. Interestingly, the GenEO-2\nmethod has to be modified in order to be able to prove its robustness in this\ncontext.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 08:54:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2020 09:14:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nataf", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "LJLL"]]}, {"id": "1912.13248", "submitter": "Tsiry Randrianasolo", "authors": "\\v{L}ubom\\'ir Ba\\v{n}as and Giorgio Ferrari and Tsiry A.
