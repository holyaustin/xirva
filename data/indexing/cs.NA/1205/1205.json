We conducted a thorough performance study of EleMRRR and ScaLAPACK's\nsolvers on two supercomputers. Such a study, performed with up to 8,192 cores,\nprovides precise guidelines to assemble the fastest solver within the ScaLAPACK\nframework; it also indicates that EleMRRR outperforms even the fastest solvers\nbuilt from ScaLAPACK's components.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2012 21:20:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 02:59:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Petschow", "Matthias", ""], ["Peise", "Elmar", ""], ["Bientinesi", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.2129", "submitter": "Vinh Phu Vinh Phu Nguyen Vinh Phu Nguyen", "authors": "Vinh Phu Nguyen, St\\'ephane P.A.

The\nimplications to practical engineering design scenarios are profound, since the\ntime taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced, leading to dramatic\ngains in efficiency. The tight coupling of CAD and analysis within IGA requires\nknowledge from both fields and it is one of the goals of the present paper to\noutline much of the commonly used notation. In this manuscript, through a clear\nand simple Matlab implementation, we present an introduction to IGA applied to\nthe Finite Element (FE) method and related computer implementation aspects.\nFurthermore, implemen- tation of the extended IGA which incorporates enrichment\nfunctions through the partition of unity method (PUM) is also presented, where\nseveral examples for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fracture are\nillustrated. The open source Matlab code which accompanies the present paper\ncan be applied to one, two and three-dimensional problems for linear\nelasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, structural mechanics\n(beams/plates/shells including large displacements and rotations) and Poisson\nproblems with or without enrichment. The Bezier extraction concept that allows\nFE analysis to be performed efficiently on T-spline geometries is also\nincorporated.

A wide variety of methods have been used to model poroelasticity,\nincluding finite difference, finite element, pseudospectral, and discontinuous\nGalerkin methods.
