Methods: The underlying idea is that\nmany iterative algorithms for finding such a solution are perturbation\nresilient in the sense that, even if certain kinds of changes are made at the\nend of each iterative step, the algorithm still produces a\nconstraints-compatible solution. This property is exploited by using permitted\nchanges to steer the algorithm to a solution that is not only\nconstraints-compatible, but is also desirable according to a specified\noptimization criterion. The approach is very general, it is applicable to many\niterative procedures and optimization criteria used in medical physics.\nResults: The main practical contribution is a procedure for automatically\nproducing from any given iterative algorithm its superiorized version, which\nwill supply solutions that are superior according to a given optimization\ncriterion. It is shown that if the original iterative algorithm satisfies\ncertain mathematical conditions, then the output of its superiorized version is\nguaranteed to be as constraints-compatible as the output of the original\nalgorithm, but it is superior to the latter according to the optimization\ncriterion. This intuitive description is made precise in the paper and the\nstated claims are rigorously proved. Superiorization is illustrated on\nsimulated computerized tomography data of a head cross-section and, in spite of\nits generality, superiorization is shown to be competitive to an optimization\nalgorithm that is specifically designed to minimize total variation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 05:19:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Herman", "G.
