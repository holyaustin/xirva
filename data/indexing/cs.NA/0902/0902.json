Communication costs often dominate arithmetic costs, so it is of\ninterest to design algorithms minimizing communication. In this paper we first\nextend known lower bounds on the communication cost (both for bandwidth and for\nlatency) of conventional (O(n^3)) matrix multiplication to Cholesky\nfactorization, which is used for solving dense symmetric positive definite\nlinear systems. Second, we compare the costs of various Cholesky decomposition\nimplementations to these lower bounds and identify the algorithms and data\nstructures that attain them. In the sequential case, we consider both the\ntwo-level and hierarchical memory models. Combined with prior results in [13,\n14, 15], this gives a set of communication-optimal algorithms for O(n^3)\nimplementations of the three basic factorizations of dense linear algebra: LU\nwith pivoting, QR and Cholesky. But it goes beyond this prior work on\nsequential LU by optimizing communication for any number of levels of memory\nhierarchy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2009 11:41:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2009 12:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2010 16:59:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ballard", "Grey", ""], ["Demmel", "James", ""], ["Holtz", "Olga", ""], ["Schwartz", "Oded", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.3088", "submitter": "Daniel Fulger", "authors": "Daniel Fulger and Guido Germano", "title": "Automatic generation of non-uniform random variates for arbitrary\n  pointwise computable probability densities by tiling", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures, submitted to a peer-reviewed journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a rejection method based on recursive covering of the probability\ndensity function with equal tiles.
