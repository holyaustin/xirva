These systems\nhave been used to model the conformational switching of proteins as they cycle\nfrom an inactive state in the cell cytoplasm, to an active state at the cell\nmembrane. The active state then acts as input to downstream effectors. The\nparadigm of activation by recruitment to the membrane underpins a range of\nbiological pathways - including G-protein signalling, growth control through\nRas and PI 3-kinase, and cell polarity through Rac and Rho; all activate their\ntargets by recruiting them from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Global mass\nconservation lies at the heart of these models reflecting the property that the\ntotal number of active and inactive forms, and targets, remains constant. Here\nwe present a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element\nmethod for the approximate solution of systems of bulk-surface\nreaction-diffusion equations on an evolving two-dimensional domain. Fundamental\nto the success of the method is the robust generation of bulk and surface\nmeshes. For this purpose, we use a moving mesh partial differential equation\n(MMPDE) approach. Global conservation of the fully discrete finite element\nsolution is established independently of the ALE velocity field and the time\nstep size.

While these techniques have been very successful for parabolic\nequations, it has often been observed that their performance suffers\ndramatically when applied to advection-dominated problems or purely hyperbolic\nPDEs using standard rediscretization approaches on coarse grids. In this paper,\nwe apply MGRIT or Parareal to the constant-coefficient linear advection\nequation, appealing to existing convergence theory to provide insight into the\ntypically non-scalable or even divergent behavior of these solvers for this\nproblem. To overcome these failings, we replace rediscretization on coarse\ngrids with improved coarse-grid operators that are computed by applying\noptimization techniques to approximately minimize error estimates from the\nconvergence theory. One of our main findings is that, in order to obtain fast\nconvergence as for parabolic problems, coarse-grid operators should take into\naccount the behavior of the hyperbolic problem by tracking the characteristic\ncurves. Our approach is tested for schemes of various orders using explicit or\nimplicit Runge-Kutta methods combined with upwind-finite-difference spatial\ndiscretizations. In all cases, we obtain scalable convergence in just a handful\nof iterations, with parallel tests also showing significant speed-ups over\nsequential time-stepping.

Layer-wise training is one of them, which\ntrains a single layer at a time, rather than trains the whole layers\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we study a layer-wise training using a block\ncoordinate gradient descent (BCGD) for deep linear networks.

Also, we\nidentify the effects of depth, width, and initialization in the training\nprocess. We show that when the orthogonal-like initialization is employed, the\nwidth of intermediate layers plays no role in gradient-based training, as long\nas the width is greater than or equal to both the input and output dimensions.\nWe show that under some conditions, the deeper the network is, the faster the\nconvergence is guaranteed.

Image recovery techniques from\nMMVs aim to exploit the joint sparsity across the measurements in the sparse\ndomain. This is typically accomplished by extending the use of $\\ell_1$\nregularization of the sparse domain in the single measurement vector (SMV) case\nto using $\\ell_{2,1}$ regularization so that the \"jointness\" can be accounted\nfor. Although effective, the approach is inherently coupled and therefore\ncomputationally inefficient. The method also does not consider current\napproaches in the SMV case that use spatially varying weighted $\\ell_1$\nregularization term. The recently introduced variance based joint sparsity\n(VBJS) recovery method uses the variance across the measurements in the sparse\ndomain to produce a weighted MMV method that is more accurate and more\nefficient than the standard $\\ell_{2,1}$ approach. The efficiency is due to the\ndecoupling of the measurement vectors, with the increased accuracy resulting\nfrom the spatially varying weight. This paper introduces the accelerated VBJS\nwhich reduces computational cost even further by eliminating the requirement to\nfirst approximate the underlying image in order to construct the weights.\nEliminating this preprocessing step moreover reduces the amount of information\nlost from the data, so that our method is more accurate.

This method\nuses a different hybridization compared to the space-time hybridized\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method we presented previously in (Int. J. Numer.\nMeth. Fluids 89: 519--532, 2019). In the space-time EHDG method the velocity\ntrace unknown is continuous while the pressure trace unknown is discontinuous\nacross facets. In the space-time HDG method, all trace unknowns are\ndiscontinuous across facets. Alternatively, we present also a space-time\nembedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method in which all trace unknowns are\ncontinuous across facets. The advantage of continuous trace unknowns is that\nthe formulation has fewer global degrees-of-freedom for a given mesh than when\nusing discontinuous trace unknowns. Nevertheless, the discrete velocity field\nobtained by the space-time EHDG and EDG methods, like the space-time HDG\nmethod, is exactly divergence-free, even on moving domains. However, only the\nspace-time EHDG and HDG methods result in divergence-conforming velocity\nfields. An immediate consequence of this is that the space-time EHDG and HDG\ndiscretizations of the conservative form of the Navier--Stokes equations are\nenergy stable. The space-time EDG method, on the other hand, requires a\nskew-symmetric formulation of the momentum advection term to be energy-stable.\nNumerical examples will demonstrate the differences in solution obtained by the\nspace-time EHDG, EDG, and HDG methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2019 20:35:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Horvath", "Tamas L.", ""], ["Rhebergen", "Sander", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.08652", "submitter": "Chao-Ping Lin", "authors": "Chao-Ping Lin, Huiqing Xie, Roger Grimes and Zhaojun Bai", "title": "On the shift-invert Lanczos method for the buckling eigenvalue problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of extracting a few desired eigenpairs of the\nbuckling eigenvalue problem $Kx = \\lambda K_Gx$, where $K$ is symmetric\npositive semi-definite, $K_G$ is symmetric indefinite, and the pencil $K -\n\\lambda K_G$ is singular, namely, $K$ and $K_G$ share a non-trivial common\nnullspace.

In particular, we show that under moderate assumptions on the\ndecay of the input random field, the error rate obtained by using a specially\ndesigned, randomly shifted rank-1 lattice quadrature rule is essentially\ninversely proportional to the number of quadrature nodes. The overall\ndiscretization error of the problem, consisting of the dimension truncation\nerror, finite element discretization error and quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature\nerror, is derived in detail. We assess the theoretical findings in numerical\nexperiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2019 14:58:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Guth", "Philipp A.", ""], ["Kaarnioja", "Vesa", ""], ["Kuo", "Frances Y.", ""], ["Schillings", "Claudia", ""], ["Sloan", "Ian H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.10069", "submitter": "Yangwen Zhang", "authors": "Peter Monk, Yangwen Zhang", "title": "Finite Element Methods for Maxwell's Equations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We survey finite element methods for approximating the time harmonic Maxwell\nequations.

In the literature, it is\nquite standard to ask for exact geometric information to implement a priori or\na posteriori error analysis of numerical solutions, which, however, is often\nviolated in practice. Such gap is filled using the superconvergence of\ndifferential structure on manifolds. We illustrate the idea using two concrete\nexemplary case study. In the first case, we deal with deviated manifolds, where\nwe propose a concept called geometric supercloseness.
