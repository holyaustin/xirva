We introduce strong multiplicity detection as\nthe ability for the robots to detect the exact number of robots located at a\ngiven position. We show that with strong multiplicity detection, there exists a\ndeterministic self-stabilizing algorithm solving GP for n robots if, and only\nif, n is odd.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2009 06:11:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Dieudonn\u00e9", "Yoann", "", "LaRIA, MIS"], ["Petit", "Franck", "", "LaRIA, LIP, INRIA\n  Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parall\u00e9lisme"]]}, {"id": "0905.4387", "submitter": "Fahem Kebair", "authors": "Fahem Kebair and Frederic Serin", "title": "Information Modeling for a Dynamic Representation of an Emergency\n  Situation", "comments": "6", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose an approach to build a decision support system that\ncan help emergency planners and responders to detect and manage emergency\nsituations. The internal mechanism of the system is independent from the\ntreated application. Therefore, we think the system may be used or adapted\neasily to different case studies. We focus here on a first step in the\ndecision-support process which concerns the modeling of information issued from\nthe perceived environment and their representation dynamically using a\nmultiagent system. This modeling was applied on the RoboCupRescue Simulation\nSystem. An implementation and some results are presented here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2009 11:53:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kebair", "Fahem", ""], ["Serin", "Frederic", ""]]}]
