In this\ndirection, a first contribution of this work is an extension of rigidity theory\nto weighted frameworks and the rigidity eigenvalue, which when positive ensures\nthe infinitesimal rigidity of the framework. We then propose a distributed\nalgorithm for estimating a common relative position reference frame amongst a\nteam of robots with only range measurements in addition to one agent endowed\nwith the capability of measuring the bearing to two other agents. This first\nestimation step is embedded into a subsequent distributed algorithm for\nestimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework. The\nestimate of the rigidity eigenvalue is finally used to generate a local control\naction for each agent that both maintains the rigidity property and enforces\nadditional con- straints such as collision avoidance and sensing/communication\nrange limits and occlusions. As an additional feature of our approach, the\ncommunication and sensing links among the robots are also left free to change\nover time while preserving rigidity of the whole framework. The proposed scheme\nis then experimentally validated with a robotic testbed consisting of 6\nquadrotor UAVs operating in a cluttered environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 20:34:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 18:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2014 21:07:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zelazo", "Daniel", ""], ["Franchi", "Antonio", ""], ["B\u00fclthoff", "Heinrich H.", ""], ["Giordano", "Paolo Robuffo", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.2574", "submitter": "Guodong Shi", "authors": "Guodong Shi, Alexandre Proutiere, Mikael Johansson, and Karl H.\n  Johansson", "title": "Randomized Consensus with Attractive and Repulsive Links", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.MA math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study convergence properties of a randomized consensus algorithm over a\ngraph with both attractive and repulsive links. At each time instant, a node is\nrandomly selected to interact with a random neighbor. Depending on if the link\nbetween the two nodes belongs to a given subgraph of attractive or repulsive\nlinks, the node update follows a standard attractive weighted average or a\nrepulsive weighted average, respectively. The repulsive update has the opposite\nsign of the standard consensus update. In this way, it counteracts the\nconsensus formation and can be seen as a model of link faults or malicious\nattacks in a communication network, or the impact of trust and antagonism in a\nsocial network. Various probabilistic convergence and divergence conditions are\nestablished. A threshold condition for the strength of the repulsive action is\ngiven for convergence in expectation: when the repulsive weight crosses this\nthreshold value, the algorithm transits from convergence to divergence. An\nexplicit value of the threshold is derived for classes of attractive and\nrepulsive graphs. The results show that a single repulsive link can sometimes\ndrastically change the behavior of the consensus algorithm. They also\nexplicitly show how the robustness of the consensus algorithm depends on the\nsize and other properties of the graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 15:28:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Guodong", ""], ["Proutiere", "Alexandre", ""], ["Johansson", "Mikael", ""], ["Johansson", "Karl H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.3126", "submitter": "Robert Singer", "authors": "J.

Current BPMS, in general, are based on BPMN 2.0\nand/or BPEL. It is well known, that these approaches have some restrictions\naccording modeling and immediate transfer of the model into executable code.\nRecently, a method for modeling and execution of business processes, named\nsubject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), gained attention. This\nmethodology facilitates modeling of any business process using only five\nsymbols and allows direct execution based on such models. Further on, this\nmethodology has a strong theoretical and formal basis realizing distributed\nsystems; any process is defined as a network of independent and distributed\nagents - i.e. instances of subjects - which coordinate work through the\nexchange of messages. In this work, we present a framework and a prototype\nbased on off-the-shelf technologies as a possible realization of the S-BPM\nmethodology. We can prove and demonstrate the principal architecture concept;\nthese results should also stimulate a discussion about actual BPMS and its\nunderlying concepts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 12:02:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 May 2014 14:53:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kotremba", "J.", ""], ["Ra\u00df", "S.", ""], ["Singer", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.3197", "submitter": "Arthur Carvalho", "authors": "Arthur Carvalho, Stanko Dimitrov, Kate Larson", "title": "Inducing Honest Reporting Without Observing Outcomes: An Application to\n  the Peer-Review Process", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.DL math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When eliciting opinions from a group of experts, traditional devices used to\npromote honest reporting assume that there is an observable future outcome.

We also show how the group's scores can be used to find a consensual\nreview.
