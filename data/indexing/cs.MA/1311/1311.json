Coordination usually requires sufficient information\nflow, which is usually depicted by the connectivity of the communication\nnetwork. In a networked system, removal of some agents may cause a\ndisconnection. In order to maintain connectivity in agent removal, one can\ndesign a robust network topology that tolerates a finite number of agent\nlosses, and/or develop a control strategy that recovers connectivity. This\npaper proposes a decentralized control scheme based on a sequence of\nreplacements, each of which occurs between an agent and one of its immediate\nneighbors. The replacements always end with an agent, whose relocation does not\ncause a disconnection. We show that such an agent can be reached by a local\nrule utilizing only some local information available in agents' immediate\nneighborhoods. As such, the proposed message passing strategy guarantees the\nconnectivity maintenance in arbitrary agent removal. Furthermore, we\nsignificantly improve the optimality of the proposed scheme by incorporating\n$\\delta$-criticality (i.e. the criticality of an agent in its\n$\\delta$-neighborhood).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 18:16:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Aksaray", "Derya", ""], ["Yazicioglu", "A.
