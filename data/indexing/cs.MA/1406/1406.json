We prove rigorous results on the evolution of this\nconfiguration, which confirm hypotheses previously made based on simulations\nfor small values of n. Namely, for every n, the system evolves as follows:\nafter every 5 time steps, a group of 3 agents become disconnected at either end\nand collapse to a cluster at the subsequent step. This continues until there\nare fewer than 6 agents left in the middle, and these finally collapse to a\ncluster, if n is not a multiple of 6. In particular, the final configuration\nconsists of 2*[n/6] clusters of size 3, plus one cluster in the middle of size\nn (mod 6), if n is not a multiple of 6, and the number of time steps before\nfreezing is 5n/6 + O(1). We also consider the dynamics for arbitrary, but\nconstant, inter-agent spacings d \\in [0, 1] and present three main findings.\nFirstly we prove that the evolution is periodic also at some other, but not\nall, values of d, and present numerical evidence that for all d something\n\"close\" to periodicity nevertheless holds. Secondly, we exhibit a value of d at\nwhich the behaviour is periodic and the time to freezing is n + O(1), hence\nslower than that for d = 1. Thirdly, we present numerical evidence that, as d\n--> 0, the time to freezing may be closer, in order of magnitude, to the\ndiameter d(n-1) of the configuration rather than the number of agents n.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 16:01:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 16:51:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hegarty", "Peter", ""], ["Wedin", "Edvin", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1034", "submitter": "Christoph Salge", "authors": "Christoph Salge and Daniel Polani", "title": "Don't Believe Everything You Hear; Preserving Relevant Information by\n  Discarding Social Information", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Proceedings of\n  Alife14", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.SI nlin.AO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Integrating information gained by observing others via Social Bayesian\nLearning can be beneficial for an agent's performance, but can also enable\npopulation wide information cascades that perpetuate false beliefs through the\nagent population.
