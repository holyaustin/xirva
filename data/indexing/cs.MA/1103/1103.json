To protect\nelections from such control attempts, computational complexity has been\ninvestigated and the corresponding NP-hardness results are termed \"resistance.\"\nIt has been a long-running project of research in this area to classify the\nmajor voting systems in terms of their resistance properties. We show that\nfallback voting, an election system proposed by Brams and Sanver (2009) to\ncombine Bucklin with approval voting, is resistant to each of the common types\nof control except to destructive control by either adding or deleting voters.\nThus fallback voting displays the broadest control resistance currently known\nto hold among natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem.\nWe also study the control complexity of Bucklin voting and show that it\nperforms at least almost as well as fallback voting in terms of control\nresistance. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting, each\nresistance shown for Bucklin voting strengthens the corresponding resistance\nfor fallback voting. Such worst-case complexity analysis is at best an\nindication of security against control attempts, rather than a proof. In\npractice, the difficulty of control will depend on the structure of typical\ninstances. We investigate the parameterized control complexity of Bucklin and\nfallback voting, according to several parameters that are often likely to be\nsmall for typical instances. Our results, though still in the worst-case\ncomplexity model, can be interpreted as significant strengthenings of the\nresistance demonstrations based on NP-hardness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2011 10:17:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2012 23:17:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Erd\u00e9lyi", "G\u00e1bor", ""], ["Fellows", "Michael", ""], ["Rothe", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["Schend", "Lena", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5142", "submitter": "Paolo Braca Paolo Braca", "authors": "Paolo Braca, Stefano Marano, and Vincenzo Matta", "title": "Asymptotic Properties of One-Bit Distributed Detection with Ordered\n  Transmissions", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.MA math.IT stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a sensor network made of remote nodes connected to a common fusion\ncenter. In a recent work Blum and Sadler [1] propose the idea of ordered\ntransmissions -sensors with more informative samples deliver their messages\nfirst- and prove that optimal detection performance can be achieved using only\na subset of the total messages. Taking to one extreme this approach, we show\nthat just a single delivering allows making the detection errors as small as\ndesired, for a sufficiently large network size: a one-bit detection scheme can\nbe asymptotically consistent. The transmission ordering is based on the modulus\nof some local statistic (MO system). We derive analytical results proving the\nasymptotic consistency and, for the particular case that the local statistic is\nthe log-likelihood (\\ell-MO system), we also obtain a bound on the error\nconvergence rate. All the theorems are proved under the general setup of random\nnumber of sensors. Computer experiments corroborate the analysis and address\ntypical examples of applications including: non-homogeneous Poisson-deployed\nnetworks, detection by per-sensor censoring, monitoring of energy-constrained\nphenomenon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Mar 2011 16:48:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Braca", "Paolo", ""], ["Marano", "Stefano", ""], ["Matta", "Vincenzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5703", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "Jose-Luis Lopez, Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz and Xavier Calbet", "title": "Exponential wealth distribution in a random market.
