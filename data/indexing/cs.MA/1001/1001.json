In this paper we focus on human reactive behaviour as it is\npossible in both modelling approaches to implement human reactive behaviour in\nthe model by using standard methods. As a case study we have chosen the retail\nsector, and here in particular the operations of the fitting room in the women\nwear department of a large UK department store. In our case study we looked at\nways of determining the efficiency of implementing new management policies for\nthe fitting room operation through modelling the reactive behaviour of staff\nand customers of the department. First, we have carried out a validation\nexperiment in which we compared the results from our models to the performance\nof the real system. This experiment also allowed us to establish differences in\noutput accuracy between the two modelling methids. In a second step a\nmulti-scenario experiment was carried out to study the behaviour of the models\nwhen they are used for the purpose of operational improvement. Overall we have\nfound that for our case study example both discrete event simulation and agent\nbased simulation have the same potential to support the investigation into the\nefficiency of implementing new management policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 14:15:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Majid", "Mazlina Abdul", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Siebers", "Peer-Olaf", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3171", "submitter": "Ali Parandehgheibi", "authors": "Ali ParandehGheibi, Asuman Ozdaglar, Michelle Effros, Muriel Medard", "title": "Optimal Reverse Carpooling Over Wireless Networks - A Distributed\n  Optimization Approach", "comments": "submitted to CISS 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We focus on a particular form of network coding, reverse carpooling, in a\nwireless network where the potentially coded transmitted messages are to be\ndecoded immediately upon reception.

Although the individual agents have knowledge of their local network\nstructure only (i.e., myopic information), they are collectively able to\naggregate this local information and decide on what links are most beneficial\nto be added or removed at each time step.
