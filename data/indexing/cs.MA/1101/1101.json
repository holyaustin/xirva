It is shown how to build a bridge\nbetween RGT and emotions. For this purpose the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD)\nmodel is adopted. The major advantages of RGT are its ability to predict human\nbehavior and unfold the entire spectra of reflexion in the human mind. On the\nother hand, PAD provides ultimate approach to model emotions. It is illustrated\nthat emotions are reflexive processes and, consequently, RGT fused with PAD\nmodel is natural solution to model emotional interactions between people. The\nfusion of RGT and PAD, called Emotional Reflexive Games (ERG), inherits the key\nfeatures of both components. Using ERG, we show how reflexive control can be\nsuccessfully applied to model human emotional states. Up to date, EGR is a\nunique methodology capable of modeling human reflexive processes and emotional\naspects simultaneously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Dec 2010 15:18:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tarasenko", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2002", "submitter": "Mohammad Karimadini", "authors": "Mohammad Karimadini and Hai Lin", "title": "Cooperative Tasking for Deterministic Specification Automata", "comments": "Preprint, Submitted for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Technical Report: NUS-ACT-12-001-Ver.3", "categories": "cs.SY cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In our previous work [1], a divide-and-conquer approach was proposed for\ncooperative tasking among multi-agent systems.

As a follow-up work, this paper deals\nwith the robustness issues of the proposed top-down design approach with\nrespect to event failures in the multi-agent systems. The main concern under\nevent failure is whether a previously decomposable task can still be achieved\ncollectively by the agents, and if not, we would like to investigate that under\nwhat conditions the global task could be robustly accomplished. This is\nactually the fault-tolerance issue of the top-down design, and the results\nprovide designers with hints on which events are fragile with respect to\nfailures, and whether redundancies are needed. The main objective of this paper\nis to identify necessary and sufficient conditions on failed events under which\na decomposable global task can still be achieved successfully. For such a\npurpose, a notion called passivity is introduced to characterize the type of\nevent failures. The passivity is found to reflect the redundancy of\ncommunication links over shared events, based on which necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the reliability of cooperative tasking under event failures are\nderived, followed by illustrative examples and remarks for the derived\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jan 2011 02:05:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Apr 2011 11:40:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Karimadini", "Mohammad", ""], ["Lin", "Hai", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2416", "submitter": "Mohamed-Ali Belabbas", "authors": "M.-A.

The basic\nset-up consists of a system with multiple agents corresponding to the nodes of\na graph whose edges encode the information that is available to the agents. We\naddress the question of whether the information flow defined by the graph is\nsufficient for the agents to accomplish a given task. Formation control is\nconcerned with problems in which agents are required to stabilize at a given\ndistance from other agents. In this context, the graph of a formation encodes\nboth the information flow and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths\nof the edges. A formation is said to be rigid if it cannot be continuously\ndeformed with the distance constraints satisfied; a formation is minimally\nrigid if no distance constraint can be omitted without the formation losing its\nrigidity. Hence, the graph underlying minimally rigid formation provides just\nenough constraints to yield a rigid formation. An open question we will settle\nis whether the information flow afforded by a minimally rigid graph is\nsufficient to insure global stability. We show that the answer is negative in\nthe case of directed information flow. In this first part, we establish basic\nproperties of formation control in the plane. Formations and the associated\ncontrol problems are defined modulo rigid transformations. This fact has strong\nimplications on the geometry of the space of formations and on the feedback\nlaws, since they need to respect this invariance. We study both aspects here.\nWe show that the space of frameworks of n agents is CP(n-2) x (0,\\infty).

This framework underscores the need to differentiate the knowledge\nan agent has about the task to accomplish from the knowledge an agent has about\nthe current state of the system.

We then develop a framework that reduces the question of\nwhether feedback with partial information can stabilize the system to whether\ntwo sets of functions intersect. We apply this framework to the study of a\ndirected formation with n = 4 agents and show that the agents do not have\nenough information to implement locally stabilizing feedback laws.\nAdditionally, we show that feedback laws that respect the information flow\ncannot stabilize a target configuration without stabilizing other, unwanted\nconfigurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 18:31:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Jan 2011 04:35:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Belabbas", "M. -A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2678", "submitter": "Martyn Amos", "authors": "Jose M.
