Ecosystems are\nthought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve\ncomplex, dynamic problems.

The potential for exploiting these properties in digital ecosystems\nis considered, suggesting how several key features of biological ecosystems can\nbe exploited in Digital Ecosystems, and discussing how mimicking these features\nmay assist in developing robust, scalable self-organising architectures. An\nexample architecture, the Digital Ecosystem, is considered in detail.

However, as spot markets for display ads, such as the\nRightMedia Exchange, have grown in prominence, the selection of advertisements\nto show on a given page is increasingly being chosen based on price, using an\nauction. As the number of participants in the exchange grows, the price of an\nimpressions becomes a signal of its value. This correlation between price and\nvalue means that a seller implementing the contract through bidding should\noffer the contract buyer a range of prices, and not just the cheapest\nimpressions necessary to fulfill its demand.\n  Implementing a contract using a range of prices, is akin to creating a mutual\nfund of advertising impressions, and requires {\\em randomized bidding}. We\ncharacterize what allocations can be implemented with randomized bidding,\nnamely those where the desired share obtained at each price is a non-increasing\nfunction of price.

One of the important issues to apply intelligent\nmulti agent systems in real world and virtual environment is to develop a\nframework that support machine learning model to reflect the whole complexity\nof the real world. In this paper, we proposed a framework of intelligent agent\nbased neural network classification model to solve the problem of gap between\ntwo applicable flows of intelligent multi agent technology and learning model\nfrom real environment.

Therefore, the\nSMFFNN model that lies in the framework will give more benefits in finding the\nsuitable information and the real weights from the environment which result for\nbetter recognition.
