The success\nof a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of\nthe contributions of this work is that we identify suitable vertex-allocation\nstrategies for diverse instance types. In particular, we introduce a\nsimulation-based method that identifies and tries to capture bottlenecks in the\ngraph, that are frequently used by the attackers. Our experimental evaluation\nsuggests that this method often allows a successful defense even in instances\nwhere the attackers significantly outnumber the defenders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 05:58:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ivanov\u00e1", "Marika", ""], ["Surynek", "Pavel", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.07607", "submitter": "Qingpeng Cai", "authors": "Qingpeng Cai, Aris Filos-Ratsikas, Pingzhong Tang, Yiwei Zhang", "title": "Reinforcement Mechanism Design for e-commerce", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of allocating impressions to sellers in e-commerce\nwebsites, such as Amazon, eBay or Taobao, aiming to maximize the total revenue\ngenerated by the platform. We employ a general framework of reinforcement\nmechanism design, which uses deep reinforcement learning to design efficient\nalgorithms, taking the strategic behaviour of the sellers into account.\nSpecifically, we model the impression allocation problem as a Markov decision\nprocess, where the states encode the history of impressions, prices,\ntransactions and generated revenue and the actions are the possible impression\nallocations in each round. To tackle the problem of continuity and\nhigh-dimensionality of states and actions, we adopt the ideas of the DDPG\nalgorithm to design an actor-critic policy gradient algorithm which takes\nadvantage of the problem domain in order to achieve convergence and stability.\nWe evaluate our proposed algorithm, coined IA(GRU), by comparing it against\nDDPG, as well as several natural heuristics, under different rationality models\nfor the sellers - we assume that sellers follow well-known no-regret type\nstrategies which may vary in their degree of sophistication. We find that\nIA(GRU) outperforms all algorithms in terms of the total revenue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 03:55:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 13:15:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 06:17:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Qingpeng", ""], ["Filos-Ratsikas", "Aris", ""], ["Tang", "Pingzhong", ""], ["Zhang", "Yiwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09630", "submitter": "Rohollah Moghadam", "authors": "Rohollah Moghadam and Hamidreza Modares", "title": "Resilient Autonomous Control of Distributed Multi-agent Systems in\n  Contested Environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.LG cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An autonomous and resilient controller is proposed for leader-follower\nmulti-agent systems under uncertainties and cyber-physical attacks. The leader\nis assumed non-autonomous with a nonzero control input, which allows changing\nthe team behavior or mission in response to environmental changes. A resilient\nlearning-based control protocol is presented to find optimal solutions to the\nsynchronization problem in the presence of attacks and system dynamic\nuncertainties. An observer-based distributed H_infinity controller is first\ndesigned to prevent propagating the effects of attacks on sensors and actuators\nthroughout the network, as well as to attenuate the effect of these attacks on\nthe compromised agent itself. Non-homogeneous game algebraic Riccati equations\nare derived to solve the H_infinity optimal synchronization problem and\noff-policy reinforcement learning is utilized to learn their solution without\nrequiring any knowledge of the agent's dynamics. A trust-confidence based\ndistributed control protocol is then proposed to mitigate attacks that hijack\nthe entire node and attacks on communication links. A confidence value is\ndefined for each agent based solely on its local evidence. The proposed\nresilient reinforcement learning algorithm employs the confidence value of each\nagent to indicate the trustworthiness of its own information and broadcast it\nto its neighbors to put weights on the data they receive from it during and\nafter learning. If the confidence value of an agent is low, it employs a trust\nmechanism to identify compromised agents and remove the data it receives from\nthem from the learning process. Simulation results are provided to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 09:21:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Sep 2017 13:52:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 31 Dec 2017 05:51:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2018 02:25:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Moghadam", "Rohollah", ""], ["Modares", "Hamidreza", ""]]}]
