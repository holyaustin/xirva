Therefore, we created the Digital\nEcosystem, a novel optimisation technique inspired by biological ecosystems,\nwhere the optimisation works at two levels: a first optimisation, migration of\nagents which are distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating\ncontinuously in time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on\nevolutionary computing that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at\nfinding solutions to satisfy locally relevant constraints. The Digital\nEcosystem was then measured experimentally through simulations, with measures\noriginating from theoretical ecology, evaluating its likeness to biological\necosystems.

An important\ncontribution in this context is given by modal logics for strategic ability, in\nthe setting of multi-agent games, such as ATL, ATL\\star, and the like.\nRecently, Chatterjee, Henzinger, and Piterman introduced Strategy Logic, which\nwe denote here by CHP-SL, with the aim of getting a powerful framework for\nreasoning explicitly about strategies. CHP-SL is obtained by using first-order\nquantifications over strategies and has been investigated in the very specific\nsetting of two-agents turned-based games, where a non-elementary model-checking\nalgorithm has been provided. While CHP-SL is a very expressive logic, we claim\nthat it does not fully capture the strategic aspects of multi-agent systems. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a more general strategy logic, denoted SL,\nfor reasoning about strategies in multi-agent concurrent games. We prove that\nSL includes CHP-SL, while maintaining a decidable model-checking problem. In\nparticular, the algorithm we propose is computationally not harder than the\nbest one known for CHP-SL. Moreover, we prove that such a problem for SL is\nNonElementarySpace-hard. This negative result has spurred us to investigate\nhere syntactic fragments of SL, strictly subsuming ATL\\star, with the hope of\nobtaining an elementary model-checking problem. Among the others, we study the\nsublogics SL[NG], SL[BG], and SL[1G]. They encompass formulas in a special\nprenex normal form having, respectively, nested temporal goals, Boolean\ncombinations of goals and, a single goal at a time. About these logics, we\nprove that the model-checking problem for SL[1G] is 2ExpTime-complete, thus not\nharder than the one for ATL\\star.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 11:12:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Feb 2012 00:00:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Mogavero", "Fabio", ""], ["Murano", "Aniello", ""], ["Perelli", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""]]}]
