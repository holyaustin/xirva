It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic\ncomplexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure\nand functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on\nmodeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies\nhave employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation\nmodels as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been\ndeveloped using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of\nthem have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)\nmethodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem\nbecause without due process, developed models can miss out on important\nrequirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from\nmultiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides\nconcepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software\nengineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from\nanalysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ\nthe use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple\nSclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the\nmodels, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to\ndevelop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The\nkey objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and\neffectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain\nstructure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration\nthat AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living\ncomplex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 04:44:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Muqaddas", "Ayesha", ""], ["Niazi", "Muaz A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.00232", "submitter": "Cesar A.

We show that mixing operations in network coding can induce\npacket anonymity that allows the inter-connections in a network to be\ndecoupled. This enables each intermediate node to consider complex network\ninter-connections as a node-environment interaction such that the Markov\ndecision process (MDP) can be employed at each intermediate node. The optimal\npolicy that can be obtained by solving the MDP provides each node with optimal\namount of changes in transmission range given network dynamics (e.g., the\nnumber of nodes in the range and channel condition). Hence, the network can be\nadaptively and optimally evolved by responding to the network dynamics. The\nproposed strategy is used to maximize long-term utility, which is achieved by\nconsidering both current network conditions and future network dynamics. We\ndefine the utility of an action to include network throughput gain and the cost\nof transmission power.

This can be\ndifficult or impossible to attain in games where the information structure\nallows only imperfect monitoring of the played actions or of the global state.\n  We study the problem of synthesising finite-state strategies for detecting\nthe deviator from an agreed strategy profile in games played on finite graphs\nwith different information structures. We show that the problem is undecidable\nin the general case where the global state cannot be monitored. On the other\nhand, we prove that under perfect monitoring of the global state and imperfect\nmonitoring of actions, the problem becomes decidable, and we present an\neffective synthesis procedure that covers infinitely repeated games with\nprivate monitoring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 21:09:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Berwanger", "Dietmar", ""], ["Ramanujam", "R.", ""]]}]
