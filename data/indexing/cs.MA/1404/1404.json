In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from\nthe planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required\ncooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that\nrequire cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems\nwith heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the\nconditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none\nof these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.\nFurthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum\nnumber of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study\nnot only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many\napplications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve\na task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be\ninformed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a\nsolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 20:46:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["Kambhampati", "Subbarao", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7711", "submitter": "Bal\\'azs Gerencs\\'er", "authors": "Paolo Frasca, Federica Garin, Balazs Gerencser and Julien M.

We assume that sensors can fail with a certain\nprobability and we minimize the expected maximum distance from any point in the\nenvironment to the closest active sensor. We provide a computational method to\nfind the optimal placement and we estimate the relative quality of equispaced\nand random placements. We prove that the former is asymptotically equivalent to\nthe optimal placement when the number of sensors goes to infinity, with a cost\nratio converging to 1, while the cost of the latter remains strictly larger.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:07:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 09:29:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Frasca", "Paolo", ""], ["Garin", "Federica", ""], ["Gerencser", "Balazs", ""], ["Hendrickx", "Julien M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7717", "submitter": "Lorenza Manenti", "authors": "Mizar Luca Federici, Lorenza Manenti, Sara Manzoni", "title": "A Checklist for the Evaluation of Pedestrian Simulation Software\n  Functionalities", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures, 1 Table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The employment of micro-simulation (agent-based) tools in the phase of design\nof public and private spaces and facilities and for the definition of transport\nschemes that impact on pedestrian flows, thanks to their achieved accuracy and\npredictive capacity, has become a consolidated practice. These instruments\nprovide support to the organization of spaces, services and facilities and to\nthe definition of management procedures for normal and emergency situations.\nThe employment of these tools is effective for various but not for all the\ncontexts, nevertheless new features and functions are under constant\ndevelopment and new products are often launched on the market. Therefore, there\nis a higher necessity of a standard criteria both for the evaluation of the\nkinds of function that these software provide, at use of practitioners and\nend-users, and for the definition of software requirements as a reference for\nthe developers that aim at being competitive on this market.\n  On the basis of our experience as pedestrian modellers and as researchers in\nthe crowd modelling area, we designed a comprehensive and detailed ready-to-use\nchecklist for the quantitative evaluation of Pedestrian Simulation Software\nfunctionalities that aims at capturing all the aspects that we claim that are\nuseful to undertake a professional study. These functions in our opinion are\nnecessary to provide accurate results in the planning of new facilities or\nschemes that involve pedestrian activities. With this work we propose a set of\ncriteria of evaluation for these products also to encourage a debate for the\ndefinition of objective standards for pedestrian simulation software\ncertification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:22:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jul 2014 20:28:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Federici", "Mizar Luca", ""], ["Manenti", "Lorenza", ""], ["Manzoni", "Sara", ""]]}]
