Swarm computation\nhas previously been used to explore how spatiotemporal complexity can emerge\nfrom, and be distributed within, simple component parts and their interactions.\nUsing a particle based swarm approach we explore the question of how to\ngenerate collective amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component\nparts in a model of P. polycephalum. The model collective behaves as a cohesive\nand deformable virtual material, approximating the local coupling within the\nplasmodium matrix. The collective generates de-novo and complex oscillatory\npatterns from simple local interactions. The origin of this motor behaviour is\ndistributed within the collective rendering is morphologically adaptive,\namenable to external influence, and robust to simulated environmental insult.\nWe show how to gain external influence over the collective movement by\nsimulated chemo-attraction (pulling towards nutrient stimuli) and simulated\nlight irradiation hazards (pushing from stimuli). The amorphous and distributed\nproperties of the collective are demonstrated by cleaving it into two\nindependent entities and fusing two separate entities to form a single device,\nthus enabling it to traverse narrow, separate or tortuous paths. We conclude by\nsummarising the contribution of the model to swarm based robotics and\nsoft-bodied modular robotics and discuss the future potential of such material\napproaches to the field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 22:00:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Jeff", ""], ["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0240", "submitter": "Ramviyas Nattanmai Parasuraman", "authors": "Abhisekh Jain, Arvind Seshadri, Balaji B.S, Ramviyas Parasuraman", "title": "Onboard Dynamic Rail Track Safety Monitoring System", "comments": "International Conference on Advanced Communication Systems 2007,\n  Coimbatore, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This proposal aims at solving one of the long prevailing problems in the\nIndian Railways.

It is\nshown how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed\nexample scenario is broken in particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral\ndynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there is a symmetry\nbetween left- and right-chiral dynamics. In the course of the symmetry breaking\ndifferences between models and parameter settings are amplified which is the\norigin of the high sensitivity of the scenario against parameter changes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2012 10:56:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kretz", "Tobias", ""]]}]
