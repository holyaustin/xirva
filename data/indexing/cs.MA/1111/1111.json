Despite their manifest attractions, speech-act\nmodels of communication have several serious disadvantages as a foundation for\ncommunication in artificial agent systems. In particular, it has proved to be\nextremely difficult to give a satisfactory semantics to speech-act based agent\ncommunication languages. In part, the problem is that speech-act semantics\ntypically make reference to the \"mental states\" of agents (their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions), and there is in general no way to attribute such\nattitudes to arbitrary computational agents. In addition, agent programming\nlanguages have only had their semantics formalised for abstract, stand-alone\nversions, neglecting aspects such as communication primitives. With respect to\ncommunication, implemented agent programming languages have tended to be rather\nad hoc. This paper addresses both of these problems, by giving semantics to\nspeech-act based messages received by an AgentSpeak agent. AgentSpeak is a\nlogic-based agent programming language which incorporates the main features of\nthe PRS model of reactive planning systems. The paper builds upon a structural\noperational semantics to AgentSpeak that we developed in previous work. The\nmain contributions of this paper are as follows: an extension of our earlier\nwork on the theoretical foundations of AgentSpeak interpreters; a\ncomputationally grounded semantics for (the core) performatives used in\nspeech-act based agent communication languages; and a well-defined extension of\nAgentSpeak that supports agent communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 21:40:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bordini", "R.

Every camera in the network has limited communication\ncapabilities and can only exchange local matches with its neighbors.

When the algorithm\nfinishes, each camera knows the global correspondences between its features and\nthe features of all the cameras in the network. The presence of spurious\nintroduced by the local matcher may produce inconsistent global\ncorrespondences, which are association paths between features from the same\ncamera.
