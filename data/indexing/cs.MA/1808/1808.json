The\ntrajectory of the distracted driver vehicle is thus evaluated and projected,\nfor the given time steps, for the established distraction time, over the actual\ntrajectories of other vehicles. Every occurring crash is then evaluated in\nterms of energy involved in the crash, or with any other severity index (which\ncan be easily calculated since the accident dynamics can be accurately\nsimulated). The simulation of a driver error allows not only the typology of\ncrashes to be included, normally accounted for with surrogate safety measures,\nbut also many other type of typical crashes that it is impossible to simulate\nwith microsimulation and traditional methodologies being caused by vehicles who\nare driving on non-conflicting trajectories such as drivers speeding at a red\nlight, drivers taking the wrong lane or side of the street or just driving off\nthe road in isolated accidents against external obstacles or traffic barriers.\nThe total crash energy of all crashes is proposed as an indicator of risk and\nadopted in the case studies.

It is a fundamental problem in the\nmodeling of transport where the synthetic populations of micro-agents represent\na key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological\nframework for how to 'grow' pools of micro-agents is presented. The model\nframework adopts a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning\nbased on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Compared to the previous population\nsynthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs\nsampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden\nMarkov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution\nfor high dimensions. The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional\nGibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by using a large-scale Danish trip diary.\nIt is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE in the\nlow-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number\nof modeled attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler\nessentially replicates the agents from the original sample when the required\nconditional distributions are estimated as frequency tables. In contrast, the\nVAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents that\nare virtually different from those in the original data but have similar\nstatistical properties. The presented approach can support agent-based modeling\nat all levels by enabling richer synthetic populations with smaller zones and\nmore detailed individual characteristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 14:08:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 17:11:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Borysov", "Stanislav S.", ""], ["Rich", "Jeppe", ""], ["Pereira", "Francisco C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.07252", "submitter": "Ivano Notarnicola", "authors": "Ivano Notarnicola, Ying Sun, Gesualdo Scutari, Giuseppe Notarstefano", "title": "Distributed Big-Data Optimization via Block-wise Gradient Tracking", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study distributed big-data nonconvex optimization in multi-agent networks.\nWe consider the (constrained) minimization of the sum of a smooth (possibly)\nnonconvex function, i.e., the agents' sum-utility, plus a convex (possibly)\nnonsmooth regularizer.

To deal with the nonconvexity of the cost function, the\nnovel scheme hinges on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques\ncombined with a novel block-wise perturbed push-sum consensus protocol, which\nis instrumental to perform local block-averaging operations and tracking of\ngradient averages.
