This is a challenging problem as a cloud service provider may\nhave insufficient resources to satisfy all user requests. Furthermore,\nallocating available resources optimally to different applications is also\nchallenging. Resource sharing among different cloud service providers can\nimprove resource availability and resource utilization as certain cloud service\nproviders may have free resources available that can be ``rented'' by other\nservice providers. However, different cloud service providers can have\ndifferent objectives or \\emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for a\nframework that can share and allocate resources in an efficient and effective\nway, while taking into account the objectives of various service providers that\nresults in a \\emph{multi-objective optimization} problem. In this paper, we\npresent a \\emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT) based framework for resource\nsharing and allocation among different service providers with varying\nobjectives that form a coalition. We show that the resource sharing problem can\nbe modeled as an $N-$player \\emph{canonical} cooperative game with\n\\emph{non-transferable utility} (NTU) and prove that the game is convex for\nmonotonic non-decreasing utilities. We propose an $\\mathcal{O}({N})$ algorithm\nthat provides an allocation from the \\emph{core}, hence guaranteeing\n\\emph{Pareto optimality}. We evaluate the performance of our proposed resource\nsharing framework in a number of simulation settings and show that our proposed\nframework improves user satisfaction and utility of service providers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2019 13:04:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 18:34:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zafari", "Faheem", ""], ["Leung", "Kin K.", ""], ["Towsley", "Don", ""], ["Basu", "Prithwish", ""], ["Swami", "Ananthram", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.01736", "submitter": "Nathalia Moraes do Nascimento", "authors": "Nathalia Nascimento, Carlos Lucena, Paulo Alencar and Carlos Juliano\n  Viana", "title": "Testing Self-Organizing Multiagent Systems", "comments": "9 pages, double column", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3036668", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.NE cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multiagent Systems (MASs) involve different characteristics, such as\nautonomy, asynchronous and social features, which make these systems more\ndifficult to understand.

We use a well-established collective movement model that\nonly assumes local interactions between individuals without any leadership, in\norder to examine the benefits of group searching.

A detailed characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of these estimators is established in terms of an error\nbias and of the identifiability gap, and a sample complexity analysis is\nperformed to establish how the number of samples scales with the network size\nto achieve consistent learning.
