However, the\ncoordination and control of independently operated flexible resources (e.g.,\nstorage, demand response) imposes critical challenges arising from the\nheterogeneity of the resources, conflict of interests, and impact on the grid.\nCorrespondingly, overcoming these challenges with a general and fair yet\nefficient exchange mechanism that coordinates these distributed resources will\naccommodate renewable fluctuations on a local level, thereby supporting the\nenergy transition. In this paper, we introduce such an exchange mechanism. It\nincorporates a payment structure that encourages prosumers to participate in\nthe exchange by increasing their utility above baseline alternatives. The\nallocation from the proposed mechanism increases the system efficiency\n(utilitarian social welfare) and distributes profits more fairly (measured by\nNash social welfare) than individual flexibility activation. A case study\nanalyzing the mechanism performance and resulting payments in numerical\nexperiments over real demand and generation profiles of the Pecan Street\ndataset elucidates the efficacy to promote cooperation between co-located\nflexibilities in residential cooperatives through local exchange.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:14:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2019 03:41:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Shantanu", ""], ["Hernandez-Leal", "Pablo", ""], ["Kaisers", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.04848", "submitter": "Tony T.

In many sharing economy scenarios, agents both produce as well as\nconsume a resource; we call them prosumers.

In this\nchapter, we propose a control theoretic approach to regulate the number of\nprosumers in a prosumer community, where each prosumer has a cost function that\nis coupled through its time-averaged production and consumption of the\nresource. Furthermore, each prosumer runs its distributed algorithm and takes\nonly binary decisions in a probabilistic way, whether to produce one unit of\nthe resource or not and to consume one unit of the resource or not. In the\nproposed approach, prosumers do not explicitly exchange information with each\nother due to privacy reasons, but little exchange of information is required\nfor feedback signals, broadcast by a central agency. In the proposed approach,\nprosumers achieve the optimal values asymptotically. Furthermore, the proposed\napproach is suitable to implement in an IoT context with minimal demands on\ninfrastructure.
