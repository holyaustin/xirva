We propose a new reward mechanism with strong incentive\nproperties applicable in a wide variety of such settings. This mechanism has a\nsimple and intuitive output agreement structure: an agent gets a reward only if\nher response for an evaluation matches that of her peer. But instead of the\nreward being the same across different answers, it is inversely proportional to\na popularity index of each answer. This index is a second order population\nstatistic that captures how frequently two agents performing the same\nevaluation agree on the particular answer. Rare agreements thus earn a higher\nreward than agreements that are relatively more common.\n  In the regime where there are a large number of evaluation tasks, we show\nthat truthful behavior is a strict Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the game induced\nby the mechanism. Further, we show that the truthful equilibrium is\napproximately optimal in terms of expected payoffs to the agents across all\nsymmetric equilibria, where the approximation error vanishes in the number of\nevaluation tasks. Moreover, under a mild condition on strategy space, we show\nthat any symmetric equilibrium that gives a higher expected payoff than the\ntruthful equilibrium must be close to being fully informative if the number of\nevaluations is large. These last two results are driven by a new notion of an\nagreement measure that is shown to be monotonic in information loss.
