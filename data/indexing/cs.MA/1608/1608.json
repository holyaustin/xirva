However, several of the\nheterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future\napplications --- robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent\nbehavior, etc. --- hinder the evolution of the technology from academic\ninstitutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology\noriginated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer\nnetworks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement\non a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for\na controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed\nsystems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities\nto make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even\nprofitable. This work explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative\nsolutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New\nsecurity, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for\nswarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples.\nFinally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the\ncombination of these two technologies are described.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 05:09:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 05:17:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 17:39:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 25 Jun 2017 00:00:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrer", "Eduardo Castell\u00f3", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.01039", "submitter": "Nicholas Mattei", "authors": "Nicholas Mattei and Toby Walsh", "title": "Empirical Evaluation of Real World Tournaments", "comments": "2 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computational Social Choice (ComSoc) is a rapidly developing field at the\nintersection of computer science, economics, social choice, and political\nscience.

Each a(ge)nt begins to operate at an arbitrary initial\nlocation, and throughout its work does not acquire any information on either\nthe shape or size of the graph, or the number or whereabouts of other a(ge)nts.\nGraph partitioning occurs spontaneously, as each of the a(ge)nts patrols and\nexpands its own pheromone-marked sub-graph, or region. This graph partitioning\nalgorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic\nballoons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region\nmore frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent\nvertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding\nits region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a\nregion ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely\nproportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller\nregion will effectively exert higher \"pressure\" at its borders, and conquer\nadjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region\nand shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes\nof the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical\nballoons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.\nThe pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to\nevolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the\ngraph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the\nsystem settles into a stable and balanced partition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Elazar", "Gidi", ""], ["Bruckstein", "Alfred M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04851", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vizzari", "authors": "Giuseppe Vizzari and Stefania Bandini", "title": "Essentials of an Integrated Crowd Management Support System Based on\n  Collective Artificial Intelligence", "comments": "8 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The simulation of the dynamical behavior of pedestrians and crowds in spatial\nstructures is a consolidated research and application context that still\npresents challenges for researchers in different fields and disciplines.\nDespite currently available commercial systems for this kind of simulation are\ngrowingly employed by designers and planners for the evaluation of alternative\nsolutions, this class of systems is generally not integrated with existing\nmonitoring and control infrastructures, usually employed by crowd managers and\nfield operators for security reasons.
