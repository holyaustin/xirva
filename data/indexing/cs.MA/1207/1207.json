We achieve these benefits by combining concepts\nfrom game theory and reinforcement learning. To be precise, we extend the\nbounded rational \"level-K reasoning\" model to apply to games over multiple\nstages. Our extension allows the decomposition of the overall modeling problem\ninto a series of smaller ones, each of which can be solved by standard\nreinforcement learning algorithms. We call this hybrid approach \"level-K\nreinforcement learning\". We investigate these ideas in a cyber battle scenario\nover a smart power grid and discuss the relationship between the behavior\npredicted by our model and what one might expect of real human defenders and\nattackers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 22:30:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Ritchie", ""], ["Wolpert", "David H.", ""], ["Bono", "James", ""], ["Backhaus", "Scott", ""], ["Bent", "Russell", ""], ["Tracey", "Brendan", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1271", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "F.

If communication is possible, the manager can\nask users to report their private information and then, using this information,\ninstruct them on what actions they should take. If the users are compliant,\nthis reduces the manager's optimization problem to a well-studied problem of\noptimal control. However, if the users are self-interested and not compliant,\nthe problem is much more complicated: when asked to report their private\ninformation, the users might lie; upon receiving instructions, the users might\ndisobey. Here we ask whether the manager can design the system to get around\nboth of these difficulties. To do so, the manager must provide for the users\nthe incentives to report truthfully and to follow the instructions, despite the\nfact that the users are self-interested. For a class of environments that\nincludes many resource allocation games in communication networks, we provide\ntools for the manager to design an efficient system. In addition to reports and\nrecommendations, the design we employ allows the manager to intervene in the\nsystem after the users take actions. In an abstracted environment, we find\nconditions under which the manager can achieve the same outcome it could if\nusers were compliant, and conditions under which it does not.

For\nthis we introduce inter-agent channels modeled as 2-state automata, compute the\noverall system behavior, and present an effective computational test for\ndelay-robustness. From the test it typically results that the given delay-free\ndistributed control is delay-robust with respect to certain communicated\nevents, but not for all, thus distinguishing events which are not\ndelay-critical from those that are.

Moreover, these potential relays are better informed than the\nsource about their transmission costs, which depend on the exact channel\nconditions on their relay-destination links. This results in asymmetry of\navailable information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we use\ncontract theory to tackle the problem of relay selection under asymmetric\ninformation in OFDM-based cooperative wireless system that employs\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We first design incentive compatible\noffers/contracts, consisting of a menu of payments and desired\nsignal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)s at the destination and then the source broadcasts\nthis menu to nearby mobile nodes. The nearby mobile nodes who are willing to\nrelay notify back the source with the contracts they are willing to accept in\neach subcarrier. We show that when the source is under a budget constraint, the\nproblem of relay selection in each subcarrier in order to maximize the capacity\nis a nonlinear non-separable knapsack problem. We propose a heuristic relay\nselection scheme to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our\noverall mechanism and the heuristic solution with a simple relay selection\nscheme and selected numerical results showed that our solution performs better\nand is close to optimal.
