The global dynamics of\nsuch a system is determined by the nature of the local interactions among the\nagents. Since it is difficult to formally analyze complex multiagent systems,\nthey are often studied through computer simulations. While computer simulations\ncan be very useful, results obtained through simulations do not formally\nvalidate the observed behavior. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical\nframework which one can use to represent multiagent systems and formally\nestablish their properties. This work contains a brief exposition of some known\nmathematical frameworks that can model multiagent systems. The focus is on one\nsuch framework, namely that of finite dynamical systems. Both, deterministic\nand stochastic versions of this framework are discussed. The paper contains a\nsampling of the mathematical results from the literature to show how finite\ndynamical systems can be used to carry out a rigorous study of the properties\nof multiagent systems and it is shown how the framework can also serve as a\nuniversal model for computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2007 23:22:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""], ["Jarrah", "Abdul S.", ""], ["Mortveit", "Henning", ""], ["Ravi", "S.

We present a brief introduction into\nthis rapidly developing field, as well as our own contributions that include an\nanalysis of the evolutionary naming-game model. In this model communicating\nagents, that try to establish a common vocabulary, are equipped with an\nevolutionarily selected learning ability. Such a coupling of biological and\nlinguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a small change of\nthe model control parameter a poorly communicating group of linguistically\nunskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating group with\nlarge learning abilities. Genetic imprinting of the learning abilities proceeds\nvia Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents learn a language\nand that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary pressure for the\nincrease of learning ability. Under the assumption that communication intensity\nincreases continuously with finite speed, the transition is split into several\ntransition-like changes. It shows that the speed of cultural changes, that sets\nan additional characteristic timescale, might be yet another factor affecting\nthe evolution of language. In our opinion, this model shows that linguistic and\nbiological processes have a strong influence on each other and this effect\ncertainly has contributed to an explosive development of our species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2008 19:45:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2008 23:45:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 21 Aug 2010 21:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lipowski", "Adam", ""], ["Lipowska", "Dorota", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3048", "submitter": "Franco Bagnoli", "authors": "Franco Bagnoli, Andrea Guazzini, Pietro Lio'", "title": "Human Heuristics for Autonomous Agents", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": "P.
