The\nrobustness of a multi-agent network to perturbations such as failures, noise,\nor malicious attacks largely depends on the corresponding graph. In many\napplications, networks are desired to have well-connected interaction graphs\nwith relatively small number of links. One family of such graphs is the random\nregular graphs. In this paper, we present a decentralized scheme for\ntransforming any connected interaction graph with a possibly non-integer\naverage degree of k into a connected random m-regular graph for some m in [k, k\n+ 2]. Accordingly, the agents improve the robustness of the network with a\nminimal change in the overall sparsity by optimizing the graph connectivity\nthrough the proposed local operations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 16:32:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yazicioglu", "A.

In particular, the\nSCN's users are divided into two types: frequent users, who are regular users\nof certain small cells, and occasional users, who are one-time or infrequent\nusers of a particular small cell. Given such \\emph{context} information, each\nsmall cell base station (SCBS) aims to maximize the overall performance\nprovided to its frequent users, while ensuring that occasional users are also\nwell serviced. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the\nSCBSs are the players. The strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power\nallocation so as to optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff\nbetween the users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource\nexpenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and\nuniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show that\nthis condition is independent of the number of users in the network. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed context-aware resource allocation game yields\nsignificant performance gains, in terms of the average utility per SCBS,\ncompared to conventional techniques such as proportional fair allocation and\nsum-rate maximization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 16:33:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Khanafer", "Ali", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Ba\u015far", "Tamer", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.08855", "submitter": "Gonzalo Mateos", "authors": "Georgios B.

This paper presents a reputation model that follows a probabilistic\nmodelling of opinions based on three main concepts: (1) the value of an opinion\ndecays with time, (2) the reputation of the opinion source impacts the\nreliability of the opinion, and (3) the certainty of the opinion impacts its\nweight with respect to other opinions. Furthermore, the model is flexible with\nits opinion sources: it may use explicit opinions or implicit opinions that can\nbe extracted from agent behavior in domains where explicit opinions are sparse.\nWe illustrate the latter with an approach to extract opinions from behavioral\ninformation in the sports domain, focusing on football in particular. One of\nthe uses of a reputation model is predicting behavior.
