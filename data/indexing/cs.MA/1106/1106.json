Climate control in large buildings is one\napplication area where multi-agent systems, and market-oriented programming in\nparticular, have been reported to be very successful, although central control\nsolutions are still the standard practice.

We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a\ndecision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and\n(b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a\ncorporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility\nfrom the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually\nhave an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the\ndecision maker if typical scoring rules are used.

When\ncombined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule\ninduces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming\nfull knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all\n(strictly) proper compensation rules. We then analyze the situation where the\nexpert's utility function is not fully known to the decision maker. We show\nbounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert\nwill misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty.\nThese bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local\ndegree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the\ndecision maker's utility function.

The key issue in cooperative control of multi-agent systems is the\nsynthesis of local control and interaction rules among the agents such that the\nentire controlled system achieves a desired global behavior. For this purpose,\nthree fundamental problems have to be addressed: (1) task decomposition for\ntop-down design, such that the fulfillment of local tasks guarantees the\nsatisfaction of the global task, by the team; (2) fault-tolerant top-down\ndesign, such that the global task remains decomposable and achievable, in spite\nof some failures, and (3) design of interactions among agents to make an\nundecomposable task decomposable and achievable in a top-down framework. The\nfirst two problems have been addressed in our previous works, by identifying\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for task automaton decomposition, and\nfault-tolerant task decomposability. This paper deals with the third problem\nand proposes a procedure to redistribute the events among agents in order to\nenforce decomposability of an undecomposable task automaton. The\ndecomposability conditions are used to identify the root causes of\nundecomposability which are found to be due to over-communications that have to\nbe deleted, while respecting the fault-tolerant decomposability conditions; or\nbecause of the lack of communications that require new sharing of events, while\nconsidering new violations of decomposability conditions. This result provides\na sufficient condition to make any undecomposable deterministic task automaton\ndecomposable in order to facilitate cooperative tasking. Illustrative examples\nare presented to show the concept of task automaton decomposabilization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 03:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Karimadini", "Mohammad", ""], ["Lin", "Hai", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4509", "submitter": "Amos Storkey", "authors": "Amos Storkey", "title": "Machine Learning Markets", "comments": "Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial\n  Intelligence and Statistics 2011", "journal-ref": "Journal of Machine Learning Research W&CP 15(AISTATS):716-724,\n  2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.NE q-fin.TR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Prediction markets show considerable promise for developing flexible\nmechanisms for machine learning.
