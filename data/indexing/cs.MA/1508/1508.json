In this work we determine\nthe capacity of freelance markets, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests,\nand propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized\noperation and freedom of choice for customers and freelancers, we propose\nsimple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowdsourcing platforms\nthat approximately achieve capacity.

In this\nsense, our approach is closely related to the construction of one-dimensional\nprincipal curves that minimize orthogonal error to data points subject to\nsmoothness constraints.

Thus, the\nmapping from the high-dimensional data to the manifold is defined in terms of\nlocal coordinates. Through representative examples, we show that compared to\nexisting nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, the principal manifold\nretains the original structure even in noisy and sparse datasets.
