We\nuse tools from averaging theory and an input-to-state stability type argument\nto derive conditions on the model parameters that guarantee confinement of the\nfollowers about the trajectory. For the case of a single follower, we show that\nif the follower starts at the origin, then the error in trajectory tracking can\nbe made arbitrarily small depending on the frequency of the periodic control\ncomponents and the rate of change of the trajectory.

The modeling involves the construction of a computational\nalgorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and\ngovernments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real\nestate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher\nquality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods\nmarket allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by\nprice and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms\n(location) and candidates (qualification). The government may be configured\ninto one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments. The role of\ngovernment is to collect taxes on the value added of firms in its territory and\ninvest the taxes into higher levels of quality of life for residents.

Initially, the robots form a closed chain on\nthe grid and must keep this connectivity during the whole process of their\ngathering. Connectivity means, that neighboring robots of the chain need to be\npositioned at the same or neighboring points of the grid. In our model,\ngathering means to keep shortening the chain until the robots are located\ninside a $2\\times 2$ subgrid. Our model is completely local (no global control,\nno global coordinates, no compass, no global communication or vision, \\ldots).\nEach robot can only see its next constant number of left and right neighbors on\nthe chain. This fixed constant is called the \\emph{viewing path length}. All\nits operations and detections are restricted to this constant number of robots.\nOther robots, even if located at neighboring or the same grid point cannot be\ndetected. Only based on the relative positions of its detectable chain\nneighbors, a robot can decide to obtain a certain state. Based on this state\nand their local knowledge, the robots do local modifications to the chain by\nmoving to neighboring grid points without breaking the chain. These\nmodifications are performed without the knowledge whether they lead to a global\nprogress or not. We assume the fully synchronous $\\mathcal{FSYNC}$ model.
