We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential\nelections.

In addition, we obtain\n(by a new characterization of coNP in terms of weight-bounded alternating\nTuring machines) completeness for coNP in the deleting/adding cases with a\nbounded deletion/addition limit, and we obtain completeness for NP in the\npartition cases with an additional restriction.

This\npaper develops algorithms for distributed sparsity-regularized rank\nminimization over networks, when the nuclear- and $\\ell_1$-norm are used as\nsurrogates to the rank and nonzero entry counts of the sought matrices,\nrespectively. While nuclear-norm minimization has well-documented merits when\ncentralized processing is viable, non-separability of the singular-value sum\nchallenges its distributed minimization. To overcome this limitation, an\nalternative characterization of the nuclear norm is adopted which leads to a\nseparable, yet non-convex cost minimized via the alternating-direction method\nof multipliers. The novel distributed iterations entail reduced-complexity\nper-node tasks, and affordable message passing among single-hop neighbors.\nInterestingly, upon convergence the distributed (non-convex) estimator provably\nattains the global optimum of its centralized counterpart, regardless of\ninitialization. Several application domains are outlined to highlight the\ngenerality and impact of the proposed framework. These include unveiling\ntraffic anomalies in backbone networks, predicting networkwide path latencies,\nand mapping the RF ambiance using wireless cognitive radios.
