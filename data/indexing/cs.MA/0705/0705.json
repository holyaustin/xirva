Each committee of agents, which is\nregarded as a player in a game, is optimised by continually adapting the\narchitecture of the agents using genetic algorithms. The committees of agents\nbuy and sell stocks by following this procedure: (1) obtain the current price\nof stocks; (2) predict the future price of stocks; (3) and for a given price\ntrade until all the players are mutually satisfied. The trading of stocks is\nconducted by following these rules: (1) if a player expects an increase in\nprice then it tries to buy the stock; (2) else if it expects a drop in the\nprice, it sells the stock; (3)and the order in which a player participates in\nthe game is random. The proposed procedure is implemented to simulate trading\nof three stocks, namely, the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A linear\nrelationship between the number of players and agents versus the computational\ntime to run the complete simulation is observed. It is also found that no\nplayer has a monopolistic advantage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 May 2007 10:11:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Marwala", "T.", ""], ["De Wilde", "P.", ""], ["Correia", "L.", ""], ["Mariano", "P.", ""], ["Ribeiro", "R.", ""], ["Abramov", "V.", ""], ["Szirbik", "N.", ""], ["Goossenaerts", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3050", "submitter": "Kimmo Soramaki", "authors": "Marco Galbiati and Kimmo Soramaki", "title": "A competitive multi-agent model of interbank payment systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": null, "abstract": "  We develop a dynamic multi-agent model of an interbank payment system where\nbanks choose their level of available funds on the basis of private payoff\nmaximisation.

Adaptation takes place with bayesian updating, with banks maximizing\nimmediate payoffs. We carry out numerical simulations to solve the model and\ninvestigate two special scenarios: an operational incident and exogenous\nthroughput guidelines for payment submission. We find that the demand for\nintraday credit is an S-shaped function of the cost ratio between intraday\ncredit costs and the costs associated with delaying payments. We also find that\nthe demand for liquidity is increased both under operational incidents and in\nthe presence of effective throughput guidelines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 May 2007 14:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Galbiati", "Marco", ""], ["Soramaki", "Kimmo", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.4584", "submitter": "Stefan Johansson", "authors": "Magnus Boman and Stefan J.

To a game developer maintaining an MMOG, recognizing,\nmonitoring, and ultimately controlling a virtual plague is important,\nregardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and\ntheory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.\nWe will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some\nbasic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences\nbetween real world epidemics and virtual plagues. We also suggest directions\nfor MMOG developer control through epidemiological modeling. Our aim is\nunderstanding the properties of virtual plagues, rather than trying to\neliminate them or mitigate their effects, as would be in the case of real\ninfectious disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2007 12:15:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Boman", "Magnus", ""], ["Johansson", "Stefan J.", ""]]}]
