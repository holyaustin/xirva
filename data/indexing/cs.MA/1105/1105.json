The\nsimulation of the interaction protocols among network nodes is performed via a\nsimulation middleware that supports both the sequential and the\nparallel/distributed simulation approaches. In the latter case, a specific\nmechanism for the communication overhead-reduction is used; this guarantees\nhigh levels of performance and scalability. To demonstrate the efficiency of\nLUNES, we test the simulator with gossip protocols executed on top of networks\n(representing peer-to-peer overlays), generated with different topologies.\nResults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 12:26:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 08:58:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:38:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angelo", "Gabriele", ""], ["Ferretti", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5032", "submitter": "Piotr Faliszewski", "authors": "Piotr Faliszewski and Edith Hemaspaandra and Lane A.

It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into\npolynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked (i.e., is polarized along\nsome axis/issue). However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.\nThere are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely\nbe nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of\nmanipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked\nelectorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We\nprovide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action\ncomplexity up to $\\np$-hardness, but we also provide many instances where a\nreasonable number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the\nmanipulative-action complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 14:12:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 13:59:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Faliszewski", "Piotr", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Edith", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Lane A.", ""]]}]
