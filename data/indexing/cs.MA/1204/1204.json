Also, its impact on\neconomy is quite nontrivial. On what is fashionable, interestingly, there are\ntwo viewpoints that are both extremely widespread but almost opposite:\nconformists think that what is popular is fashionable, while rebels believe\nthat being different is the essence. Fashion color is fashionable in the first\nsense, and Lady Gaga in the second. We investigate a model where the population\nconsists of the afore-mentioned two groups of people that are located on social\nnetworks (a spatial cellular automata network and small-world networks). This\nmodel captures two fundamental kinds of social interactions (coordination and\nanti-coordination) simultaneously, and also has its own interest to game\ntheory: it is a hybrid model of pure competition and pure cooperation. This is\ntrue because when a conformist meets a rebel, they play the zero sum matching\npennies game, which is pure competition. When two conformists (rebels) meet,\nthey play the (anti-) coordination game, which is pure cooperation. Simulation\nshows that simple social interactions greatly promote cooperation: in most\ncases people can reach an extraordinarily high level of cooperation, through a\nselfish, myopic, naive, and local interacting dynamic (the best response\ndynamic). We find that degree of synchronization also plays a critical role,\nbut mostly on the negative side. Four indices, namely cooperation degree,\naverage satisfaction degree, equilibrium ratio and complete ratio, are defined\nand applied to measure people's cooperation levels from various angles. Phase\ntransition, as well as emergence of many interesting geographic patterns in the\ncellular automata network, is also observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 04:40:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2012 05:42:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 23:33:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Zhigang", ""], ["Gao", "Haoyu", ""], ["Qu", "Xinglong", ""], ["Yang", "Mingmin", ""], ["Yang", "Xiaoguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0168", "submitter": "Wen Dong", "authors": "Wen Dong, Katherine A.

A simple model\nwas proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to\ntheir size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate\nto other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces\nrealistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf\ndistribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense\nthat mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly\nhigh density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution\nof external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.\n  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both\ncentripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the\nsense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a\nhigher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an\naversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The\nmodel is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial\nsetting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons\nare made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a\nseries of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of\nthe degree of clustering and concentration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 13:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jung-Hun", ""], ["Ettema", "Dick", ""], ["Frenken", "Koen", ""]]}]
