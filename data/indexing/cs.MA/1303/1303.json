Guaranteeing knowledge\nintegration is an important element during the development of the Semantic Web.\nThanks to this, it is possible to obtain access to services which offer\nknowledge contained in various distributed databases associated with\nsemantically described web portals. We will present the advantages of the\nmulti-agent approach while solving this problem. Then, we will describe an\nexample of its application in systems supporting company management knowledge\nin the process of constructing supply-chains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 12:03:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zygmunt", "Anna", ""], ["Ko\u017alak", "Jaros\u0142aw", ""], ["Siwik", "Leszek", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7103", "submitter": "Federico Penna", "authors": "Federico Penna, Slawomir Stanczak", "title": "Decentralized Eigenvalue Algorithms for Distributed Signal Detection in\n  Cognitive Networks", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE JSAC Cognitive Radio Series", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we derive and analyze two algorithms -- referred to as\ndecentralized power method (DPM) and decentralized Lanczos algorithm (DLA) --\nfor distributed computation of one (the largest) or multiple eigenvalues of a\nsample covariance matrix over a wireless network. The proposed algorithms,\nbased on sequential average consensus steps for computations of matrix-vector\nproducts and inner vector products, are first shown to be equivalent to their\ncentralized counterparts in the case of exact distributed consensus. Then,\nclosed-form expressions of the error introduced by non-ideal consensus are\nderived for both algorithms. The error of the DPM is shown to vanish\nasymptotically under given conditions on the sequence of consensus errors.\nFinally, we consider applications to spectrum sensing in cognitive radio\nnetworks, and we show that virtually all eigenvalue-based tests proposed in the\nliterature can be implemented in a distributed setting using either the DPM or\nthe DLA. Simulation results are presented that validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed algorithms in conditions of practical interest (large-scale\nnetworks, small number of samples, and limited number of iterations).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 11:42:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Penna", "Federico", ""], ["Stanczak", "Slawomir", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7377", "submitter": "Neeraj Kumar Sharma", "authors": "Vibha Gaur, Neeraj Kumar Sharma, Punam Bedi", "title": "Evaluating Reputation Systems for Agent Mediated e-Commerce", "comments": "5 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1110.3961", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Agent mediated e-commerce involves buying and selling on Internet through\nsoftware agents. The success of an agent mediated e-commerce system lies in the\nunderlying reputation management system which is used to improve the quality of\nservices in e-market environment. A reputation system encourages the honest\nbehaviour of seller agents and discourages the malicious behaviour of dishonest\nseller agents in the e-market where actual traders never meet each other. This\npaper evaluates various reputation systems for assigning reputation rating to\nsoftware agents acting on behalf of buyers and sellers in e-market. These\nmodels are analysed on the basis of a number of features viz. reputation\ncomputation and their defence mechanisms against different attacks. To address\nthe problems of traditional reputation systems which are relatively static in\nnature, this paper identifies characteristics of a dynamic reputation framework\nwhich ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation\nand also associates the reputation of an agent with the value of a transaction\nso that the market approaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are\nweeded out of the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 12:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gaur", "Vibha", ""], ["Sharma", "Neeraj Kumar", ""], ["Bedi", "Punam", ""]]}]
