Therefore we require a\nsystem which changes as per the changing requirements. Multi agent system\ntechnology in recent times has emerged as a possible way of efficient solution\nimplementation for many such complex problems. Our research here focuses on\nbuilding a Multi Agent System (MAS), which implements a modified version of\nGravitational Search swarm intelligence Algorithm (GSA) to find out an optimal\nstrategy in managing the demand supply chain. We target the grains distribution\nsystem among various centers of Food Corporation of India (FCI) as application\ndomain. We assume centers with larger stocks as objects of greater mass and\nvice versa. Applying Newtonian law of gravity as suggested in GSA, larger\nobjects attract objects of smaller mass towards itself, creating a virtual\ngrain supply source. As heavier object sheds its mass by supplying some to the\none in demand, it loses its gravitational pull and thus keeps the whole system\nof supply chain per-fectly in balance. The multi agent system helps in\ncontinuous updation of the whole system with the help of autonomous agents\nwhich react to the change in environment and act accordingly. This model also\nreduces the communication bottleneck to greater extents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 11:20:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ojha", "Muneendra", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0935", "submitter": "Sumit Sourabh", "authors": "Sanchit Saraf, Sumit Sourabh", "title": "Characterizing Successful Formulas: the Multi-agent Case", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Characterization of successful formulas in Public Announcement Logic (PAL) is\na well known open problem in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.

There is both good news and bad news. The good news is that over the\npast decade we've made considerable progress on techniques for engineering\nmulti-agent systems: we have good, usable methodologies, and mature tools.\nFurthermore, we've seen a wide range of demonstrated applications, and have\neven begun to quantify the advantages of agent technology. However, industry\ninvolvement in AAMAS appears to be declining (as measured by industry\nsponsorship of the conference), and industry affiliated attendants at AAMAS\n2012 were few (1-2%). Furthermore, looking at the applications of agents being\nreported at recent AAMAS, usage of Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)\nand of Agent Oriented Programming Languages (AOPLs) is quite limited. This\nobservation is corroborated by the results of a 2008 survey by Frank and\nVirginia Dignum. Based on these observations, I make five recommendations: (1)\nRe-engage with industry; (2) Stop designing AOPLs and AOSE methodologies ...\nand instead ... (3) Move to the \"macro\" level: develop techniques for designing\nand implementing interaction, integrate micro (single cognitive agent) and\nmacro (MAS) design and implementation; (4) Develop techniques for the Assurance\nof MAS; and (5) Re-engage with the US.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Sep 2012 00:27:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Winikoff", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1885", "submitter": "Simon Kramer", "authors": "Simon Kramer and Joshua Sack", "title": "Parametric Constructive Kripke-Semantics for Standard Multi-Agent Belief\n  and Knowledge (Knowledge As Unbiased Belief)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose parametric constructive Kripke-semantics for multi-agent\nKD45-belief and S5-knowledge in terms of elementary set-theoretic constructions\nof two basic functional building blocks, namely bias (or viewpoint) and\nvisibility, functioning also as the parameters of the doxastic and epistemic\naccessibility relation. The doxastic accessibility relates two possible worlds\nwhenever the application of the composition of bias with visibility to the\nfirst world is equal to the application of visibility to the second world. The\nepistemic accessibility is the transitive closure of the union of our doxastic\naccessibility and its converse. Therefrom, accessibility relations for common\nand distributed belief and knowledge can be constructed in a standard way. As a\nresult, we obtain a general definition of knowledge in terms of belief that\nenables us to view S5-knowledge as accurate (unbiased and thus true)\nKD45-belief, negation-complete belief and knowledge as exact KD45-belief and\nS5-knowledge, respectively, and perfect S5-knowledge as precise (exact and\naccurate) KD45-belief, and all this generically for arbitrary functions of bias\nand visibility.

We present a formal model of a distributed\ntraffic control protocol that guarantees minimum separation between entities,\neven as some cells fail. Once new failures cease occurring, in the case of a\nsingle target, the protocol is guaranteed to self-stabilize and the entities\nwith feasible paths to the target cell make progress towards it. For multiple\ntargets, failures may cause deadlocks in the system, so we identify a class of\nnon-deadlocking failures where all entities are able to make progress to their\nrespective targets. The algorithm relies on two general principles: temporary\nblocking for maintenance of safety and local geographical routing for\nguaranteeing progress. Our assertional proofs may serve as a template for the\nanalysis of other distributed traffic control protocols.
