Each agent\ninitially receives a noisy observation of the true state of the world. The\nagents then repeatedly 'vote' and observe the votes of some of their peers,\nfrom which they gain more information. The agents' calculations are Bayesian\nand aim to myopically maximize the expected utility at each iteration.\n  This model, introduced by Gale and Kariv (2003), is a natural approach to\nlearning on networks. However, it has been criticized, chiefly because the\nagents' decision rule appears to become computationally intractable as the\nnumber of iterations advances. For instance, a dynamic programming approach\n(part of this work) has running time that is exponentially large in \\min(n,\n(d-1)^t), where n is the number of agents.\n  We provide a new algorithm to perform the agents' computations on locally\ntree-like graphs. Our algorithm uses the dynamic cavity method to drastically\nreduce computational effort. Let d be the maximum degree and t be the iteration\nnumber. The computational effort needed per agent is exponential only in O(td)\n(note that the number of possible information sets of a neighbor at time t is\nitself exponential in td).\n  Under appropriate assumptions on the rate of convergence, we deduce that each\nagent is only required to spend polylogarithmic (in 1/\\eps) computational\neffort to approximately learn the true state of the world with error\nprobability \\eps, on regular trees of degree at least five. We provide\nnumerical and other evidence to justify our assumption on convergence rate.\n  We extend our results in various directions, including loopy graphs. Our\nresults indicate efficiency of iterative Bayesian social learning in a wide\nrange of situations, contrary to widely held beliefs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Feb 2011 19:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kanoria", "Yashodhan", ""], ["Tamuz", "Omer", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1747", "submitter": "Maria Polukarov", "authors": "Thomas D.
