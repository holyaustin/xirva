Each\niteration, each agent in the artificial society invents a new action, or\nimitates a neighbor's action. Only the leader's actions can be imitated by all\nother agents, referred to as followers. Two measures of creativity were used:\n(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent\ninvents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how\ncreative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but\nonly when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with\ngreater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High\ncLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;\nin the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and\ntentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 May 2010 12:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:44:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 21:00:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 19:56:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Leijnen", "Stefan", ""], ["Gabora", "Liane", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3529", "submitter": "Gyorgy Korniss", "authors": "D.

These\nactions modify an election's participation structure and aim at either making a\nfavorite candidate win (\"constructive control\") or prevent a despised candidate\nfrom winning (\"destructive control\"), which yields a total of 22 standard\ncontrol scenarios. To protect elections from such control attempts,\ncomputational complexity has been used to show that electoral control, though\nnot impossible, is computationally prohibitive. Among natural voting systems\nwith a polynomial-time winner problem, the two systems with the highest number\nof proven resistances to control types (namely 19 out of 22) are\n\"sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting\" (SP-AV, a modification of a\nsystem proposed by Brams and Sanver) and fallback voting. Both are hybrid\nsystems; e.g., fallback voting combines approval with Bucklin voting. In this\npaper, we study the control complexity of Bucklin voting itself and show that\nit behaves equally well in terms of control resistance for the 20 cases\ninvestigated so far. As Bucklin voting is a special case of fallback voting,\nall resistances shown for Bucklin voting in this paper strengthen the\ncorresponding resistance for fallback voting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 May 2010 09:12:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Erd\u00e9lyi", "G\u00e1bor", ""], ["Piras", "Lena", ""], ["Rothe", "J\u00f6rg", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.4263", "submitter": "Chriss Romy", "authors": "S.B.Thorat, S.

The member agents of such systems may inadvertently fail\nto, or even deliberately choose not to, conform to the system specification.\nConsequently, it is necessary to specify the normative relations that may exist\nbetween the agents, such as permission, obligation, and institutional power.\nThe specification of open agent systems of this sort is largely seen as a\ndesign-time activity. Moreover, there is no support for run-time specification\nmodification. Due to environmental, social, or other conditions, however, it is\noften required to revise the specification during the system execution. To\naddress this requirement, we present an infrastructure for `dynamic'\nspecifications, that is, specifications that may be modified at run-time by the\nagents. The infrastructure consists of well-defined procedures for proposing a\nmodification of the `rules of the game', as well as decision-making over and\nenactment of proposed modifications. We evaluate proposals for rule\nmodification by modelling a dynamic specification as a metric space, and by\nconsidering the effects of accepting a proposal on system utility. Furthermore,\nwe constrain the enactment of proposals that do not meet the evaluation\ncriteria. We employ the action language C+ to formalise dynamic specifications,\nand the `Causal Calculator' implementation of C+ to execute the specifications.\nWe illustrate our infrastructure by presenting a dynamic specification of a\nresource-sharing protocol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 May 2010 13:55:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Artikis", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.4877", "submitter": "Felix Brandt", "authors": "Felix Brandt", "title": "Set-Monotonicity Implies Kelly-Strategyproofness", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the strategic manipulation of set-valued social choice\nfunctions according to Kelly's preference extension, which prescribes that one\nset of alternatives is preferred to another if and only if all elements of the\nformer are preferred to all elements of the latter.

Recent theoretical results\nsuggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice.
