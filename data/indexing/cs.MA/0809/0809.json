It introduces \\emph{separably estimable} observation models that\ngeneralize the observability condition in linear centralized estimation to\nnonlinear distributed estimation. It studies two distributed estimation\nalgorithms in separably estimable models, the $\\mathcal{NU}$ (with its linear\ncounterpart $\\mathcal{LU}$) and the $\\mathcal{NLU}$. Their update rule combines\na \\emph{consensus} step (where each sensor updates the state by weight\naveraging it with its neighbors' states) and an \\emph{innovation} step (where\neach sensor processes its local current observation.) This makes the three\nalgorithms of the \\textit{consensus + innovations} type, very different from\ntraditional consensus. The paper proves consistency (all sensors reach\nconsensus almost surely and converge to the true parameter value,) efficiency,\nand asymptotic unbiasedness. For $\\mathcal{LU}$ and $\\mathcal{NU}$, it proves\nasymptotic normality and provides convergence rate guarantees. The three\nalgorithms are characterized by appropriately chosen decaying weight sequences.\nAlgorithms $\\mathcal{LU}$ and $\\mathcal{NU}$ are analyzed in the framework of\nstochastic approximation theory; algorithm $\\mathcal{NLU}$ exhibits mixed\ntime-scale behavior and biased perturbations, and its analysis requires a\ndifferent approach that is developed in the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 20:32:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2012 14:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jose M.
