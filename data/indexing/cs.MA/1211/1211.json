Interest in population-level cellular\nbehaviour is increasing, due to both our expanding knowledge of the underlying\nbiological principles, and the growing range of possible applications for\nengineered microbial consortia. Researchers in the field of synthetic biology -\nthe application of engineering principles to living systems - have, for\nexample, recently shown how useful decision-making circuits may be distributed\nacross a bacterial population. The ability of cells to interact through small\nsignalling molecules (a mechanism known as it quorum sensing) is the basis for\nthe majority of existing engineered systems. However, horizontal gene transfer\n(or conjugation) offers the possibility of cells exchanging messages (using\nDNA) that are much more information-rich. The potential of engineering this\nconjugation mechanism to suit specific goals will guide future developments in\nthis area. Motivated by a lack of computational models for examining the\nspecific dynamics of conjugation, we present a simulation framework for its\nfurther study. We present an agent-based model for conjugation dynamics, with\nrealistic handling of physical forces. Our framework combines the management of\nintercellular interactions together with simulation of intracellular genetic\nnetworks, to provide a general-purpose platform. We validate our simulations\nagainst existing experimental data, and then demonstrate how the emergent\nmixing patterns of multi-strain populations can affect conjugation dynamics.\nOur model of conjugation, based on a probability distribution, may be easily\ntuned to correspond to the behaviour of different cell types.
