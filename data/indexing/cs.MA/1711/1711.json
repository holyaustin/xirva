In this article, we present such a methodology,\nwhich comprises a design space exploration coupled with a formal performance\nanalysis. This results in several resource reservation configurations,\noptimized for multiple objectives, with verified real-time guarantees for each\nindividual application. The Pareto-optimal configurations are handed over to\nrun-time management which searches for a suitable mapping according to this\ninformation. To provide any real-time guarantees, the performance analysis\nneeds to be composable and the influence of the applications on each other has\nto be bounded. We achieve this either by spatial or a novel temporal isolation\nfor tasks and by exploiting composable NoCs. With the proposed temporal\nisolation, tasks of different applications can be mapped to the same resource\nwhile with spatial isolation, one computing resource can be exclusively used by\nonly one application. The experiments reveal that the success rate in finding\nfeasible application mappings can be increased by the proposed temporal\nisolation by up to 30% and energy consumption can be reduced compared to\nspatial isolation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Nov 2017 05:31:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Weichslgartner", "Andreas", ""], ["Wildermann", "Stefan", ""], ["Gangadharan", "Deepak", ""], ["Gla\u00df", "Michael", ""], ["Teich", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.06064", "submitter": "Kian Hsiang Low", "authors": "Ruofei Ouyang, Kian Hsiang Low", "title": "Gaussian Process Decentralized Data Fusion Meets Transfer Learning in\n  Large-Scale Distributed Cooperative Perception", "comments": "32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2018), Extended\n  version with proofs, 14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.MA cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents novel Gaussian process decentralized data fusion\nalgorithms exploiting the notion of agent-centric support sets for distributed\ncooperative perception of large-scale environmental phenomena.
