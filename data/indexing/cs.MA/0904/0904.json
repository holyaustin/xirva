Auctions also provide a very valuable\ntesting-ground for economic theory, and they play an important role in\ncomputer-based control systems.\n  Auction mechanism design aims to manipulate the rules of an auction in order\nto achieve specific goals. Economists traditionally use mathematical methods,\nmainly game theory, to analyze auctions and design new auction forms. However,\ndue to the high complexity of auctions, the mathematical models are typically\nsimplified to obtain results, and this makes it difficult to apply results\nderived from such models to market environments in the real world. As a result,\nresearchers are turning to empirical approaches.\n  This report aims to survey the theoretical and empirical approaches to\ndesigning auction mechanisms and trading strategies with more weights on\nempirical ones, and build the foundation for further research in the field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2009 03:41:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2009 00:14:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Niu", "Jinzhong", ""], ["Parsons", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2320", "submitter": "Sherief Abdallah", "authors": "Sherief Abdallah", "title": "Why Global Performance is a Poor Metric for Verifying Convergence of\n  Multi-agent Learning", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the\nstability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm as the\nnumber of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex.\nFor cooperative agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global\nmetric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the\nglobal performance metric over time. If the global metric improves and\neventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the\nsystem's stability.\n  The main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better\nexperimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale\nadaptive cooperative systems. We show an experimental case study where the\nstability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an\nunderlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in\nperformance. We then propose an alternative metric that relies on agents' local\npolicies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective\n(than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of\nMARL algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2009 13:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Abdallah", "Sherief", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2953", "submitter": "Fahem Kebair", "authors": "Fahem Kebair and Frederic Serin", "title": "Towards an Intelligent System for Risk Prevention and Management", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the 5th International ISCRAM Conference. 526-535,\n  Washington, DC, USA May 2008", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Making a decision in a changeable and dynamic environment is an arduous task\nowing to the lack of information, their uncertainties and the unawareness of\nplanners about the future evolution of incidents.

When only the valuations are private\nand the budgets are public, Dobzinski {\\em et al} show that the {\\em adaptive\nclinching} auction is the unique incentive-compatible auction achieving\nPareto-optimality. They further show thatthere is no deterministic\nPareto-optimal auction with private budgets. Our main contribution is to show\nthe following Budget Monotonicity property of this auction: When there is only\none infinitely divisible good, a bidder cannot improve her utility by reporting\na budget smaller than the truth. This implies that a randomized modification to\nthe adaptive clinching auction is incentive compatible and Pareto-optimal with\nprivate budgets.\n  The Budget Monotonicity property also implies other improved results in this\ncontext. For revenue maximization, the same auction improves the best-known\ncompetitive ratio due to Abrams by a factor of 4, and asymptotically approaches\nthe performance of the optimal single-price auction.\n  Finally, we consider the problem of revenue maximization (or social welfare)\nin a Bayesian setting. We allow the bidders have public size constraints (on\nthe amount of good they are willing to buy) in addition to private budget\nconstraints. We show a simple poly-time computable 5.83-approximation to the\noptimal Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism, that is implementable in\ndominant strategies. Our technique again crucially needs the ability to prevent\nbidders from over-reporting budgets via randomization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2009 16:47:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bhattacharya", "Sayan", ""], ["Conitzer", "Vincent", ""], ["Munagala", "Kamesh", ""], ["Xia", "Lirong", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3669", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Alin Munteanu, Cristina Ofelia Sofran", "title": "Collaborative systems and multiagent systems", "comments": "6 pages,exposed on 1st \"European Conference on Computer Sciences &\n  Applications\" - XA2006, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
