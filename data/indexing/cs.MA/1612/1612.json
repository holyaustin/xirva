The algorithm runs over a network in which the agents communicate\nwith their neighbors and perform local computation. In the proposed algorithm,\neach agent can compute and communicate independently at different times, for\ndifferent durations, with the information it has even if the latest information\nfrom its neighbors is not yet available. Such an asynchronous algorithm reduces\nthe time that agents would otherwise waste idle because of communication delays\nor because their neighbors are slower. It also eliminates the need for a global\nclock for synchronization. Mathematically, the algorithm involves both primal\nand dual variables, uses fixed step-size parameters, and provably converges to\nthe exact solution under a bounded delay assumption and a random agent\nassumption. When running synchronously, the algorithm performs just as well as\nexisting competitive synchronous algorithms such as PG-EXTRA, which diverges\nwithout synchronization.

An\nalternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,\nrather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm\n(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.\nRobots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets\nin the area without global localization or central control, and return the\ntargets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large\nnumbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas\nresult in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the\nmultiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed\nthroughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but\nreturn to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging\nbehavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic\nalgorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes\nand the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always\nproduces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search\ntime compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the\nadvantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential\ndisadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic\nalgorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less\ncommunication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:38:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Qi", ""], ["Moses", "Melanie E.", ""], ["Hecker", "Joshua P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00903", "submitter": "Tianyu Wu", "authors": "Yat-Tin Chow, Wei Shi, Tianyu Wu, Wotao Yin", "title": "Expander Graph and Communication-Efficient Decentralized Optimization", "comments": "2016 IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we discuss how to design the graph topology to reduce the\ncommunication complexity of certain algorithms for decentralized optimization.\nOur goal is to minimize the total communication needed to achieve a prescribed\naccuracy.

On the\nlow level, CBM uses a min-cost max-flow algorithm on a time-expanded network to\nassign all agents in a single team to targets and plan their paths. On the high\nlevel, CBM uses conflict-based search to resolve collisions among agents in\ndifferent teams. Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and\noptimal. Experimentally, we show the scalability of CBM to TAPF instances with\ndozens of teams and hundreds of agents and adapt it to a simulated warehouse\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Dec 2016 01:54:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Hang", ""], ["Koenig", "Sven", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.06340", "submitter": "Sam Ganzfried", "authors": "Sam Ganzfried and Farzana Yusuf", "title": "Computing Human-Understandable Strategies", "comments": "Earlier version appeared in Proceedings of the Workshop on Computer\n  Poker and Imperfect Information Games at AAAI Conference on Artificial\n  Intelligence, 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Algorithms for equilibrium computation generally make no attempt to ensure\nthat the computed strategies are understandable by humans.

ARES uses Particle Swarm Optimization, with adaptive sizing for both\nthe receding horizon and the particle swarm. Inspired by Importance Splitting,\nthe length of the horizon and the number of particles are chosen such that at\nleast one particle reaches a next-level state, that is, a state where the cost\ndecreases by a required delta from the previous-level state. The level relation\non states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov\nfunction and an optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly\ngenerated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological\nequivalence relation. We also assess the effectiveness of ARES by statistically\nevaluating its rate of success in generating optimal plans. The ARES algorithm\nresulted from our desire to clarify if flying in V-formation is a flocking\npolicy that optimizes energy conservation, clear view, and velocity alignment.\nThat is, we were interested to see if one could find optimal plans that bring a\nflock from an arbitrary initial state to a state exhibiting a single connected\nV-formation. For flocks with 7 birds, ARES is able to generate a plan that\nleads to a V-formation in 95% of the 8,000 random initial configurations within\n63 seconds, on average. ARES can also be easily customized into a\nmodel-predictive controller (MPC) with an adaptive receding horizon and\nstatistical guarantees of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, our\nadaptive-sizing approach is the first to provide convergence guarantees in\nreceding-horizon techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Dec 2016 11:16:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Lukina", "Anna", ""], ["Esterle", "Lukas", ""], ["Hirsch", "Christian", ""], ["Bartocci", "Ezio", ""], ["Yang", "Junxing", ""], ["Tiwari", "Ashish", ""], ["Smolka", "Scott A.", ""], ["Grosu", "Radu", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.07182", "submitter": "Angeliki  Lazaridou", "authors": "Angeliki Lazaridou, Alexander Peysakhovich, Marco Baroni", "title": "Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language", "comments": "Accepted at ICLR 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.GT cs.LG cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The current mainstream approach to train natural language systems is to\nexpose them to large amounts of text.

The receiver must rely on this message to\nidentify the target. Thus, the agents develop their own language interactively\nout of the need to communicate.
