An\nimportant aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial\nand incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models:\nMDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many\napplications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt.\nWhile it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for\nlearning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability\nmodels, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning\ncapability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning,\nand the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan\nexecution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of\nincompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP\nbased and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\\em\nabstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability\nmodels are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g.,\nrobot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore,\nwhen used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately),\ncapability models provide flexible abstraction of actions. The limitation,\nhowever, is that the synthesized plan is incomplete and abstract.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 23:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["Kambhampati", "Subbarao", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.1751", "submitter": "Reshef Meir", "authors": "Reshef Meir, David Parkes", "title": "Playing the Wrong Game: Bounding Externalities in Diverse Populations of\n  Agents", "comments": "full version of a paper accepted to AAMAS 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The robustness of multiagent systems can be affected by mistakes or\nbehavioral biases (e.g., risk-aversion, altruism, toll-sensitivity), with some\nagents playing the \"wrong game.\" This can change the set of equilibria, and may\nin turn harm or improve the social welfare of agents in the system.
