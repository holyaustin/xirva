The former consists in distinguishing a unique\nrobot, called the leader. The latter aims in arranging the robots in the plane\nto form any given pattern. The solv- ability of both these tasks turns out to\nbe necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. In this paper, we study\nthe relationship between these two tasks in a model, called CORDA, wherein the\nrobots are weak in several aspects. In particular, they are fully asynchronous\nand they have no direct means of communication. They cannot remember any\nprevious observation nor computation performed in any previous step. Such\nrobots are said to be oblivious. The robots are also uniform and anonymous,\ni.e, they all have the same program using no global parameter (such as an\nidentity) allowing to differentiate any of them. Moreover, we assume that none\nof them share any kind of common coordinate mechanism or common sense of\ndirection and we discuss the influence of a common handedness (i.e.,\nchirality). In such a system, Flochini et al. proved in [11] that it is\npossible to elect a leader for n \\geq 3 robots if it is possible to form any\npattern for n \\geq 3. In this paper, we show that the converse is true for n\n\\geq 4 when the robots share a common handedness and for n \\geq 5 when they do\nnot. Thus, we deduce that with chirality (resp. without chirality) both\nproblems are equivalent for n \\geq 4 (resp. n \\geq 5) in CORDA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 08:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2009 15:28:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 21:19:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dieudonn\u00e9", "Yoann", "", "MIS"], ["Petit", "Franck", "", "LIP6"], ["Villain", "Vincent", "", "MIS"]]}, {"id": "0902.3513", "submitter": "Mark Burgin", "authors": "Mark Burgin and Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic", "title": "A Systematic Approach to Artificial Agents", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Agents and agent systems are becoming more and more important in the\ndevelopment of a variety of fields such as ubiquitous computing, ambient\nintelligence, autonomous computing, intelligent systems and intelligent\nrobotics.

We introduce the use\nof movement-signals (analogously to flight signals and bees waggle) as a mean\nto transfer messages, enabling the use of distributed algorithms among the\nrobots. We propose one-to-one deterministic movement protocols that implement\nexplicit communication. We first present protocols for synchronous robots. We\nbegin with a very simple coding protocol for two robots. Based on on this\nprotocol, we provide one-to-one communication for any system of n \\geq 2 robots\nequipped with observable IDs that agree on a common direction (sense of\ndirection). We then propose two solutions enabling one-to-one communication\namong anonymous robots. Since the robots are devoid of observable IDs, both\nprotocols build recognition mechanisms using the (weak) capabilities offered to\nthe robots. The first protocol assumes that the robots agree on a common\ndirection and a common handedness (chirality), while the second protocol\nassumes chirality only. Next, we show how the movements of robots can provide\nimplicit acknowledgments in asynchronous systems. We use this result to design\nasynchronous one-to-one communication with two robots only. Finally, we combine\nthis solution with the schemes developed in synchronous settings to fit the\ngeneral case of asynchronous one-to-one communication among any number of\nrobots. Our protocols enable the use of distributing algorithms based on\nmessage exchanges among swarms of Stigmergic robots. Furthermore, they provides\nrobots equipped with means of communication to overcome faults of their\ncommunication device.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Feb 2009 10:39:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Dieudonn\u00e9", "Yoann", "", "LaRIA, MIS"], ["Dolev", "Shlomi", "", "LaRIA,\n  LIP, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du\n  Parall\u00e9lisme"], ["Petit", "Franck", "", "LaRIA,\n  LIP, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du\n  Parall\u00e9lisme"], ["Segal", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4098", "submitter": "Pavel Chebotarev", "authors": "Pavel Chebotarev and Rafig Agaev", "title": "Coordination in multiagent systems and Laplacian spectra of digraphs", "comments": "15 pages, 2 figures, 40 references.
