Our model is also consistent with a\ndual-process psychological theory of thinking: the group members behave\nrationally at the initiation of their interactions with each other (the slow\nand deliberative mode); however, in the ensuing decision epochs, they rely on a\nheuristic that replicates their experiences from the first stage (the fast\nautomatic mode). We specialize this model to a group decision scenario where\nprivate observations are received at the beginning, and agents aim to take the\nbest action given the aggregate observations of all group members. We study the\nimplications of the information structure together with the properties of the\nprobability distributions which determine the structure of the so-called\n\"Bayesian heuristics\" that the agents follow in our model. We also analyze the\ngroup decision outcomes in two classes of linear action updates and log-linear\nbelief updates and show that many inefficiencies arise in group decisions as a\nresult of repeated interactions between individuals, leading to overconfident\nbeliefs as well as choice-shifts toward extremes. Nevertheless, balanced\nregular structures demonstrate a measure of efficiency in terms of aggregating\nthe initial information of individuals. These results not only verify some\nwell-known insights about group decision-making but also complement these\ninsights by revealing additional mechanistic interpretations for the group\ndeclension-process, as well as psychological and cognitive intuitions about the\ngroup interaction model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 16:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rahimian", "M.

We\nconsider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems.\nHigh-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard\nrepresentation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in\nstandard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for\npolynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same\napproach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain\npolynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the\ncase where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases. In\nthe process we explore the relationship between high-multiplicity scheduling\nand manipulation of high-multiplicity elections. And we show that for any fixed\nset of job lengths, high-multiplicity scheduling on uniform parallel machines\nis in P, which was previously known for only two job lengths. We did not find\nany natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P\nwhen moving to high-multiplicity representation. However, we found one natural\nNP-hard election problem where the complexity does increase, namely winner\ndetermination for Kemeny elections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 22:39:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 21:54:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Nov 2017 21:35:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:49:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:32:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Fitzsimmons", "Zack", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Edith", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.08951", "submitter": "Rodrigo de Lamare", "authors": "C.

Diffusion-based\nalgorithms have been demonstrated to be among the most effective for\ndistributed signal processing problems, through the combination of local node\nestimate updates and sharing of information with neighbour nodes through\ndiffusion. In this work, we develop a serial-inspired approach based on\nmessage-passing strategies that provides a significant improvement in\nperformance over prior art. The concept of serial processing in the graph has\nbeen successfully applied in sum-product based algorithms and here provides\ninspiration for an algorithm which makes use of the most up-to-date information\nin the graph in combination with the diffusion approach to offer improved\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 01:10:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Healy", "C.

Given a fixed observation point, it is desired to find sufficient\ngraphical conditions under which the failure of a set of edges in the network\ninformation flow digraph is distinguishable from another set. When the latter\nis empty, this corresponds to the detectability of the former link set given\nthe response of the observing agent. In developing the results, a powerful\nextension of the all-minors matrix tree theorem in algebraic graph theory is\nproved which relates the minors of the transformed Laplacian of a directed\ngraph to the number and length of the shortest paths between its vertices. The\nresults reveal an intricate relationship between the ability to distinguish the\nresponses of a healthy and a faulty multi-agent network and the inter-nodal\npaths in their information flow digraphs. The results have direct implications\nfor the operation and design of multi-agent systems subject to multiple link\nlosses.

The\neffects of the loss of agents and communication links on the controllability of\nan information flow graph are previously studied. In this work, the\ncorresponding results are exploited to introduce some useful indices and\nimportance measures that help characterize and quantify the role of individual\nlinks and agents in the controllability of the overall network. Existing\nresults are then extended by considering the effects of losses in both links\nand agents at the same time. To this end, the concepts of joint\n(r,s)-controllability and joint t-controllability are introduced as\nquantitative measures of reliability for a multi-agent system, and their\nimportant properties are investigated. Lastly, the class of jointly critical\ndigraphs is introduced and it is stated that if a digraph is jointly critical,\nthen joint t-controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for\nremaining controllable following the failure of any set of links and agents,\nwith cardinality less than t. Various examples are exploited throughout the\npaper to elaborate on the analytical findings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 05:37:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rahimian", "M.
