Many\nresearchers have thus recognized the importance of evolvability, i.e. the\nability to find new variants of higher fitness, in the fields of biological\nevolution and evolutionary computation. Recent studies by Ciliberti et al\n(Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 2007) and Wagner (Proc. R. Soc. B., 2008) propose a\npotentially important link between the robustness and the evolvability of a\nsystem. In particular, it has been suggested that robustness may actually lead\nto the emergence of evolvability. Here we study two design principles,\nredundancy and degeneracy, for achieving robustness and we show that they have\na dramatically different impact on the evolvability of the system. In\nparticular, purely redundant systems are found to have very little evolvability\nwhile systems with degeneracy, i.e. distributed robustness, can be orders of\nmagnitude more evolvable. These results offer insights into the general\nprinciples for achieving evolvability and may prove to be an important step\nforward in the pursuit of evolvable representations in evolutionary\ncomputation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2009 09:59:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Whitacre", "James M", ""], ["Bender", "Axel", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.0499", "submitter": "Fahem Kebair", "authors": "Fahem Kebair and Frederic Serin", "title": "Agent-Oriented Approach for Detecting and Managing Risks in Emergency\n  Situations", "comments": "5", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an agent-oriented approach to build a decision support\nsystem aimed at helping emergency managers to detect and to manage risks.

A mechanism maps the locations reported by the agents to the\nlocation of the facility. Specifically, we are interested in social choice\nmechanisms that do not utilize payments. We wish to design mechanisms that are\nstrategyproof, in the sense that agents can never benefit by lying, or, even\nbetter, group strategyproof, in the sense that a coalition of agents cannot all\nbenefit by lying.

Our main results\nare: We show that a simple randomized mechanism is group strategyproof and\ngives a (2-2/n)-approximation for the social cost, where n is the number of\nagents, when the network is a circle (known as a ring in the case of computer\nnetworks); we design a novel \"hybrid\" strategyproof randomized mechanism that\nprovides a tight approximation ratio of 3/2 for the maximum cost when the\nnetwork is a circle; and we show that no randomized SP mechanism can provide an\napproximation ratio better than 2-o(1) to the maximum cost even when the\nnetwork is a tree, thereby matching a trivial upper bound of two.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jul 2009 16:13:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Alon", "Noga", ""], ["Feldman", "Michal", ""], ["Procaccia", "Ariel D.", ""], ["Tennenholtz", "Moshe", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.2759", "submitter": "Fr\\'ed\\'erique Oggier", "authors": "Frederique Oggier and Alfred Bruckstein", "title": "On Cyclic and Nearly Cyclic Multiagent Interactions in the Plane", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss certain types of cyclic and nearly cyclic interactions among N\n\"point\"-agents in the plane, leading to formations of interesting limiting\ngeometric configurations.
