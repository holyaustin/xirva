In order to detect that an application is\nmalicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant\nperiod of time is often required. Mobile devices have limited computation and\npower resources and thus are limited in their monitoring capabilities. In this\npaper we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses\nthe collective resources of many mobile devices, \"vaccinating\" them against\npotentially unsafe applications. We suggest a new local information flooding\nalgorithm called \"TTL Probabilistic Propagation\" (TPP). The algorithm\nperiodically monitors one or more application and reports its conclusions to a\nsmall number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information\nonwards. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform existing state\nof the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as\nwell as network overhead. The maximal \"load\" of the algorithm (the fastest\narrival rate of new suspicious applications, that can still guarantee complete\nmonitoring), is analytically calculated and shown to be significantly superior\ncompared to any non-collaborative approach. Finally, we show both analytically\nand experimentally using real world network data that implementing the proposed\nalgorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. In\naddition, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to several types\nof Byzantine attacks where some adversarial agents may generate false\ninformation, or abuse the algorithm in other ways.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Sep 2010 19:26:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Sep 2010 17:17:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Altshuler", "Yaniv", ""], ["Dolev", "Shlomi", ""], ["Elovici", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2997", "submitter": "George Atia", "authors": "George K.

Our objective is to devise strategies\nfor scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking\nperformance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the control actions\ncorrespond to the set of sensors to activate at each time step. Using a\nbottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with\nincreasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the\ndifferent sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the\nsensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping\nsensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the\ndifferent sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein\nthe target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous\nspaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models\ndue to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we\ndevise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds\non the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit\nsuboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Sep 2010 18:55:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Atia", "George K.", ""], ["Veeravalli", "Venugopal V.", ""], ["Fuemmeler", "Jason A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4409", "submitter": "Boris Oreshkin N.", "authors": "Boris N.

Here we investigate in details the role played by\nthe way in which the two agents update their states after an interaction. We\nshow that slightly modifying the NG rules in terms of which agent performs the\nupdate in given circumstances (i.e. after a success) can either alter\ndramatically the overall dynamics or leave it qualitatively unchanged. We\nunderstand analytically the first case by casting the model in the broader\nframework of a generalized NG. As for the second case, on the other hand, we\nnote that the modified rule reproducing the main features of the usual NG\ncorresponds in fact to a simplification of it consisting in the elimination of\nfeedback between the agents. This allows us to introduce and study a very\nnatural broadcasting scheme on networks that can be potentially relevant for\ndifferent applications, such as the design and implementation of autonomous\nsensor networks, as pointed out in the recent literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Sep 2010 10:23:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2011 10:05:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Baronchelli", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5346", "submitter": "Murugesan Kuttikrishnan", "authors": "Murugesan Kuttikrishnan", "title": "A Novel Approach for Cardiac Disease Prediction and Classification Using\n  Intelligent Agents", "comments": "8 pages 2 figures and 7 tables", "journal-ref": "(IJCSIS) International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, Vol. 8, No. 5, August 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The goal is to develop a novel approach for cardiac disease prediction and\ndiagnosis using intelligent agents.
