An active line of\nresearch in behavioral economics and related fields has developed and analyzed\nmodels for this type of time-inconsistent behavior.\n  Here we propose a graph-theoretic model of tasks and goals, in which\ndependencies among actions are represented by a directed graph, and a\ntime-inconsistent agent constructs a path through this graph. We first show how\ninstances of this path-finding problem on different input graphs can\nreconstruct a wide range of qualitative phenomena observed in the literature on\ntime-inconsistency, including procrastination, abandonment of long-range tasks,\nand the benefits of reduced sets of choices. We then explore a set of analyses\nthat quantify over the set of all graphs; among other results, we find that in\nany graph, there can be only polynomially many distinct forms of\ntime-inconsistent behavior; and any graph in which a time-inconsistent agent\nincurs significantly more cost than an optimal agent must contain a large\n\"procrastination\" structure as a minor. Finally, we use this graph-theoretic\nmodel to explore ways in which tasks can be designed to help motivate agents to\nreach designated goals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2014 13:09:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kleinberg", "Jon", ""], ["Oren", "Sigal", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.1734", "submitter": "Tiep Le", "authors": "Tiep Le, Enrico Pontelli, Tran Cao Son, William Yeoh", "title": "Logic and Constraint Logic Programming for Distributed Constraint\n  Optimization", "comments": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) has gained\nmomentum, thanks to its suitability in capturing complex problems (e.g.,\nmulti-agent coordination and resource allocation problems) that are naturally\ndistributed and cannot be realistically addressed in a centralized manner.

This brings up the replanning problem, and the various techniques\nthat have been proposed to solve it. In all, three main techniques -- based on\nthree different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work.\nAn open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this\nrequires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In\nthis paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by\ncompiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this\nnovel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not\ninterchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other.
