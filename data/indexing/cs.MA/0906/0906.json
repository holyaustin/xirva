With advances in the health\nscience, many features and functionalities need to be added to, or removed\nfrom, existing software applications in the biomedical domain. At the same\ntime, the increasing complexity of biomedical systems makes them more difficult\nto understand, and consequently it is more difficult to define their\nrequirements, which contributes considerably to their volatility. In this\npaper, we present a novel agent-based approach for analyzing and managing\nvolatile and dynamic requirements in an ontology-driven laboratory information\nmanagement system (LIMS) designed for Web-based case reporting in medical\nmycology. The proposed framework is empowered with ontologies and formalized\nusing category theory to provide a deep and common understanding of the\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirement hierarchies and their interrelations,\nand to trace the effects of a change on the conceptual framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2009 00:44:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Shaban-Nejad", "Arash", ""], ["Ormandjieva", "Olga", ""], ["Kassab", "Mohamad", ""], ["Haarslev", "Volker", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.2667", "submitter": "Tobias Kretz", "authors": "Tobias Kretz", "title": "The use of dynamic distance potential fields for pedestrian flow around\n  corners", "comments": "Prepared and Accepted for \"First International Conference on\n  Evacuation Modeling and Management\" (ICEM 09)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This contribution investigates situations in pedestrian dynamics, where\ntrying to walk the shortest path leads to largely different results than trying\nto walk the quickest path.

The bid optimizer is positioned as a key value added tool the search\nengine provides to the advertisers. The proposed bid optimizer algorithm\ntransforms the reported values of the advertisers for a keyword into a\ncorrelated bid profile using many ideas from cooperative game theory. The\nalgorithm is based on a characteristic form game involving the search engine\nand the advertisers. Ideas from Nash bargaining theory are used in formulating\nthe characteristic form game to provide for a fair share of surplus among the\nplayers involved. The algorithm then computes the nucleolus of the\ncharacteristic form game since we find that the nucleolus is an apt way of\nallocating the gains of cooperation among the search engine and the\nadvertisers. The algorithm next transforms the nucleolus into a correlated bid\nprofile using a linear programming formulation. This bid profile is input to a\nstandard generalized second price mechanism (GSP) for determining the\nallocation of sponsored slots and the prices to be be paid by the winners. The\ncorrelated bid profile that we determine is a locally envy-free equilibrium and\nalso a correlated equilibrium of the underlying game. Through detailed\nsimulation experiments, we show that the proposed bid optimizer retains more\ncustomers than a plain GSP mechanism and also yields better long-run utilities\nto the search engine and the advertisers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2009 18:25:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 11:31:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Somanchi", "Sriram", ""], ["Nittala", "Chaitanya", ""], ["Yadati", "Narahari", ""]]}]
