In this paper, a\nframework for learning this task in a limited domain (restricted environment)\nis proposed. In this framework, agents learn either directly by observing an\nexpert behavior or indirectly by observing other agents or objects behavior.\nFirst, a group of algorithms for learning formation strategy based on limited\nfeatures will be presented. Due to distributed and complex nature of many\nmulti-agent systems, it is impossible to include all features directly in the\nlearning process; thus, a modular scheme is proposed in order to reduce the\nnumber of features. In this method, some important features have indirect\ninfluence in learning instead of directly involving them as input features.\nThis framework has the ability to dynamically assign a group of positions to a\ngroup of agents to improve system performance. In addition, it can change the\nformation strategy when the context changes. Finally, this framework is able to\nautomatically produce many complex and flexible formation strategy algorithms\nwithout directly involving an expert to present and implement such complex\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 01:29:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Norouzitallab", "Mehrab", ""], ["Monajjemi", "Valiallah", ""], ["Ghidary", "Saeed Shiry", ""], ["Menhaj", "Mohammad Bagher", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0258", "submitter": "Joel Oren", "authors": "Omer Lev, Joel Oren, Craig Boutilier, Jeffery S.
