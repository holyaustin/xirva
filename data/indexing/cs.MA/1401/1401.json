In contrast,\ntraditional self-nonself discrimination theory states that immune response is\nonly initiated by sensing nonself (unknown) patterns. Danger theory solves many\nproblems that could only be partially explained by the traditional model.\nAlthough the traditional model is simpler, such problems result in high false\npositive rates in immune-inspired intrusion detection systems. We believe using\ndanger theory in a multi-agent environment that computationally emulates the\nbehavior of natural immune systems is effective in reducing false positive\nrates. We first describe a simplified scenario of immune response in natural\nsystems based on danger theory and then, convert it to a computational model as\na network protocol. In our protocol, we define several immune signals and model\ncell signaling via message passing between agents that emulate cells. Most\nmessages include application-specific patterns that must be meaningfully\nextracted from various system properties. We show how to model these messages\nin practice by performing a case study on the problem of detecting distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks in wireless sensor networks. We conduct a set of\nsystematic experiments to find a set of performance metrics that can accurately\ndistinguish malicious patterns.

Forming effective\ncoalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.\nCentral to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many\npossible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually\nrequires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the\ncoalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it\nwas formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a\ncombination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one\ncoalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.\nHowever, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging\ndue to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows\nexponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many\nalgorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques\nranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search\nall of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution\nquality, and memory requirements.\n  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition\nstructure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel\nrepresentation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible\nsolutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower\nbounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are\nthen used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the\noptimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches\nthrough the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound\ntechnique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).\nIn this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition\nstructures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions\nautomatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop\na new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable\nbenchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.\nGiven this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able\nto find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the\nfastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if\ninterrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a\nsolution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.\nMoreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are\nsignificantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art\nalgorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case\ndistribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient\nsolution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:23:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rahwan", "Talal", ""], ["Ramchurn", "Sarvapali Dyanand", ""], ["Jennings", "Nicholas Robert", ""], ["Giovannucci", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3845", "submitter": "Jianhui Wu", "authors": "Jianhui Wu, Edmund H.

Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if\nthey can use --- and even create --- opportunities to change which resources\nthey hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could\nbreak their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally\nreconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned\nresources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment.\nIn this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential\noptimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts.

They try to avoid collisions\nand to preserve their personal space. State-of-the-art pedestrian motion models\nautomatically reduce speed in dense crowds simply because there is no space\nwhere the pedestrians could go. The stride length and its correct adaptation,\nhowever, are rarely considered. This leads to artefacts that impact macroscopic\nobservation parameters such as densities in front of bottlenecks and, through\nthis, flow. Hence modelling stride adaptation is important to increase the\npredictive power of pedestrian models. To achieve this we reformulate the\nproblem as an optimisation problem on a disk around the pedestrian. Each\npedestrian seeks the position that is most attractive in a sense of balanced\ngoals between the search for targets, the need for individual space and the\nneed to keep a distance from obstacles. The need for space is modelled\naccording to findings from psychology defining zones around a person that, when\ninvaded, cause unease. The result is a fully automatic adjustment that allows\ncalibration through meaningful social parameters and that gives visually\nnatural results with an excellent fit to measured experimental data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 13:32:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 14:28:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 13:43:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["von Sivers", "Isabella", ""], ["K\u00f6ster", "Gerta", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8132", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vizzari", "authors": "Stefania Bandini, Luca Crociani, Giuseppe Vizzari", "title": "Heterogeneous Speed Profiles in Discrete Models for Pedestrian\n  Simulation", "comments": "Poster at the 93rd Transportation Research Board annual meeting,\n  Washington, January 2014 - Committee number AHB45 - TRB Committee on Traffic\n  Flow Theory and Characteristics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Discrete pedestrian simulation models are viable alternatives to particle\nbased approaches based on a continuous spatial representation. The effects of\ndiscretisation, however, also imply some difficulties in modelling certain\nphenomena that can be observed in reality. This paper focuses on the\npossibility to manage heterogeneity in the walking speed of the simulated\npopulation of pedestrians by modifying an existing multi-agent model extending\nthe floor field approach. Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or\ncars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per\ntime step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but\nwe model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some\nturns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired\nwalking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain\nan average speed close to this threshold. In the paper we formally describe the\nmodel and we show the results of its application in benchmark scenarios.\nFinally, we also show how this approach can also support the definition of\nslopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians\nclimbing them in a simulated scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 11:07:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bandini", "Stefania", ""], ["Crociani", "Luca", ""], ["Vizzari", "Giuseppe", ""]]}]
