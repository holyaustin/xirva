However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate\nand defect. In real-world prisoner's dilemmas, these choices are temporally\nextended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions,\nreflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner's Dilemma\n(SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work,\nwe propose a deep multiagent reinforcement learning approach that investigates\nthe evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two\nphases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different\ncooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The\nsecond phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the\ndetected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is\ndemonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the\nFruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid\nbeing exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with\ncooperative opponents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 01:53:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Weixun", ""], ["Hao", "Jianye", ""], ["Wang", "Yixi", ""], ["Taylor", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00853", "submitter": "Przemys{\\l}aw Sadowski", "authors": "Przemys{\\l}aw Sadowski", "title": "Quantum distance-based classifier with constant size memory, distributed\n  knowledge and state recycling", "comments": "17 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CV cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we examine recently proposed distance-based classification\nmethod designed for near-term quantum processing units with limited resources.\nWe further study possibilities to reduce the quantum resources without any\nefficiency decrease.

In this\npaper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities:\nminimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only\non minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the\nalgorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures;\nand provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all\nmonotone (and not necessarily submodular) objective functions a solution that\nis finitely close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithm's approximation\nperformance using a notion of curvature for monotone set functions. We support\nour theoretical analyses with simulated and real-world experiments, by\nconsidering an active information gathering scenario, namely, multi-robot\ntarget tracking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2018 17:41:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2018 03:32:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2018 14:59:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Schlotfeldt", "Brent", ""], ["Tzoumas", "Vasileios", ""], ["Thakur", "Dinesh", ""], ["Pappas", "George J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.09792", "submitter": "Amritha Prasad", "authors": "Amritha Prasad, Han-Lim Choi, Shreyas Sundaram", "title": "Min-Max Tours for Task Allocation to Heterogeneous Agents", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.RO cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a scenario consisting of a set of heterogeneous mobile agents\nlocated at a depot, and a set of tasks dispersed over a geographic area.

A\ndistributed optimal control protocol is presented for the followers to not only\nassure that their outputs fall into the convex hull of the leaders' output\n(i.e., the desired or safe region), but also optimizes their transient\nperformance. The proposed optimal control solution is composed of a feedback\npart, depending of the followers' state, and a feed-forward part, depending on\nthe convex hull of the leaders' state. To comply with most real-world\napplications, the feedback and feed-forward states are assumed to be\nunavailable and are estimated using two distributed observers. That is, since\nthe followers cannot directly sense their absolute states, a distributed\nobserver is designed that uses only relative output measurements with respect\nto their neighbors (measured for example by using range sensors in robotic) and\nthe information which is broadcasted by their neighbors to estimate their\nstates. Moreover, another adaptive distributed observer is designed that uses\nexchange of information between followers over a communication network to\nestimate the convex hull of the leaders' state. The proposed observer relaxes\nthe restrictive requirement of knowing the complete knowledge of the leaders'\ndynamics by all followers. An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm on an\nactor-critic structure is next developed to solve the optimal containment\ncontrol problem online, using relative output measurements and without\nrequirement of knowing the leaders' dynamics by all followers. Finally, the\ntheoretical results are verified by numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2018 11:07:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mazouchi", "Majid", ""], ["Naghibi-Sistani", "Mohammad Bagher", ""], ["Sani", "Seyed Kamal Hosseini", ""], ["Tatari", "Farzaneh", ""], ["Modares", "Hamidreza", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.11457", "submitter": "Juste Raimbault", "authors": "Juste Raimbault", "title": "Co-evolution and morphogenetic systems", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The emerging field of morphogenetic engineering proposes to design complex\nheterogeneous system focused on the paradigm of emergence.

We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is\nmonotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the\njoint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between\nthe centralised and decentralised policies.
