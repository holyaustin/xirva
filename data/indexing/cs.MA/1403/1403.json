A solution to this problem\nof upgrading an open system is to have a mechanism that allows agents to\nreceive a description of an interaction protocol and use it. In this paper we\npropose a representation for protocols based on extending Petri nets. However,\nthis is not enough: in an open system the source of a protocol may not be\ntrusted and a protocol that is received may contain steps that are erroneous or\nthat make confidential information public. We therefore also describe an\nanalysis method that infers whether a protocol is safe. Finally, we give an\nexecution model for extended Petri nets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 13:46:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["de Silva", "Lavindra", ""], ["Winikoff", "Michael", ""], ["Liu", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0500", "submitter": "Blesson Varghese", "authors": "Blesson Varghese and Gerard McKee and Vassil Alexandrov", "title": "Automating Fault Tolerance in High-Performance Computational Biological\n  Jobs Using Multi-Agent Approaches", "comments": "Computers in Biology and Medicine", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.02.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CE cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Large-scale biological jobs on high-performance computing systems\nrequire manual intervention if one or more computing cores on which they\nexecute fail. This places not only a cost on the maintenance of the job, but\nalso a cost on the time taken for reinstating the job and the risk of losing\ndata and execution accomplished by the job before it failed. Approaches which\ncan proactively detect computing core failures and take action to relocate the\ncomputing core's job onto reliable cores can make a significant step towards\nautomating fault tolerance.\n  Method: This paper describes an experimental investigation into the use of\nmulti-agent approaches for fault tolerance. Two approaches are studied, the\nfirst at the job level and the second at the core level. The approaches are\ninvestigated for single core failure scenarios that can occur in the execution\nof parallel reduction algorithms on computer clusters. A third approach is\nproposed that incorporates multi-agent technology both at the job and core\nlevel. Experiments are pursued in the context of genome searching, a popular\ncomputational biology application.\n  Result: The key conclusion is that the approaches proposed are feasible for\nautomating fault tolerance in high-performance computing systems with minimal\nhuman intervention. In a typical experiment in which the fault tolerance is\nstudied, centralised and decentralised checkpointing approaches on an average\nadd 90% to the actual time for executing the job. On the other hand, in the\nsame experiment the multi-agent approaches add only 10% to the overall\nexecution time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 17:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Varghese", "Blesson", ""], ["McKee", "Gerard", ""], ["Alexandrov", "Vassil", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0770", "submitter": "Kieran Greer Dr", "authors": "Kieran Greer", "title": "A Metric for Modelling and Measuring Complex Behavioural Systems", "comments": "Published", "journal-ref": "IOSR Journal of Engineering (IOSRJEN), Vol. 3, Issue 11, November\n  2013, pp. 11 - 28", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a metric for measuring the success of a complex system\ncomposed of agents performing autonomous behaviours.

In order to assist the development of\nmulti-agent systems, agent-oriented methodologies (AOM) have been created in\nthe last years to support modeling more and more complex applications in many\ndifferent domains. By defining in a non-ambiguous way concepts used in a\nspecific domain, Meta modeling may represent a step towards such\ninteroperability. In the Transport domain, this paper propose an agent-oriented\nmeta-model that provides rigorous concepts for conducting transportation system\nproblem modeling. The aim is to allow analysts to produce a transportation\nsystem model that precisely captures the knowledge of an organization so that\nan agent-oriented requirements specification of the system-to-be and its\noperational corporate environment can be derived from it. To this end, we\nextend and adapt an existing meta-model, Extended Gaia, to build a meta-model\nand an adequate model for transportation problems. Our new agent-oriented\nmeta-model aims to allow the analyst to model and specify any transportation\nsystem as a multi-agent system. Based on the proposed meta-model, we proposes\nan approach for modeling and evaluating the Transportation System based on\nStochastic Activity Network (SAN) components. The proposed process is based on\nseven steps from Recognition phase to Quantitative Analysis phase.
