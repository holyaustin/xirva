Despite their promise, current BDI team\napproaches lack tools for quantitative performance analysis under uncertainty.\nDistributed partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) are well\nsuited for such analysis, but the complexity of finding optimal policies in\nsuch models is highly intractable. The key contribution of this article is a\nhybrid BDI-POMDP approach, where BDI team plans are exploited to improve POMDP\ntractability and POMDP analysis improves BDI team plan performance. Concretely,\nwe focus on role allocation, a fundamental problem in BDI teams: which agents\nto allocate to the different roles in the team. The article provides three key\ncontributions. First, we describe a role allocation technique that takes into\naccount future uncertainties in the domain; prior work in multiagent role\nallocation has failed to address such uncertainties. To that end, we introduce\nRMTDP (Role-based Markov Team Decision Problem), a new distributed POMDP model\nfor analysis of role allocations. Our technique gains in tractability by\nsignificantly curtailing RMTDP policy search; in particular, BDI team plans\nprovide incomplete RMTDP policies, and the RMTDP policy search fills the gaps\nin such incomplete policies by searching for the best role allocation. Our\nsecond key contribution is a novel decomposition technique to further improve\nRMTDP policy search efficiency. Even though limited to searching role\nallocations, there are still combinatorially many role allocations, and\nevaluating each in RMTDP to identify the best is extremely difficult. Our\ndecomposition technique exploits the structure in the BDI team plans to\nsignificantly prune the search space of role allocations. Our third key\ncontribution is a significantly faster policy evaluation algorithm suited for\nour BDI-POMDP hybrid approach. Finally, we also present experimental results\nfrom two domains: mission rehearsal simulation and RoboCupRescue disaster\nrescue simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:23:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "R.", ""], ["Tambe", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.2135", "submitter": "P.

Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of\nthe environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates\nto maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to\nactions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related\nto agent types considered in games of incomplete information. We express the\nagents autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable\nor observable by other agents. We show that important properties of POMDPs,\nsuch as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise\nlinearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework. Our\napproach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which\nuses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm. We seek to avoid some of the\ndrawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture\noff-equilibrium behaviors. We do so at the cost of having to represent, process\nand continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agents beliefs may be\narbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only\nasymptotically computable. However, approximate belief updates and\napproximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a\nsimple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value\nfunctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2011 20:24:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Doshi", "P.", ""], ["Gmytrasiewicz", "P.

Their occurrence depends on the concentration of proteins which are\nsynthesized based on the transcriptional activities of some genes.

To address this, many\nresearchers have developed techniques that allow the agents to make decisions\nbased on estimates of the states and actions of other agents that are typically\nlearnt using some form of machine learning algorithm. Nevertheless, many of\nthese approaches fail to provide an actual means by which the necessary\ninformation is made available so that the estimates can be learnt. To this end,\nwe argue that cooperative communication of state information between agents is\none such mechanism. However, in a dynamically changing environment, the\naccuracy and timeliness of this communicated information determine the fidelity\nof the learned estimates and the usefulness of the actions taken based on\nthese. Given this, we propose a novel information-sharing protocol,\npost-task-completion sharing, for the distribution of state information. We\nthen show, through a formal analysis, the improvement in the quality of\nestimates produced using our strategy over the widely used protocol of sharing\ninformation between nearest neighbours. Moreover, communication heuristics\ndesigned around our information-sharing principle are subjected to empirical\nevaluation along with other benchmark strategies (including Littmans Q-routing\nand Stones TPOT-RL) in a simulated call-routing application.
