Our approach tackles scenarios in which the swarm must reach multiple\nspatially distributed targets, and enforce the constraint that the robot\nnetwork cannot be split. The basic idea behind our work is to construct a\nlogical tree topology over the physical network formed by the robots. The\nlogical tree acts as a backbone used by robots to enforce connectivity\nconstraints. We study and compare two algorithms to form the logical tree:\noutwards and inwards. These algorithms differ in the order in which the robots\njoin the tree: the outwards algorithm starts at the tree root and grows towards\nthe targets, while the inwards algorithm proceeds in the opposite manner. Both\nalgorithms perform periodic reconfiguration, to prevent suboptimal topologies\nfrom halting the growth of the tree. Our contributions are (i) The formulation\nof the two algorithms; (ii) A comparison of the algorithms in extensive\nphysics-based simulations; (iii) A validation of our findings through\nreal-robot experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2018 00:47:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Majcherczyk", "Nathalie", ""], ["Jayabalan", "Adhavan", ""], ["Beltrame", "Giovanni", ""], ["Pinciroli", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.00367", "submitter": "Pragna Das", "authors": "Pragna Das, Vincent Hilaire, Lluis Ribas-Xirgo", "title": "An Ontology to Support Collective Intelligence in Decentralised\n  Multi-Robot Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In most multi-robot systems, conditions of the floor, battery and mechanical\nparts are important and impact cost-efficiency.

The goal is to derive a distributed algorithm in which each\nagent obtains a local estimate of its own subset of the global parameter\nvector, based on local measurements as well as information received from its\nneighbours. A recent algorithm has been proposed, which yields the optimal\nsolution (i.e., the one that would be obtained using a centralized method) in\nfinite time, provided the communication network forms an acyclic graph. If\ninstead, the graph is cyclic, the only available alternative algorithm, which\nis based on iterative matrix inversion, achieving the optimal solution, does so\nasymptotically. However, it is also known that, in the cyclic case, the\nalgorithm designed for acyclic graphs produces a solution which, although non\noptimal, is highly accurate. In this paper we do a theoretical study of the\naccuracy of this algorithm, in communication networks forming cyclic graphs. To\nthis end, we provide bounds for the sub-optimality of the estimation error and\nthe estimation error covariance, for a class of systems whose topological\nsparsity and signal-to-noise ratio satisfy certain condition. Our results show\nthat, at each node, the accuracy improves exponentially with the so-called\nloop-free depth. Also, although the algorithm no longer converges in finite\ntime in the case of cyclic graphs, simulation results show that the convergence\nis significantly faster than that of methods based on iterative matrix\ninversion. Our results suggest that, depending on the loop-free depth, the\nstudied algorithm may be the preferred option even in applications with cyclic\ncommunication graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2018 08:20:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Sui", "Tianju", ""], ["Marelli", "Dami\u00e1n", ""], ["Fu", "Minyue", ""], ["Lu", "Renquan", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.09757", "submitter": "Jianxiang Xi", "authors": "Jianxiang Xi, Jie Yang, Hao Liu, Tang Zheng", "title": "Adaptive guaranteed-performance consensus design for high-order\n  multiagent systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The current paper addresses the distributed guaranteed-performance consensus\ndesign problems for general high-order linear multiagent systems with\nleaderless and leader-follower structures, respectively.
