Often they are not very useful for giving answers to\nspeculative 'what-if' questions, particularly when one is interested in the\ndevelopment of the system over time rather than just the state of the system at\na certain point in time. Simulation can be used to analyse the operation of\ndynamic and stochastic systems. ABS is particularly useful when complex\ninteractions between system entities exist, such as autonomous decision making\nor negotiation. In an ABS model the researcher explicitly describes the\ndecision process of simulated actors at the micro level. Structures emerge at\nthe macro level as a result of the actions of the agents and their interactions\nwith other agents and the environment. 3 We will show how ABS experiments can\ndeal with testing and optimising management practices such as training,\nempowerment or teamwork.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web\ntraffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both\naggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link\ntraffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model\ncurrently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show\nthat all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model\nthat takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited\nlinks, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as\nthe use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by\nvisiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more\ntopically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the\nprobability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing\nus to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of\nreproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical\ndata, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users\nwith the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result\nallows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient\nto interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data.
