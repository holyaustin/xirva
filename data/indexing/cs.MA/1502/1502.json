Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or\ntask requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,\nin turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a\nmechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where\nrisk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust\ncrowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to\nefficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve\nhigh social welfare?\n  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the\nexisting trust management research framework by removing a widespread\nassumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can\nprocess an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit\nwithout compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or\ntruster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a\nmulti-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is\nsolved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social\nWelfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)\napproach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair\nutilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized\nsystems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical\nanalyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches\ncan be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter.

In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation\nFramework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that allows exploiting historical\nreal-world data to assess the validity of activity-based models. The framework\ncompares temporal and spatial properties and the structure of activity\nschedules against real-world travel diaries and origin-destination matrices. We\nconfirm the usefulness of the framework on three real-world activity-based\ntransport models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 15:42:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 19:15:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Drchal", "Jan", ""], ["\u010certick\u00fd", "Michal", ""], ["Jakob", "Michal", ""]]}]
