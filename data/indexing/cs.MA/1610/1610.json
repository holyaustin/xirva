The\nimplementation of a policy without pedestrian analysis might lead to a very\ncostly trial and error due to the implementation cost (i.e. user cost,\nconstruction time and cost, etc.). On the other hand, using good analysis\ntools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once\nthe analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy\nis straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy\nquantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.\nSince the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic\nlevel of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the\nanalytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and\nsimulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the\npolicy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its\nimplementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed. The\nmodel was based on physical forces, which work upon each pedestrian\ndynamically. To demonstrate the numerical analysis of the model, an\nexperimental policy on pedestrian crossing was performed. The simulation\nresults showed that the keep right policy or the lane-like segregation policy\nis inclined to be superior to do minimum or mix-lane policy in terms of average\nspeed, average delay and dissipation time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 02:49:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Teknomo", "Kardi", ""], ["Takeyama", "Yasushi", ""], ["Inamura", "Hajime", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.01295", "submitter": "Gabriele D'Angelo", "authors": "Gabriele D'Angelo", "title": "The Simulation Model Partitioning Problem: an Adaptive Solution Based on\n  Self-Clustering (Extended Version)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory, Elsevier, Volume 70,\n  January 2017 pages 1-20", "doi": "10.1016/j.simpat.2016.10.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.MA cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is about partitioning in parallel and distributed simulation.

These graphs are usually\ncharacterized algebraically by their associated Laplacian matrices. Network\nalgorithms with similar algebraic graph theoretic structures, called being of\nLaplacian-type in this paper, also arise in other related multi-agent control\nproblems, such as aggregation and containment control, target surrounding,\ndistributed optimization and modeling of opinion evolution in social groups. In\nspite of their similarities, each of such algorithms has often been studied\nusing separate mathematical techniques. In this paper, a novel approach is\noffered, allowing a unified and elegant way to examine many Laplacian-type\nalgorithms for multi-agent coordination. This approach is based on the analysis\nof some differential or difference inequalities that have to be satisfied by\nthe some \"outputs\" of the agents (e.g. the distances to the desired set in\naggregation problems). Although such inequalities may have many unbounded\nsolutions, under natural graphic connectivity conditions all their bounded\nsolutions converge (and even reach consensus), entailing the convergence of the\ncorresponding distributed algorithms. In the theory of differential equations\nthe absence of bounded non-convergent solutions is referred to as the\nequation's dichotomy.

We analyze the performance of the procedure and show that\nthe error probabilities of types I and II decay exponentially to zero with the\nstep-size parameter. While links between agents following different objectives\nare ignored in the clustering process, we nevertheless show how to exploit\nthese links to relay critical information across the network for enhanced\nperformance. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed\nmethod in comparison to other useful techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 08:16:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Khawatmi", "Sahar", ""], ["Sayed", "Ali H.", ""], ["Zoubir", "Abdelhak M.", ""]]}]
