This is useful for designing empirically grounded agent-based\nsimulations and for gaining direct insight into observed dynamic processes. We\nuse an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based estimation\nprocess to generate simple approximations that explain most of the structure of\ncomplex stochastic processes. This method, implemented in C++ and R, scales\nwell to large data sets. We apply our methods to empirical data from human\nsubjects game experiments and international relations. We also demonstrate the\nmethod's ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating data\nwith agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision models\nfor multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Mar 2016 22:45:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Nay", "John J.", ""], ["Gilligan", "Jonathan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08177", "submitter": "Sigal Oren", "authors": "Jon Kleinberg, Sigal Oren and Manish Raghavan", "title": "Planning Problems for Sophisticated Agents with Present Bias", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.MA cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Present bias, the tendency to weigh costs and benefits incurred in the\npresent too heavily, is one of the most widespread human behavioral biases. It\nhas also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics\nliterature. While the simplest models assume that the agents are naive,\nreasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is\nconsiderable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated\nwith respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will\nbe present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action\nto reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are\ninstances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life.\n  Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that\nallows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a\nsophisticated agent might face. This has made it correspondingly difficult to\nmake comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the\nnotion of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent\nwork for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms -\nsophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that\nwasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem.\n  In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results\npossible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal\nplan. Second, the flexibility of our formalism makes it possible to identify\nnew phenomena that had not been seen in prior literature: these include a\nsurprising non-monotonic property in the use of rewards to motivate\nsophisticated agents and a framework for reasoning about commitment devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Mar 2016 06:12:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kleinberg", "Jon", ""], ["Oren", "Sigal", ""], ["Raghavan", "Manish", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08844", "submitter": "Saeed Manaffam", "authors": "S.
