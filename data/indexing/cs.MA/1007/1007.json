We try to answer the question by proposing\na new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing\nagents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.\nConsider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by\nVicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but\nwith different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the\naverage of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of\nthis model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as\nsynchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior\n(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special\nagent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an\nordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so\nthat it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control\nlaw is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft\ncontrol is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural\nway to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting\nissues and challenges on the control of complex systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2010 04:00:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Jing", ""], ["Li", "Ming", ""], ["Guo", "Lei", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1800", "submitter": "Piotr Faliszewski", "authors": "Piotr Faliszewski, Edith Hemaspaandra, Lane A.

That work has led to many results on how\nalgorithms can be used to find attacks on elections and how\ncomplexity-theoretic hardness results can be used as shields against attacks.\nHowever, all the work in this line has assumed that the attacker employs just a\nsingle type of attack. In this paper, we model and study the case in which the\nattacker launches a multipronged (i.e., multimode) attack. We do so to more\nrealistically capture the richness of real-life settings. For example, an\nattacker might simultaneously try to suppress some voters, attract new voters\ninto the election, and introduce a spoiler candidate. Our model provides a\nunified framework for such varied attacks, and by constructing polynomial-time\nmultiprong attack algorithms we prove that for various election systems even\nsuch concerted, flexible attacks can be perfectly planned in deterministic\npolynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jul 2010 20:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Faliszewski", "Piotr", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Edith", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Lane A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4523", "submitter": "Sanmay Das", "authors": "Teruhiko Yoneyama, Sanmay Das and Mukkai Krishnamoorthy", "title": "A Hybrid Model for Disease Spread and an Application to the SARS\n  Pandemic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and\nsocieties. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale\ndifference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed\nmicro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This\npaper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local\nspread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease\nbetween regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the\nspread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the\nspread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global\nspread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the\nlocal spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a\nsimulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available\ndata on population, population density, and traffic networks between different\nregions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global\ntraffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results\nshow that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly\nimprove the results of modeling disease spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 17:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Yoneyama", "Teruhiko", ""], ["Das", "Sanmay", ""], ["Krishnamoorthy", "Mukkai", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.5114", "submitter": "Toby Walsh", "authors": "Toby Walsh", "title": "Where are the hard manipulation problems?", "comments": "Invited tutorial at the Third International Workshop on Computational\n  Social Choice 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One possible escape from the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is computational\ncomplexity.

Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging\nfrom matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or\nmore generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage\nproblem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members\nof the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage\nproblems with quantitative preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a\nscore for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the\nclassical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it\nis more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs)\nrather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new\nnotions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find\nmarriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While\nexpressivity greatly increases by adopting quantitative preferences, we show\nthat in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing\nalgorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 06:37:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Pini", "Maria Silvia", ""], ["Rossi", "Francesca", ""], ["Venable", "Brent", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}]
