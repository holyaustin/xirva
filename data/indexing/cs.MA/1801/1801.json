In this\npaper, we propose an emotion-based crowd simulation model integrating physical\nstrength consumption. Inspired by the theory of \"the devoted actor,\" the\nmovements of each individual in our model are determined by modeling the\ninfluence of physical strength consumption and the emotion of panic. In\nparticular, human physical strength consumption is computed using a\nphysics-based numerical method. Inspired by the James-Lange theory, panic\nlevels are estimated by means of an enhanced emotional contagion model that\nleverages the inherent relationship between physical strength consumption and\npanic. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first method integrating\nphysical strength consumption into an emotion-based crowd simulation model by\nexploiting the relationship between physical strength consumption and emotion.\nWe highlight the performance on different scenarios and compare the resulting\nbehaviors with real-world video sequences.

Traditional examples of this include social network spam, but\nan important new concern is the propagation of fake news through social media.\nA common approach for mitigating this problem is by using standard statistical\nclassification to distinguish malicious (e.g., fake news) instances from benign\n(e.g., actual news stories). However, such an approach ignores the fact that\nmalicious instances propagate through the network, which is consequential both\nin quantifying consequences (e.g., fake news diffusing through the network),\nand capturing detection redundancy (bad content can be detected at different\nnodes). An additional concern is evasion attacks, whereby the generators of\nmalicious instances modify the nature of these to escape detection. We model\nthis problem as a Stackelberg game between the defender who is choosing\nparameters of the detection model, and an attacker, who is choosing both the\nnode at which to initiate malicious spread, and the nature of malicious\nentities. We develop a novel bi-level programming approach for this problem, as\nwell as a novel solution approach based on implicit function gradients, and\nexperimentally demonstrate the advantage of our approach over alternatives\nwhich ignore network structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jan 2018 19:38:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Sixie", ""], ["Vorobeychik", "Yevgeniy", ""], ["Alfeld", "Scott", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.09535", "submitter": "Dominik Harz", "authors": "Dominik Harz and Magnus Boman", "title": "The Scalability of Trustless Trust", "comments": "16 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Permission-less blockchains can realise trustless trust, albeit at the cost\nof limiting the complexity of computation tasks.

A critical insight of our\nframework is to separate the descriptive complexity of the voting rule R from\nthe number of types of people. This allows us to finally settle the\ncomputational complexity of R-Swap Bribery, one of the most fundamental\nmanipulation problems. In particular, we prove that R-Swap Bribery is\nfixed-parameter tractable when R is Dodgson's rule and Young's rule, when\nparameterized by the number of candidates. This way, we resolve a long-standing\nopen question from 2007 which was explicitly asked by Faliszewski et al. [JAIR\n40, 2011].\n  Our algorithms reveal that the true hardness of bribery problems often stems\nfrom the complexity of the voting rules. On one hand, we give a fixed-parameter\nalgorithm parameterized by number of types of people for complex voting rules.\nThus, we reveal that R-Swap Bribery with Dodgson's rule is much harder than\nwith Condorcet's rule, which can be expressed by a conjunction of linear\ninequalities, while Dodson's rule requires quantifier alternation and a bounded\nnumber of disjunctions of linear systems. On the other hand, we give an\nalgorithm for quantifier-free voting rules which is parameterized only by the\nnumber of conjunctions of the voting rule and runs in time polynomial in the\nnumber of types of people. This way, our framework explains why Shift Bribery\nis polynomial-time solvable for the plurality voting rule, making explicit that\nthe rule is simple in that it can be expressed with a single linear inequality,\nand that the number of voter types is polynomial.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Knop", "Du\u0161an", ""], ["Kouteck\u00fd", "Martin", ""], ["Mnich", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10000", "submitter": "Mingliang Xu", "authors": "Mingliang Xu, Xiaozheng Xie, Pei Lv, Jiangwei Niu, Hua Wang, Chaochao\n  Li, Ruijie Zhu, Zhigang Deng and Bing Zhou", "title": "Crowd Behavior Simulation with Emotional Contagion in Unexpected\n  Multi-hazard Situations", "comments": "Already accepted by IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and\n  Cybernetics 2019, 15 pages and 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the\ngeneration and contagion of panic emotion under multi-hazard circumstances.\nSpecifically, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and\npersistent, concurrent and non-concurrent, static and dynamic ) based on their\ninherent characteristics.
