Specifically, we consider situations where the robot communication\ncapabilities are not sufficient to form reliable and connected networks while\nthe robots move to accomplish their tasks. In this case, intermittent\ncommunication protocols are necessary that allow the robots to temporarily\ndisconnect from the network in order to accomplish their tasks free of\ncommunication constraints.

One of the crucial resources in\nknowledge economy is time. The ability to force others to adapt to our schedule\neven if it harms their efficiency can be seen as an outcome of social\nstratification. The principal objective of this paper is to use time allocation\nto model and study the global efficiency of social stratification, and to\nreveal whether hierarchy is an emergent property. A multi-agent model with an\nevolving social network is used to verify our hypotheses. The network's\nevolution is driven by the intensity of inter-agent communications, and the\ncommunications as such depend on the preferences and time resources of the\ncommunicating agents. The entire system is to be perceived as a metaphor of a\nsocial network of people regularly filling out agenda for their meetings for a\nperiod of time. The overall efficiency of the network of those scheduling\nagents is measured by the average utilization of the agent's preferences to\nspeak on specific subjects. The simulation results shed light on the effects of\ndifferent scheduling methods, resource availabilities, and network evolution\nmechanisms on communication system efficiency. The non-stratified systems show\nbetter long-term efficiency. Moreover, in the long term hierarchy disappears in\noverwhelming majority of cases.

However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle\ncomplex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from\nthe sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate\nof accidents in these settings prove that they constitute difficult driving\nsituations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of\nimportant traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this article, we\npropose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles\nin such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining\ncompatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised\ncoordination scheme that overrides control inputs from human drivers when they\nwould result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary\nintervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs\nwhen collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe overriding\ncontrols are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally\nrequested by the drivers. Simulation results based on a realistic physics\nsimulator show that our approach is scalable to real-world scenarios, and\ncomputations can be performed in real-time on a standard computer for up to a\ndozen simultaneous vehicles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Jun 2017 07:35:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Altche", "Florent", ""], ["Qian", "Xiangjun", ""], ["de La Fortelle", "Arnaud", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.08501", "submitter": "Luke Miles", "authors": "Luke Harold Miles", "title": "A Simulator for Hedonic Games", "comments": "Will be presented at the 2017 Algorithmic Decision Theory Doctoral\n  Consortium. 6 pages and 4 pictures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Hedonic games are meant to model how coalitions of people form and break\napart in the real world.

The\nmain purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a\nset of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of\n\"rational trust modeling\" is introduced by bridging trust management and game\ntheory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory\n(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been\nutilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty\nof our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust\nmodel assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are\nrational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy\nbased on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are\nincentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of\ntrust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and\nsolution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be\nbuilt-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of\nrational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will\nresult in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model\ncan incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper\nparameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish\nplayers in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).\nFurthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known\nattacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict\nbehavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 17:18:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 16:53:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Nojoumian", "Mehrdad", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09932", "submitter": "Andrew Dobson", "authors": "Andrew Dobson, Kiril Solovey, Rahul Shome, Dan Halperin, Kostas E.\n  Bekris", "title": "Scalable Asymptotically-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning", "comments": "8 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the first International Symposium\n  on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems (MRS)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Finding asymptotically-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning problems\ncould be achieved, in principle, using sampling-based planners in the composite\nconfiguration space of all of the robots in the space.
