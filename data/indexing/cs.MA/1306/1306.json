In this paper, we enhance the capability of a MoD\nsystem by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the\nstreets to be hailed by users. A key challenge to managing the MoD system\neffectively is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and\nprediction. This paper presents a novel decentralized data fusion and active\nsensing algorithm for real-time, fine-grained mobility demand sensing and\nprediction with a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles in a MoD system. Our\nGaussian process (GP)-based decentralized data fusion algorithm can achieve a\nfine balance between predictive power and time efficiency. We theoretically\nguarantee its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a\nsophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model: The\ncomputation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be distributed among\nthe MoD vehicles, hence achieving efficient and scalable demand prediction.\nThough our decentralized active sensing strategy is devised to gather the most\ninformative demand data for demand prediction, it can achieve a dual effect of\nfleet rebalancing to service the mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on\nreal-world mobility demand data shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve a\nbetter balance between predictive accuracy and time efficiency than\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jun 2013 14:05:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jie", ""], ["Low", "Kian Hsiang", ""], ["Tan", "Colin Keng-Yan", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1849", "submitter": "Nicolas Maudet", "authors": "J\\'er\\^ome Lang, Nicolas Maudet, Maria Polukarov, Alice Cohen-Hadria", "title": "New Results on Equilibria in Strategic Candidacy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a voting setting where candidates have preferences about the\noutcome of the election and are free to join or leave the election. The\ncorresponding candidacy game, where candidates choose strategically to\nparticipate or not, has been studied %initially by Dutta et al., who showed\nthat no non-dictatorial voting procedure satisfying unanimity is\ncandidacy-strategyproof, that is, is such that the joint action where all\ncandidates enter the election is always a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Dutta\net al. also showed that for some voting tree procedures, there are candidacy\ngames with no pure Nash equilibria, and that for the rule that outputs the\nsophisticated winner of voting by successive elimination, all games have a pure\nNash equilibrium. No results were known about other voting rules. Here we prove\nseveral such results. For four candidates, the message is, roughly, that most\nscoring rules (with the exception of Borda) do not guarantee the existence of a\npure Nash equilibrium but that Condorcet-consistent rules, for an odd number of\nvoters, do. For five candidates, most rules we study no longer have this\nguarantee. Finally, we identify one prominent rule that guarantees the\nexistence of a pure Nash equilibrium for any number of candidates (and for an\nodd number of voters): the Copeland rule. We also show that under mild\nassumptions on the voting rule, the existence of strong equilibria cannot be\nguaranteed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 21:49:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:01:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lang", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["Maudet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Polukarov", "Maria", ""], ["Cohen-Hadria", "Alice", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1881", "submitter": "Cm Pintea", "authors": "Camelia-M.

It\nis well known that, without additional assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if\nthe entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent memory) even if the system\nis semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous is\npossible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed\nwith O(1) bits of persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and\ncan remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.\nThis setting is overly powerful.\n  In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by\nmaintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the communication\ncapabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the\nability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of\nan agent to remember its previous activities. We call the former setting\nfinite-state (FState) and the latter finite-communication (FComm). Note that,\neven though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of\npersistent memory of a robot is constant.\n  We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings. We model\nboth settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights: in FState, a\nrobot can only see its own light, while in FComm a robot can only see the other\nrobot's light. We prove, among other things, that finite-state robots can\nrendezvous in SSynch, and that finite-communication robots are able to\nrendezvous even in ASynch. All proofs are constructive: in each setting, we\npresent a protocol that allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2013 20:34:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Flocchini", "Paola", ""], ["Santoro", "Nicola", ""], ["Viglietta", "Giovanni", ""], ["Yamashita", "Masafumi", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.3134", "submitter": "Steffen Eger", "authors": "Steffen Eger", "title": "Opinion dynamics and wisdom under out-group discrimination", "comments": "Further slight/minor ameliorations throughout.
