Our algorithm\nplans tours for the UGVs as well as determines best locations to place\nstationary charging stations. While the problems we study are NP-Hard, we\npresent a practical solution using Generalized TSP that finds the optimal\nsolution.

The\nmeasure, complete local integration (CLI), is formally investigated in general\nBayesian networks. It is based on the specific local integration (SLI) which is\nmeasured with respect to a partition. CLI is the minimum value of SLI over all\npartitions. We prove that $\\iota$-entities are blocks in specific partitions of\nthe global trajectory. These partitions are the finest partitions that achieve\na given SLI value. We also establish the transformation behaviour of SLI under\npermutations of nodes in the network.\n  We go on to present three conditions on general definitions of entities.\nThese are not fulfilled by sets of random variables i.e.\\ the perception-action\nloop, which is often used to model agents, is too restrictive.

Option prices are calculated using an analytical formula\nwhose main inputs are strike (at which price to exercise) and volatility. The\nBS framework assumes that volatility remains constant across all strikes,\nhowever, in practice it varies. How do traders come to learn these parameters?\nWe introduce natural models of learning agents, in which they update their\nbeliefs about the true implied volatility based on the opinions of other\ntraders. We prove convergence of these opinion dynamics using techniques from\ncontrol theory and leader-follower models, thus providing a resolution between\ntheory and market practices. We allow for two different models, one with\nfeedback and one with an unknown leader.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 09:13:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 May 2017 14:43:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2020 03:41:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 11 Jul 2020 02:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Vaidya", "Tushar", ""], ["Murguia", "Carlos", ""], ["Piliouras", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07767", "submitter": "Andrea Baronchelli", "authors": "Andrea Baronchelli", "title": "The Emergence of Consensus: A Primer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Royal Society Open Science 5, 172189 (2018)", "doi": "10.1098/rsos.172189", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech cs.MA cs.SI q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The origin of population-scale coordination has puzzled philosophers and\nscientists for centuries. Recently, game theory, evolutionary approaches and\ncomplex systems science have provided quantitative insights on the mechanisms\nof social consensus. However, the literature is vast and widely scattered\nacross fields, making it hard for the single researcher to navigate it. This\nshort review aims to provide a compact overview of the main dimensions over\nwhich the debate has unfolded and to discuss some representative examples. It\nfocuses on those situations in which consensus emerges 'spontaneously' in\nabsence of centralised institutions and covers topic that include the\nmacroscopic consequences of the different microscopic rules of behavioural\ncontagion, the role of social networks, and the mechanisms that prevent the\nformation of a consensus or alter it after it has emerged. Special attention is\ndevoted to the recent wave of experiments on the emergence of consensus in\nsocial systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 16:17:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Dec 2017 16:17:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:00:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Baronchelli", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07883", "submitter": "Eric Goubault", "authors": "Eric Goubault and Sergio Rajsbaum", "title": "Models of fault-tolerant distributed computation via dynamic epistemic\n  logic", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1703.11005", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.LO cs.MA math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The computability power of a distributed computing model is determined by the\ncommunication media available to the processes, the timing assumptions about\nprocesses and communication, and the nature of failures that processes can\nsuffer.
