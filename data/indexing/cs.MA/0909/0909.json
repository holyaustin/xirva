So, this\nwork is concerned with the creation, investigation, and optimisation of Digital\nEcosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems.\nFirst, we created the Digital Ecosystem, a novel optimisation technique\ninspired by biological ecosystems, where the optimisation works at two levels:\na first optimisation, migration of agents which are distributed in a\ndecentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this\nprocess feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that\noperates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy\nlocally relevant constraints. We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted\nmigration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent\noptimisation of the agent migration patterns. Overall, we have advanced the\nunderstanding of creating Digital Ecosystems, the self-organisation that occurs\nwithin them, and the optimisation of their Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 15:07:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 16:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Briscoe", "Gerard", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3475", "submitter": "Yilun Shang", "authors": "Yilun Shang", "title": "Multi-agent Coordination in Directed Moving Neighborhood Random Networks", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": "Chinese physics b, 2010", "doi": "10.1088/1674-1056/19/7/070201", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of dynamical multiple agents\nthat communicate via a directed moving neighborhood random network.

In\naddition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated.\nFor example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions\nbeing compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to\ndetermine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences\nmay be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is\ncomputationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may\nwin, whatever the agenda.

These results hold even if the agenda\nmust be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of\nmajority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference\nelicitation.
