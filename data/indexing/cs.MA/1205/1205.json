The paper investigates a distributed\nreinforcement learning setup with no prior information on the global state\ntransition and local agent cost statistics. Specifically, with the agents'\nobjective consisting of minimizing a network-averaged infinite horizon\ndiscounted cost, the paper proposes a distributed version of $Q$-learning,\n$\\mathcal{QD}$-learning, in which the network agents collaborate by means of\nlocal processing and mutual information exchange over a sparse (possibly\nstochastic) communication network to achieve the network goal. Under the\nassumption that each agent is only aware of its local online cost data and the\ninter-agent communication network is \\emph{weakly} connected, the proposed\ndistributed scheme is almost surely (a.s.) shown to yield asymptotically the\ndesired value function and the optimal stationary control policy at each\nnetwork agent. The analytical techniques developed in the paper to address the\nmixed time-scale stochastic dynamics of the \\emph{consensus + innovations}\nform, which arise as a result of the proposed interactive distributed scheme,\nare of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 22:48:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 01:59:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jose' M.

Not only\nmicro-simulation and agent-based model such as UrbanSim, ILUMAS and SIMFIRMS,\nbut also Simon's model of hierarchical concentration have widely applied, for\nthis purpose. These models, however, have limitations with respect to\nsimulating structural changes in spatial economic systems and the impact of\nproximity. The present paper proposes a model of firm development that is based\non behavioural rules such as growth, closure, spin-off and relocation. An\nimportant aspect of the model is that locational preferences of firms are based\non agglomeration advantages, accessibility of markets and congestion, allowing\nfor a proper description of concentration and deconcentration tendencies. By\ncomparing the outcomes of the proposed model with real world data, we will\ncalibrate the parameters and assess how well the model predicts existing\nspatial configurations and decide. The model is implemented as an agent-based\nsimulation model describing firm development in the Netherlands in 21\nindustrial sectors from 1950 to 2004.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 08:47:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jung-Hun", ""], ["Ettema", "Dick", ""], ["Frenken", "Koen", ""], ["Van Oort", "Frank", ""], ["Visser", "Evert-Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0561", "submitter": "Gildas Morvan", "authors": "Gildas Morvan", "title": "Multi-level agent-based modeling - A literature survey", "comments": "v2.
