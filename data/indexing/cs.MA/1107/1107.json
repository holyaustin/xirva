Much of the\ngroundbreaking work in this area draws on notable results from game theory, in\nparticular, the concept of Nash equilibria. Learners that directly learn an\nequilibrium obviously rely on their existence. Learners that instead seek to\nplay optimally with respect to the other players also depend upon equilibria\nsince equilibria are fixed points for learning. From another perspective,\nagents with limitations are real and common. These may be undesired physical\nlimitations as well as self-imposed rational limitations, such as abstraction\nand approximation techniques, used to make learning tractable. This article\nexplores the interactions of these two important concepts: equilibria and\nlimitations in learning. We introduce the question of whether equilibria\ncontinue to exist when agents have limitations. We look at the general effects\nlimitations can have on agent behavior, and define a natural extension of\nequilibria that accounts for these limitations. Using this formalization, we\nmake three major contributions: (i) a counterexample for the general existence\nof equilibria with limitations, (ii) sufficient conditions on limitations that\npreserve their existence, (iii) three general classes of games and limitations\nthat satisfy these conditions. We then present empirical results from a\nspecific multiagent learning algorithm applied to a specific instance of\nlimited agents. These results demonstrate that learning with limitations is\nfeasible, when the conditions outlined by our theoretical analysis hold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:35:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bowling", "M.", ""], ["Veloso", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.2004", "submitter": "Tobias Kretz", "authors": "Tobias Kretz, Andree Grosse, Stefan Hengst, Lukas Kautzsch, Andrej\n  Pohlmann, Peter Vortisch", "title": "Quickest Paths in Simulations of Pedestrians", "comments": "revised version submitted", "journal-ref": "Advances in Complex Systems 14(5) pp. 733-759 (2011)", "doi": "10.1142/S0219525911003281", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This contribution proposes a method to make agents in a microscopic\nsimulation of pedestrian traffic walk approximately along a path of estimated\nminimal remaining travel time to their destination.
