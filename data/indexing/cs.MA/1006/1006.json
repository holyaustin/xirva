Since\nthere is currently no agreed-upon standard way to specify such models it is not\nalways easy to use published models. Also, since model descriptions are not\nusually given in mathematical terms, it is difficult to bring mathematical\nanalysis tools to bear, so that models are typically studied through\nsimulation. In order to address this issue, Grimm et al. proposed a protocol\nfor model specification, the so-called ODD protocol, which provides a standard\nway to describe models. This paper proposes an addition to the ODD protocol\nwhich allows the description of an agent-based model as a dynamical system,\nwhich provides access to computational and theoretical tools for its analysis.\nThe mathematical framework is that of algebraic models, that is, time-discrete\ndynamical systems with algebraic structure. It is shown by way of several\nexamples how this mathematical specification can help with model analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 14:39:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Jul 2010 02:29:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Jul 2010 00:46:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 28 Aug 2010 17:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 16:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hinkelmann", "Franziska", ""], ["Murrugarra", "David", ""], ["Jarrah", "Abdul Salam", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0741", "submitter": "Pavel Chebotarev", "authors": "P.Yu.

The underlying concept of coordination among nodes\nin a cooperative MANET has induced in them a vulnerability to attacks due to\nissues like lack of fixed infrastructure, dynamically changing network\ntopology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management\npoint, and lack of a clear line of defense. We propose a semi-distributed\napproach towards Reputation Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that\ncombines with the DSR routing protocol for strengthening the defense of a\nMANET. Our system inherits the features of reputation from human behavior,\nhence making the IDS socially inspired. It has a semi-distributed architecture\nas the critical observation results of the system are neither spread globally\nnor restricted locally. The system assigns maximum weightage to self\nobservation by nodes for updating any reputation values, thus avoiding the need\nof a trust relationship between nodes. Our system is also unique in the sense\nthat it features the concepts of Redemption and Fading with a robust Path\nManager and Monitor system. Simulation studies show that DSR fortified with our\nsystem outperforms normal DSR in terms of the packet delivery ratio and routing\noverhead even when up to half of nodes in the network behave as malicious.\nVarious parameters introduced such as timing window size, reputation update\nvalues, congestion parameter and other thresholds have been optimized over\nseveral simulation test runs of the system.
