This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g.,\nglucose) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to\nflee from poisons. Based on self-organized computational approaches and similar\nstigmergic concepts we derive a novel swarm intelligent algorithm. What strikes\nfrom these observations is that both eusocial insects as ant colonies and\nbacteria have similar natural mechanisms based on stigmergy in order to emerge\ncoherent and sophisticated patterns of global collective behaviour. Keeping in\nmind the above characteristics we will present a simple model to tackle the\ncollective adaptation of a social swarm based on real ant colony behaviors (SSA\nalgorithm) for tracking extrema in dynamic environments and highly multimodal\ncomplex functions described in the well-know De Jong test suite. Later, for the\npurpose of comparison, a recent model of artificial bacterial foraging (BFOA\nalgorithm) based on similar stigmergic features is described and analyzed.\nFinal results indicate that the SSA collective intelligence is able to cope and\nquickly adapt to unforeseen situations even when over the same cooperative\nforaging period, the community is requested to deal with two different and\ncontradictory purposes, while outperforming BFOA in adaptive speed. Results\nindicate that the present approach deals well in severe Dynamic Optimization\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2007 15:02:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ramos", "Vitorino", ""], ["Fernandes", "C.

To achieve consensus,\ndither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When\nthe quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),\nstochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with\nprobability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that\nthe meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link\nweight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm. To study\ndithered consensus with random links when the range of the quantizer is\nbounded, we establish uniform boundedness of the sample paths of the unbounded\nquantizer. This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the\nsupremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is\naccomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:\none along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to\nthe consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale\nand supermartingale sequences. From these, we derive probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the two subsequences, from which probability bounds on the\nexcursions of the quantizer state vector follow. The paper shows how to use\nthese probability bounds to design the quantizer parameters and to explore\ntradeoffs among the number of quantizer levels, the size of the quantization\nsteps, the desired probability of saturation, and the desired level of accuracy\n$\\epsilon$ away from consensus. Finally, the paper illustrates the quantizer\ndesign with a numerical study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2007 21:38:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2009 20:11:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 18:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jose M.

Ecosystems are\nthought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve\ncomplex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to\nthese properties have not been made explicit in Digital Ecosystems research.\nHere, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organising\nfeatures of biological ecosystems, including population dynamics, evolution, a\ncomplex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions for generating local\ninteractions. The potential for exploiting these properties in artificial\nsystems is then considered. We suggest that several key features of biological\necosystems have not been fully explored in existing digital ecosystems, and\ndiscuss how mimicking these features may assist in developing robust, scalable\nself-organising architectures. An example architecture, the Digital Ecosystem,\nis considered in detail. The Digital Ecosystem is then measured experimentally\nthrough simulations, with measures originating from theoretical ecology, to\nconfirm its likeness to a biological ecosystem.
