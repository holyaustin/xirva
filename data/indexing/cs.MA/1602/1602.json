The proposed classification suggests several future perspectives for\nDCOP extensions, and identifies challenges in the design of efficient\nresolution algorithms, possibly through the adaptation of strategies from\ndifferent areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 00:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 14:59:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 May 2017 03:00:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Jan 2018 02:26:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Fioretto", "Ferdinando", ""], ["Pontelli", "Enrico", ""], ["Yeoh", "William", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06460", "submitter": "Garima Agrawal", "authors": "Garima Agrawal and Kamalakar Karlapalem", "title": "Wheeled Robots playing Chain Catch: Strategies and Evaluation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Robots playing games that humans are adept in is a challenge. We studied\nrobotic agents playing Chain Catch game as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Our game\nstarts with a traditional Catch game similar to Pursuit evasion, and further\nextends it to form a growing chain of predator agents to chase remaining preys.\nHence Chain Catch is a combination of two challenges - pursuit domain and\nrobotic chain formation. These are games that require team of robotic agents to\ncooperate among themselves and to compete with other group of agents through\nquick decision making. In this paper, we present a Chain Catch simulator that\nallows us to incorporate game rules, design strategies and simulate the game\nplay. We developed cost model driven strategies for each of Escapee, Catcher\nand Chain. Our results show that Sliding slope strategy is the best strategy\nfor Escapees whereas Tagging method is the best method for chain s movement in\nChain Catch. We also use production quality robots to implement the game play\nin a physical environment and analyze game strategies on real robots. Our real\nrobots implementation in different scenarios shows that game strategies work as\nexpected and a complete chain formation takes place successfully in each game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 21:07:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Agrawal", "Garima", ""], ["Karlapalem", "Kamalakar", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06731", "submitter": "Natasha Alechina", "authors": "Natasha Alechina, Joseph Y.

The cost of providing the\nincentives is not borne by the MAS and does not come from fines charged for\nnorm violations (fines may be impossible to levy in a system where agents are\nfree to leave and rejoin again under a different identity). Instead, monitoring\nincentives come from (scrip) fees for accessing the services provided by the\nMAS. In some cases, perfect monitoring (and hence enforcement) can be achieved:\nno norms will be violated in equilibrium. In other cases, we show that, while\nit is impossible to achieve perfect enforcement, we can get arbitrarily close;\nwe can make the probability of a norm violation in equilibrium arbitrarily\nsmall. We show using simulations that our theoretical results hold for\nmulti-agent systems with as few as 1000 agents---the system rapidly converges\nto the steady-state distribution of scrip tokens necessary to ensure monitoring\nand then remains close to the steady state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 11:23:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Alechina", "Natasha", ""], ["Halpern", "Joseph Y.", ""], ["Kash", "Ian A.", ""], ["Logan", "Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06737", "submitter": "Stefano Bennati", "authors": "Stefano Bennati", "title": "On the Role of Collective Sensing and Evolution in Group Formation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11721-018-0156-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collective sensing is an emergent phenomenon which enables individuals to\nestimate a hidden property of the environment through the observation of social\ninteractions. Previous work on collective sensing shows that gregarious\nindividuals obtain an evolutionary advantage by exploiting collective sensing\nwhen competing against solitary individuals. This work addresses the question\nof whether collective sensing allows for the emergence of groups from a\npopulation of individuals without predetermined behaviors. It is assumed that\ngroup membership does not lessen competition on the limited resources in the\nenvironment, e.g. groups do not improve foraging efficiency. Experiments are\nrun in an agent-based evolutionary model of a foraging task, where the fitness\nof the agents depends on their foraging strategy. The foraging strategy of\nagents is determined by a neural network, which does not require explicit\nmodeling of the environment and of the interactions between agents. Experiments\ndemonstrate that gregarious behavior is not the evolutionary-fittest strategy\nif resources are abundant, thus invalidating previous findings in a specific\nregion of the parameter space. In other words, resource scarcity makes\ngregarious behavior so valuable as to make up for the increased competition\nover the few available resources. Furthermore, it is shown that a population of\nsolitary agents can evolve gregarious behavior in response to a sudden scarcity\nof resources, thus individuating a possible mechanism that leads to gregarious\nbehavior in nature. The evolutionary process operates on the whole parameter\nspace of the neural networks, hence these behaviors are selected among an\nunconstrained set of behavioral models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 11:33:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:20:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:23:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bennati", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07024", "submitter": "Sailik Sengupta", "authors": "Sailik Sengupta, Satya Gautam Vadlamudi, Subbarao Kambhampati,\n  Marthony Taguinod, Adam Doup\\'e, Ziming Zhao, Gail-Joon Ahn", "title": "Moving Target Defense for Web Applications using Bayesian Stackelberg\n  Games", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present complexity in designing web applications makes software security\na difficult goal to achieve.

Moving Target Defense (MTD) in web\napplications is an effective mechanism to nullify this advantage of their\nreconnaissance but the framework demands a good switching strategy when\nswitching between multiple configurations for its web-stack. To address this\nissue, we propose modeling of a real-world MTD web application as a repeated\nBayesian game. We then formulate an optimization problem that generates an\neffective switching strategy while considering the cost of switching between\ndifferent web-stack configurations. To incorporate this model into a developed\nMTD system, we develop an automated system for generating attack sets of Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for input attacker types with predefined\ncapabilities. Our framework obtains realistic reward values for the players\n(defenders and attackers) in this game by using security domain expertise on\nCVEs obtained from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). We also address\nthe issue of prioritizing vulnerabilities that when fixed, improves the\nsecurity of the MTD system. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our\nproposed model by evaluating its performance when there is uncertainty about\ninput attacker information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 03:44:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:20:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 01:04:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sengupta", "Sailik", ""], ["Vadlamudi", "Satya Gautam", ""], ["Kambhampati", "Subbarao", ""], ["Taguinod", "Marthony", ""], ["Doup\u00e9", "Adam", ""], ["Zhao", "Ziming", ""], ["Ahn", "Gail-Joon", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08150", "submitter": "Mo Chen", "authors": "Mo Chen, Qie Hu, Jaime Fisac, Kene Akametalu, Casey Mackin, Claire\n  Tomlin", "title": "Reachability-Based Safety and Goal Satisfaction of Unmanned Aerial\n  Platoons on Air Highways", "comments": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Journal of\n  Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, January 30, 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.2514/1.G000774", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) for civilian operations. As a result, unmanned aerial systems traffic\nmanagement is needed to ensure the safety and goal satisfaction of potentially\nthousands of UAVs flying simultaneously. Currently, the analysis of large\nmulti-agent systems cannot tractably provide these guarantees if the agents'\nset of maneuvers is unrestricted. In this paper, platoons of UAVs flying on air\nhighways is proposed to impose an airspace structure that allows for tractable\nanalysis. For the air highway placement problem, the fast marching method is\nused to produce a sequence of air highways that minimizes the cost of flying\nfrom an origin to any destination. The placement of air highways can be updated\nin real-time to accommodate sudden airspace changes. Within platoons traveling\non air highways, each vehicle is modeled as a hybrid system. Using\nHamilton-Jacobi reachability, safety and goal satisfaction are guaranteed for\nall mode transitions. For a single altitude range, the proposed approach\nguarantees safety for one safety breach per vehicle, in the unlikely event of\nmultiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over multiple altitude\nranges. We demonstrate the platooning concept through simulations of three\nrepresentative scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 23:42:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:06:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 23:05:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:45:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Mo", ""], ["Hu", "Qie", ""], ["Fisac", "Jaime", ""], ["Akametalu", "Kene", ""], ["Mackin", "Casey", ""], ["Tomlin", "Claire", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.09107", "submitter": "Pavel Hrab\\'ak", "authors": "Pavel Hrab\\'ak and Ond\\v{r}ej Tich\\'a\\v{c}ek and Vladim\\'ira\n  Se\\v{c}k\\'arov\\'a", "title": "Estimation of Discretized Motion of Pedestrians by the Decision-Making\n  Model", "comments": "Conference Traffic and Granullar Flow 2015, to be published by\n  Springer", "journal-ref": "Traffic and Granular Flow '15, 2016, Springer, Cham", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-33482-0_40", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The contribution gives a micro-structural insight into the pedestrian\ndecision process during an egress situation.
