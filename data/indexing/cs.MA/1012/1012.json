While cloud management is centralized, the information\nresides in the cloud and information sharing can be implemented via\noff-the-shelf techniques for multiuser databases. Users, however, are very\ndiffident for not having full control over their sensitive data. Untrusted\ndatabase-as-a-server techniques are neither readily extendable to the cloud\nenvironment nor easily understandable by non-technical users. To solve this\nproblem, we present an approach where agents share reserved data in a secure\nmanner by the use of simple grant-and-revoke permissions on shared data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Dec 2010 15:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Damiani", "Ernesto", ""], ["Pagano", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1547", "submitter": "Martin Hoefer", "authors": "Martin Hoefer, Michal Penn, Maria Polukarov, Alexander Skopalik,\n  Berhold V\\\"ocking", "title": "Considerate Equilibrium", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DS cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the existence and computational complexity of coalitional\nstability concepts based on social networks. Our concepts represent a natural\nand rich combinatorial generalization of a recent approach termed partition\nequilibrium. We assume that players in a strategic game are embedded in a\nsocial network, and there are coordination constraints that restrict the\npotential coalitions that can jointly deviate in the game to the set of cliques\nin the social network. In addition, players act in a \"considerate\" fashion to\nignore potentially profitable (group) deviations if the change in their\nstrategy may cause a decrease of utility to their neighbors.\n  We study the properties of such considerate equilibria in application to the\nclass of resource selection games (RSG). Our main result proves existence of a\nconsiderate equilibrium in all symmetric RSG with strictly increasing delays,\nfor any social network among the players. The existence proof is constructive\nand yields an efficient algorithm. In fact, the computed considerate\nequilibrium is a Nash equilibrium for the standard RSG showing that there\nexists a state that is stable against selfish and considerate behavior\nsimultaneously. In addition, we show results on convergence of considerate\ndynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 16:44:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hoefer", "Martin", ""], ["Penn", "Michal", ""], ["Polukarov", "Maria", ""], ["Skopalik", "Alexander", ""], ["V\u00f6cking", "Berhold", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1651", "submitter": "Adrian Paschke", "authors": "Adrian Paschke, Zhili Zhao", "title": "The Rule Responder eScience Infrastructure", "comments": "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
