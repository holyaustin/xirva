Beneficial contagions,\nsuch as viruses that enhance host survival or technological innovations that\nimprove quality of life, also have the potential to spread epidemically. How do\nthe dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics differ from those of\ndetrimental epidemics? We investigate this question using three theoretical\napproaches. First, in the context of population genetics, we show that a\nhorizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness, such as viral DNA,\nspreads superexponentially through a population, more quickly than a beneficial\nmutation. Second, in the context of behavioral epidemiology, we show that\ninfections that cause increased connectivity lead to superexponential fixation\nin the population. Third, in the context of dynamic social networks, we find\nthat preferences for increased global infection accelerate spread and produce\nsuperexponential fixation, but preferences for local assortativity halt\nepidemics by disconnecting the infected from the susceptible. We conclude that\nthe dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics are characterized by\nthe rapid spread of beneficial elements, which is facilitated in biological\nsystems by horizontal transmission and in social systems by active spreading\nbehavior of infected individuals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 18:13:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:40:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Berdahl", "Andrew", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Brelsford", "Christa", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["De Bacco", "Caterina", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Dumas", "Marion", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Ferdinand", "Vanessa", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Grochow", "Joshua A.", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["H\u00e9bert-Dufresne", "Laurent", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Kallus", "Yoav", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Kempes", "Christopher P.", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Kolchinsky", "Artemy", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Larremore", "Daniel B.", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Libby", "Eric", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Power", "Eleanor A.", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Stern", "Caitlin A.", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"], ["Tracey", "Brendan", "", "Santa Fe Institute\n  Postdocs"]]}, {"id": "1604.02704", "submitter": "Javier Enciso", "authors": "Javier Enciso, Juan Vargas and Pablo Mart\\'inez", "title": "Modeling and Simulation of Passenger Traffic in a National Airport", "comments": "8 pages, submitted to LACCEI 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.18687/laccei2016.1.1.217", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Optimal operation of a country's air transport infrastructure plays a major\nrole in the economic development of nations.

In most\nreal-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate\nknowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation\nwith incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial\norder for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.\nIn this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of\nmanipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We say that\nan extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative vote for that\nextension.\n  1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes\ntheir preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of\nthe non-manipulators.\n  2.

Strong Manipulation (SM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that\nmakes their preferred candidate win in every extension of the partial votes of\nthe non-manipulators.\n  We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems\nare easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator).

We extend this line of research and study preference\nelicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset\nof the domain of single peaked preferences.

In this\npaper, we consider the domain of single crossing preference profiles and study\nthe query complexity of preference elicitation under various settings. We\nconsider two distinct situations: when an ordering of the voters with respect\nto which the profile is single crossing is known versus when it is unknown. We\nalso consider different access models: when the votes can be accessed at\nrandom, as opposed to when they are coming in a pre-defined sequence. In the\nsequential access model, we distinguish two cases when the ordering is known:\nthe first is that sequence in which the votes appear is also a single-crossing\norder, versus when it is not.\n  The main contribution of our work is to provide polynomial time algorithms\nwith low query complexity for preference elicitation in all the above six\ncases. Further, we show that the query complexities of our algorithms are\noptimal up to constant factors for all but one of the above six cases. We then\npresent preference elicitation algorithms for profiles which are close to being\nsingle crossing under various notions of closeness, for example, single\ncrossing width, minimum number of candidates | voters whose deletion makes a\nprofile single crossing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 08:47:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Palash", ""], ["Misra", "Neeldhara", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05243", "submitter": "Yun Kuen Cheung", "authors": "Yun Kuen Cheung", "title": "Better Strategyproof Mechanisms without Payments or Prior --- An\n  Analytic Approach", "comments": "14 pages.
