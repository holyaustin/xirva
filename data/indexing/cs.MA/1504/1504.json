Inspired by the model of\ninterpersonal synergy, we critically investigate the presence, temporal\ndevelopment, possible mechanisms and impact of shared interpersonal heart rate\ndynamics during individual and collective creative LEGO construction tasks. In\nStudy 1 we show how shared HR dynamics are driven by a plurality of sources\nincluding task constraints and behavioral coordination. Generally, shared HR\ndynamics are more prevalent in individual trials (involving participants doing\nthe same things) than in collective ones (involving participants taking turns\nand performing complementary actions). However, when contrasted against virtual\npairs, collective trials display more stable shared HR dynamics suggesting that\nonline social interaction plays an important role. Furthermore, in contrast to\nindividual trials, shared HR dynamics are found to increase across collective\ntrials. Study 2 investigates which aspects of social interaction might drive\nthese effects. We show that shared HR dynamics are statistically predicted by\ninterpersonal speech and building coordination. In Study 3, we explore the\nrelation between HR dynamics, behavioral coordination, and self-reported\nmeasures of rapport and group competence. While behavioral coordination\npredicts rapport and group competence, shared HR dynamics do not. Although\nshared physiological dynamics were reliably observed in our study, our results\nwarrant not to consider HR dynamics a general driving mechanism of social\ncoordination. Behavioral coordination - on the other hand - seems to be more\ninformative of both shared physiological dynamics and collective experience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:06:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 09:16:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 12:06:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Fusaroli", "Riccardo", ""], ["Bj\u00f8rndahl", "Johanne S.", ""], ["Roepstorff", "Andreas", ""], ["Tyl\u00e9n", "Kristian", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.06075", "submitter": "Ivo Herman", "authors": "Ivo Herman, Dan Martinec, J.

However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent\ncomputational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to\ncapture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber\nis frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a\ncertain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the\ngoal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only\nvulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes\nhave prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by\nchanging only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber.\nWe further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem\nnamely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery\nwhere the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or\ndifferent.\n  We study the computational complexity of the above problems for unweighted\nand weighted elections for several commonly used voting rules.
