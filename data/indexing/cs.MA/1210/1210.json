We\napply Approximate Policy Iteration (API) algorithms to derive potent attack\npolicies. We evaluate their performance on a number of systems and compare them\nto other attack policies including random, myopic and DoS attack policies. The\ngenerated policies, albeit suboptimal, are shown to significantly outperform\nother attack policies as they maximize the expected cumulative reward from the\nstandpoint of the attacker.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 15:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Guirguis", "Mina", ""], ["Atia", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.5936", "submitter": "Vincent Chevrier", "authors": "Benjamin Camus (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Julien Siebert (Lab-STICC),\n  Christine Bourjot (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA), Vincent Chevrier (INRIA Lorraine\n  - LORIA)", "title": "Mod\\'elisation multi-niveaux dans AA4MM", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journ\\'ees Francophones sur les Syst\\`emes Multi-Agents (2012)\n  43-52", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, we propose to represent a multi-level phenomenon as a set of\ninteracting models.

Given the structure of an autonomous linear\ndynamical system, the goal is to design the structure of the input matrix\n(commonly denoted by $B$) such that the system is structurally controllable\nwith the restriction that each input be dedicated, i.e., it can only control\ndirectly a single state variable. We provide a methodology that addresses this\ndesign question: specifically, we determine the minimum number of dedicated\ninputs required to ensure such structural controllability, and characterize,\nand characterizes all (when not unique) possible configurations of the\n\\emph{minimal} input matrix $B$. Furthermore, we show that the proposed\nsolution methodology incurs \\emph{polynomial complexity} in the number of state\nvariables. By duality, the solution methodology may be readily extended to the\nstructural design of the corresponding minimal output matrix (commonly denoted\nby $C$) that ensures structural observability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 01:49:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Pequito", "Sergio", ""], ["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Aguiar", "A.
