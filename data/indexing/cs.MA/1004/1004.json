Every agent is trying to maximize the\nreward from all relationships that it is involved in. We consider pairwise\nequilibria of this game, and characterize the existence, computational\ncomplexity, and quality of equilibrium based on the types of reward functions\ninvolved. For example, when all reward functions are concave, we prove that the\nprice of anarchy is at most 2. For convex functions the same only holds under\nsome special but very natural conditions. A special focus of the paper are\nminimum effort games, where the reward of a relationship depends only on the\nminimum effort of any of the participants.

In particular, we find explicit relationships between the so-called\nspectral moments of a graph and the presence of certain small subgraphs, also\ncalled motifs, in the network. Since the eigenvalues of the network have a\ndirect influence on the network dynamical behavior, our result builds a bridge\nbetween local network measurements (i.e., the presence of small subgraphs) and\nglobal dynamical behavior (via the spectral moments). Furthermore, based on our\nresult, we propose a novel decentralized scheme to compute the spectral moments\nof a network by aggregating local measurements of the network topology.
