With the agent-based model we carry out\nexperiments to validate the model and test different energy interventions that\nlocal authorities can use to facilitate energy consumers' learning and maintain\ntheir continuous use of the technology. Our results show that the easier energy\nconsumers become experienced, the more energy-efficient they are and the more\nenergy saving they can achieve; encouraging energy consumers' contacts via\nvarious informational means can facilitate their learning; and developing and\nmaintaining their positive attitude toward smart metering can enable them to\nuse the technology continuously. Contributions and energy policy/intervention\nimplications are discussed in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2016 10:57:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Tao", ""], ["Siebers", "Peer-Olaf", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.06332", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Tao Zhang, Peer-Olaf Siebers, Uwe Aickelin", "title": "Modelling Office Energy Consumption: An Agent Based Approach", "comments": "Proceedings of the 3rd World Congress on Social Simulation\n  (WCSS2010), 5-9 Sep, Kassel, Germany, 2010. arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:1305.7437", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop an agent-based model which integrates four\nimportant elements, i.e. organisational energy management policies/regulations,\nenergy management technologies, electric appliances and equipment, and human\nbehaviour, based on a case study, to simulate the energy consumption in office\nbuildings.

Done in the right way, improved\nutilization maximizes social welfare--- balancing the utility of a high value\nbut unreliable agent with the group's preference that resources be used. We\nintroduce the family of contingent payment mechanisms (CP), which may charge an\nagent contingent on use (a penalty). A CP mechanism is parameterized by a\nmaximum penalty, and has a dominant-strategy equilibrium. Under a set of\naxiomatic properties, we establish welfare-optimality for the special case\nCP(W), with CP instantiated for a maximum penalty equal to societal value W for\nutilization. CP(W) is not dominated for expected welfare by any other\nmechanism, and second, amongst mechanisms that always allocate the resource and\nhave a simple indirect structure, CP(W) strictly dominates every other\nmechanism. The special case with no upper bound on penalty, the contingent\nsecond-price mechanism, maximizes utilization. We extend the mechanisms to\nassign multiple, heterogeneous resources, and present a simulation study of the\nwelfare properties of these mechanisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 21:26:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:29:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2018 16:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Hongyao", ""], ["Meir", "Reshef", ""], ["Parkes", "David C.", ""], ["Zou", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07906", "submitter": "Krzysztof Sornat", "authors": "Marek Cygan, {\\L}ukasz Kowalik, Arkadiusz Soca{\\l}a, Krzysztof Sornat", "title": "Approximation and Parameterized Complexity of Minimax Approval Voting", "comments": "14 pages, 3 figures, 2 pseudocodes", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present three results on the complexity of Minimax Approval Voting.
