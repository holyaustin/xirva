Along a distinct line, this paper proposes\nto use Tullock contests as an alternative tool to design incentive mechanisms\nfor crowdsourcing. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to\nattracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.\nIn this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by\nsuperseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock\ncontests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's\ncontribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that\nthis approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited\nfor rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)\nit overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to\nan increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional,\nfixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to\ncompare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our\nmechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds\non the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'\nsocial welfare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 05:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "T.", ""], ["Kanhere", "S.

Thus, it motivates us to leverage the\ndistributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling\nMAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).\nTwo issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet\nincluding: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the\nnegtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which\nkind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the\nquality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with\nan ECAV-$\\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\\eta$\nwith an adequate assignment ($\\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the\nscale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed\non the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the\nsolution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the\nMax-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method\n(LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to\ntransform original problem into a satisfied one.
