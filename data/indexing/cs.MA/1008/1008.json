The network manager monitors the behavior of users and intervenes in\nthe interaction among users if necessary, while users make decisions\nindependently to optimize their individual objectives. In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework of intervention mechanism design, which is aimed to\noptimize the objective of the manager, or the network performance, taking the\nincentives of selfish users into account. Our framework is general enough to\ncover a wide range of application scenarios, and it has advantages over\nexisting approaches such as Stackelberg strategies and pricing. To design an\nintervention mechanism and to predict the resulting operating point, we\nformulate a new class of games called intervention games and a new solution\nconcept called intervention equilibrium. We provide analytic results about\nintervention equilibrium and optimal intervention mechanisms in the case of a\nbenevolent manager with perfect monitoring. We illustrate these results with a\nrandom access model. Our illustrative example suggests that intervention\nrequires less knowledge about users than pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 04:33:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Jaeok", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0212", "submitter": "Yashodhan Kanoria", "authors": "Yashodhan Kanoria", "title": "An FPTAS for Bargaining Networks with Unequal Bargaining Powers", "comments": "18 pages; Amin Saberi (Ed.): Internet and Network Economics - 6th\n  International Workshop, WINE 2010, Stanford, CA, USA, December 13-17, 2010.\n  Proceedings.", "journal-ref": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6484 Springer (2010) 282-293", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bargaining networks model social or economic situations in which agents seek\nto form the most lucrative partnership with another agent from among several\nalternatives. There has been a flurry of recent research studying Nash\nbargaining solutions (also called 'balanced outcomes') in bargaining networks,\nso that we now know when such solutions exist, and also that they can be\ncomputed efficiently, even by market agents behaving in a natural manner. In\nthis work we study a generalization of Nash bargaining, that models the\npossibility of unequal 'bargaining powers'. This generalization was introduced\nin [KB+10], where it was shown that the corresponding 'unequal division' (UD)\nsolutions exist if and only if Nash bargaining solutions exist, and also that a\ncertain local dynamics converges to UD solutions when they exist. However, the\nbound on convergence time obtained for that dynamics was exponential in network\nsize for the unequal division case. This bound is tight, in the sense that\nthere exists instances on which the dynamics of [KB+10] converges only after\nexponential time. Other approaches, such as the one of Kleinberg and Tardos, do\nnot generalize to the unsymmetrical case. Thus, the question of computational\ntractability of UD solutions has remained open. In this paper, we provide an\nFPTAS for the computation of UD solutions, when such solutions exist. On a\ngraph G=(V,E) with weights (i.e. pairwise profit opportunities) uniformly\nbounded above by 1, our FPTAS finds an \\eps-UD solution in time\npoly(|V|,1/\\eps). We also provide a fast local algorithm for finding \\eps-UD\nsolution, providing further justification that a market can find such a\nsolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 23:17:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kanoria", "Yashodhan", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0775", "submitter": "Armen Bagdasaryan", "authors": "Armen Bagdasaryan", "title": "Systems Theoretic Techniques for Modeling, Control, and Decision Support\n  in Complex Dynamic Systems", "comments": "58 pages, 24 figures, 1 table; a book chapter published by Bentham\n  Science", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.AI cs.MA math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss the problems of modeling, control, and decision support in complex\ndynamic systems from a general system theoretic point of view.
