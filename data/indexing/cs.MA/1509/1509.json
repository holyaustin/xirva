In practice,\nwhen the transformations are estimated from data, this property is lacking.\nThis work addresses the problem of synchronizing transformations that are not\ntransitively consistent. Once the transformations have been synchronized, they\nsatisfy the transitive consistency condition - a transformation from frame $A$\nto frame $C$ is equal to the composite transformation of first transforming A\nto B and then transforming B to C. The coordinate frames correspond to nodes in\na graph and the transformations correspond to edges in the same graph. Two\ndirect or centralized synchronization methods are presented for different graph\ntopologies; the first one for quasi-strongly connected graphs, and the second\none for connected graphs. As an extension of the second method, an iterative\nGauss-Newton method is presented, which is later adapted to the case of affine\nand Euclidean transformations. Two distributed synchronization methods are also\npresented for orthogonal matrices, which can be seen as distributed versions of\nthe two direct or centralized methods; they are similar in nature to standard\nconsensus protocols used for distributed averaging. When the transformations\nare orthogonal matrices, a bound on the optimality gap can be computed.\nSimulations show that the gap is almost right, even for noise large in\nmagnitude. This work also contributes on a theoretical level by providing\nlinear algebraic relationships for transitively consistent transformations. One\nof the benefits of the proposed methods is their simplicity - basic linear\nalgebraic methods are used, e.g., the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). For a\nwide range of parameter settings, the methods are numerically validated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 14:57:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Thunberg", "Johan", ""], ["Bernard", "Florian", ""], ["Goncalves", "Jorge", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00737", "submitter": "Daniel Pickem", "authors": "Daniel Pickem, Magnus Egerstedt, and Jeff S.
