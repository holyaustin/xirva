We present a mean field approach to draw relationships\nbetween road network spatial attributes, number of evacuees and resultant\nevacuation time estimate (ETE). We divide $50$ medium sized UK cities into a\ntotal of $697$ catchment areas which we define as an area where all agents\nshare the same nearest exit node. In these catchment areas, 90% of agents are\nwithin $5.4$ km of their designated exit node. We establish a characteristic\nflow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node and\nexit node width) and a mean flow rate in free-flow regime by simulating total\nevacuations using an agent based `queuing network' model. We use these\nvariables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and\nresultant ETE. This relationship could enable emergency planners to make rapid\nappraisal of evacuation strategies and help support decisions in the run up to\na crisis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 14:14:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kunwar", "Bharat", ""], ["Simini", "Filippo", ""], ["Johansson", "Anders", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03419", "submitter": "Simon DeDeo", "authors": "Simon DeDeo", "title": "Major Transitions in Political Order", "comments": "27 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "In S.I.

The influence of the\naggressiveness is studied by means of the dependence of the travel time on the\noccupancy of a room.
