A variable-gain algorithm is employed\nwhen the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a\nfully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous\nwork concerning event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is\ndirected, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be\ncentrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities which require\nlimited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics,\nbounds on network topology information and bounds on the initial conditions.\nWhen the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics which include the vector of\ngravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed which\nrequires more information about the agent dynamics but can estimate uncertain\nagent parameters.\n  For each algorithm, a trigger function is proposed to govern the event update\ntimes. At each event, the controller is updated, which ensures that the control\ninput is piecewise constant and saves energy resources.

As the expectation of intelligent systems rises, we discover many\nmore applications for artificial intelligence.

Although the field of multiagent systems (MAS)\nand distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is relatively young, the\nimportance and applicability of this technology for solving today's problems\ncontinue to grow. In multiagent systems, the main goal is to provide fruitful\ncooperation among agents in order to enrich the support given to all user\nactivities. This paper deals with the development of a multiagent system aimed\nat solving the reservation problems encountered in rural tourism. Due to their\nbenefits over the last few years, online travel agencies have become a very\nuseful instrument in planning vacations.

Hence, we are motivated to study the co-design of both\ncontrol and communication systems. In particular, we propose a control\ntheoretical framework for distributed motion planning for multi-agent systems\nwhich satisfies complex and high-level spatial and temporal specifications\nwhile accounting for communication quality at the same time. Towards this end,\ndesired motion specifications and communication performances are formulated as\nsignal temporal logic (STL) and spatial-temporal logic (SpaTeL) formulas,\nrespectively. The specifications are encoded as constraints on system and\nenvironment state variables of mixed integer linear programs (MILP), and upon\nwhich control strategies satisfying both STL and SpaTeL specifications are\ngenerated for each agent by employing a distributed model predictive control\n(MPC) framework. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by a\nsimulation of distributed communication-aware motion planning for multi-agent\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 May 2017 15:34:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Zhiyu", ""], ["Wu", "Bo", ""], ["Dai", "Jin", ""], ["Lin", "Hai", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.10369", "submitter": "Andrew Drozdov", "authors": "Katrina Evtimova, Andrew Drozdov, Douwe Kiela, Kyunghyun Cho", "title": "Emergent Communication in a Multi-Modal, Multi-Step Referential Game", "comments": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018. 12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.CV cs.IT cs.MA math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Inspired by previous work on emergent communication in referential games, we\npropose a novel multi-modal, multi-step referential game, where the sender and\nreceiver have access to distinct modalities of an object, and their information\nexchange is bidirectional and of arbitrary duration.

In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of\nthe MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In\nthe MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an\nonline setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent\nhas to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery\nlocation while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled\nMAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS).\nTheoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a\nrealistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a\ncentralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated\nwarehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD\nalgorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary\nconcern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents\nand tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well\nbetween TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 May 2017 21:08:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Hang", ""], ["Li", "Jiaoyang", ""], ["Kumar", "T.
