However, it still remains elusive on how to design these local\ninteractions among agents so as to achieve certain desired collective\nbehaviors. This paper aims to tackle this challenge and proposes a\ndivide-and-conquer approach to guarantee specified global behaviors through\nlocal coordination and control design for multi-agent systems. The basic idea\nis to decompose the requested global specification into subtasks for each\nindividual agent. It should be noted that the decomposition is not arbitrary.\nThe global specification should be decomposed in such a way that the fulfilment\nof these subtasks by each individual agent will imply the satisfaction of the\nglobal specification as a team. First, it is shown by a counterexample that not\nall specifications can be decomposed in this sense. Then, a natural follow-up\nquestion is what the necessary and sufficient condition should be for the\nproposed decomposability of a global specification. The main part of the paper\nis set to answer this question. The case of two cooperative agents is\ninvestigated first, and a necessary and sufficient condition is presented and\nproven. Later on, the result is generalized to the case of arbitrary finite\nnumber of agents, and a hierarchical algorithm is proposed, which is shown to\nbe a sufficient condition. Finally, a cooperative control scenario for a team\nof three robots is developed to illustrate the task decomposition procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 04:23:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 13:14:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 02:58:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Karimadini", "Mohammad", ""], ["Lin", "Hai", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0753", "submitter": "Pasquale  De Meo", "authors": "P.
