Such efforts lead to the emergence of language that\nallows for an efficient communication and exhibits some degree of homonymy and\nsynonymy. Although homonymy reduces the communication efficiency, it seems to\nbe a dynamical trap that persists for a long, and perhaps indefinite, time. On\nthe other hand, synonymy does not reduce the efficiency of communication, but\nappears to be only a transient feature of the language. Thus, in our model the\nrole of synonymy decreases and in the long-time limit it becomes negligible. A\nsimilar rareness of synonymy is observed in present natural languages. The role\nof noise, that distorts the communicated words, is also examined. Although, in\ngeneral, the noise reduces the communication efficiency, it also regroups the\nwords so that they are more evenly distributed within the available \"verbal\"\nspace.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Oct 2008 23:59:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 21 Nov 2009 18:15:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lipowski", "Adam", ""], ["Lipowska", "Dorota", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3474", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Vukosi N.

The training of agents in a social context instead of a\nself-play environment is investigated. Agents that use the reinforcement\nlearning algorithms are trained in social settings. This mimics the way in\nwhich players of board games such as scrabble and chess mentor each other in\ntheir clubs. A Round Robin tournament and a modified Swiss tournament setting\nare used for the training. The agents trained using social settings are\ncompared to self play agents and results indicate that more robust agents\nemerge from the social training setting. Higher state space games can benefit\nfrom such settings as diverse set of agents will have multiple strategies that\nincrease the chances of obtaining more experienced players at the end of\ntraining. The Social Learning trained agents exhibit better playing experience\nthan self play agents. The modified Swiss playing style spawns a larger number\nof better playing agents as the population size increases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2008 07:04:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Marivate", "Vukosi N.", ""], ["Marwala", "Tshilidzi", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.5484", "submitter": "Qiang Li", "authors": "Qiang Li, Yan He, Jing-ping Jiang", "title": "A Novel Clustering Algorithm Based on a Modified Model of Random Walk", "comments": "21 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a modified model of random walk, and then develop two novel\nclustering algorithms based on it. In the algorithms, each data point in a\ndataset is considered as a particle which can move at random in space according\nto the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also\nviewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its\ntransition probability vector in terms of the feedbacks of all data points, and\nthen its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function.\nFinally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space,\ndata points collect gradually and some separating parts emerge among them\nautomatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are\nlocated at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are\naway from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated\nthat data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently,\nand the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 13:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Qiang", ""], ["He", "Yan", ""], ["Jiang", "Jing-ping", ""]]}]
