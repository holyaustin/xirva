In\nself-interested multi-agent environments, the transition dynamics are mainly\ncontrolled by the other agent's stochastic behavior for which FDM's\nindependence and modeling assumptions do not hold. As a result, FDM does not\nallow the other agent's behavior to be generalized across different states nor\nspecified using prior domain knowledge. To overcome these practical limitations\nof FDM, we propose a generalization of BRL to integrate the general class of\nparametric models and model priors, thus allowing practitioners' domain\nknowledge to be exploited to produce a fine-grained and compact representation\nof the other agent's behavior. Empirical evaluation shows that our approach\noutperforms existing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Apr 2013 17:00:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 11:34:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 16 Mar 2014 15:10:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hoang", "Trong Nghia", ""], ["Low", "Kian Hsiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3088", "submitter": "Greg Hager", "authors": "Greg Hager, Hugh F.

Let I be a set of arbitrary\ncardinality (the set of actions) and assume that for each pair of distinct\nactions (i,j), we are given a number \\delta(i,j). We say that a function t,\nspecifying a time for each action, satisfies the timely constraint {\\delta} if\nfor every pair of distinct actions (i,j), we have t(j)-t(i) <= \\delta(i,j) (and\nthus also t(j)-t(i) >= -\\delta(j,i)).

Using such tools, we characterise the set of satisfiable timely\nconstraints, and reduce the problem of satisfiability of a timely constraint to\nthe all-pairs shortest-path problem, and for finite I, furthermore to the\nnegative-cycle detection problem. Moreover, we constructively show that every\nsatisfiable timely constraint has a minimal satisfying function - a key\nmilestone on the way to optimally solving a large class of coordination\nproblems - and reduce the problem of finding this minimal satisfying function,\nas well as the problems of classifying and comparing timely constraints, to the\nall-pairs shortest-path problem. At the heart of our analysis lies the\nconstructive definition of a \"nicely-behaved\" representative for each class of\ntimely constraints sharing the same set of satisfying functions.
