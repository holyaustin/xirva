In fact, an altruist has a wide range\nof strategies, from behaving in the interest of the society as a whole to the\nsupport of the most disadvantaged ones. How can we compare the effectiveness of\nsuch strategies? Another question is: \"Given a strategy, is it possible to\nestimate the optimal number of participants choosing it?\" Finally, do the\nanswers to these questions depend on the level of well-being in the society?\nCan we say that the poorer the society, the more important is to focus on the\nsupport of the poorest?
