In it, agents obtain information about their (common) environment by\nthe perception of messages of other agents, which is determined by an\ninteraction probability (the structure of the population). For an agent to\nunderstand another agent's messages, the former must either know the identity\nof the latter, or the code producing the messages must be universally\ninterpretable. A universal code, however, introduces a vulnerability: a\nparasitic entity can take advantage of it. Here, we investigate this problem.\nIn our specific setting, we consider a parasite to be an agent that tries to\ninflict as much damage as possible in the mutual understanding of the\npopulation (i.e. the parasite acts as a disinformation agent). We show that,\nafter introducing a parasite in the population, the former adopts a code such\nthat it captures the information about the environment that is missing in the\npopulation. Such agent would be of great value, but only if the rest of the\npopulation could understand its messages. However, it is of little use here,\nsince the parasite utilises the most common messages in the population to\nexpress different concepts. Now we let the population respond by updating their\ncodes such that, in this arms race, they again maximise their mutual\nunderstanding. As a result, there is a code drift in the population where the\nutilisation of the messages of the parasite is avoided. A consequence of this\nis that the information that the parasite possesses but the agents lack becomes\nunderstandable and readily available.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 11:15:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 17:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Burgos", "Andres C.", ""], ["Polani", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.01629", "submitter": "Christoph Benzmueller", "authors": "Max Wisniewski and Alexander Steen and Christoph Benzm\\\"uller", "title": "LeoPARD --- A Generic Platform for the Implementation of Higher-Order\n  Reasoners", "comments": "6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of CICM'2015 conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MA cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  LeoPARD supports the implementation of knowledge representation and reasoning\ntools for higher-order logic(s).
