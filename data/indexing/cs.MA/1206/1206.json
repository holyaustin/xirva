More often than not, the actions of some agents are dependent on\nthe previous execution (if not also on the outcome) of the actions of other\nagents. The resulting interdependencies between the timings of the actions of\nthe various agents give rise to the study of methods for timely coordination of\nthese actions.\n  In this work, we formulate and mathematically analyze \"Timely-Coordinated\nResponse\" - a novel multi-agent coordination problem in which the time\ndifference between each pair of actions may be constrained by upper and/or\nlower bounds. This problem generalizes coordination problems previously studied\nby Halpern and Moses and by Ben-Zvi and Moses.\n  We optimally solve timely-coordinated response in two ways: using a\ngeneralization of the fixed-point approach of Halpern and Moses, and using a\ngeneralization of the \"syncausality\" approach of Ben-Zvi and Moses. We\nconstructively show the equivalence of the solutions yielded by both\napproaches, and by combining them, derive strengthened versions of known\nresults for some previously-defined special cases of this problem.\n  Our analysis is conducted under minimal assumptions: we work in a\ncontinuous-time model with possibly infinitely many agents. The general results\nwe obtain for this model reduce to stronger ones for discrete-time models with\nonly finitely many agents. In order to distill the properties of such models\nthat are significant to this reduction, we define several classes of\nnaturally-occurring models, which in a sense separate the different results. We\npresent both a more practical optimal solution, as well as a surprisingly\nsimple condition for solvability, for timely coordinated response under these\nmodels.\n  Finally, we show how our results generalize the results known for\npreviously-studied special cases of this problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Jun 2012 14:10:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Gonczarowski", "Yannai A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.3261", "submitter": "Greg Hines", "authors": "Greg Hines, Kate Larson", "title": "Learning When to Take Advice: A Statistical Test for Achieving A\n  Correlated Equilibrium", "comments": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2008-PG-274-281", "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a multiagent learning problem where agents can either learn via\nrepeated interactions, or can follow the advice of a mediator who suggests\npossible actions to take.

We apply\nthis theory to collaborative multi-agent systems. The agents evolve according\nto a given non-linear dynamics with additive Wiener noise. Each agent can\ncontrol its own dynamics. The goal is to minimize the accumulated joint cost,\nwhich consists of a state dependent term and a term that is quadratic in the\ncontrol. We focus on systems of non-interacting agents that have to distribute\nthemselves optimally over a number of targets, given a set of end-costs for the\ndifferent possible agent-target combinations. We show that optimal control is\nthe combinatorial sum of independent single-agent single-target optimal\ncontrols weighted by a factor proportional to the end-costs of the different\ncombinations. Thus, multi-agent control is related to a standard graphical\nmodel inference problem. The additional computational cost compared to\nsingle-agent control is exponential in the tree-width of the graph specifying\nthe combinatorial sum times the number of targets. We illustrate the result by\nsimulations of systems with up to 42 agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:28:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wiegerinck", "Wim", ""], ["Broek", "Bart van den", ""], ["Kappen", "Hilbert", ""]]}]
