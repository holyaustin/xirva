This bronze age civilization flourished from the end of the\nfourth millennium BC. It disintegrated during the second millennium BC; despite\nmuch research effort, this decline is not well understood. Less research has\nbeen devoted to the emergence of the IVC, which shows continuous cultural\nprecursors since at least the seventh millennium BC. To understand the decline,\nwe believe it is necessary to investigate the rise of the IVC, i.e., the\nestablishment of agriculture and livestock, dense populations and technological\ndevelopments 7000--3000 BC. Although much archaeological information is\navailable, our capability to investigate the system is hindered by poorly\nresolved chronology, and by a lack of field work in the intermediate areas\nbetween the Indus valley and Mesopotamia. We thus employ a complementary\nnumerical simulation to develop a consistent picture of technology,\nagropastoralism and population developments in the IVC domain. Results from\nthis Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator show that there is\n(1) fair agreement between the simulated timing of the agricultural transition\nand radiocarbon dates from early agricultural sites, but the transition is\nsimulated first in India then Pakistan; (2) an independent agropastoralism\ndeveloping on the Indian subcontinent; and (3) a positive relationship between\narcheological artifact richness and simulated population density which remains\nto be quantified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Oct 2011 20:04:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 08:56:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2012 08:47:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lemmen", "Carsten", ""], ["Khan", "Aurangzeb", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1494", "submitter": "Tobias Kretz", "authors": "Tobias Kretz", "title": "Counterflow in Evacuations", "comments": "Preprint of TGF11 (Traffic and Granular Flow, Moscow, September 2011)\n  conference proceedings contribution", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-39669-4_13", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is shown in this work that the average individual egress time and other\nperformance indicators for egress of people from a building can be improved\nunder certain circumstances if counterflow occurs.

Since each of them yields a different outcome, a key problem is\nto decide which one to use in which circumstances.

For this model, we\nconsider issues that are both independent and those that are interdependent and\ndetermine equilibria for each case for each procedure. In so doing, we show\nthat the package deal is in fact the optimal procedure for each party. We then\ngo on to show that, although the package deal may be computationally more\ncomplex than the other two procedures, it generates Pareto optimal outcomes\n(unlike the other two), it has similar earliest and latest possible times of\nagreement to the simultaneous procedure (which is better than the sequential\nprocedure), and that it (like the other two procedures) generates a unique\noutcome only under certain conditions (which we define).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Oct 2011 19:22:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fatima", "S.
