On one hand, massive\nnumber of devices sharing the limited wireless resources will render\ncentralized control mechanisms infeasible due to the excessive cost of\ninformation acquisition and computations. On the other hand, to reduce energy\nconsumption from fixed power grid and/or battery, many IoT devices may need to\ndepend on the energy harvested from the ambient environment (e.g., from RF\ntransmissions, environmental sources). However, due to the opportunistic nature\nof energy harvesting, this will introduce uncertainty in the network operation.\nIn this article, we study the distributed cell association problem for energy\nharvesting IoT devices in UD-SCNs. After reviewing the state-of-the-art\nresearch on the cell association problem in small cell networks, we outline the\nmajor challenges for distributed cell association in IoT-driven UD-SCNs where\nthe IoT devices will need to perform cell association in a distributed manner\nin presence of uncertainty (e.g., limited knowledge on channel/network) and\nlimited computational capabilities. To this end, we propose an approach based\non mean-field multi-armed bandit games to solve the uplink cell association\nproblem for energy harvesting IoT devices in a UD-SCN. This approach is\nparticularly suitable to analyze large multi-agent systems under uncertainty\nand lack of information. We provide some theoretical results as well as\npreliminary performance evaluation results for the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Apr 2016 02:52:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Maghsudi", "Setareh", ""], ["Hossain", "Ekram", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01853", "submitter": "Andrew Connor", "authors": "Ricardo Sosa and Andy M.

This problem\nhas relevance in signal and data fusion network applications and in studying\nopinion and consensus dynamics in social networks. Due to its capability of\nhandling a wider variety of uncertainties and ambiguities associated with\nevidence, we use the framework of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to capture the\nopinion of an agent. We then examine the consensus among agents in dynamic\nnetworks in which an agent can utilize either a cautious or receptive updating\nstrategy. In particular, we examine the case of bounded confidence updating\nwhere an agent exchanges its opinion only with neighboring nodes possessing\n'similar' evidence. In a fusion network, this captures the case in which nodes\nonly update their state based on evidence consistent with the node's own\nevidence. In opinion dynamics, this captures the notions of Social Judgment\nTheory (SJT) in which agents update their opinions only with other agents\npossessing opinions closer to their own. Focusing on the two special DS\ntheoretic cases where an agent state is modeled as a Dirichlet body of evidence\nand a probability mass function (p.m.f.), we utilize results from matrix\ntheory, graph theory, and networks to prove the existence of consensus agent\nstates in several time-varying network cases of interest. For example, we show\nthe existence of a consensus in which a subset of network nodes achieves a\nconsensus that is adopted by follower network nodes.

The model of simulation is parametrized and calibrated on processed\nreal time-series of bike movements for the system of Paris. After showing the\nrobustness of the simulations by validating internally and externally the\nmodel, we are able to test different user-based strategies for an increase of\nthe level of service. In particular, we show that an increase of user\ninformation can have significant impact on the homogeneity of repartition of\nbikes in docking stations, and, what is important for a future implementation\nof the strategy, that an action on only 30% of regular users is enough to\nobtain most of the possible amelioration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 May 2016 12:24:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Raimbault", "Juste", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09497", "submitter": "Nicholas Mattei", "authors": "Andres Abeliuk, Haris Aziz, Gerardo Berbeglia, Serge Gaspers, Petr\n  Kalina, Nicholas Mattei, Dominik Peters, Paul Stursberg, Pascal Van\n  Hentenryck, Toby Walsh", "title": "Interdependent Scheduling Games", "comments": "Accepted to IJCAI 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a model of interdependent scheduling games in which each player\ncontrols a set of services that they schedule independently.

This model,\nwhere players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced\nin planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring\nelectricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical\ncare in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of\nstaff, equipment, and medicine. We undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this\nsetting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization,\ncomputing best responses, Nash dynamics, and existence and computation of Nash\nequilibria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 04:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Abeliuk", "Andres", ""], ["Aziz", "Haris", ""], ["Berbeglia", "Gerardo", ""], ["Gaspers", "Serge", ""], ["Kalina", "Petr", ""], ["Mattei", "Nicholas", ""], ["Peters", "Dominik", ""], ["Stursberg", "Paul", ""], ["Van Hentenryck", "Pascal", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09509", "submitter": "Yu Zhao", "authors": "Yongfang Liu and Yu Zhao and Wei Ren and Guanrong Chen", "title": "Fixed-time consensus of multiple double-integrator systems under\n  directed topologies: A motion-planning approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the fixed-time consensus problem under directed\ntopologies. By using a motion-planning approach, a class of distributed\nfixed-time algorithms are developed for a multi-agent system with\ndouble-integrator dynamics. In the context of the fixed-time consensus, we\nfocus on both directed fixed and switching topologies. Under the directed fixed\ntopology, a novel class of distributed algorithms are designed, which guarantee\nthe consensus of the multi-agent system with a fixed settling time if the\ntopology has a directed spanning tree. Under the directed periodically\nswitching topologies, the fixedtime consensus is solved via the proposed\nalgorithms if the topologies jointly have a directed spanning tree. In\nparticular, the fixed settling time can be off-line pre-assigned according to\ntask requirements. Compared with the existing results, to our best knowledge,\nit is the first time to solve the fixed-time consensus problem for\ndouble-integrator systems under directed topologies. Finally, a numerical\nexample is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the analytical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 07:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yongfang", ""], ["Zhao", "Yu", ""], ["Ren", "Wei", ""], ["Chen", "Guanrong", ""]]}]
