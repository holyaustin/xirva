We model the interaction among the nodes as a directed\ngraph with weights (possibly) dependent on the radio channels and we pose\nspecial attention to the effect of the propagation delay occurring in the\nexchange of data among sensors, as a function of the network geometry. We\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a\nconsensus on globally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results\nproved in this work is that a consensus is reached with exponential convergence\nspeed for any bounded delay condition if and only if the directed graph is\nquasi-strongly connected. We provide a closed form expression for the global\nconsensus, showing that the effect of delays is, in general, the introduction\nof a bias in the final decision. Finally, we exploit our closed form expression\nto devise a double-step consensus mechanism able to provide an unbiased\nestimate with minimum extra complexity, without the need to know or estimate\nthe channel parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Sep 2007 08:40:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2007 15:29:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Scutari", "Gesualdo", ""], ["Barbarossa", "Sergio", ""], ["Pescosolido", "Loreto", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3753", "submitter": "Aditya Mahajan", "authors": "Aditya Mahajan and Demosthenis Teneketzis", "title": "On Real-Time Communication Systems with Noisy Feedback", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE Information Theory Workshop", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.MA math.IT math.OC math.PR", "license": null, "abstract": "  We consider a real-time communication system with noisy feedback consisting\nof a Markov source, a forward and a backward discrete memoryless channels, and\na receiver with finite memory.
