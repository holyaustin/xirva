This\ndiscussion is based on concepts coming from the AMCIS methodology and the JADE\nframework. The AMCIS methodology is specifically tailored to the analysis and\ndesign of cooperative information agent-based systems, while it supports both\nthe levels of the individual agent structure and the agent society in the\nMulti-Agents Systems (MAS) development process. According to AMCIS, MAS are\nviewed as being composed of a number of autonomous cooperative agents that live\nin an organized society, in which each agent plays one or more specific roles,\nwhile their plans and interaction protocols are well defined. On the other hand\nJADE is a FIPA specifications compliant agent development environment that\ngives several facilities for an easy and fast implementation. Our aim is to\nreveal the mapping that may exists between the basic concepts proposed by AMCIS\nfor agents specification and agents interactions and those provided by JADE for\nagents implementation, and therefore to propose a kind of roadmap for agents\ndevelopers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Dec 2013 18:04:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Benmerzoug", "Djamel", ""], ["Djaaboub", "Salim", ""], ["Mahmoudi", "Hani", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2642", "submitter": "Kiran Sree Pokkuluri Prof", "authors": "P.
