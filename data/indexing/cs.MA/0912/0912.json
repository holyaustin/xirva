Since many agents are\nconstantly interacting in parallel, it is difficult to predict the future state\nof a transportation system. Because of this, optimization techniques tend to\ngive obsolete solutions, as the problem changes before it can be optimized. An\nalternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved\nwith self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the\nelements of the system follow local rules to achieve a global solution. Like\nthis, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new\nconfiguration.\n  In this chapter, I will review recent, current, and future work on\nself-organizing transportation systems. Self-organizing traffic lights have\nproven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public\ntransportation systems, simple rules are being explored to prevent the \"equal\nheadway instability\" phenomenon. The methods we have used can be also applied\nto other urban transportation systems and their generality is discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Dec 2009 21:35:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Gershenson", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.2826", "submitter": "Floriana Gargiulo", "authors": "Floriana Gargiulo, Sonia Ternes, Sylvie Huet, Guillaume Deffuant", "title": "An iterative approach for generating statistically realistic populations\n  of households", "comments": "16 oages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008828", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Many different simulation frameworks, in different topics, need\nto treat realistic datasets to initialize and calibrate the system. A precise\nreproduction of initial states is extremely important to obtain reliable\nforecast from the model. Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper proposes an\nalgorithm to create an artificial population where individuals are described by\ntheir age, and are gathered in households respecting a variety of statistical\nconstraints (distribution of household types, sizes, age of household head,\ndifference of age between partners and among parents and children). Such a\npopulation is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)\nindividual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often\nvery important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic\nevolution. Usual techniques from microsimulation approach cross different\nsources of aggregated data for generating individuals. In our case the number\nof combinations of different households (types, sizes, age of participants)\nmakes it computationally difficult to use directly such methods. Hence we\ndeveloped a specific algorithm to make the problem more easily tractable.\nConclusions/Significance: We generate the populations of two pilot\nmunicipalities in Auvergne region (France), to illustrate the approach. The\ngenerated populations show a good agreement with the available statistical\ndatasets (not used for the generation) and are obtained in a reasonable\ncomputational time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2009 09:28:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gargiulo", "Floriana", ""], ["Ternes", "Sonia", ""], ["Huet", "Sylvie", ""], ["Deffuant", "Guillaume", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3275", "submitter": "Nicola Gatti", "authors": "Nicola Basilico and Nicola Gatti and Francesco Amigoni", "title": "A Formal Framework for Mobile Robot Patrolling in Arbitrary Environments\n  with Adversaries", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using mobile robots for autonomous patrolling of environments to prevent\nintrusions is a topic of increasing practical relevance. One of the most\nchallenging scientific issues is the problem of finding effective patrolling\nstrategies that, at each time point, determine the next moves of the patrollers\nin order to maximize some objective function. In the very last years this\nproblem has been addressed in a game theoretical fashion, explicitly\nconsidering the presence of an adversarial intruder. The general idea is that\nof modeling a patrolling situation as a game, played by the patrollers and the\nintruder, and of studying the equilibria of this game to derive effective\npatrolling strategies. In this paper we present a game theoretical formal\nframework for the determination of effective patrolling strategies that extends\nthe previous proposals appeared in the literature, by considering environments\nwith arbitrary topology and arbitrary preferences for the agents. The main\noriginal contributions of this paper are the formulation of the patrolling game\nfor generic graph environments, an algorithm for finding a deterministic\nequilibrium strategy, which is a fixed path through the vertices of the graph,\nand an algorithm for finding a non-deterministic equilibrium strategy, which is\na set of probabilities for moving between adjacent vertices of the graph. Both\nthe algorithms are analytically studied and experimentally validated, to assess\ntheir properties and efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 21:57:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Basilico", "Nicola", ""], ["Gatti", "Nicola", ""], ["Amigoni", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3961", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Yee Ming Chen, Bo-Yuan Wang, Hung-Ming Shiu", "title": "Enhancing Multi-Agent Based Simulation with Human-Agents Interactive\n  Spatial Behaviour", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Computing, Volume 1, Issue 1, pp 49-56, December 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We are exploring the enhancement of models of agent behaviour with more\n\"human-like\" decision making strategies than are presently available.

The extended naming game models an environment\nsimilar to one that can be found in the context of social bookmarking and\ncollaborative tagging sites where users tag sites using appropriate labels, but\nalso mimics an important aspect in the field of human-based image labeling.\nAlthough the extended naming game is non-deterministic in its word selection,\nwe show that consensus towards a common vocabulary is reached.
