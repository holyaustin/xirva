We propose a variant of\nthe mEDEA algorithm in which we add a selection operator, and we apply it in a\ntaskdriven scenario. We evaluate four selection methods that induce different\nintensity of selection pressure in a multi-robot navigation with obstacle\navoidance task and a collective foraging task. Experiments show that a small\nintensity of selection pressure is sufficient to rapidly obtain good\nperformances on the tasks at hand.

One critical\nshortcoming of classical experimental methods, however, is that they typically\ndo not take into account the dynamic nature of response to policy changes. For\ninstance, in an experiment where we seek to understand the effects of a new ad\npricing policy on auction revenue, agents may adapt their bidding in response\nto the experimental pricing changes. Thus, causal effects of the new pricing\npolicy after such adaptation period, the {\\em long-term causal effects}, are\nnot captured by the classical methodology even though they clearly are more\nindicative of the value of the new policy. Here, we formalize a framework to\ndefine and estimate long-term causal effects of policy changes in multiagent\neconomies. Central to our approach is behavioral game theory, which we leverage\nto formulate the ignorability assumptions that are necessary for causal\ninference. Under such assumptions we estimate long-term causal effects through\na latent space approach, where a behavioral model of how agents act conditional\non their latent behaviors is combined with a temporal model of how behaviors\nevolve over time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Jan 2015 07:06:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 03:10:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 20:20:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:50:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 17:58:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 01:08:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 21:26:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 02:18:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Panagiotis", "", "", "Panos"], ["Toulis", "", ""], ["Parkes", "David C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02713", "submitter": "David Casbeer", "authors": "David W.

To do this, the nodes must use the network connections of\nthe non-participating nodes, which act as bridges for information and ignore\nthe initial values of the non-participating nodes. The solution to this problem\nis made by merging the ideas from estimation theory and consensus theory. By\nconsidering the participating nodes has having equal information and the\nnon-participating nodes as having no information, the nodes initial values are\ntransformed into information space. Two consensus filters are run in parallel\non the information state and information matrix.
