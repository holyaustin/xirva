This question is equivalent to the question ''How\nimportant is the orientation of the axis of discretization for the result of\nthe simulation?'' An optimization in terms of symmetry can be combined with the\nimplementation of higher and heterogeniously distributed walking speeds by\nrepresenting different walking speeds via different amounts of cells an agent\nmay move during one round. Therefore all different possible neighborhoods for\nspeeds up to v = 10 (cells per round) will be examined for the amount of\ndeviation from radial symmetry. Simple criteria will be stated which will allow\nfind an optimal neighborhood for each speed. It will be shown that following\nthese criteria even the best mixture of steps in Moore and von Neumann\nneighborhoods is unable to reproduce the optimal neighborhood for a speed as\nlow as 4.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2008 09:47:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kretz", "Tobias", ""], ["Schreckenberg", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0506", "submitter": "Gesualdo Scutari", "authors": "Gesualdo Scutari and Sergio Barbarossa", "title": "Distributed Consensus over Wireless Sensor Networks Affected by\n  Multipath Fading", "comments": "Paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, August\n  2007.

Many consensus\nalgorithms have been proposed, with convergence conditions depending on the\ngraph describing the interaction among the nodes. In most works, the graph is\nundirected and there are no propagation delays. Only recently, the analysis has\nbeen extended to consensus algorithms incorporating propagation delays. In this\nwork, we propose a consensus algorithm able to converge to a globally optimal\ndecision statistic, using a wideband wireless network, governed by a fairly\nsimple MAC mechanism, where each link is a multipath, frequency-selective,\nchannel. The main contribution of the paper is to derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions on the network topology and sufficient conditions on the\nchannel transfer functions guaranteeing the exponential convergence of the\nconsensus algorithm to a globally optimal decision value, for any bounded delay\ncondition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 09:22:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Scutari", "Gesualdo", ""], ["Barbarossa", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1421", "submitter": "Christopher Homan", "authors": "Jason Covey and Christopher Homan", "title": "A $O(\\log m)$, deterministic, polynomial-time computable approximation\n  of Lewis Carroll's scoring rule", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide deterministic, polynomial-time computable voting rules that\napproximate Dodgson's and (the ``minimization version'' of) Young's scoring\nrules to within a logarithmic factor.
