In this paper, we follow the latter approach\nand establish generic PSPACE-bounds for a large and heterogeneous class of\nmodal logics in a coalgebraic framework. In particular, no complete\naxiomatisation of the logic under scrutiny is needed. This does not only\ncomplement our earlier, syntactic, approach conceptually, but also covers a\nwide variety of new examples which are difficult to harness by purely syntactic\nmeans. Apart from re-proving known complexity bounds for a large variety of\nstructurally different logics, we apply our method to obtain previously unknown\nPSPACE-bounds for Elgesem's logic of agency and for graded modal logic over\nreflexive frames.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2008 13:11:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2008 20:48:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 09:34:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schr\u00f6der", "Lutz", ""], ["Patinson", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1393", "submitter": "Clement Jonquet", "authors": "Cl\\'ement Jonquet (LIRMM), Stefano A.

AGGs, introduced by Bhat and Leyton-Brown, is a succinct representation\nof games that encapsulates both \"local\" dependencies as in graphical games, and\npartial indifference to other agents' identities as in anonymous games, which\noccur in many natural settings. This is achieved by specifying a graph on the\nset of actions, so that the payoff of an agent for selecting a strategy depends\nonly on the number of agents playing each of the neighboring strategies in the\naction graph. We present a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for computing\nmixed Nash equilibria of AGGs with constant treewidth and a constant number of\nagent types (and an arbitrary number of strategies), together with hardness\nresults for the cases when either the treewidth or the number of agent types is\nunconstrained. In particular, we show that even if the action graph is a tree,\nbut the number of agent-types is unconstrained, it is NP-complete to decide the\nexistence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and PPAD-complete to compute a\nmixed Nash equilibrium (even an approximate one); similarly for symmetric AGGs\n(all agents belong to a single type), if we allow arbitrary treewidth. These\nhardness results suggest that, in some sense, our PTAS is as strong of a\npositive result as one can expect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2008 09:45:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Daskalakis", "Constantinos", ""], ["Schoenebeck", "Grant", ""], ["Valiant", "Gregory", ""], ["Valiant", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3414", "submitter": "Scott Kominers", "authors": "Zachary Abel, Scott D.
