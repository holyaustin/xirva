The focus is on\nprincipled methods for a single agent to cooperate with others. This motivates\ninvestigating the ad hoc teamwork problem in the context of individual decision\nmaking frameworks. However, individual decision making in multiagent settings\nfaces the task of having to reason about other agents' actions, which in turn\ninvolves reasoning about others. An established approximation that\noperationalizes this approach is to bound the infinite nesting from below by\nintroducing level 0 models. We show that a consequence of the finitely-nested\nmodeling is that we may not obtain optimal team solutions in cooperative\nsettings. We address this limitation by including models at level 0 whose\nsolutions involve learning. We demonstrate that the learning integrated into\nplanning in the context of interactive dynamic influence diagrams facilitates\noptimal team behavior, and is applicable to ad hoc teamwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2014 06:53:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chandrasekaran", "Muthukumaran", ""], ["Doshi", "Prashant", ""], ["Zeng", "Yifeng", ""], ["Chen", "Yingke", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0507", "submitter": "Michele Starnini", "authors": "Michele Starnini, Andrea Baronchelli and Romualdo Pastor-Satorras", "title": "Model reproduces individual, group and collective dynamics of human\n  contact networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Social Networks 47, pp. 130-137 (2016)", "doi": "10.1016/j.socnet.2016.06.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.MA cs.SI physics.data-an q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Empirical data on the dynamics of human face-to-face interactions across a\nvariety of social venues have recently revealed a number of context-independent\nstructural and temporal properties of human contact networks.

The first generalization is one where the strength of\ninfluence depends on the distance of the agents' opinions. Under this setup, we\nidentify conditions under which the opinions converge in finite time, and\nprovide a qualitative characterization of the equilibrium. We interpret the HK\nmodel opinion update rule as a quadratic cost-minimization rule. This enables a\nsecond generalization: a family of update rules which possess different\nequilibrium properties. Subsequently, we investigate models in which a external\nforce can behave strategically to modulate/influence user updates. We consider\ncases where this external force can introduce additional agents and cases where\nthey can modify the cost structures for other agents. We describe and analyze\nsome strategies through which such modulation may be possible in an\norder-optimal manner. Our simulations demonstrate that generalized dynamics\ndiffer qualitatively and quantitatively from traditional HK dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 14:10:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Avhishek", ""], ["Sarwate", "Anand D.", ""], ["Vishwanath", "Sriram", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.7830", "submitter": "Szymon Matejczyk", "authors": "Kamil Adamczewski, Szymon Matejczyk and Tomasz P.

The\nmain advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic\nanalysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains,\nwithout requiring any modification.
