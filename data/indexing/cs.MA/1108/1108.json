Although my model is based on ecological\n-Neomalthusian- principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship\nbetween technology and population results in a seemingly Boserupian response:\ninnovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not\nonly visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a\ncorresponding \"real world\" simulator which was tested against archaeological\ndata, demonstrating the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model.

This paper presents a hybrid supervisory control framework\nfor the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmanned\nhelicopters. The proposed hybrid control framework captures internal\ninteractions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuous\ndynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. To\ndesign such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space is\nproposed as a new method of abstraction. Utilizing the properties of\nmulti-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite state\nDiscrete Event System (DES) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to the\noriginal continuous-variable dynamical system. Then, in the discrete domain, a\nlogic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. Due to the\nbisimilarity between the abstracted DES model and the original UAV dynamics,\nthe designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller through\nan interface layer. This supervisor drives the UAV dynamics to satisfy the\ndesign requirements. In other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring the\nUAVs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside the\ncontrol horizon and then, maintain the formation. Moreover, a collision\navoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. Finally, the\nalgorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,\nwhich is developed for unmanned helicopters. The presented results show the\neffectiveness of the algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2011 06:46:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Karimoddini", "A.", ""], ["Lin", "H.", ""], ["Chen", "B.

One prominent such language\nis the simple yet expressive Weighted Graph Games (WGGs) representation [14],\nwhich maintains knowledge about synergies between agents in the form of an edge\nweighted graph.\n  We consider the problem of finding the optimal coalition structure in WGGs.\nThe agents in such games are vertices in a graph, and the value of a coalition\nis the sum of the weights of the edges present between coalition members. The\noptimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that\nmaximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that finding\nthe optimal coalition structure is not only hard for general graphs, but is\nalso intractable for restricted families such as planar graphs which are\namenable for many other combinatorial problems.
