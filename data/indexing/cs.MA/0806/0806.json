In such\ncontrol scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election\nvia actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.\nSP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of\ncandidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'\napproval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred\ncandidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule\ncoerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and\nhybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.\n  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the\ncorresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of\nconstructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to\ncontrol than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a\npolynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,\nsee Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the\nsecond natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that\nis known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland\nvoting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 13:27:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 22:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Sep 2008 21:57:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 09:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 15:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Erdelyi", "Gabor", ""], ["Nowak", "Markus", ""], ["Rothe", "Joerg", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0576", "submitter": "Wojciech Mazurczyk", "authors": "Krzysztof Szczypiorski, Igor Margasinski, Wojciech Mazurczyk", "title": "Steganographic Routing in Multi Agent System Environment", "comments": "9 pages, 10 figures,", "journal-ref": "\"Secured Information Systems\" of Journal of Information Assurance\n  and Security (JIAS), Dynamic Publishers Inc., Atlanta, GA 30362, USA, Volume\n  2, Issue 3, September 2007, pp. 235-243, ISSN 1554-1010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present an idea of trusted communication platform for\nMulti-Agent Systems (MAS) called TrustMAS.

It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept and on the\nprinciple of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each\nenterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local\nand global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual\nEnterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of\ntiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner\nconstitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers.\nExchanges between the VENs ensure the autonomy of decision, and guarantiee the\nconsistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN\nagents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA)\nand one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If\nsupply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier\nNegotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain\nMediator Agent (SCMA) working at the level of the enterprise network. These two\nagents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs\nprocess the flow of information alone. With this new approach, managing\nenterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a\nsimple enterprise in the network.
