By collectives we mean multi-agent systems\nthat transition from one state to another at discrete moments of time. The\nbehavior of a member of a collective (agent) is called conforming if the\nopinion of this agent at current time moment conforms to the opinion of some\nother agents at the previous time moment. We presume that at each moment of\ntime every agent makes a decision by choosing from the set {0,1} (where\n1-decision corresponds to action and 0-decision corresponds to inaction). In\nour approach we model collective behavior with synchronous Boolean networks. We\npresume that in a network there can be agents that act at every moment of time.\nSuch agents are called instigators. Also there can be agents that never act.\nSuch agents are called loyalists. Agents that are neither instigators nor\nloyalists are called simple agents. We study two combinatorial problems. The\nfirst problem is to find a disposition of instigators that in several time\nmoments transforms a network from a state where a majority of simple agents are\ninactive to a state with a majority of active agents. The second problem is to\nfind a disposition of loyalists that returns the network to a state with a\nmajority of inactive agents. Similar problems are studied for networks in which\nsimple agents demonstrate the contrary to conforming behavior that we call\nanticonforming. We obtained several theoretical results regarding the behavior\nof collectives of agents with conforming or anticonforming behavior. In\ncomputational experiments we solved the described problems for randomly\ngenerated networks with several hundred vertices. We reduced corresponding\ncombinatorial problems to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and used\nmodern SAT solvers to solve the instances obtained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 11:35:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kochemazov", "Stepan", ""], ["Semenov", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.7998", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Liane Gabora and Stefan Leijnen", "title": "The Relationship between Creativity, Imitation, and Cultural Diversity", "comments": "13 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:0911.2390, arXiv:1005.1516, arXiv:1310.3781, arXiv:1310.0522,\n  arXiv:0811.2551", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Software and Informatics, 7(4), 615-627\n  2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cs.CY cs.MA cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are both benefits and drawbacks to cultural diversity. It can lead to\nfriction and exacerbate differences. However, as with biological diversity,\ncultural diversity is valuable in times of upheaval; if a previously effective\nsolution no longer works, it is good to have alternatives available. What\nfactors give rise to cultural diversity? This paper describes a preliminary\ninvestigation of this question using a computational model of cultural\nevolution. The model is composed of neural network based agents that evolve\nfitter ideas for actions by (1) inventing new ideas through modification of\nexisting ones, and (2) imitating neighbors' ideas. Numerical simulations\nindicate that the diversity of ideas in a population is positively correlated\nwith both the proportion of creators to imitators in the population, and the\nrate at which creators create. This is the case for both minimum and peak\ndiversity of actions over the duration of a run.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 02:57:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Gabora", "Liane", ""], ["Leijnen", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8673", "submitter": "Meng Guo", "authors": "Meng Guo, Jana Tumova, Dimos V.
