Based\non this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc\nCoordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in\na planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal\ncontrol. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based\nforaging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than\nseveral alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at\na public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated\nPrisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative\nalgorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly\nhigher welfare and winning rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 09:12:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Albrecht", "Stefano V.", ""], ["Ramamoorthy", "Subramanian", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.01310", "submitter": "Valmir Barbosa", "authors": "Rodrigo R.
