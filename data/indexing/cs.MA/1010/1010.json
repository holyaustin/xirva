In\nthe field of robotics, this spectrum has important implications in many\nproblems that require some form of distributed coordination within a team of\nrobots. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time control scheme that\nmodifies the structure of a position-dependent network of mobile robots so that\nit achieves a desired set of adjacency eigenvalues. For this, we employ a novel\nabstraction of the eigenvalue spectrum by means of the adjacency matrix\nspectral moments. Since the eigenvalue spectrum is uniquely determined by its\nspectral moments, this abstraction provides a way to indirectly control the\neigenvalues of the network. Our construction is based on artificial potentials\nthat capture the distance of the network's spectral moments to their desired\nvalues. Minimization of these potentials is via a gradient descent closed-loop\nsystem that, under certain convexity assumptions, ensures convergence of the\nnetwork topology to one with the desired set of moments and, therefore,\neigenvalues. We illustrate our approach in nontrivial computer simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 23:03:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zavlanos", "Michael M.", ""], ["Preciado", "Victor M.", ""], ["Jadbabaie", "Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0145", "submitter": "Joergen Villadsen", "authors": "J{\\o}rgen Villadsen, Niklas Skamriis Boss, Andreas Schmidt Jensen, and\n  Steen Vester", "title": "Multi-Agent Programming Contest 2010 - The Jason-DTU Team", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a brief description of the Jason-DTU system, including the\nmethodology, the tools and the team strategy that we plan to use in the agent\ncontest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 12:37:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Villadsen", "J\u00f8rgen", ""], ["Boss", "Niklas Skamriis", ""], ["Jensen", "Andreas Schmidt", ""], ["Vester", "Steen", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0150", "submitter": "Joergen Villadsen", "authors": "Andreas Schmidt Jensen", "title": "Implementing Lego Agents Using Jason", "comments": "24 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Since many of the currently available multi-agent frameworks are generally\nmostly intended for research, it can be difficult to built multi-agent systems\nusing physical robots. In this report I describe a way to combine the\nmulti-agent framework Jason, an extended version of the agent-oriented\nprogramming language AgentSpeak, with Lego robots to address this problem. By\nextending parts of the Jason reasoning cycle I show how Lego robots are able to\ncomplete tasks such as following lines on a floor and communicating to be able\nto avoid obstacles with minimal amount of coding. The final implementation is a\nfunctional extension that is able to built multi-agent systems using Lego\nagents, however there are some issues that have not been addressed. If the\nagents are highly dependent on percepts from their sensors, they are required\nto move quite slowly, because there currently is a high delay in the reasoning\ncycle, when it is combined with a robot. Overall the system is quite robust and\ncan be used to make simple Lego robots perform tasks of an advanced agent in a\nmulti-agent environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 13:03:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Jensen", "Andreas Schmidt", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0155", "submitter": "Joergen Villadsen", "authors": "Andreas Schmidt Jensen", "title": "An Investigation of the Advantages of Organization-Centered Multi-Agent\n  Systems", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Whereas classical multi-agent systems have the agent in center, there have\nrecently been a development towards focusing more on the organization of the\nsystem.

To obtain the\napproximation bounds, we introduce a new technique that while conceptually\nsimple, seems to be quite powerful. With this method we are able to prove the\nfollowing results.\n  First, we consider Smith's Rule, which orders the jobs on a machine in\nascending processing time to weight ratio, and show that it achieves an\napproximation ratio of 4. We also demonstrate that this is the best possible\nfor deterministic non-preemptive strongly local policies. Since Smith's Rule is\nalways optimal for a given assignment, this may seem unsurprising, but we then\nshow that better approximation ratios can be obtained if either preemption or\nrandomization is allowed.\n  We prove that ProportionalSharing, a preemptive strongly local policy,\nachieves an approximation ratio of 2.618 for the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, and an approximation ratio of 2.5 in the unweighted case. Again, we\nobserve that these bounds are tight. Next, we consider Rand, a natural\nnon-preemptive but randomized policy. We show that it achieves an approximation\nratio of at most 2.13; moreover, if the sum of the weighted completion times is\nnegligible compared to the cost of the optimal solution, this improves to \\pi\n/2.\n  Finally, we show that both ProportionalSharing and Rand induce potential\ngames, and thus always have a pure Nash equilibrium (unlike Smith's Rule). This\nalso allows us to design the first \\emph{combinatorial} constant-factor\napproximation algorithm minimizing weighted completion time for unrelated\nmachine scheduling that achieves a factor of 2+ \\epsilon for any \\epsilon > 0.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Oct 2010 01:59:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Dec 2010 03:01:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Dec 2010 17:39:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cole", "Richard", ""], ["Correa", "Jos\u00e9 R.", ""], ["Gkatzelis", "Vasilis", ""], ["Mirrokni", "Vahab", ""], ["Olver", "Neil", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.4786", "submitter": "Luca Vigan\\`o", "authors": "Matteo Cristani and Erisa Karafili and Luca Vigan\\`o", "title": "Blocking Underhand Attacks by Hidden Coalitions (Extended Version)", "comments": "13 pages, short version in Proceedings of ICAART 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LO cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Similar to what happens between humans in the real world, in open multi-agent\nsystems distributed over the Internet, such as online social networks or wiki\ntechnologies, agents often form coalitions by agreeing to act as a whole in\norder to achieve certain common goals.
