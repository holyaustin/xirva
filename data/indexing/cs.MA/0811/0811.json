Previously, it was shown\nthat a user having the knowledge of its opponents' channel state information\ncan make foresighted decisions and substantially improve its performance\ncompared with the case in which it deploys the conventional iterative\nwater-filling algorithm, which does not exploit such knowledge. This paper\ndiscusses how a foresighted user can acquire this knowledge by modeling its\nexperienced interference as a function of its own power allocation. To\ncharacterize the outcome of the multi-user interaction, the conjectural\nequilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the\ninvestigated water-filling game is proved. Interestingly, both the Nash\nequilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are shown to be special cases of\nthe generalization of conjectural equilibrium. We develop practical algorithms\nto form accurate beliefs and search desirable power allocation strategies.\nNumerical simulations indicate that a foresighted user without any a priori\nknowledge of its competitors' private information can effectively learn the\nrequired information, and induce the entire system to an operating point that\nimproves both its own achievable rate as well as the rates of the other\nparticipants in the water-filling game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2008 23:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Yi", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0113", "submitter": "Andr\\'e C.

It consists of\nneural network based agents that invent ideas for actions, and imitate\nneighbors' actions. The model is based on a theory of culture according to\nwhich what evolves through culture is not memes or artifacts, but the internal\nmodels of the world that give rise to them, and they evolve not through a\nDarwinian process of competitive exclusion but a Lamarckian process involving\nexchange of innovation protocols. EVOC shows an increase in mean fitness of\nactions over time, and an increase and then decrease in the diversity of\nactions. Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and\ndensity, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase\nfitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by\nsharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions\nthroughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces\ndiversity of actions. Increasing the number of leaders reduces this effect.\nEfforts are underway to simulate the conditions under which an agent\nimmigrating from one culture to another contributes new ideas while still\nfitting in.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Nov 2008 03:35:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 21:19:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 20:25:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gabora", "Liane", ""]]}]
