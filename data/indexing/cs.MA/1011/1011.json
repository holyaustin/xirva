In particular,\nour focus is on studying differences between the decidability of a decision\nproblem by agents and its verifiability when a certificate for a positive\nanswer is provided to the agents. We show that the class MAV of mobile agents\nverifiable problems is much wider than the class MAD of mobile agents decidable\nproblems. Our main result shows that there exist natural MAV-complete problems:\nthe most difficult problems in this class, to which all problems in MAV are\nreducible. Our construction of a MAV-complete problem involves two main\ningredients in mobile agents computability: the topology of the quotient graph\nand the number of operating agents. Beyond the class MAV we show that, for a\nsingle agent, three natural oracles yield a strictly increasing chain of\nrelative decidability classes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:46:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Fraigniaud", "Pierre", ""], ["Pelc", "Andrzej", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3397", "submitter": "Sergey Tarasenko", "authors": "Sergey Tarasenko", "title": "The Inverse Task of the Reflexive Game Theory: Theoretical Matters,\n  Practical Applications and Relationship with Other Issues", "comments": "27 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Reflexive Game Theory (RGT) has been recently proposed by Vladimir\nLefebvre to model behavior of individuals in groups.

In particular, we discuss the efficient use of \"ant robots\"\nfor covering a connected region on the Z^{2} grid, whose area is unknown in\nadvance, and which expands at a given rate, where $n$ is the initial size of\nthe connected region.\n  We show that regardless of the algorithm used, and the robots' hardware and\nsoftware specifications, the minimal number of robots required in order for\nsuch coverage to be possible is \\Omega({\\sqrt{n}}).\n  In addition, we show that when the region expands at a sufficiently slow\nrate, a team of \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}) robots could cover it in at most O(n^{2} \\ln\nn) time.\n  This completion time can even be achieved by myopic robots, with no ability\nto directly communicate with each other, and where each robot is equipped with\na memory of size O(1) bits w.r.t the size of the region (therefore, the robots\ncannot maintain maps of the terrain, nor plan complete paths).\n  Regarding the coverage of non-expanding regions in the grid, we improve the\ncurrent best known result of O(n^{2}) by demonstrating an algorithm that\nguarantees such a coverage with completion time of O(\\frac{1}{k} n^{1.5} + n)\nin the worst case, and faster for shapes of perimeter length which is shorter\nthan O(n).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Nov 2010 21:17:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Altshuler", "Yaniv", ""], ["Bruckstein", "Alfred", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6127", "submitter": "Fabio Morbidi", "authors": "Fabio Morbidi, Francesco Bullo, Domenico Prattichizzo", "title": "Visibility maintenance via controlled invariance for leader-follower\n  Dubins-like vehicles", "comments": "17 pages, 24 figures, extended version of the journal paper of the\n  authors submitted to Automatica", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper studies the visibility maintenance problem (VMP) for a\nleader-follower pair of Dubins-like vehicles with input constraints, and\nproposes an original solution based on the notion of controlled invariance.
