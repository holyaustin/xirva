In order to assess the efficiency of the\nnew algorithm, some standard traveling salesman problems (TSPs) were studied\nand their results were compared with classical EAC and other well-known\nmeta-heuristic algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has\nbeen able to improve the efficiency of the algorithms in all instances and it\nis competitive with other algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 11:12:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yousefikhoshbakht", "Majid", ""], ["Didehvar", "Farzad", ""], ["Rahmati", "Farhad", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1941", "submitter": "Atul Mishra", "authors": "A.K.

Moreover, varied technologies, such as SONET,\nATM, Ethernet, DWDM etc., present at different layers of the Access, Metro and\nCore (long haul) sections of the network, have contributed to the complexity in\nterms of their own framing and protocol structures. Thus, controlling and\nmanaging the traffic in these networks is a challenging task.

However, in multi-agent settings the communication\ncomplexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication\noverhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains.

The verified\nproperties are formally expressed in temporal logics. Some temporal logics,\nsuch as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole\ncomputation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.\nThis branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal\nlogics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition\nrelations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and\nepistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce\nlinear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation\npath of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially\nexplained by a linear counter-example.\n  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like\nannotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL\n(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions\nlabeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching\nstructure that supports more complete description of property violations.\nElements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to\ngive a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of\nthese richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of\nbranches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties.\n  This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate\ncounter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation\nalgorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples\nin CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been\nimplemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export\nbranching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical\ninterface to visualize and browse them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Feb 2012 01:41:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Busard", "Simon", "", "UCLouvain, Belgium"], ["Pecheur", "Charles", "", "UCLouvain,\n  Belgium"]]}, {"id": "1202.5509", "submitter": "Jacob Beal", "authors": "Jacob Beal, Stefan Dulman, Kyle Usbeck, Mirko Viroli, and Nikolaus\n  Correll", "title": "Organizing the Aggregate: Languages for Spatial Computing", "comments": "60 pages; Review chapter to appear as a chapter in book \"Formal and\n  Practical Aspects of Domain-Specific Languages: Recent Developments\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.DC cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As the number of computing devices embedded into engineered systems continues\nto rise, there is a widening gap between the needs of the user to control\naggregates of devices and the complex technology of individual devices.
