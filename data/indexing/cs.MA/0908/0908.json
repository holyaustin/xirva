As observed in the World Color\nSurvey (WCS), indeed, any two groups of individuals develop quite different\ncategorization patterns, but some universal properties can be identified by a\nstatistical analysis over a large number of populations. Here, we reproduce the\nWCS in a numerical model in which different populations develop independently\ntheir own categorization systems by playing elementary language games. We find\nthat a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just\nNoticeable Difference (JND), is sufficient to trigger the emergence of\nuniversal patterns that unconstrained cultural interaction fails to produce. We\ntest the results of our experiment against real data by performing the same\nstatistical analysis proposed to quantify the universal tendencies shown in the\nWCS [Kay P and Regier T. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100: 9085-9089], and\nobtain an excellent quantitative agreement. This work confirms that synthetic\nmodeling has nowadays reached the maturity to contribute significantly to the\nongoing debate in cognitive science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 13:54:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 09:42:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Baronchelli", "Andrea", ""], ["Gong", "Tao", ""], ["Puglisi", "Andrea", ""], ["Loreto", "Vittorio", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0982", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Maryam Hosseini-Pozveh, Mohamadali Nematbakhsh, Naser Movahhedinia", "title": "A multidimensional approach for context-aware recommendation in mobile\n  commerce", "comments": "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS July 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 3, No. 1, July 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.CY cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context as the dynamic information describing the situation of items and\nusers and affecting the users decision process is essential to be used by\nrecommender systems in mobile commerce to guarantee the quality of\nrecommendation.

The approach represents users,\nitems, context information and the relationship between them in a\nmultidimensional space. It then determines the usage patterns of each user\nunder different contextual situations and creates a new 2 dimensional\nrecommendation space and does the final recommendation in that space.
