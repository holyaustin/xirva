For this they accept to move\non a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and\nby this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of\npedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either \"move as far as\npossible toward the destination\" or - reformulated - \"of all coordinates\naccessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the\ndestination\". Atop of this rule modifications are placed to make the motion\nmore realistic. These modifications usually focus on local behavior and neglect\nlong-ranged effects. Compared to real pedestrians this leads to agents in a\nsimulation valuing the shortest path a lot better than the quickest. So, in a\nsituation as the movement of a large crowd around a corner, one needs an\nadditional element in a model of pedestrian dynamics that makes the agents\ndeviate from the rule of the shortest path. In this work it is shown, how this\ncan be achieved by using a flood fill dynamic potential field method, where\nduring the filling process the value of a field cell is not increased by 1, but\nby a larger value, if it is occupied by an agent. This idea may be an obvious\none, however, the tricky part - and therefore in a strict sense the\ncontribution of this work - is a) to minimize unrealistic artifacts, as naive\nflood fill metrics deviate considerably from the Euclidean metric and in this\nrespect yield large errors, b) do this with limited computational effort, and\nc) keep agents' movement at very low densities unaltered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jan 2009 09:29:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kretz", "Tobias", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1610", "submitter": "Janardan Misra", "authors": "Janardan Misra", "title": "Towards a Framework for Observing Artificial Evolutionary Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Establishing the emergence of evolutionary behavior as a defining\ncharacteristic of 'life' is a major step in the Artificial life (ALife)\nstudies.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users over the course of two months, we characterize\nthe properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models, in\nwhich destinations are independent of past decisions. In particular, we show\nthat the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more\nbroadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is\nmore broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive\nvisits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.\nTo account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation\nmodel in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as\nteleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic\nproperty caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model\nreproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also\ngenerating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return\ntime distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the\nextreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the\nmore narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Jan 2009 15:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Goncalves", "Bruno", ""], ["Meiss", "Mark R.", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jose J.", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3910", "submitter": "Charles Lales", "authors": "Charles Lales (LaBRI), N.

In this context, the multi-agents systems appear as an alternative\nto model the metabolic pathways.
