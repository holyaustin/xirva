In this paper, we combine the quantum game with the problem of data\nclustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in\nwhich data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions\nand implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a\nquantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a\nlink-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust\nthe strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff.\nFurther, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two\npayoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results\nhave demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and\nefficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence.\nMoreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 15:46:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Oct 2009 09:10:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Qiang", ""], ["He", "Yan", ""], ["Jiang", "Jing-ping", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1155", "submitter": "Shan Mei", "authors": "Shan Mei, P.M.A Sloot, Rick Quax, Yifan Zhu, Weiping Wang", "title": "Complex Agent Networks explaining the HIV epidemic among homosexual men\n  in Amsterdam", "comments": "21 pages, 4 figures, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, added\n  references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Simulating the evolution of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic\nrequires a detailed description of the population network, especially for small\npopulations in which individuals can be represented in detail and accuracy.

The\napplicability of CANs is demonstrated by constructing and executing a detailed\nHIV epidemic model for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Amsterdam, including\na distinction between steady and casual relationships.
