This paper describes the\nFuzzy Decision Analysis used in the negotiation between the SoS agent and a\nSystem agent in the ABM of an Acknowledged SoS development. An Acknowledged SoS\nhas by definition a limited influence on the development of the individual\nSystems. The individual Systems have their own priorities, pressures, and\nagenda which may or may not align with the goals of the SoS. The SoS has some\nfunding and deadlines which can be used to negotiate with the individual System\nin order to illicit the required capability from that System. The Fuzzy\nDecision Analysis determines how the SoS agent will adjust the funding and\ndeadlines for each of the Systems in order to achieve the desired SoS\narchitecture quality. The Fuzzy Decision Analysis has inputs of performance,\nfunding, and deadlines as well as weights for each capability. The performance,\nfunding, and deadlines are crisp values which are fuzzified. The fuzzified\nvalues are then used with a Fuzzy Inference Engine to get the fuzzy outputs of\nfunding adjustment and deadline adjustment which must then be defuzzified\nbefore being passed to the System agent. The first contribution of this paper\nis the fuzzy decision analysis that represents the negotiation between the SoS\nagent and the System agent. A second contribution of this paper is the method\nof implementing the fuzzy decision analysis which provides a generalized fuzzy\ndecision analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 23:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Acheson", "Paulette", ""], ["Dagli", "Cihan", ""], ["Kilicay-Ergin", "Nil", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.0051", "submitter": "Nikolay Atanasov", "authors": "Nikolay A.

It is common sense that vehicular traffic arranges\nin a user-equilibrium based on generalized costs in which travel time is a\nmajor factor.

In microscopic simulations of pedestrians the\nvastly dominating paradigm for the computation of the preferred walking\ndirection is set into the direction of the (spatially) shortest path. For\nsituations where pedestrians have travel time as primary determinant for their\nwalking behavior it would be desirable to also have an assignment method in\npedestrian simulations. To apply existing (road traffic) assignment methods\nwith simulations of pedestrians one has to reduce the nondenumerably many\npossible pedestrian trajectories to a small subset of routes which represent\nthe main, relevant, and significantly distinguished routing alternatives. All\nexcept one of these routes will mark detours, i.e. not the shortest connection\nbetween origin and destination. The proposed assignment method is intended to\nwork with common operational models of pedestrian dynamics. These - as\nmentioned before - usually send pedestrians into the direction of the spatially\nshortest path. Thus, all detouring routes have to be equipped with intermediate\ndestinations, such that pedestrians can do a detour as a piecewise connection\nof segments on which they walk into the direction of the shortest path.

We use three\nvariations on a warehouse task to show that a single planner of this type can\ngenerate cooperative behavior using task allocation, direct communication, and\nsignaling, as appropriate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 16:13:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Amato", "Christopher", ""], ["Konidaris", "George D.", ""], ["Cruz", "Gabriel", ""], ["Maynor", "Christopher A.", ""], ["How", "Jonathan P.", ""], ["Kaelbling", "Leslie P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.3044", "submitter": "Piotr Skowron", "authors": "Piotr Skowron and Piotr Faliszewski and Jerome Lang", "title": "Finding a Collective Set of Items: From Proportional Multirepresentation\n  to Group Recommendation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and\na group of agents (e.g., passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic\nutility for each of the items.
