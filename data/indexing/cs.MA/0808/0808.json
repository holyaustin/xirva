Cognizers\ncan offload some of their cognitive functions onto cognitive technology,\nthereby extending their performance capacity beyond the limits of their own\nbrain power. Language itself is a form of cognitive technology that allows\ncognizers to offload some of their cognitive functions onto the brains of other\ncognizers. Language also extends cognizers' individual and joint performance\npowers, distributing the load through interactive and collaborative cognition.\nReading, writing, print, telecommunications and computing further extend\ncognizers' capacities. And now the web, with its network of cognizers, digital\ndatabases and software agents, all accessible anytime, anywhere, has become our\n'Cognitive Commons,' in which distributed cognizers and cognitive technology\ncan interoperate globally with a speed, scope and degree of interactivity\ninconceivable through local individual cognition alone. And as with language,\nthe cognitive tool par excellence, such technological changes are not merely\ninstrumental and quantitative: they can have profound effects on how we think\nand encode information, on how we communicate with one another, on our mental\nstates, and on our very nature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2008 19:15:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2008 22:50:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 20:34:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dror", "Itiel", ""], ["Harnad", "Stevan", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4060", "submitter": "Wojciech Mazurczyk", "authors": "Krzysztof Szczypiorski, Igor Margasinski, Wojciech Mazurczyk,\n  Krzysztof Cabaj, Pawel Radziszewski", "title": "TrustMAS: Trusted Communication Platform for Multi-Agent Systems", "comments": "18 pages, 7 figures, accepted to The 3rd International Symposium on\n  Information Security (IS'08), Monterrey, Mexico, November 10-11, 2008\n  (Proceedings will be published by Springer LNCS)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper presents TrustMAS - Trusted Communication Platform for Multi-Agent\nSystems, which provides trust and anonymity for mobile agents. The platform\nincludes anonymous technique based on random-walk algorithm for providing\ngeneral purpose anonymous communication for agents. All agents, which take part\nin the proposed platform, benefit from trust and anonymity that is provided for\ntheir interactions. Moreover, in TrustMAS there are StegAgents (SA) that are\nable to perform various steganographic communication. To achieve that goal, SAs\nmay use methods in different layers of TCP/IP model or specialized middleware\nenabling steganography that allows hidden communication through all layers of\nmentioned model. In TrustMAS steganographic channels are used to exchange\nrouting tables between StegAgents. Thus all StegAgents in TrustMAS with their\nability to exchange information by using hidden channels form distributed\nsteganographic router (Stegrouter).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 10:02:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Szczypiorski", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Margasinski", "Igor", ""], ["Mazurczyk", "Wojciech", ""], ["Cabaj", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Radziszewski", "Pawel", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4133", "submitter": "Dmitry Shkatov", "authors": "Valentin Goranko, Dmitry Shkatov", "title": "Tableau-based decision procedure for the multi-agent epistemic logic\n  with operators of common and distributed knowledge", "comments": "To appear in the Proceedings of the 6th IEEE Conference on Software\n  Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM 2008)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/SEFM.2008.27", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop an incremental-tableau-based decision procedure for the\nmulti-agent epistemic logic MAEL(CD) (aka S5_n (CD)), whose language contains\noperators of individual knowledge for a finite set Ag of agents, as well as\noperators of distributed and common knowledge among all agents in Ag.
