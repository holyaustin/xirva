It\nconsiders contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and\ncritical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or\nnight) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node\nand sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to\nperform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context\ninterpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency\ncomprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB).\nContext agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node\nmanager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink\nnode by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager\nagent, fusing agent, and sink black board. A context at the sensor node\ntriggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager\nagent triggers the fusing agent. Fusing agent roams around the network, visits\nactive sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to\nsink. The fusing agent uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is\nsimulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean\nsquare error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery\nusage and agent overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 09:32:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sutagundar", "Ashok V", ""], ["Manvi", "Sunilkumar S", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1477", "submitter": "Arijit  Laha Ph.D.", "authors": "Arijit Laha", "title": "An Agent-based Architecture for a Knowledge-work Support System", "comments": "8 pages, ACM Compute 2011, Bangalore, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Enhancement of technology-based system support for knowledge workers is an\nissue of great importance.

Were it people who moved and outplaced the indigenous hunter-\ngatherer groups or admixed with them? Or was it just material and information\nthat moved-the Neolithic Package-consisting of domesticated plants and animals\nand the knowledge of its use? The latter process is commonly referred to as\ncultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and\npartly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists,\npaleontologists and geneticists a final resolution of the debate has not yet\nbeen reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global\nLand Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES), a mathematical model\nfor regional sociocultural development embedded in the western Eurasian\ngeoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is\nable to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous\nspace-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in\ncontrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also\ndescribes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the\nmodel analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information\nexchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well\nhave arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and\nCentral Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both\ndemic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the\nwestern European transition equally well, (3) [...]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 11:15:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 08:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Lemmen", "Carsten", ""], ["Gronenborn", "Detlef", ""], ["Wirtz", "Kai W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.2187", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "R.

A black\nhole is a harmful stationary process residing in a node of the network and\ndestroying destroys all mobile agents visiting that node without leaving any\ntrace. We consider the more challenging scenario when the agents are identical\nand initially scattered within the network. Moreover, we solve the problem with\nagents that have constant-sized memory and carry a constant number of identical\ntokens, which can be placed at nodes of the network.

This paper solves the problem for ring\nnetworks containing a single black hole. We are interested in the minimum\nresources (number of agents and tokens) necessary for locating all links\nincident to the black hole.
