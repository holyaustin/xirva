This proposal is a\nfirst step towards interoperable mobility mechanisms, which are needed for\nfuture agent migration between different kinds of platforms. Our proposal is\npresented as a flexible and robust architecture that has been successfully\nimplemented in the JADE and AgentScape platforms. It is based on an open set of\nprotocols, allowing new protocols and future improvements to be accommodated in\nthe architecture. With this proposal we demonstrate that a standard\narchitecture for agent mobility capable of supporting several agent platforms\ncan be defined and implemented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2007 14:37:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2007 10:57:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cucurull", "Jordi", ""], ["Marti", "Ramon", ""], ["Robles", "Sergi", ""], ["Borrell", "Joan", ""], ["Navarro", "Guillermo", ""]]}]
