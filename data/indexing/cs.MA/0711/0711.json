Schwartz's tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) ranks among the most\nintriguing, but also among the most enigmatic, tournament solutions that have\nbeen proposed so far in this context. Due to its unwieldy recursive definition,\nlittle is known about TEQ. In particular, its monotonicity remains an open\nproblem up to date. Yet, if TEQ were to satisfy monotonicity, it would be a\nvery attractive tournament solution concept refining both the Banks set and\nDutta's minimal covering set. We show that the problem of deciding whether a\ngiven alternative is contained in TEQ is NP-hard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2007 15:48:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2008 13:47:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Brandt", "Felix", ""], ["Fischer", "Felix", ""], ["Harrenstein", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3915", "submitter": "Soummya Kar", "authors": "Soummya Kar and Jos\\'e M.

Consensus with noise in the network links leads to\nthe bias-variance dilemma--running consensus for long reduces the bias of the\nfinal average estimate but increases its variance. We present two different\ncompromises to this tradeoff: the $\\mathcal{A-ND}$ algorithm modifies\nconventional consensus by forcing the weights to satisfy a \\emph{persistence}\ncondition (slowly decaying to zero); and the $\\mathcal{A-NC}$ algorithm where\nthe weights are constant but consensus is run for a fixed number of iterations\n$\\hat{\\imath}$, then it is restarted and rerun for a total of $\\hat{p}$ runs,\nand at the end averages the final states of the $\\hat{p}$ runs (Monte Carlo\naveraging). We use controlled Markov processes and stochastic approximation\narguments to prove almost sure convergence of $\\mathcal{A-ND}$ to the desired\naverage (asymptotic unbiasedness) and compute explicitly the m.s.e. (variance)\nof the consensus limit. We show that $\\mathcal{A-ND}$ represents the best of\nboth worlds--low bias and low variance--at the cost of a slow convergence rate;\nrescaling the weights...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Nov 2007 18:19:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Sep 2008 02:29:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jos\u00e9 M.

Among the systems with a polynomial-time\nwinner problem, this is the first natural election system proven to have full\nresistance to constructive control. Results on bribery and fixed-parameter\ntractability of bounded-case control proven for Copeland^0 and Copeland^1 in\n[FHHR07] are extended to Copeland^alpha for each rational alpha, 0 < alpha < 1;\nwe also give results in more flexible models such as microbribery and extended\ncontrol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 16:12:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2007 17:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Faliszewski", "Piotr", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Edith", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Lane A.", ""], ["Rothe", "J\u00f6rg", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4924", "submitter": "Piotr Faliszewski", "authors": "Piotr Faliszewski", "title": "Nonuniform Bribery", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "URCS TR-2007-922", "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.MA", "license": null, "abstract": "  We study the concept of bribery in the situation where voters are willing to\nchange their votes as we ask them, but where their prices depend on the nature\nof the change we request.
