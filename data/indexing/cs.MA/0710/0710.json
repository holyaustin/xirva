The objective is to minimize the power expenditure of each user\nsubject to satisfying individual user delay. We make the practical assumption\nthat the system statistics are unknown, i.e., the probability distributions of\nthe user arrivals and channel states are unknown. The problem has the structure\nof a Constrained Markov Decision Problem (CMDP). Determining an optimal policy\nunder for the CMDP faces the problems of state space explosion and unknown\nsystem statistics. To tackle the problem of state space explosion, we suggest\ndetermining the transmission rate of a particular user in each slot based on\nits channel condition and buffer occupancy only. The rate allocation algorithm\nfor a particular user is a learning algorithm that learns about the buffer\noccupancy and channel states of that user during system execution and thus\naddresses the issue of unknown system statistics. Once the rate of each user is\ndetermined, the proposed algorithm schedules the user with the best rate. Our\nsimulations within an IEEE 802.16 system demonstrate that the algorithm is\nindeed able to satisfy the user specified delay constraints. We compare the\nperformance of our algorithm with the well known M-LWDF algorithm. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the power expended by the users under our algorithm is quite\nlow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Oct 2007 12:51:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Salodkar", "Nitin", ""], ["Karandikar", "Abhay", ""], ["Borkar", "Vivek S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.2659", "submitter": "Julien Hendrickx", "authors": "Julien M.

We first analyze the rigidity and\npersistence of meta-formations, which are formations obtained by connecting\nseveral rigid or persistent formations. Persistence is a generalization to\ndirected graphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving\nautonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a\ndirected structure of unilateral distance constraints seeking to preserve a\nformation shape. We derive then, for agents evolving in a two- or\nthree-dimensional space, the conditions under which a set of persistent\nformations can be merged into a persistent meta-formation, and give the minimal\nnumber of interconnections needed for such a merging. We also give conditions\nfor a meta-formation obtained by merging several persistent formations to be\npersistent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Oct 2007 13:51:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hendrickx", "Julien M.", ""], ["Yu", "Changbin", ""], ["Fidan", "Baris", ""], ["Anderson", "Brian D.
