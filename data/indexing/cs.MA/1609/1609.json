Our main contribution here is to\nwrite the reactive potential field based motion controller as a hybrid\nautomaton, and then formally verify its safety using differential dynamic\nlogic. In particular, we can guarantee a passive safety property, which means\nthat collisions cannot occur if the robot is to blame, namely a collision can\noccur only if the robot is at rest.
