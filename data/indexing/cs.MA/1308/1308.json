We describe an instantiation\nwhere a mobile robotic network is dynamically reconfigured to ensure high\nquality routes between static wireless nodes, which act as source/destination\npairs for information flow. The ICP commands the robots towards evenly\ndistributed inter-flow allocations, with intra-flow configurations that\nmaximize route quality. The PCP then guides the robots via potential-based\ncontrol to reconfigure according to ICP commands. This formulation, deemed\nRoute Swarm, decouples information flow and physical control, generating a\nfeedback between routing and sensing needs and robotic configuration.
