We then present the MANCaLog language, a formalism\nbased on logic programming that satisfies all these desiderata, and focus on\nalgorithms for finding minimal models (from which the outcome of cascades can\nbe obtained) as well as how this formalism can be applied in real world\nscenarios. We are not aware of any other formalism in the literature that meets\nall of the above requirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 20:01:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Jan 2013 01:54:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Shakarian", "Paulo", ""], ["Simari", "Gerardo I.", ""], ["Schroeder", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.0647", "submitter": "Mani A", "authors": "A.

In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a\nnovel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems\noperating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services,\nthe semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which\nartifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for\nartifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a\nquantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the\nagents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in\ngeneral. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one\nsemantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore\nreduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these\nassumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is\nEXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and\ndeclarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system\nand the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state\nsystems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on\nfinite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally\nwe exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream\nprocurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Jan 2013 11:45:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 09:22:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Belardinelli", "Francesco", ""], ["Lomuscio", "Alessio", ""], ["Patrizi", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3347", "submitter": "Michalis Smyrnakis", "authors": "Michalis Smyrnakis", "title": "Multi-agent learning using Fictitious Play and Extended Kalman Filter", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Decentralised optimisation tasks are important components of multi-agent\nsystems.

We present a novel variant of fictitious play where\nplayers predict their opponents' strategies using Extended Kalman filters and\nuse their predictions to update their strategies.\n  We show that in 2 by 2 games with at least one pure Nash equilibrium and in\npotential games where players have two available actions, the proposed\nalgorithm converges to the pure Nash equilibrium. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm was empirically tested, in two strategic form games and an\nad-hoc sensor network surveillance problem.
