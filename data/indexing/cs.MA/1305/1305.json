For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC). In this paper, we provide the first set of\ntheoretical properties for regret minimization algorithms in non-zero-sum games\nby proving that solutions eliminate iterative strict domination. We formally\ndefine \\emph{dominated actions} in extensive-form games, show that CFR avoids\niteratively strictly dominated actions and strategies, and demonstrate that\nremoving iteratively dominated actions is enough to win a mock tournament in a\nsmall poker game. In addition, for two-player non-zero-sum games, we bound the\nworst case performance and show that in practice, regret minimization can yield\nstrategies very close to equilibrium. Our theoretical advancements lead us to a\nnew modification of CFR for games with more than two players that is more\nefficient and may be used to generate stronger strategies than previously\npossible. Furthermore, we present a new three-player Texas Hold'em poker agent\nthat was built using CFR and a novel game decomposition method. Our new agent\nwins the three-player events of the 2012 ACPC and defeats the winning\nthree-player programs from previous competitions while requiring less resources\nto generate than the 2011 winner. Finally, we show that our CFR modification\ncomputes a strategy of equal quality to our new agent in a quarter of the time\nof standard CFR using half the memory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 21:54:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gibson", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0943", "submitter": "Lane A.

This exploration task is formalized by Low,\nDolan, and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under\nuncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP\napproximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in\nlarge-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this\ncomputational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach\nto MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the\ncost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity\nbecomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot\nteam size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the\nreward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy\nsampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also\nallows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage\nof optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of\napproximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and\nempirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the\nlog-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process\nin mapping the hotspot field.

The formula shows that localization accuracy is approximately\ninversely proportional to the average degree, and a higher ratio of average\nanchor degree to average sensor degree yields better localization accuracy.\nFurthermore, the paper demonstrates a strong connection between LB-E-AGDOP and\nthe best achievable accuracy.
