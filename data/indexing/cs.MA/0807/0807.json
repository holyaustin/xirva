We give a new proof of\nconvergence into clusters of agents, with all agents in the same cluster\nholding the same opinion. We then introduce a particular notion of equilibrium\nstability and provide lower bounds on the inter-cluster distances at a stable\nequilibrium. To better understand the behavior of the system when the number of\nagents is large, we also introduce and study a variant involving a continuum of\nagents, obtaining partial convergence results and lower bounds on inter-cluster\ndistances, under some mild assumptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jul 2008 12:33:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Jan 2009 22:47:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2009 16:45:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2009 21:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Blondel", "Vincent D.", ""], ["Hendrickx", "Julien M.", ""], ["Tsitsiklis", "John N.", ""]]}]
