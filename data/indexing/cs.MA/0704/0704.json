We relax this assumption by considering extensive\ngames where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In\nparticular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.\nWe show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game\nfrom the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We\nprovide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with\nawareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results\nto games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a\nplayer j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where\npayers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs\nare incompatible with a common prior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2007 13:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Halpern", "Joseph Y.", ""], ["R\u00eago", "Leandro C.", ""]]}]
