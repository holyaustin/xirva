The modeling processes\nwere supported by a conceptual corpus regarding systems dynamics, multi-agent\nsystems, graph theory, and, particularly, the information theory. Besides to\nthe specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of\nagents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity\nof such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with\nemergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were\ndefined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was\ncarried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and\necological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development\nof a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger\nset of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in\nquestioning essential issues associated with the DS field. All this was\nachieved from a simple base of calculation and interpretation, which does not\nrequire advanced mathematical knowledge, and facilitates their application in\ndifferent fields of science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 17:01:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fernandez", "Nelson", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.01380", "submitter": "Okan A\\c{s}{\\i}k", "authors": "Okan A\\c{s}{\\i}k and H.

Their evolution cannot be understood by looking at the dynamics\nof urban aggregations and transportation systems separately. Instead, existing\nbuilt-up areas feed back on the further development of transportation\nstructures, and the availability of the latter feeds back on the future growth\nof urban aggregations. To model this co-evolution, we propose an agent-based\napproach that builds on existing agent-based models for the evolution of trail\nsystems and of urban settlements. The key element in these separate approaches\nis a generalized communication of agents by means of an adaptive landscape.\nThis landscape is only generated by the agents, but once it exists, it feeds\nback on their further actions. The emerging trail system or urban aggregation\nresults as a self-organized structure from these collective interactions. In\nour co-evolutionary approach, we couple these two separate models by means of\nmeta-agents that represent humans with their different demands for housing and\nmobility.
