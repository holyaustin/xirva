We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and\nshow that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we\nprove to be essentially optimal.

Each node obtains a value in [k] equal to its d-ary\nfunction applied to the values of its d children. The output is the value of\nthe root. We show that the standard black pebbling algorithm applied to the\nbinary tree of height h yields a deterministic k-way branching program with\nTheta(k^h) states solving this problem, and we prove that this upper bound is\ntight for h=2 and h=3. We introduce a simple semantic restriction called\n\"thrifty\" on k-way branching programs solving tree evaluation problems and show\nthat the same state bound of Theta(k^h) is tight (up to a constant factor) for\nall h >= 2 for deterministic thrifty programs. We introduce fractional pebbling\nfor trees and show that this yields nondeterministic thrifty programs with\nTheta(k^{h/2+1}) states solving the Boolean problem \"determine whether the root\nhas value 1\". We prove that this bound is tight for h=2,3,4, and tight for\nunrestricted nondeterministic k-way branching programs for h=2,3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 May 2010 00:23:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cook", "Stephen", ""], ["McKenzie", "Pierre", ""], ["Wehr", "Dustin", ""], ["Braverman", "Mark", ""], ["Santhanam", "Rahul", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.2678", "submitter": "Martin Dyer", "authors": "Andrei Bulatov, Martin Dyer, Leslie Ann Goldberg, Markus Jalsenius,\n  Mark Jerrum and David Richerby", "title": "The complexity of weighted and unweighted #CSP", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": "JCSS 2012", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give some reductions among problems in (nonnegative) weighted #CSP which\nrestrict the class of functions that needs to be considered in computational\ncomplexity studies.
