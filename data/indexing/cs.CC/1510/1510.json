Little is known about the power of this class. The only\nproposed approach for establishing upper bounds is based on a hierarchy of\nsemidefinite programs introduced independently by Pironio et al. and Doherty et\nal. This hierarchy converges to a value that is only known to coincide with the\nprovers' maximum success probability in a given proof system under a plausible\nbut difficult mathematical conjecture, Connes' embedding conjecture. No bounds\non the rate of convergence are known.\n  We introduce a rounding scheme for the hierarchy, establishing that any\nsolution to its $N$-th level can be mapped to a strategy for the provers in\nwhich measurement operators associated with distinct provers have pairwise\ncommutator bounded by $O(\\ell^2/\\sqrt{N})$ in operator norm, where $\\ell$ is\nthe number of possible answers per prover.\n  Our rounding scheme motivates the introduction of a variant of $\\MIP^*$,\ncalled $\\MIP_\\delta^*$, in which the soundness property is required to hold as\nlong as the commutator of operations performed by distinct provers has norm at\nmost $\\delta$. Our rounding scheme implies the upper bound $\\MIP_\\delta^*\n\\subseteq \\DTIME(\\exp(\\exp(\\poly)/\\delta^2))$. In terms of lower bounds we\nestablish that $\\MIP^*_{2^{-\\poly}}$, with completeness $1$ and soundness\n$1-2^{-\\poly}$, contains $\\NEXP$. The relationship of $\\MIP_\\delta^*$ to\n$\\MIPstar$ has connections with the mathematical literature on approximate\ncommutation. Our rounding scheme gives an elementary proof that the Strong\nKirchberg Conjecture implies that $\\MIPstar$ is computable.

This theory\nprovides a formal foundation for understanding the tractability of query\nclasses in the context of big data. Along this line, we introduce a novel\nnotion of $\\sqcap'$-tractability in this paper. Inspired by some technologies\nused to deal big data, we place a restriction on preprocessing function, which\nlimits the function to produce a relatively small database as output, at most\npolylog-size of the input database. At the same time, we bound the redundancy\ninformation when re-factorizing data and queries for preprocessing. These\nchanges aim to make our theory more closely linked to practice. We set two\ncomplexity classes to denote the classes of Boolean queries that are\n$\\sqcap'$-tractable themselves and that can be made $\\sqcap'$-tractable,\nrespectively. Based on a new factorization in our complexity classes, we\ninvestigate two reductions, which differ from whether allowing re-factorizing\ndata and query parts. We verify the transitive and compatible properties of the\nreductions and analysis the complete problems and sizes of the complexity\nclasses. We conclude that all PTIME classes of Boolean queries can be made\n$\\sqcap'$-tractable, similar to that of the $\\sqcap$-tractability theory. With\na little surprise, we prove that the set of all $\\sqcap'$-tractable queries is\nstrictly smaller than that of all $\\sqcap$-tractable queries, and thus the set\nof $\\sqcap'$-tractable queries is properly contained in that of PTIME queries.\nIn this way, we attain a new complexity class inside the complexity class of\nPTIME queries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 13:43:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jiannan", ""], ["Wang", "Hanpin", ""], ["Cao", "Yongzhi", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.00354", "submitter": "Min Jae Song", "authors": "Stella Biderman, Kevin Cuddy, Ang Li, Min Jae Song", "title": "On the Sensitivity of k-Uniform Hypergraph Properties", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a graph property with sensitivity\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, where $n={v\\choose2}$ is the number of variables, and\ngeneralize it to a $k$-uniform hypergraph property with sensitivity\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, where $n={v\\choose k}$ is again the number of variables.\nThis yields the smallest sensitivity yet achieved for a $k$-uniform hypergraph\nproperty.

We focus on a broad class of\nvaluations shown to have the Weak-Equilibrium-for-Expectation property, which\nwe exploit to prove two main complexity results, the first of their kind, for\nthe two simplest cases of the problem: games with two strategies, or games with\ntwo players. For each case, we show that deciding the existence of a\n${\\mathsf{V}}$-equilibrium is strongly ${\\mathcal{NP}}$-hard for certain\nchoices of significant valuations (including variance and standard deviation).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 06:31:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mavronicolas", "Marios", ""], ["Monien", "Burkhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09193", "submitter": "Leslie Ann Goldberg", "authors": "Ivona Bezakova, Andreas Galanis, Leslie Ann Goldberg, Heng Guo, Daniel\n  Stefankovic", "title": "Approximation via Correlation Decay when Strong Spatial Mixing Fails", "comments": "To appear in SICOMP", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Approximate counting via correlation decay is the core algorithmic technique\nused in the sharp delineation of the computational phase transition that arises\nin the approximation of the partition function of anti-ferromagnetic two-spin\nmodels.\n  Previous analyses of correlation-decay algorithms implicitly depended on the\noccurrence of strong spatial mixing (SSM). This means that one uses worst-case\nanalysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop\na new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We\ntake the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and\namortise against certain \"bad\" instances that are created as the recursion\nproceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even\nwhen SSM fails.\n  We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent\nsets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on\nthe arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k>=2 and Delta<=5 (lack\nof SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to\nDelta=6). Our technique gives a tight result for Delta=6, showing that there is\nan FPTAS for k>=3 and Delta<=6. The best previously-known approximation scheme\nfor Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and\nKarpinski, which only works for k>=8.\n  Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for\nk>=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised\nresults in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic\napproximation scheme in this regime. Moreover, unlike existing results, it\nleads to an FPTAS for counting dominating sets in regular graphs with\nsufficiently large degree.\n  We further demonstrate that approximately counting independent sets in\nhypergraphs is NP-hard even within the uniqueness regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 18:38:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 14:45:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 20:52:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 13:02:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 14:47:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bezakova", "Ivona", ""], ["Galanis", "Andreas", ""], ["Goldberg", "Leslie Ann", ""], ["Guo", "Heng", ""], ["Stefankovic", "Daniel", ""]]}]
