Originally NP was defined as the\nclass of problems solvable in polynomial time by a NDTM in the theorem of Cook,\nwhere the NDTM was represented as Query Machine of essence Oracle. Later a\nmodel consisting of a guessing module and a checking module was proposed to\nreplace the NDTM. This model of essence TM has a fundamental difference from\nthe NDTM of essence Oracle, but people still use the term NDTM to designate\nthis model, which leads to the disguised displacement of NDTM and produces out\nthe verifier-based definition of NP as the class of problems verifiable in\npolynomial time by a TM (Turing Machine). This verifier-based one has been then\naccepted as the standard definition of NP where comes from the famous\nequivalence of the two definitions of NP. Since then the notion of\nnondeterminism is lost from NP, which causes ambiguities in understanding NP\nand then great difficulties in solving the P versus NP problem. Since NP is\noriginally related with Oracle that comes from the work of Turing work about\nComputability, it seems quite necessary to trace back to the work of Turing and\nclarify further the issue about NP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 17:41:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "JianMing", ""], ["Li", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.00544", "submitter": "Nikhil Mande", "authors": "Mark Bun, Nikhil S.

More generally, our algorithm computes an $\\epsilon$-spectral\napproximation to the normalized Laplacian of the $r$-step walk.\n  Our algorithm combines the derandomized square graph operation (Rozenman and\nVadhan, 2005), which we recently used for solving Laplacian systems in nearly\nlogarithmic space (Murtagh, Reingold, Sidford, and Vadhan, 2017), with ideas\nfrom (Cheng, Cheng, Liu, Peng, and Teng, 2015), which gave an algorithm that is\ntime-efficient (while ours is space-efficient) and randomized (while ours is\ndeterministic) for the case of even $r$ (while ours works for all $r$). Along\nthe way, we provide some new results that generalize technical machinery and\nyield improvements over previous work. First, we obtain a nearly linear-time\nrandomized algorithm for computing a spectral approximation to the normalized\nLaplacian for odd $r$. Second, we define and analyze a generalization of the\nderandomized square for irregular graphs and for sparsifying the product of two\ndistinct graphs. As part of this generalization, we also give a strongly\nexplicit construction of expander graphs of every size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 04:58:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2019 02:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Murtagh", "Jack", ""], ["Reingold", "Omer", ""], ["Sidford", "Aaron", ""], ["Vadhan", "Salil", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.06579", "submitter": "Cl\\'ement Dallard", "authors": "Cristina Bazgan, Janka Chleb\\'ikov\\'a, Cl\\'ement Dallard, Thomas\n  Pontoizeau", "title": "Proportionally dense subgraph of maximum size: complexity and\n  approximation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Discrete Applied Mathematics, Volume 270, 2019, Pages 25-36", "doi": "10.1016/j.dam.2019.07.010", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We define a proportionally dense subgraph (PDS) as an induced subgraph of a\ngraph with the property that each vertex in the PDS is adjacent to\nproportionally as many vertices in the subgraph as in the graph.

We first show a sharp quantitative\nform of a theorem which says that if an affine space $U$ is $\\delta$-far in\nrelative Hamming distance from a linear code $V$ - this is the worst-case\nassumption - then most elements of $U$ are almost $\\delta$-far from $V$ - this\nis the average case. This leads to an optimal analysis of the soundness of the\nFRI protocol of [Ben-Sasson, et.al., eprint 2018] for proving proximity to\nReed-Solomon codes.\n  To further improve soundness, we sample outside the box. We suggest a new\nprotocol which asks a prover for values of a polynomial at points outside the\ndomain of evaluation of the Reed-Solomon code. We call this technique Domain\nExtending for Eliminating Pretenders (DEEP).\n  We use the DEEP technique to devise two new protocols: (1) An Interactive\nOracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for RS codes, called DEEP-FRI. This soundness\nof the protocol improves upon that of the FRI protocol while retaining linear\narithmetic proving complexity and logarithmic verifier arithmetic complexity.\n(2) An Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP) for the Algebraic Linking IOP (ALI)\nprotocol used to construct zero knowledge scalable transparent arguments of\nknowledge (ZK-STARKs) in [Ben-Sasson et al., eprint 2018]. The new protocol,\ncalled DEEP-ALI, improves soundness of this crucial step from a small constant\n$< 1/8$ to a constant arbitrarily close to $1$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 20:03:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ben-Sasson", "Eli", ""], ["Goldberg", "Lior", ""], ["Kopparty", "Swastik", ""], ["Saraf", "Shubhangi", ""]]}]
