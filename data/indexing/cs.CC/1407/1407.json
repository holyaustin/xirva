Recently, Curticapean [ICALP 2013] proved the\n#W[1]-hardness of counting $k$-matchings in general graphs; our result\nstrengthens this statement to bipartite graphs with a considerably simpler\nproof and even shows that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH),\nthere is no $f(k)n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ time algorithm for counting $k$-matchings in\nbipartite graphs for any computable function $f(k)$. As a consequence, we\nobtain an independent and somewhat simpler proof of the classical result of\nFlum and Grohe [SICOMP 2004] stating that counting paths of length $k$ is\n#W[1]-hard, as well as a similar almost-tight ETH-based lower bound on the\nexponent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 19:59:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Curticapean", "Radu", ""], ["Marx", "D\u00e1niel", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.3130", "submitter": "Toby Walsh", "authors": "Toby Walsh", "title": "Allocation in Practice", "comments": "To appear in Proc. of 37th edition of the German Conference on\n  Artificial Intelligence (KI 2014), Springer LNCS", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How do we allocate scarcere sources?
