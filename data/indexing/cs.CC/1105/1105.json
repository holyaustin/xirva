However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.\nThere are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend to merely\nbe nearly single-peaked. This paper studies the complexity of\nmanipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked\nelectorates, for various notions of nearness and various election systems. We\nprovide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action\ncomplexity up to $\\np$-hardness, but we also provide many instances where a\nreasonable number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the\nmanipulative-action complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 14:12:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 13:59:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Faliszewski", "Piotr", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Edith", ""], ["Hemaspaandra", "Lane A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5131", "submitter": "Daniel \\v{S}tefankovi\\v{c}", "authors": "Andreas Galanis, Qi Ge, Daniel Stefankovic, Eric Vigoda, Linji Yang", "title": "Improved Inapproximability Results for Counting Independent Sets in the\n  Hard-Core Model", "comments": "to appear in Random Structures and Algorithms", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the computational complexity of approximately counting the number of\nindependent sets of a graph with maximum degree Delta. More generally, for an\ninput graph G=(V,E) and an activity lambda>0, we are interested in the quantity\nZ_G(lambda) defined as the sum over independent sets I weighted as w(I) =\nlambda^|I|. In statistical physics, Z_G(lambda) is the partition function for\nthe hard-core model, which is an idealized model of a gas where the particles\nhave non-negibile size.\n  Recently, an interesting phase transition was shown to occur for the\ncomplexity of approximating the partition function. Weitz showed an FPAS for\nthe partition function for any graph of maximum degree Delta when Delta is\nconstant and lambda< lambda_c(Tree_Delta):=(Delta-1)^(Delta-1)/(Delta-2)^Delta.\nThe quantity lambda_c(Tree_Delta) is the critical point for the so-called\nuniqueness threshold on the infinite, regular tree of degree Delta. On the\nother side, Sly proved that there does not exist efficient (randomized)\napproximation algorithms for lambda_c(Tree_Delta) < lambda <\nlambda_c(Tree_Delta)+epsilon(Delta), unless NP=RP, for some function\nepsilon(Delta)>0. We remove the upper bound in the assumptions of Sly's result\nfor Delta not equal to 4 and 5, that is, we show that there does not exist\nefficient randomized approximation algorithms for all\nlambda>lambda_c(Tree_Delta) for Delta=3 and Delta>= 6.

We extend\nSly's result by improving upon the technical work of Mossel et al., via a more\ndetailed analysis of independent sets in random regular graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 19:56:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2011 13:22:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 19:04:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Galanis", "Andreas", ""], ["Ge", "Qi", ""], ["Stefankovic", "Daniel", ""], ["Vigoda", "Eric", ""], ["Yang", "Linji", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5806", "submitter": "Michael Viderman", "authors": "Michael Viderman", "title": "A Combination of Testability and Decodability by Tensor Products", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ben-Sasson and Sudan (RSA 2006) showed that repeated tensor products of\nlinear codes with a very large distance are locally testable.
