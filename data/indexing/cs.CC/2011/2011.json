The problem of testing proximity to an\nerror-correcting code $C$ consists in distinguishing between the case where an\ninput word, given as an oracle, belongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from\nevery codeword of $C$. AG codes are good candidates to construct short proof\nsystems, but there exists no efficient proximity tests for them.

Beyond a\nfield of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require\nefficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision\nproblem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,\nbelieved to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for\nthe worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of\nBoolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the\nworst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a\nmemory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its\nnon-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows\nevidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving \"hard\"\nplanted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve\nin the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the\nSAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an\nexponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to\nthe collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that\npersist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even\nin the presence of numerical errors.

Together with a previous work\nregarding improperly learning a ReLU (Goel et al., COLT'17), this implies the\nfirst separation between proper and improper algorithms for learning a ReLU. We\nalso study the problem of properly learning a depth-2 network of ReLUs with\nbounded weights giving new (worst-case) upper bounds on the running time needed\nto learn such networks both in the realizable and agnostic settings. Our upper\nbounds on the running time essentially matches our lower bounds in terms of the\ndependency on $\\epsilon$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2020 04:18:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Goel", "Surbhi", ""], ["Klivans", "Adam", ""], ["Manurangsi", "Pasin", ""], ["Reichman", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.14192", "submitter": "Amatya Sharma", "authors": "Palash Dey, Arnab Maiti and Amatya Sharma", "title": "On Parameterized Complexity of Liquid Democracy", "comments": "Submitted to 7th Annual International Conference on Algorithms and\n  Discrete Applied Mathematics [CALDAM 2021]", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.CY cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In liquid democracy, each voter either votes herself or delegates her vote to\nsome other voter. This gives rise to what is called a delegation graph. To\ndecide the voters who eventually votes along with the subset of voters whose\nvotes they give, we need to resolve the cycles in the delegation graph. This\ngives rise to the Resolve Delegation problem where we need to find an acyclic\nsub-graph of the delegation graph such that the number of voters whose votes\nthey give is bounded above by some integer {\\lambda}. Putting a cap on the\nnumber of voters whose votes a voter gives enable the system designer restrict\nthe power of any individual voter. The Resolve Delegation problem is already\nknown to be NP-hard. In this paper we study the parameterized complexity of\nthis problem. We show that Resolve Delegation is para-NP-hard with respect to\nparameters {\\lambda}, number of sink nodes and the maximum degree of the\ndelegation graph. We also show that Resolve Delegation is W[1]-hard even with\nrespect to the treewidth of the delegation graph. We complement our negative\nresults by exhibiting FPT algorithms with respect to some other parameters. We\nfinally show that a related problem, which we call Resolve Fractional\nDelegation, is polynomial time solvable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2020 18:48:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Palash", ""], ["Maiti", "Arnab", ""], ["Sharma", "Amatya", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.14490", "submitter": "Erlend Raa V{\\aa}gset", "authors": "Nello Blaser, Erlend Raa V{\\aa}gset", "title": "Homology Localization Through the Looking-Glass of Parameterized\n  Complexity Theory", "comments": "30 pages, 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.CC math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Finding a cycle of lowest weight that represents a homology class in a\nsimplicial complex is known as homology localization (HL).

For each $v \\in V(G)$, the indegree of $v$ in $D$, denoted by\n$d^-_D(v)$, is the number of arcs with head $v$ in $D$. An orientation $D$ of\n$G$ is proper if $d^-_D(u)\\neq d^-_D(v)$, for all $uv\\in E(G)$. An orientation\nwith maximum indegree at most $k$ is called a $k$-orientation.

When parameterizing by $k$, we argue that\nthis problem is FPT for chordal graphs and argue that no polynomial kernel\nexists, unless $NP\\subseteq coNP/\\ poly$. We present a better kernel to the\nsubclass of split graphs and a linear kernel to the class of cobipartite\ngraphs.\n  Concerning bounds, we prove tight upper bounds for subclasses of block\ngraphs.

Actually, we prove a general bound stating that any\ngraph $G$ having no adjacent vertices of degree at least $c+1$ have proper\norientation number at most $c$. This implies new classes of (outer)planar\ngraphs with bounded proper orientation number. We also prove that maximal\nouterplanar graphs $G$ whose weak-dual is a path satisfy\n$\\overrightarrow{\\chi}(G)\\leq 13$.
