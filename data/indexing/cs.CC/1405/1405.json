We\nstudy the notion of $\\mathit{approximate}$ $\\mathit{resilience}$ of Boolean\nfunctions, where we say that $f$ is $\\alpha$-approximately $d$-resilient if $f$\nis $\\alpha$-close to a $[-1,1]$-valued $d$-resilient function in $\\ell_1$\ndistance. We show that approximate resilience essentially characterizes the\ncomplexity of agnostic learning of a concept class $C$ over the uniform\ndistribution. Roughly speaking, if all functions in a class $C$ are far from\nbeing $d$-resilient then $C$ can be learned agnostically in time $n^{O(d)}$ and\nconversely, if $C$ contains a function close to being $d$-resilient then\nagnostic learning of $C$ in the statistical query (SQ) framework of Kearns has\ncomplexity of at least $n^{\\Omega(d)}$. This characterization is based on the\nduality between $\\ell_1$ approximation by degree-$d$ polynomials and\napproximate $d$-resilience that we establish. In particular, it implies that\n$\\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials, known to be sufficient for\nagnostic learning over product distributions, is in fact necessary.\n  Focusing on monotone Boolean functions, we exhibit the existence of\nnear-optimal $\\alpha$-approximately\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\alpha\\sqrt{n})$-resilient monotone functions for all\n$\\alpha>0$. Prior to our work, it was conceivable even that every monotone\nfunction is $\\Omega(1)$-far from any $1$-resilient function. Furthermore, we\nconstruct simple, explicit monotone functions based on ${\\sf Tribes}$ and ${\\sf\nCycleRun}$ that are close to highly resilient functions. Our constructions are\nbased on a fairly general resilience analysis and amplification. These\nstructural results, together with the characterization, imply nearly optimal\nlower bounds for agnostic learning of monotone juntas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 May 2014 00:06:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Jul 2014 19:16:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dachman-Soled", "Dana", ""], ["Feldman", "Vitaly", ""], ["Tan", "Li-Yang", ""], ["Wan", "Andrew", ""], ["Wimmer", "Karl", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5606", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Henning Fernau (Universit\\\"at Trier, Germany), Rudolf Freund (TU Wien,\n  Austria), Markus Holzer (Universit\\\"at Gie{\\ss}en, Germany)", "title": "Cooperating Distributed Grammar Systems of Finite Index Working in\n  Hybrid Modes", "comments": "In Proceedings AFL 2014, arXiv:1405.5272", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 151, 2014, pp. 246-260", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.151.17", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study cooperating distributed grammar systems working in hybrid modes in\nconnection with the finite index restriction in two different ways: firstly, we\ninvestigate cooperating distributed grammar systems working in hybrid modes\nwhich characterize programmed grammars with the finite index restriction;\nlooking at the number of components of such systems, we obtain surprisingly\nrich lattice structures for the inclusion relations between the corresponding\nlanguage families.

Varying $S$ yields\ndifferent models of computation, which we may investigate to better understand\nthe (likely) difference in power between randomised and quantum computation.\nThe \"modal quantum states\" of Schumacher and Westmoreland [arXiv:1010.2929] are\nexamples of such distributions, for $S$ a finite field. For $S = \\mathbb F_2$,\nWillcock and Sabry [arXiv:1102.3587] show that UNIQUE-SAT is solvable by\npolynomial-time uniform circuit families consisting of invertible gates. We\ncharacterize the decision problems solvable by polynomial uniform circuit\nfamilies, using either invertible or \"unitary\" transformations over cyclic\nrings $S = \\mathbb Z_k$, or (in the case that $k$ is a prime power) finite\nfields $S = \\mathbb F_k$. In particular, for $k$ a prime power, these are\nprecisely the problems in the class $\\mathsf{Mod}_k\\mathsf P$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2014 20:01:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 20:29:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["de Beaudrap", "Niel", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7596", "submitter": "Michal Jastrzebski", "authors": "Micha{\\l} Jastrz\\k{e}bski", "title": "On total communication complexity of collapsing protocols for pointer\n  jumping problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on bounding the total communication complexity of\ncollapsing protocols for multiparty pointer jumping problem ($MPJ_k^n$).

In\n1976, Knuth asked whether the worst-case running time can be improved in a\nmodel of computation that does not require sequential access to the whole\ninput. A partial negative answer was given by Ng and Hirschberg, who showed\nthat $\\Theta(n^2)$ queries are required in a model that allows certain natural\nrandom-access queries to the participants' preferences. A significantly more\ngeneral - albeit slightly weaker - lower bound follows from Segal's general\nanalysis of communication complexity, namely that $\\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries\nare required in order to find a stable marriage, regardless of the set of\nallowed Boolean queries.\n  Using a reduction to the communication complexity of the disjointness\nproblem, we give a far simpler, yet significantly more powerful argument\nshowing that $\\Omega(n^2)$ Boolean queries of any type are indeed required for\nfinding a stable - or even an approximately stable - marriage. Notably, unlike\nSegal's lower bound, our lower bound generalizes also to (A) randomized\nalgorithms, (B) allowing arbitrary separate preprocessing of the women's\npreferences profile and of the men's preferences profile, (C) several variants\nof the basic problem, such as whether a given pair is married in every/some\nstable marriage, and (D) determining whether a proposed marriage is stable or\nfar from stable. In order to analyze \"approximately stable\" marriages, we\nintroduce the notion of \"distance to stability\" and provide an efficient\nalgorithm for its computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 20:09:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 19:36:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 09:03:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Nov 2017 09:49:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 10:58:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Gonczarowski", "Yannai A.", ""], ["Nisan", "Noam", ""], ["Ostrovsky", "Rafail", ""], ["Rosenbaum", "Will", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7849", "submitter": "Farid Ablayev", "authors": "Farid Ablayev, Aida Gainutdinova, Kamil Khadiev, Abuzer Yakarylmaz", "title": "Very narrow quantum OBDDs and width hierarchies for classical OBDDs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present several results on comparative complexity for different variants\nof OBDD models.\n  - We present some results on comparative complexity of classical and quantum\nOBDDs.
