By a result of Hell and\nNe\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite graph $H$. In\nthe context of promise constraint satisfaction problems, Brakensiek and\nGuruswami conjectured that this hardness result extends to promise graph\nhomomorphism as follows: fix any non-bipartite graph $H$ and another graph $G$\nwith a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, it is NP-hard to find a homomorphism to\n$G$ from a given $H$-colourable graph. Arguably, the two most important special\ncases of this conjecture are when $H$ is fixed to be the complete graph on 3\nvertices (and $G$ is any graph with a triangle) and when $G$ is the complete\ngraph on 3 vertices (and $H$ is any 3-colourable graph). The former case is\nequivalent to the notoriously difficult approximate graph colouring problem.

The former also implies standard Herbrand-style conclusions, which\neventually leads to PSPACE-decidability of PDL-validity of $S$, provided that\n$P$ is atomic and $A$ is in a suitable \\emph{basic conjunctive normal form}.\nFurthermore we consider star-free formulas $A$ in dual \\emph{basic disjunctive\nnormal form}, and corresponding expansions $S=\\left\\langle P^{\\ast\n}\\right\\rangle \\!A\\vee Z$ whose PDL-validity problem is known to be\nEXPTIME-complete.

For example, for vertex coloring in $d$-regular graphs it is\nnow known that this jump is at precisely $d$ colors: coloring with $d+1$ colors\nis easy, while coloring with $d$ colors is hard.\n  However, it is currently poorly understood where this jump takes place when\none looks at defective colorings. To study this question, we define $k$-partial\n$c$-coloring as follows: nodes are labeled with numbers between $1$ and $c$,\nand every node is incident to at least $k$ properly colored edges.\n  It is known that $1$-partial $2$-coloring (a.k.a. weak $2$-coloring) is easy\nfor any $d \\ge 1$.

Our main results are that every such OMQ is in AC0,\nNL-complete, or PTime-complete and that containment in NL coincides with\nrewritability into linear Datalog (whereas containment in AC0 coincides with\nrewritability into first-order logic). We establish natural characterizations\nof the three cases in terms of bounded depth and (un)bounded pathwidth, and\nshow that every of the associated meta problems such as deciding wether a given\nOMQ is rewritable into linear Datalog is ExpTime-complete. We also give a way\nto construct linear Datalog rewritings when they exist and prove that there is\nno constant Datalog rewritings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 09:34:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Lutz", "Carsten", ""], ["Sabellek", "Leif", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12747", "submitter": "Konstantin Golubev", "authors": "Irit Dinur and Konstantin Golubev", "title": "Direct Sum Testing: The General Case", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Approximation, Randomization, and Combinatorial Optimization.\n  Algorithms and Techniques (APPROX/RANDOM 2019), 145, 40:1--40:11", "doi": "10.4230/LIPIcs.APPROX-RANDOM.2019.40", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A function $f:[n_1]\\times\\dots\\times[n_d]\\to\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a direct sum if\nit is of the form $f\\left(a_1,\\dots,a_d\\right) = f_1(a_1)\\oplus\\dots \\oplus f_d\n(a_d),$ for some $d$ functions $f_i:[n_i]\\to\\mathbb{F}_2$ for all $i=1,\\dots,\nd$, and where $n_1,\\dots,n_d\\in\\mathbb{N}$.
