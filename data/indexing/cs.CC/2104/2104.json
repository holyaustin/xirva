Unitarization is\nthe problem of taking several input quantum circuits that produce orthogonal\nstates from the all 0 state, and create an output circuit implementing a\nunitary with its first columns as those states.

In this work, we approximately solve this problem in the case\nwhere input circuits are given as black box oracles by probably finding an\napproximate basis for our states. This method may be more interesting than the\napplication.\n  Specifically, we find an approximate basis in polynomial time for the\nfollowing parameters.

(2019), we investigate which graphs admit a\nsimilar quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a generalization of the\nBoolean hypercube graph, the $n$-dimensional lattice graph $Q(D,n)$ with\nvertices in $\\{0,1,\\ldots,D\\}^n$. We study the complexity of the following\nproblem: given a subgraph $G$ of $Q(D,n)$ via query access to the edges,\ndetermine whether there is a path from $0^n$ to $D^n$. While the classical\nquery complexity is $\\widetilde{\\Theta}((D+1)^n)$, we show a quantum algorithm\nwith complexity $\\widetilde O(T_D^n)$, where $T_D < D+1$. The first few values\nof $T_D$ are $T_1 \\approx 1.817$, $T_2 \\approx 2.660$, $T_3 \\approx 3.529$,\n$T_4 \\approx 4.421$, $T_5 \\approx 5.332$. We also prove that $T_D \\geq\n\\frac{D+1}{\\mathrm e}$, thus for general $D$, this algorithm does not provide,\nfor example, a speedup, polynomial in the size of the lattice.\n  While the presented quantum algorithm is a natural generalization of the\nknown quantum algorithm for $D=1$ by Ambainis et al., the analysis of\ncomplexity is rather complicated. For the precise analysis, we use the\nsaddle-point method, which is a common tool in analytic combinatorics, but has\nnot been widely used in this field.\n  We then show an implementation of this algorithm with time complexity\n$\\text{poly}(n)^{\\log n} T_D^n$, and apply it to the Set Multicover problem. In\nthis problem, $m$ subsets of $[n]$ are given, and the task is to find the\nsmallest number of these subsets that cover each element of $[n]$ at least $D$\ntimes. While the time complexity of the best known classical algorithm is\n$O(m(D+1)^n)$, the time complexity of our quantum algorithm is\n$\\text{poly}(m,n)^{\\log n} T_D^n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:50:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 May 2021 16:13:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Glos", "Adam", ""], ["Kokainis", "Martins", ""], ["Mori", "Ryuhei", ""], ["Vihrovs", "Jevg\u0113nijs", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.14395", "submitter": "Ana Silva", "authors": "Celina M.

Managers in the traceability initiatives\ndeveloping such technologies face a difficult question: which companies should\nthey target as early adopters to ensure that their technology is broadly\nemployed? To answer this question, managers must consider that supply chains\nare interlinked in complex networks and that a supply chain effect is inherent\nto traceability technologies. More specifically, the benefits obtained from\ntraceability are conditional on technology adoption throughout a product's\nsupply chain.\n  We introduce a model of the dynamics of traceability technology adoption in\nsupply chain networks to tackle the problem of selecting the smallest set of\nearly adopters guaranteeing broad dissemination. Our model builds on extant\ndiffusion models while incorporating that a firm's adoption decision depends on\nprevious adoption decisions throughout its supply chains. We show that the\nproblem is NP-hard and that no approximation within a polylogarithmic factor\ncan be guaranteed for any polynomial-time algorithm. Nevertheless, we introduce\nan algorithm that identifies an exact solution in polynomial time under certain\nassumptions on the network structure and provide evidence that it is tractable\nfor real-world supply chain networks. We further propose a random generative\nmodel that outputs networks consistent with real-world supply chain networks.\nThe networks obtained display, whp, structures that allow us to find the\noptimal seed set in subexponential time using our algorithm. Our generative\nmodel also provides approximate seed sets when information on the network is\nlimited.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 08:05:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Blaettchen", "Philippe", ""], ["Calmon", "Andre P.", ""], ["Hall", "Georgina", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.15075", "submitter": "Jiehua Chen", "authors": "Jiehua Chen, Martin Lackner, Jan Maly", "title": "Participatory Budgeting with Donations and Diversity Constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.CC cs.DS cs.GT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process where citizens jointly\ndecide on how to allocate public funds to indivisible projects.
