This\ninvolves extending the notion of clustering to Hilbert space, where the\nclassical Hamming distance is not immediately useful. Quantum clusters\ncorrespond to macroscopically distinct subspaces of the full quantum ground\nstate space which grow with the system size. We explicitly demonstrate that\nsuch clusters arise in the solution space of random quantum satisfiability\n(3-QSAT) at its satisfiability transition. We estimate both the number of these\nclusters and their internal entropy. The former are given by the number of\nhardcore dimer coverings of the core of the interaction graph, while the latter\nis related to the underconstrained degrees of freedom not touched by the\ndimers.

This model has a closer and more natural\ncorrespondence to dynamic data structures than classic communication models do,\nand hence presents a new perspective on data structures.\n  We first present a tight lower bound for the online set intersection problem\nin the online communication model, demonstrating a general approach for proving\nonline communication lower bounds. The online communication model prevents a\nbatching trick that classic communication complexity allows, and yields a\nstronger lower bound. We then apply the online communication model to prove\ndata structure lower bounds for two dynamic data structure problems: the Group\nRange problem and the Dynamic Connectivity problem for forests. Both of the\nproblems admit a worst case $O(\\log n)$-time data structure. Using online\ncommunication complexity, we prove a tight cell-probe lower bound for each:\nspending $o(\\log n)$ (even amortized) time per operation results in at best an\n$\\exp(-\\delta^2 n)$ probability of correctly answering a\n$(1/2+\\delta)$-fraction of the $n$ queries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 15:27:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Nov 2017 18:05:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Alman", "Josh", ""], ["Wang", "Joshua R.", ""], ["Yu", "Huacheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.06215", "submitter": "Stanislav Zivny", "authors": "Clement Carbonnel and David A.
