The key idea is to use (a certain class of) string functions as\nnames representing these objects. These are more expressive than infinite\nsequences, which served as names in prior work that formulated complexity in\nmore restricted settings. An advantage of using string functions is that we can\ndefine their \"size\" in the way inspired by higher-type complexity theory. This\nenables us to talk about computation on string functions whose time or space is\nbounded polynomially in the input size, giving rise to more general analogues\nof the classes P, NP, and PSPACE. We also define NP- and PSPACE-completeness\nunder suitable many-one reductions.\n  Because our framework separates machine computation and semantics, it can be\napplied to problems on sets of interest in analysis once we specify a suitable\nrepresentation (encoding). As prototype applications, we consider the\ncomplexity of functions (operators) on real numbers, real sets, and real\nfunctions. For example, the task of numerical algorithms for solving a certain\nclass of differential equations is naturally viewed as an operator taking real\nfunctions to real functions. As there was no complexity theory for operators,\nprevious results only stated how complex the solution can be. We now\nreformulate them and show that the operator itself is polynomial-space\ncomplete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2013 14:47:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kawamura", "Akitoshi", ""], ["Cook", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0779", "submitter": "Christian Ikenmeyer", "authors": "Jonathan D.

Here we consider Clifford\ncomputations with a variety of additional ingredients: (a) strong vs. weak\nsimulation, (b) inputs being computational basis states vs. general product\nstates, (c) adaptive vs. non-adaptive choices of gates for circuits involving\nintermediate measurements, (d) single line outputs vs. multi-line outputs. We\nconsider the classical simulation complexity of all combinations of these\ningredients and show that many are not classically efficiently simulatable\n(subject to common complexity assumptions such as P not equal to NP). Our\nresults reveal a surprising proximity of classical to quantum computing power\nviz. a class of classically simulatable quantum circuits which yields universal\nquantum computation if extended by a purely classical additional ingredient\nthat does not extend the class of quantum processes occurring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 12:22:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Jozsa", "Richard", ""], ["Nest", "Maarten Van den", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6306", "submitter": "Leslie Ann Goldberg", "authors": "Leslie Ann Goldberg and Mark Jerrum", "title": "The Complexity of Approximately Counting Tree Homomorphisms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2600917", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study two computational problems, parameterised by a fixed tree H.\n#HomsTo(H) is the problem of counting homomorphisms from an input graph G to H.\n#WHomsTo(H) is the problem of counting weighted homomorphisms to H, given an\ninput graph G and a weight function for each vertex v of G. Even though H is a\ntree, these problems turn out to be sufficiently rich to capture all of the\nknown approximation behaviour in #P. We give a complete trichotomy for\n#WHomsTo(H). If H is a star then #WHomsTo(H) is in FP. If H is not a star but\nit does not contain a certain induced subgraph J_3 then #WHomsTo(H) is\nequivalent under approximation-preserving (AP) reductions to #BIS, the problem\nof counting independent sets in a bipartite graph. This problem is complete for\nthe class #RHPi_1 under AP-reductions. Finally, if H contains an induced J_3\nthen #WHomsTo(H) is equivalent under AP-reductions to #SAT, the problem of\ncounting satisfying assignments to a CNF Boolean formula. Thus, #WHomsTo(H) is\ncomplete for #P under AP-reductions. The results are similar for #HomsTo(H)\nexcept that a rich structure emerges if H contains an induced J_3. We show that\nthere are trees H for which #HomsTo(H) is #SAT-equivalent (disproving a\nplausible conjecture of Kelk). There is an interesting connection between these\nhomomorphism-counting problems and the problem of approximating the partition\nfunction of the ferromagnetic Potts model. In particular, we show that for a\nfamily of graphs J_q, parameterised by a positive integer q, the problem\n#HomsTo(H) is AP-interreducible with the problem of approximating the partition\nfunction of the q-state Potts model. It was not previously known that the Potts\nmodel had a homomorphism-counting interpretation. We use this connection to\nobtain some additional upper bounds for the approximation complexity of\n#HomsTo(J_q).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 19:49:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 11:30:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Goldberg", "Leslie Ann", ""], ["Jerrum", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6376", "submitter": "Frank Vanderzwet", "authors": "Frank Vanderzwet", "title": "Fractional Pebbling Game Lower Bounds", "comments": "Graduate Research Paper for University of Toronto.
