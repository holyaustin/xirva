In this paper, we show that a deterministic black-box identity testing\nalgorithm for (high-degree) univariate polynomials would imply a lower bound on\nthe arithmetic complexity of the permanent. The lower bounds that are known to\nfollow from derandomization of (low-degree) multivariate identity testing are\nweaker. To obtain our lower bound it would be sufficient to derandomize\nidentity testing for polynomials of a very specific norm: sums of products of\nsparse polynomials with sparse coefficients. This observation leads to new\nversions of the Shub-Smale tau-conjecture on integer roots of univariate\npolynomials. In particular, we show that a lower bound for the permanent would\nfollow if one could give a good enough bound on the number of real roots of\nsums of products of sparse polynomials (Descartes' rule of signs gives such a\nbound for sparse polynomials and products thereof). In this third version of\nour paper we show that the same lower bound would follow even if one could only\nprove a slightly superpolynomial upper bound on the number of real roots. This\nis a consequence of a new result on reduction to depth 4 for arithmetic\ncircuits which we establish in a companion paper. We also show that an even\nweaker bound on the number of real roots would suffice to obtain a lower bound\non the size of depth 4 circuits computing the permanent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 06:50:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2010 18:11:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2010 18:54:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 30 Jul 2010 06:49:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Koiran", "Pascal", "", "LIP"]]}, {"id": "1004.5080", "submitter": "Raghunath Tewari", "authors": "Samir Datta and Raghav Kulkarni and Raghunath Tewari and N.
