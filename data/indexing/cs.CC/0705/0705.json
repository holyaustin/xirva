This\ncan be reduced to an integer program (IP). However, to date, there exists no\nknown polynomial-time algorithm for IP. In 2004, Meneses et al. introduced a\nbranch-and-bound (B & B) method for solving the IP problem. Their algorithm is\nnot always efficient and has the exponential time complexity. In the paper, we\nattempt to solve efficiently the IP problem by a greedy iterative rounding\ntechnique. The proposed algorithm is polynomial time and much faster than the\nexisting B & B IP for the CSP. If the number of strings is limited to 3, the\nalgorithm is provably at most 1 away from the optimum. The empirical results\nshow that in many cases we can find an exact solution.

Prominent examples of difficult (that is,\nVNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian\npolynomials.

For instance, Barvinok has shown that\nif the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the\nhamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in\nVP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded\ntreewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and\nhamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently.
