For H=K_k this is the problem of finding paths between k-colorings,\nwhich was shown to be in P for k<=3 and PSPACE-complete otherwise by Cereceda\net al. 2011. We generalize the positive side of this dichotomy by providing an\nalgorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time for any H with no C_4\nsubgraph. This gives a large class of constraints for which finding solutions\nto the Constraint Satisfaction Problem is NP-complete, but finding paths in the\nsolution space is P.\n  The algorithm uses a characterization of possible reconfiguration sequences\n(paths in Hom(G,H)), whose main part is a purely topological condition\ndescribed in algebraic terms of the fundamental groupoid of H seen as a\ntopological space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2014 19:19:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 19:29:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wrochna", "Marcin", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.3193", "submitter": "Aran Nayebi", "authors": "Aran Nayebi, Scott Aaronson, Aleksandrs Belovs, Luca Trevisan", "title": "Quantum lower bound for inverting a permutation with advice", "comments": "To appear in Quantum Information & Computation.

In recent years a high dimensional theory of expanders is\nemerging.

It is known that for every d there are unbounded degree\nsimplicial complexes of dimension d with these properties. However, a major\nopen problem, formulated by Gromov, is whether bounded degree high dimensional\nexpanders, according to these definitions, exist for d >= 2. We present an\nexplicit construction of bounded degree complexes of dimension d = 2 which are\nhigh dimensional expanders. More precisely, our main result says that the\n2-skeletons of the 3-dimensional Ramanujan complexes are topological expanders.\nAssuming a conjecture of Serre on the congruence subgroup property, infinitely\nmany of them are also coboundary expanders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 08:56:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kaufman", "Tali", ""], ["Kazhdan", "David", ""], ["Lubotzky", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6509", "submitter": "Andrey Nikolaev", "authors": "Elizaveta Frenkel, Andrey Nikolaev, and Alexander Ushakov", "title": "Knapsack problems in products of groups", "comments": "15 pages, 5 figures.
