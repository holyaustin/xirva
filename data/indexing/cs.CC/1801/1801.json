Here, clustering refers to the problem of\npartitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space) into k clusters,\nminimizing some objective function f. Sketching, on the other hand, is the\nproblem of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of k\npoints. Specifically, we define the k-sketch of some mm-space M to be the\nnearest neighbor of M in the set of k-point mm-spaces, under some distance\nfunction \\rho on the set of mm-spaces. In this paper, we demonstrate a duality\nbetween general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a\ngeneral method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem\nto a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal\ncost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. 1. For metric spaces,\nwe consider the case where the clustering objective is minimizing the maximum\ncluster diameter. We show that the ratio between the sketching and clustering\nobjectives is constant over compact metric spaces. 2. We extend these results\nto the setting of metric measure spaces where we prove that the ratio of\nsketching to clustering objectives is bounded both above and below by some\nuniversal constants. In this setting, the clustering objective involves\nminimizing various notions of the l_p-diameters} of the clusters. 3. We\nconsider two competing notions of sketching for mm-spaces, with one of them\nbeing more demanding than the other. These notions arise from two different\ndefinitions of p-Gromov-Wasserstein distance that have appeared in the\nliterature. We then prove that whereas the gap between these can be arbitrarily\nlarge, in the case of doubling metric spaces the resulting sketching objectives\nare polynomially related.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jan 2018 05:15:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2018 14:39:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e9moli", "Facundo", ""], ["Sidiropoulos", "Anastasios", ""], ["Singhal", "Kritika", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.00712", "submitter": "Luis Meira", "authors": "Luis A.

This is achieved by refining the notion of\noracle-polynomial-time introduced by Cook. We impose a further restriction on\nthe oracle interactions to force feasibility. Both the restriction as well as\nits purpose are very simple: it is well-known that Cook's model allows\npolynomial depth iteration of functional inputs with no restrictions on size,\nand thus does not guarantee that polynomial-time computability is preserved. To\nmend this we restrict the number of lookahead revisions, that is the number of\ntimes a query can be asked that is bigger than any of the previous queries.
