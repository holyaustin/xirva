While there exist examples like Bin Packing, which does not admit any\nkernel unless P = NP, there apparently is a strong relation between these two\npolynomial-time techniques. We add to this picture by showing that the natural\ndecision versions of all problems in two prominent classes of constant-factor\napproximable problems, namely MIN F^+\\Pi_1 and MAX NP, admit polynomial problem\nkernels. Problems in MAX SNP, a subclass of MAX NP, are shown to admit kernels\nwith a linear base set, e.g., the set of vertices of a graph. This extends\nresults of Cai and Chen (JCSS 1997), stating that the standard\nparameterizations of problems in MAX SNP and MIN F^+\\Pi_1 are fixed-parameter\ntractable, and complements recent research on problems that do not admit\npolynomial kernelizations (Bodlaender et al. JCSS 2009).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Feb 2009 10:19:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 12:19:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kratsch", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1866", "submitter": "Sylvain Perifel", "authors": "Pascal Koiran (LIP), Sylvain Perifel (LIAFA)", "title": "A Superpolynomial Lower Bound on the Size of Uniform Non-constant-depth\n  Threshold Circuits for the Permanent", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the permanent cannot be computed by DLOGTIME-uniform threshold\nor arithmetic circuits of depth o(log log n) and polynomial size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Feb 2009 12:39:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Koiran", "Pascal", "", "LIP"], ["Perifel", "Sylvain", "", "LIAFA"]]}, {"id": "0902.2073", "submitter": "Olha Shkaravska", "authors": "Olha Shkaravska, Marko van Eekelen and Ron van Kesteren", "title": "Polynomial Size Analysis of First-Order Shapely Functions", "comments": "35 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 5, Issue 2 (May 25,\n  2009) lmcs:1148", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-5(2:10)2009", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a size-aware type system for first-order shapely function\ndefinitions.

Our generators are designed to fool\nlanguages (or equivalently, Boolean-valued functions). In particular, our\ngenerator fools advised context-free languages, namely, context-free languages\nassisted by external information known as advice, and moreover our generator is\nmade almost one-to-one, stretching $n$-bit seeds to $n+1$ bits. We explicitly\nconstruct such a pseudorandom generator, which is computed by a deterministic\nTuring machine using logarithmic space and also belongs to CFLMV(2)/n---a\nfunctional extension of the 2-conjunctive closure of CFL with the help of\nappropriate deterministic advice. In contrast, we show that there is no almost\none-to-one pseudorandom generator against context-free languages if we demand\nthat it should be computed by a nondeterministic pushdown automaton equipped\nwith a write-only output tape. Our generator naturally extends known\npseudorandom generators against advised regular languages. Our proof of the\nCFL/n-pseudorandomness of the generator is quite elementary, and in particular,\none part of the proof utilizes a special feature of the behaviors of\nnondeterministic pushdown automata, called a swapping property, which is\ninteresting in its own right, generalizing the swapping lemma for context-free\nlanguages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2009 20:41:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 07:02:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 17:14:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 15:05:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yamakami", "Tomoyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2969", "submitter": "Giorgi Japaridze", "authors": "Giorgi Japaridze", "title": "Ptarithmetic", "comments": "Substantially better versions are on their way.
