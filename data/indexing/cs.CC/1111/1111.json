This class of circuits has an efficient,\ndeterministic, white-box polynomial identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and\nShpilka), but has no known such black-box algorithm. We recast this problem as\na question of finding a low-dimensional subspace H, spanned by rank 1 tensors,\nsuch that any non-zero tensor in the dual space ker(H) has high rank. We obtain\nexplicit constructions of essentially optimal-size hitting sets for tensors of\ndegree 2 (matrices), and obtain quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for\narbitrary tensors (but this second hitting set is less explicit).\n  We also show connections to the task of performing low-rank recovery of\nmatrices, which is studied in the field of compressed sensing. Low-rank\nrecovery asks (say, over the reals) to recover a matrix M from few\nmeasurements, under the promise that M is rank <=r. We also give a formal\nconnection between low-rank recovery and the task of sparse (vector) recovery:\nany sparse-recovery algorithm that exactly recovers vectors of length n and\nsparsity 2r, using m non-adaptive measurements, yields a low-rank recovery\nscheme for exactly recovering nxn matrices of rank <=r, making 2nm non-adaptive\nmeasurements. Furthermore, if the sparse-recovery algorithm runs in time \\tau,\nthen the low-rank recovery algorithm runs in time O(rn^2+n\\tau).

In this paper we prove\nthat this tradeoff between runtime and solution quality is necessary. For the\nproblem a minimum number of edges in a graph need to be found that, when cut,\npartition the vertices into k equal-sized sets. We develop a reduction\nframework which identifies some necessary conditions on the considered graph\nclass in order to prove the hardness of the problem. We focus on two\ncombinatorially simple but very different classes, namely trees and solid grid\ngraphs. The latter are finite connected subgraphs of the infinite 2D grid\nwithout holes. First we use the framework to show that for solid grid graphs it\nis NP-hard to approximate the optimum number of cut edges within any satisfying\nratio. Then we consider solutions in which the sets may deviate from being\nequal-sized. Our framework is used on grids and trees to prove that no fully\npolynomial time algorithm exists that computes solutions in which the sets are\narbitrarily close to equal-sized. This is true even if the number of edges cut\nis allowed to increase the more stringent the limit on the set sizes is. These\nare the first bicriteria inapproximability results for the problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2011 10:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Feb 2012 12:12:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 10:46:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2013 17:28:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 02:09:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2019 11:23:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Feldmann", "Andreas Emil", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.6849", "submitter": "Claudius Gros", "authors": "Claudius Gros, Gregor Kaczor, Dimitrije Markovic", "title": "Neuropsychological constraints to human data production on a global\n  scale", "comments": "to be published in: European Physical Journal B", "journal-ref": "European Physical Journal B, 85: 28 (2012)", "doi": "10.1140/epjb/e2011-20581-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Which are the factors underlying human information production on a global\nlevel?
