The players push a token along\nthe edges of the digraph. The winner is determined by the parity of the\ngreatest priority occurring infinitely often in this infinite play.\n  A motivation for studying parity games comes from the area of formal\nverification of systems by model checking. Deciding the winner in a parity game\nis polynomial time equivalent to the model checking problem of the modal\nmu-calculus. Another strong motivation lies in the fact that the exact\ncomplexity of solving parity games is a long-standing open problem, the\ncurrently best known algorithm being subexponential. It is known that the\nproblem is in the complexity classes UP and coUP.\n  In this paper we identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time, following an approach from structural graph\ntheory. We consider three standard graph operations: the join of two graphs,\nrepeated pasting along vertices, and the addition of a vertex. Given a class C\nof digraphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time, we show that\nthe same holds for the class obtained from C by applying once any of these\nthree operations to its elements.\n  These results provide, in particular, polynomial time algorithms for parity\ngames whose underlying graph is an orientation of a complete graph, a complete\nbipartite graph, a block graph, or a block-cactus graph. These are classes\nwhere the problem was not known to be efficiently solvable.\n  Previous results concerning restricted classes of parity games which are\nsolvable in polynomial time include classes of bounded tree-width, bounded\nDAG-width, and bounded clique-width.\n  We also prove that recognising the winning regions of a parity game is not\neasier than computing them from scratch.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2012 11:04:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Dittmann", "Christoph", ""], ["Kreutzer", "Stephan", ""], ["Tomescu", "Alexandru I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.1692", "submitter": "Sebastian Ordyniak", "authors": "Serge Gaspers, Mikko Koivisto, Mathieu Liedloff, Sebastian Ordyniak,\n  Stefan Szeider", "title": "On Finding Optimal Polytrees", "comments": "(author's self-archived copy)", "journal-ref": "Proc.
