We give nearly tight upper bounds and computational lower\nbounds for this problem. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows:\n  For the case that the covariance matrix is known to be the identity, we give\na sample near-optimal and computationally efficient algorithm that outputs a\ncandidate hypothesis vector $\\widehat{\\beta}$ which approximates the unknown\nregression vector $\\beta$ within $\\ell_2$-norm $O(\\epsilon \\log(1/\\epsilon)\n\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the random observation\nnoise. An error of $\\Omega (\\epsilon \\sigma)$ is information-theoretically\nnecessary, even with infinite sample size. Prior work gave an algorithm for\nthis problem with sample complexity $\\tilde{\\Omega}(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ whose\nerror guarantee scales with the $\\ell_2$-norm of $\\beta$.\n  For the case of unknown covariance, we show that we can efficiently achieve\nthe same error guarantee as in the known covariance case using an additional\n$\\tilde{O}(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples.

By designing a new crossover gadget, we\nextend these lower bounds even to planar graphs of bounded cutwidth or\ntreewidth. Hence planarity does not help when solving Independent Set or\nDominating Set on graphs of bounded width. This sharply contrasts the fact that\nin many settings, planarity allows problems to be solved much more efficiently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2018 14:56:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["van Geffen", "Bas A.

(2013) pioneered a way to practically compute\napproximations to large scale counting or discrete integration problems by\nusing random hashes. The hashes are used to reduce the counting problem into\nmany separate discrete optimization problems. The optimization problems then\ncan be solved by an NP-oracle such as commercial SAT solvers or integer linear\nprogramming (ILP) solvers. In particular, Ermon et al. showed that if the\ndomain of integration is $\\{0,1\\}^n$ then it is possible to obtain a solution\nwithin a factor of $16$ of the optimal (a 16-approximation) by this technique.\n  In many crucial counting tasks, such as computation of partition function of\nferromagnetic Potts model, the domain of integration is naturally $\\{0,1,\\dots,\nq-1\\}^n, q>2$, the hypergrid. The straightforward extension of Ermon et al.'s\nmethod allows a $q^2$-approximation for this problem. For large values of $q$,\nthis is undesirable. In this paper, we show an improved technique to obtain an\napproximation factor of $4+O(1/q^2)$ to this problem. We are able to achieve\nthis by using an idea of optimization over multiple bins of the hash functions,\nthat can be easily implemented by inequality constraints, or even in\nunconstrained way. Also the burden on the NP-oracle is not increased by our\nmethod (an ILP solver can still be used).
