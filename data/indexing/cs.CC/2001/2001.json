We prove that this is not the case by exhibiting a shallow\ncircuit family with uniformly random gates that cannot be efficiently\nclassically simulated near-exactly under standard hardness assumptions, but can\nbe simulated approximately for all but a superpolynomially small fraction of\ncircuit instances in time linear in the number of qubits and gates. We\nfurthermore conjecture that sufficiently shallow random circuits are\nefficiently simulable more generally. To this end, we propose and analyze two\nsimulation algorithms.

Since its inception by\nGrundy in 1939, Grundy Coloring has been examined for its structural and\nalgorithmic aspects. A brute-force $f(k)n^{2^{k-1}}$-time algorithm for Grundy\nColoring on general graphs is not difficult to obtain, where $k$ is the number\nof colors required by the most adversarial vertex ordering.

In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that the examination of the $\\mathbf{P=NP}$ equality, is\nassociated with the determination of whether the $n^{th}$ derivative of a\nparticular solution is bounded or not. Accordingly, in some cases, this is not\ntrue, and hence in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:30:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 12:24:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bakas", "Nikolaos P.", ""], ["Kosmatopoulos", "Elias", ""], ["Nicolaou", "Mihalis", ""], ["Chatzichristofis", "Savvas A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11959", "submitter": "Bruno Grenet", "authors": "Pascal Giorgi, Bruno Grenet, Armelle Perret du Cray", "title": "Essentially Optimal Sparse Polynomial Multiplication", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": "Proc.

We mainly rely on\nsparse interpolation and on a new algorithm for verifying a sparse product that\nhas also a quasi-linear time complexity. Using Kronecker substitution\ntechniques we extend our result to the multivariate case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:23:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2020 09:15:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Giorgi", "Pascal", ""], ["Grenet", "Bruno", ""], ["Cray", "Armelle Perret du", ""]]}]
