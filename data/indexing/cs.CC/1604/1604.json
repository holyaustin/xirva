The halting probability of a prefix-free\nmachine M restricted to a set X is the probability that the machine halts and\noutputs an element of X. These numbers Omega_M(X) were studied by a number of\nauthors in the last decade as a way to obtain concrete highly random numbers.\nWhen X is the complement of a computably enumerable set, the number Omega_M(X)\nis the difference of two halting probabilities. Becher, Figueira, Grigorieff,\nand Miller asked whether Omega_U(X) is Martin-Loef random when U is universal\nand X is the complement of a computably enumerable set. This problem has\nresisted numerous attempts in the last decade. We apply our theory of\ndifferences of halting probabilities to give a positive answer, and show that\nOmega_U(X) is a Martin-Loef random left-c.e. real whenever X is nonempty and\nthe complement of a computably enumerable set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 12:19:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 03:45:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Barmpalias", "George", ""], ["Lewis-Pye", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00905", "submitter": "Nikola Yolov", "authors": "Nikola Yolov", "title": "Polarity and Monopolarity of $3$-colourable comparability graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We sharpen the result that polarity and monopolarity are NP-complete problems\nby showing that they remain NP-complete if the input graph is restricted to be\na $3$-colourable comparability graph.

To compute an isomorphism between two fields of\ncardinality $q^n$, our algorithm takes $$n^{1+o(1)} \\log^{1+o(1)}q +\n\\max_{\\ell} \\left(\\ell^{n_\\ell + 1+o(1)} \\log^{2+o(1)} q + O(\\ell\n\\log^5q)\\right)$$ time, where $\\ell$ runs through primes dividing $n$ but not\n$q(q-1)$ and $n_\\ell$ denotes the highest power of $\\ell$ dividing $n$. Prior\nto this work, the best known run time dependence on $n$ was quadratic. Our run\ntime dependence on $n$ is at worst quadratic but is subquadratic if $n$ has no\nlarge prime factor. In particular, the $n$ for which our run time is nearly\nlinear in $n$ have natural density at least $3/10$. The crux of our approach is\nfinding a point on an elliptic curve of a prescribed prime power order or\nequivalently finding preimages under the Lang map on elliptic curves over\nfinite fields. We formulate this as an open problem whose resolution would\nsolve the finite field isomorphism problem with run time nearly linear in $n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 19:11:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 02:16:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Aug 2018 02:51:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Narayanan", "Anand Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03084", "submitter": "Pravesh Kothari", "authors": "Boaz Barak, Samuel B.

In most\nreal-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate\nknowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation\nwith incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial\norder for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.\nIn this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of\nmanipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation.

It is known that\ngiven a DAG G as input, determining its reversible pebble game number is\nPSPACE-hard.

(JAIR 2014) that WSP restricted to the class of\nuser-independent constraints (UI), covering many practical cases, admits FPT\nalgorithms, i.e. can be solved in time exponential only in the number of steps\n$k$ and polynomial in the number of users $n$. Since usually $k << n$ in WSP,\nsuch FPT algorithms are of great practical interest. We present a new\ninterpretation of the FPT nature of the WSP with UI constraints giving a\ndecomposition of the problem into two levels. Exploiting this two-level split,\nwe develop a new FPT algorithm that is by many orders of magnitude faster than\nthe previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm and also has only polynomial-space\ncomplexity. We also introduce new pseudo-Boolean (PB) and Constraint\nSatisfaction (CSP) formulations of the WSP with UI constraints which\nefficiently exploit this new decomposition of the problem and raise the novel\nissue of how to use general-purpose solvers to tackle FPT problems in a fashion\nthat meets FPT efficiency expectations. In our computational study, we\ninvestigate, for the first time, the phase transition (PT) properties of the\nWSP, under a model for generation of random instances. We show how PT studies\ncan be extended, in a novel fashion, to support empirical evaluation of scaling\nof FPT algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 16:08:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:13:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 15:33:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 15:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Karapetyan", "Daniel", ""], ["Parkes", "Andrew J.", ""], ["Gutin", "Gregory", ""], ["Gagarin", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05940", "submitter": "Martin B\\\"ohm", "authors": "Martin B\\\"ohm and Pavel Vesel\\'y", "title": "Online Chromatic Number is PSPACE-Complete", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the online graph coloring problem, vertices from a graph G, known in\nadvance, arrive in an online fashion and an algorithm must immediately assign a\ncolor to each incoming vertex v so that the revealed graph is properly colored.\nThe exact location of v in the graph G is not known to the algorithm.

Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation\nwith completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness\n(corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into\na new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method\nknown requires extra workspace of ${O \\bigl( p \\log \\frac{1}{c-s} \\bigr)}$\nqubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like\nlogarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction\nmethods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without\nintermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \\bigl( \\log\n\\frac{p}{c-s} \\bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of\nstrong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with\ntwo-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in\ncomplexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in\nbounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper\nbound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong\namplification for matchgate computations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 19:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fefferman", "Bill", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hirotada", ""], ["Lin", "Cedric Yen-Yu", ""], ["Morimae", "Tomoyuki", ""], ["Nishimura", "Harumichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.08437", "submitter": "Gilles Didier", "authors": "Gilles Didier", "title": "Optimal pattern matching algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a class of finite state machines, called \\defi{$w$-matching\nmachines}, which yield to simulate the behavior of pattern matching algorithms\nwhile searching for a pattern $w$.
