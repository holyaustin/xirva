We advance a natural\nconjecture about the capacity of the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generator\n[NW94] to fool AC_0, with MAJORITY as its hard function. Our conjecture is\nessentially that the loss due to the hybrid argument (which is a component of\nthe standard proof from [NW94]) can be avoided in this setting. This is a\nquestion that has been asked previously in the pseudorandomness literature\n[BSW03]. We then make three main contributions: (1) We show that our conjecture\nimplies the existence of an oracle relative to which BQP is not in the PH. This\nentails giving an explicit construction of unitary matrices, realizable by\nsmall quantum circuits, whose row-supports are \"nearly-disjoint.\" (2) We give a\nsimple framework (generalizing the setting of Aaronson [A10]) in which any\nefficiently quantumly computable unitary gives rise to a distribution that can\nbe distinguished from the uniform distribution by an efficient quantum\nalgorithm. When applied to the unitaries we construct, this framework yields a\nproblem that can be solved quantumly, and which forms the basis for the desired\noracle. (3) We prove that Aaronson's \"GLN conjecture\" [A10] implies our\nconjecture; our conjecture is thus formally easier to prove. The GLN conjecture\nwas recently proved false for depth greater than 2 [A10a], but it remains open\nfor depth 2. If true, the depth-2 version of either conjecture would imply an\noracle relative to which BQP is not in AM, which is itself an outstanding open\nproblem. Taken together, our results have the following interesting\ninterpretation: they give an instantiation of the Nisan-Wigderson generator\nthat can be broken by quantum computers, but not by the relevant modes of\nclassical computation, if our conjecture is true.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2010 06:59:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:00:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Dec 2010 00:46:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Fefferman", "Bill", ""], ["Umans", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0391", "submitter": "Tomoyuki Yamakami", "authors": "Tomoyuki Yamakami", "title": "Approximate Counting for Complex-Weighted Boolean Constraint\n  Satisfaction Problems", "comments": "A4, 10 point, 25 pages.

The first algorithm extends the recent work by Koutis (2008) and\nWilliams (2009) on testing multilinear monomials. Group algebra is exploited in\nthe algorithm designs, in corporation with the randomized polynomial identity\ntesting over a finite field by Agrawal and Biswas (2003), the deterministic\nnoncommunicative polynomial identity testing by Raz and Shpilka (2005) and the\nperfect hashing functions by Chen {\\em at el.} (2007). Finally, we prove that\ntesting some special types of multilinear monomial is W[1]-hard, giving\nevidence that testing for specific monomials is not fixed-parameter tractable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jul 2010 23:04:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Zhixiang", ""], ["Fu", "Bin", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.2678", "submitter": "Bin Fu", "authors": "Zhixiang Chen and Bin Fu", "title": "Approximating Multilinear Monomial Coefficients and Maximum Multilinear\n  Monomials in Multivariate Polynomials", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-17458-2_26", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is our third step towards developing a theory of testing monomials\nin multivariate polynomials and concentrates on two problems: (1) How to\ncompute the coefficients of multilinear monomials; and (2) how to find a\nmaximum multilinear monomial when the input is a $\\Pi\\Sigma\\Pi$ polynomial. We\nfirst prove that the first problem is \\#P-hard and then devise a $O^*(3^ns(n))$\nupper bound for this problem for any polynomial represented by an arithmetic\ncircuit of size $s(n)$.
