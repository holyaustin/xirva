The Fractional Free Energy (FFE) functional is\nparameterized by a scalar parameter $\\gamma\\in[-1;1]$, where $\\gamma=-1$\ncorresponds to the BP limit and $\\gamma=1$ corresponds to the exclusion\nprinciple (but ignoring perfect matching constraints) Mean-Field (MF) limit.\nFFE shows monotonicity and continuity with respect to $\\gamma$. For every\nnon-negative matrix, we define its special value $\\gamma_*\\in[-1;0]$ to be the\n$\\gamma$ for which the minimum of the $\\gamma$-parameterized FFE functional is\nequal to the permanent of the matrix, where the lower and upper bounds of the\n$\\gamma$-interval corresponds to respective bounds for the permanent.

This leads to pure combinatorial\noptimisation problems with fixed size. These problems are unlikely to be\nsolvable in polynomial time.\n  In 1976 Laderman published a method to multiply two 3x3 matrices using only\n23 multiplications. This result is non-commutative, and therefore can be\napplied recursively to smaller sub-matrices. In 35 years nobody was able to do\nbetter and it remains an open problem if this can be done with 22\nmultiplications. We proceed by solving the so called Brent equations [7]. We\nhave implemented a method to converting this very hard problem to a SAT\nproblem, and we have attempted to solve it, with our portfolio of some 500 SAT\nsolvers. With this new method we were able to produce new solutions to the\nLaderman's problem. We present a new fully general non-commutative solution\nwith 23 multiplications and show that this solution is new and is NOT an\nequivalent variant of the Laderman's original solution.

In life sciences, combinatorial optimization problems frequently\narise in molecular biology, e.g., genome sequencing; global alignment of\nmultiple genomes; identifying siblings or discovery of dysregulated pathways.In\nalmost all of these problems, there is the need for proving a hypothesis about\ncertain property of an object that can be present only when it adopts some\nparticular admissible structure (an NP-certificate) or be absent (no admissible\nstructure), however, none of the standard approaches can discard the hypothesis\nwhen no solution can be found, since none can provide a proof that there is no\nadmissible structure. This article presents an algorithm that introduces a\nnovel type of solution method to \"efficiently\" solve the graph 3-coloring\nproblem; an NP-complete problem. The proposed method provides certificates\n(proofs) in both cases: present or absent, so it is possible to accept or\nreject the hypothesis on the basis of a rigorous proof. It provides exact\nsolutions and is polynomial-time (i.e., efficient) however parametric. The only\nrequirement is sufficient computational power, which is controlled by the\nparameter $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Nevertheless, here it is proved that the\nprobability of requiring a value of $\\alpha>k$ to obtain a solution for a\nrandom graph decreases exponentially: $P(\\alpha>k) \\leq 2^{-(k+1)}$, making\ntractable almost all problem instances. Thorough experimental analyses were\nperformed. The algorithm was tested on random graphs, planar graphs and\n4-regular planar graphs. The obtained experimental results are in accordance\nwith the theoretical expected results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2011 23:44:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 22:50:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2011 15:43:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 17:48:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 23:08:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2012 15:51:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "H.
