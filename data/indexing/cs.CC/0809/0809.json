Here we introduce a Graphical Gauge Model (GGM)\nand show that : (a) it can be stated as an average/sum of a determinant defined\non the graph over $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ (binary) gauge field; (b) it is equivalent\nto the Monomer-Dimer (MD) model on the graph; (c) the partition function of the\nmodel allows an explicit expression in terms of a series over disjoint directed\ncycles, where each term is a product of local contributions along the cycle and\nthe determinant of a matrix defined on the remainder of the graph (excluding\nthe cycle). We also establish a relation between the MD model on the graph and\nthe determinant series, discussed in the first paper, however, considered using\nsimple non-Belief-Propagation choice of the gauge. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of possible analytic and algorithmic consequences of these results,\nas well as related questions and challenges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Sep 2008 03:17:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Nov 2008 01:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Chernyak", "Vladimir Y.", ""], ["Chertkov", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.3614", "submitter": "Sergey Volkov", "authors": "Sergey Volkov", "title": "Improved Monotone Circuit Depth Upper Bound for Directed Graph\n  Reachability", "comments": "preprint", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove that the directed graph reachability problem (transitive closure)\ncan be solved by monotone fan-in 2 boolean circuits of depth (1/2+o(1))(log\nn)^2, where n is the number of nodes.

These notions were further generalized by Grohe and\nMarx, who introduced the fractional hypertree width of a hypergraph. All these\nwidth parameters on hypergraphs are useful for extending tractability of many\nproblems in database theory and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we\nstudy the approximability of (generalized, fractional) hyper treewidth of\nsparse hypergraphs where the criterion of sparsity reflects the sparsity of\ntheir incidence graphs. Our first step is to prove that the (generalized,\nfractional) hypertree width of a hypergraph H is constant-factor sandwiched by\nthe treewidth of its incidence graph, when the incidence graph belongs to some\napex-minor-free graph class. This determines the combinatorial borderline above\nwhich the notion of (generalized, fractional) hypertree width becomes\nessentially more general than treewidth, justifying that way its functionality\nas a hypergraph acyclicity measure. While for more general sparse families of\nhypergraphs treewidth of incidence graphs and all hypertree width parameters\nmay differ arbitrarily, there are sparse families where a constant factor\napproximation algorithm is possible. In particular, we give a constant factor\napproximation polynomial time algorithm for (generalized, fractional) hypertree\nwidth on hypergraphs whose incidence graphs belong to some H-minor-free graph\nclass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Sep 2008 08:17:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Fomin", "Fedor V.", ""], ["Golovach", "Petr A.", ""], ["Thilikos", "Dimitrios M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.4332", "submitter": "Haijun Zhou", "authors": "Kang Li, Hui Ma, and Haijun Zhou", "title": "From one solution of a 3-satisfiability formula to a solution cluster:\n  Frozen variables and entropy", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures.

While frozen cores are identified by a\nlocal whitening algorithm, long-range frustrations are very difficult to trace,\nand they make an entropic belief-propagation (BP) algorithm fail to converge.\nFor BP to reach a fixed point the spin values of a tiny fraction of variables\n(chosen according to the whitening algorithm) are externally fixed during the\niteration. From the calculated entropy values, we infer that, for a large\nrandom 3-SAT formula with constraint density close to the satisfiability\nthreshold, the solutions obtained by the survey-propagation or the walksat\nalgorithm belong neither to the most dominating clusters of the formula nor to\nthe most abundant clusters.
