Is there a unique solution to a given\nSu-Doku puzzle? What is a good estimation of a puzzle's difficulty? What is the\nminimum puzzle size (the number of \"givens\")?\n  This paper explores how these questions are related to the well-known\nalldifferent constraint which emerges in a wide variety of Constraint\nSatisfaction Problems (CSP) and compares various algorithmic approaches based\non different formulations of Su-Doku.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Mar 2008 10:07:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chauvet", "Jean-Marie", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.4260", "submitter": "Xin Han", "authors": "Xin Han, Kazuo Iwama, Guochuan Zhang", "title": "On Two Dimensional Orthogonal Knapsack Problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the following knapsack problem: Given a list of\nsquares with profits, we are requested to pack a sublist of them into a\nrectangular bin (not a unit square bin) to make profits in the bin as large as\npossible.

For example, the\nconstraints might specify that some measurement operators must commute.\n  We show that if an instance of the quantum moment problem is unsatisfiable,\nthen there exists a certificate of a particular form proving this. Our proof is\nbased on a recent result in algebraic geometry, the noncommutative\nPositivstellensatz of Helton and McCullough [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,\n356(9):3721, 2004].\n  A special case of the quantum moment problem is to compute the value of\none-round multi-prover games with entangled provers. Under the conjecture that\nthe provers need only share states in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we\nprove that a hierarchy of semidefinite programs similar to the one given by\nNavascues, Pironio and Acin [Phys.
