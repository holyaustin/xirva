The representation can exploit any\ncomputable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being\ncapable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly\ndictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes\nit possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows\nsimple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we\nmeasure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,\nleaving only the information in the structure.\n  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general\nobjects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that\nthe common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not\nspecified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the\nmeasure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects\nreside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that\ncharacterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to\nKolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing\nthe structure of natural numbers.
