When the normal subgroup N is abelian, this\nstrategy is well-known. Our first contribution is to extend this strategy to\nhandle the case when N is not necessarily abelian. This allows us to provide a\nunified explanation of all recent polynomial-time algorithms for special group\nclasses.\n  Guided by this strategy, to make further progress on GpI, we consider\ncentral-radical groups, proposed in Babai et al. (SODA 2011): the class of\ngroups such that G mod its center has no abelian normal subgroups. This class\nis a natural extension of the group class considered by Babai et al. (ICALP\n2012), namely those groups with no abelian normal subgroups. Following the\nabove strategy, we solve GpI in $n^{O(\\log \\log n)}$ time for central-radical\ngroups, and in polynomial time for several prominent subclasses of\ncentral-radical groups. We also solve GpI in $n^{O(\\log\\log n)}$ time for\ngroups whose solvable normal subgroups are elementary abelian but not\nnecessarily central.
