Prior work of\nBallard-Demmel-Holtz-Schwartz relied on a geometric inequality of Loomis and\nWhitney for this purpose. In this paper the general theory of discrete\nmultilinear Holder-Brascamp-Lieb (HBL) inequalities is used to establish\ncommunication lower bounds for a much wider class of algorithms. In some cases,\nalgorithms are presented which attain these lower bounds.\n  Several contributions are made to the theory of HBL inequalities proper. The\noptimal constant in such an inequality for torsion-free Abelian groups is shown\nto equal one whenever it is finite. Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao had\ncharacterized the tuples of exponents for which such an inequality is valid as\nthe convex polyhedron defined by a certain finite list of inequalities. The\nproblem of constructing an algorithm to decide whether a given inequality is on\nthis list, is shown to be equivalent to Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the\nrationals, which remains open.

In particular, assuming the Exponential Time\nHypothesis, our two main results are:\n  - For any r larger than some constant, any r-approximation algorithm for the\nmaximum independent set problem must run in at least\n2^{n^{1-\\epsilon}/r^{1+\\epsilon}} time. This nearly matches the upper bound of\n2^{n/r} (Cygan et al., 2008). It also improves some hardness results in the\ndomain of parameterized complexity (e.g., Escoffier et al., 2012 and Chitnis et\nal., 2013)\n  - For any k larger than some constant, there is no polynomial time min\n(k^{1-\\epsilon}, n^{1/2-\\epsilon})-approximation algorithm for the k-hypergraph\npricing problem, where n is the number of vertices in an input graph. This\nalmost matches the upper bound of min (O(k), \\tilde O(\\sqrt{n})) (by Balcan and\nBlum, 2007 and an algorithm in this paper).\n  We note an interesting fact that, in contrast to n^{1/2-\\epsilon} hardness\nfor polynomial-time algorithms, the k-hypergraph pricing problem admits\nn^{\\delta} approximation for any \\delta >0 in quasi-polynomial time. This puts\nthis problem in a rare approximability class in which approximability\nthresholds can be improved significantly by allowing algorithms to run in\nquasi-polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 16:39:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 Aug 2013 22:23:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chalermsook", "Parinya", ""], ["Laekhanukit", "Bundit", ""], ["Nanongkai", "Danupon", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2858", "submitter": "Sebastian Ordyniak", "authors": "Jakub Gajarsk\\'y and Michael Lampis and Sebastian Ordyniak", "title": "Parameterized Algorithms for Modular-Width", "comments": "to appear in IPEC 2013. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1304.5479 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is known that a number of natural graph problems which are FPT\nparameterized by treewidth become W-hard when parameterized by clique-width.
