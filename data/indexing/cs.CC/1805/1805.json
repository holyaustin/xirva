In many of the physical processes one may modelize thus (such\nas bootstrap percolation, forest fire or epidemic propagation models, life\nwithout death, etc), each local change is irreversible. The class of freezing\nCellular Automata (FCA) captures this feature. In a freezing cellular automaton\nthe states are ordered and the cells can only decrease their state according to\nthis \"freezing-order\". We investigate the dynamics of such systems through the\nquestions of simulation and universality in this class: is there a Freezing\nCellular Automaton (FCA) that is able to simulate any Freezing Cellular\nAutomata, i.e. an intrinsically universal FCA? We show that the answer to that\nquestion is sensitive to both the number of changes cells are allowed to make,\nand geometric features of the space. In dimension 1, there is no universal FCA.\nIn dimension 2, if either the number of changes is at least 2, or the\nneighborhood is Moore, then there are universal FCA. On the other hand, there\nis no universal FCA with one change and Von Neumann neighborhood.

The Schmidt-rank\nwidth is an entanglement measure of quantum states, meaning this algorithm is\nefficient if the original state has little entanglement. Our algorithm has\nruntime O(|V(G')||V(G)|^3), and is also efficient in practice even on small\ninstances as further showcased by a freely available software implementation.\n  2. |G> is in a certain class of states with unbounded Schmidt-rank width, and\n|G'> is a GHZ-state of a constant size. Here the runtime is O(poly(|V(G)|)),\nshowing that more efficient algorithms can in principle be found even for\nstates holding a large amount of entanglement, as long as the output state has\nconstant size.\n  Our results make use of the insight that deciding whether a graph state |G>\ncan be transformed to another graph state |G'> is equivalent to a known\ndecision problem in graph theory, namely the problem of deciding whether a\ngraph G' is a vertex-minor of a graph G.

We analyze the computational complexity of the\nproblem of counting homomorphisms $\\pi_1(X) \\to G$, where $X$ is a topological\nspace treated as computational input. We are especially interested in requiring\n$G$ to be a fixed, finite, nonabelian, simple group. We then consider two\ncases: when the input $X=M$ is a closed, triangulated 3-manifold, and when\n$X=S^3 \\setminus K$ is the complement of a knot (presented as a diagram) in\n$S^3$. We prove complexity theoretic hardness results in both settings. When\n$M$ is closed, we show that counting homomorphisms $\\pi_1(M) \\to G$ (up to\nautomorphisms of $G$) is $\\#\\mathsf{P}$-complete via parsimonious Levin\nreduction---the strictest type of polynomial-time reduction. This remains true\neven if we require $M$ to be an integer homology 3-sphere. We prove an\nanalogous result in the case that $X=S^3 \\setminus K$ is the complement of a\nknot.\n  Both proofs proceed by studying the action of the pointed mapping class group\n$\\mathrm{MCG}_*(\\Sigma)$ on the set of homomorphisms $\\{\\pi_1(\\Sigma) \\to G\\}$\nfor an appropriate surface $\\Sigma$. In the case where $X=M$ is closed, we take\n$\\Sigma$ to be a closed surface with large genus. When $X=S^3 \\setminus K$ is a\nknot complement, we take $\\Sigma$ to be a disk with many punctures. Our\nconstructions exhibit classical computational universality for a combinatorial\ntopological quantum field theory associated to $G$. Our \"topological classical\ncomputing\" theorems are analogs of the famous results of Freedman, Larsen and\nWang establishing the quantum universality of topological quantum computing\nwith the Jones polynomial at a root of unity. Instead of using quantum\ncircuits, we develop a circuit model for classical reversible computing that is\nequivariant with respect to a symmetry of the computational alphabet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2018 16:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Samperton", "Eric", "", "UC Davis"]]}, {"id": "1805.09719", "submitter": "Aryeh Kontorovich", "authors": "Lee-Ad Gottlieb, Eran Kaufman, Aryeh Kontorovich, Gabriel Nivasch", "title": "Learning convex polytopes with margin", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CC cs.CG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an improved algorithm for properly learning convex polytopes in\nthe realizable PAC setting from data with a margin.
