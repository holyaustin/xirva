The fastest such algorithms run in time linear $O(n^2)$ (or\nnearly linear) in the size of the input [FR10,DGGP14,DM15a]. In this work, we\ninitiate the development of sublinear time algorithms that find the planted\nclique when $k=\\omega(\\sqrt{n \\log \\log n})$. Our algorithms can recover the\nclique in time\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(n+(\\frac{n}{k})^{3}\\right)=\\widetilde{O}\\left(n^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)$\nwhen $k=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n\\log n})$, and in time\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(n^2/\\exp{\\left(\\frac{k^2}{24n}\\right)}\\right)$ for\n$\\omega(\\sqrt{n\\log \\log n})=k=o(\\sqrt{n\\log{n}})$. An ${\\Omega}(n)$ running\ntime lower bound for the planted clique recovery problem follows easily from\nthe results of [RS19] and therefore our recovery algorithms are optimal\nwhenever $k = \\Omega(n^{\\frac{2}{3}})$. As the lower bound of [RS19] builds on\npurely information theoretic arguments, it cannot provide a detection lower\nbound stronger than $\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\frac{n^2}{k^2})$. Since our algorithms\nfor $k = \\Omega(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ run in time\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{n^3}{k^3} + n\\right)$, we show stronger lower bounds\nbased on computational hardness assumptions. With a slightly different notion\nof the planted clique problem we show that the Planted Clique Conjecture\nimplies the following. A natural family of non-adaptive algorithms---which\nincludes our algorithms for clique detection---cannot reliably solve the\nplanted clique detection problem in time $O\\left(\n\\frac{n^{3-\\delta}}{k^3}\\right)$ for any constant $\\delta>0$. Thus we provide\nevidence that if detecting small cliques is hard, it is also likely that\ndetecting large cliques is not \\textit{too} easy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 21:44:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2020 22:54:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mardia", "Jay", ""], ["Asi", "Hilal", ""], ["Chandrasekher", "Kabir Aladin", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.12063", "submitter": "Alexander Wein", "authors": "David Gamarnik, Aukosh Jagannath, Alexander S.

The most common concurrency bugs are data races, which are\naccesses to a shared resource that can be executed concurrently. Dynamic\ndata-race prediction is the most standard technique for detecting data races:\ngiven an observed, data-race-free trace $t$, the task is to determine whether\n$t$ can be reordered to a trace $t^*$ that exposes a data-race. Although the\nproblem has received significant practical attention for over three decades,\nits complexity has remained elusive. In this work, we address this lacuna,\nidentifying sources of intractability and conditions under which the problem is\nefficiently solvable. Given a trace $t$ of size $n$ over $k$ threads, our main\nresults are as follows.\n  First, we establish a general $O(k\\cdot n^{2\\cdot (k-1)})$ upper-bound, as\nwell as an $O(n^k)$ upper-bound when certain parameters of $t$ are constant. In\naddition, we show that the problem is NP-hard and even W[1]-hard parameterized\nby $k$, and thus unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable. Second, we study the\nproblem over acyclic communication topologies, such as server-clients\nhierarchies. We establish an $O(k^2\\cdot d\\cdot n^2\\cdot \\log n)$ upper-bound,\nwhere $d$ is the number of shared variables accessed in $t$. In addition, we\nshow that even for traces with $k=2$ threads, the problem has no\n$O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ algorithm under Orthogonal Vectors. Since any trace with 2\nthreads defines an acyclic topology, our upper-bound for this case is optimal\nwrt polynomial improvements for up to moderate values of $k$ and $d$. Finally,\nwe study a distance-bounded version of the problem, where the task is to expose\na data race by a witness trace that is similar to $t$. We develop an algorithm\nthat works in $O(n)$ time when certain parameters of $t$ are constant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 16:33:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 May 2020 08:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mathur", "Umang", ""], ["Pavlogiannis", "Andreas", ""], ["Viswanathan", "Mahesh", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.15009", "submitter": "Mehdi Soleimanifar", "authors": "Anurag Anshu, Aram W.

The second problem is on the quantum communication\ncomplexity of testing bipartite states with EPR assistance, a well-known\nquestion in quantum information theory. We construct a communication protocol\nfor testing (or measuring) the ground state and use its communication\ncomplexity to reveal a new structural property for the ground state\nentanglement. This property, known as the entanglement spread, roughly measures\nthe ratio between the largest and the smallest Schmidt coefficients across a\ncut in the ground state.

Our result quite generally applies to any interaction graph with an\nimproved bound for the special case of lattices.
