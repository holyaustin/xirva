The second part is a discussion of\ntwo original results.\n  The first result concerns DPLL heuristics for random k-XORSAT, which is\nequivalent to the diluted Ising p-spin model. It is well known that DPLL is\nunable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.\nthat it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument\nsupports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known\nUC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this\nclass must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,\nwhich depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering\nthreshold.\n  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to\nvariable ratios. In this regime, it is well known that the uniform distribution\nof random instances is dominated by unsatisfiable instances. A general\ntechnique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to\nsatisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to\ncharacterize their solutions.
