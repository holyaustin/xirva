This solves an open problem proposed by one of us\nin 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational\ncomplexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a\nCTC as simply a region of spacetime where a \"causal consistency\" condition is\nimposed, meaning that Nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum)\nfixed-point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of\nthe following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a\nfixed-point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in polynomial space.\nThis theorem might have independent applications in quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2008 23:04:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Aaronson", "Scott", ""], ["Watrous", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3222", "submitter": "Jerrald Meek", "authors": "Jerrald Meek", "title": "Analysis of the postulates produced by Karp's Theorem", "comments": "12 Pages;\n  ftp://ftp%40micrognu%2Ecom:anon%40anon@ftp.micrognu.com/pnenp/conclusion.pdf", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is the final article in a series of four articles.
