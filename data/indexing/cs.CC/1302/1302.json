For\ngiven M,q find z such that q+Mz>=0, z>=0, z(q + M z)=0,or certify that there is\nno such z. It is well known that the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium for\na bimatrix game (2-NASH) can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem\n(LCP). In addition, 2-NASH is known to be complete in the complexity class PPAD\n(Polynomial-time Parity Argument Directed). However, the ingeniously\nconstructed reduction (which is designed for any PPAD problem) is very\ncomplicated, so while of great theoretical significance, it is not practical\nfor actually solving an LCP via 2-NASH, and it may not provide the potential\ninsight that can be gained from studying the game obtained from a problem\nformulated as an LCP (e.g. market equilibrium). The main goal of this paper is\nthe construction of a simple explicit reduction of any LCP(q,M) that can be\nverified as belonging to PPAD via the graph induced by the generic Lemke\nalgorithm with some positive covering vector d, to a symmetric 2-NASH. In\nparticular, any endpoint of this graph (with the exception of the initial point\nof the algorithm) corresponds to either a solution or to a so-called secondary\nray. Thus, an LCP problem is verified as belonging to PPAD if any secondary ray\ncan be used to construct, in polynomial time, a certificate that there is no\nsolution to the problem. We achieve our goal by showing that for any M,q and a\npositive d satisfying a certain nondegeneracy assumption with respect to M, we\ncan simply and directly construct a symmetric 2-NASH whose Nash equilibria\ncorrespond one-to-one to the end points of the graph induced by LCP(q,M) and\nthe Lemke algorithm with a covering vector d. We note that for a given M the\nreduction works for all positive d with the exception of a subset of measure 0.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 03:39:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Adler", "Ilan", ""], ["Verma", "Sushil", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0275", "submitter": "Prahladh Harsha", "authors": "Prahladh Harsha and Rahul Jain", "title": "A strong direct product theorem for the tribes function via the\n  smooth-rectangle bound", "comments": "16 pages (including title page), fixed error in earlier version", "journal-ref": "In Proc. 33rd IARCS Conf. on Foundations of Software Technology &\n  Theoretical Computer Science (FSTTCS) (Guwahati, India, 12-14 December),\n  pages 141-152, 2013", "doi": "10.4230/LIPIcs.FSTTCS.2013.141", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main result of this paper is an optimal strong direct product result for\nthe two-party public-coin randomized communication complexity of the Tribes\nfunction.

Our second result\ngives an explicit dual polynomial that witnesses a tight lower bound for the\napproximate degree of any symmetric Boolean function, addressing a question of\n\\v{S}palek. Our final contribution is to reprove several Markov-type\ninequalities from approximation theory by constructing explicit dual solutions\nto natural linear programs.
