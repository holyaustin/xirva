This conjecture is unproven, but a lot of\nprogress has been made. Starting with the work of Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant in\n1984, topological methods have been applied to prove partial results on the\nKarp conjecture.

For every matrix M for which our\nalgorithm fails, we show that counting list M-partitions is #P-complete.\nFurther, we give an explicit characterisation of the dichotomy theorem:\ncounting list M-partitions is in FP if M has a structure called a\nderectangularising sequence; otherwise, counting list M-partitions is #P-hard.\nWe show that the meta-problem of determining whether a given matrix has a\nderectangularising sequence is NP-complete. Finally, we show that lists can be\nused to encode cardinality restrictions in M-partitions problems and use this\nto give a polynomial-time algorithm for counting homogeneous pairs in graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 15:41:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 15:45:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 17:52:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00f6bel", "Andreas", ""], ["Goldberg", "Leslie Ann", ""], ["McQuillan", "Colin", ""], ["Richerby", "David", ""], ["Yamakami", "Tomoyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.5406", "submitter": "Attila Pereszl\\'enyi", "authors": "Attila Pereszl\\'enyi", "title": "One-Sided Error QMA with Shared EPR Pairs -- A Simpler Proof", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a simpler proof of one of the results of Kobayashi, Le Gall, and\nNishimura [arXiv:1210.1290v2], which shows that any QMA protocol can be\nconverted to a one-sided error protocol, in which Arthur and Merlin initially\nshare a constant number of EPR pairs and then Merlin sends his proof to Arthur.\nOur protocol is similar but somewhat simpler than the original.

In order to bind, two assemblies must have matching glues that can\nsimultaneously touch each other, and stick together with strength that is at\nleast the temperature $\\tau$, where $\\tau$ is some fixed positive integer. We\nask whether the 2HAM is intrinsically universal, in other words we ask: is\nthere a single universal 2HAM tile set $U$ which can be used to simulate any\ninstance of the model? Our main result is a negative answer to this question.\nWe show that for all $\\tau' < \\tau$, each temperature-$\\tau'$ 2HAM tile system\ndoes not simulate at least one temperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM tile system. This\nimpossibility result proves that the 2HAM is not intrinsically universal, in\nstark contrast to the simpler (single-tile addition only) abstract Tile\nAssembly Model which is intrinsically universal (\"The tile assembly model is\nintrinsically universal\", FOCS 2012). However, on the positive side, we prove\nthat, for every fixed temperature $\\tau \\geq 2$, temperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM tile\nsystems are indeed intrinsically universal: in other words, for each $\\tau$\nthere is a single universal 2HAM tile set $U$ that, when appropriately\ninitialized, is capable of simulating the behavior of any temperature-$\\tau$\n2HAM tile system. As a corollary of these results we find an infinite set of\ninfinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing simulation power\nwithin each hierarchy. Finally, we show that for each $\\tau$, there is a\ntemperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM system that simultaneously simulates all\ntemperature-$\\tau$ 2HAM systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 04:06:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 20:46:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Demaine", "Erik D.", ""], ["Patitz", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Rogers", "Trent A.", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert T.", ""], ["Summers", "Scott M.", ""], ["Woods", "Damien", ""]]}]
