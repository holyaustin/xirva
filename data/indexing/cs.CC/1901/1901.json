Note that the above distribution may be\nviewed as a weighted graph over the vertex set $V$ and is referred to as a test\ngraph. The testability of direct products was studied over various specific\ndomains and test graphs (for example see Dinur-Steurer [CCC'14]; Dinur-Kaufman\n[FOCS'17]). In this paper, we study the testability of direct products in a\ngeneral setting, addressing the question: what properties of the domain and the\ntest graph allow one to prove a direct product testing theorem? Towards this\ngoal we introduce the notion of coordinate expansion of a test graph. Roughly\nspeaking a test graph is a coordinate expander if it has global and local\nexpansion, and has certain nice intersection properties on sampling. We show\nthat whenever the test graph has coordinate expansion then it admits a direct\nproduct testing theorem. Additionally, for every $k$ and $n$ we provide a\ndirect product domain $V\\subseteq \\binom{n}{k}$ of size $n$, called the Sliding\nWindow domain for which we prove direct product testability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2019 13:25:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Goldenberg", "Elazar", ""], ["S.", "Karthik C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06628", "submitter": "Ashish Dwivedi", "authors": "Ashish Dwivedi, Rajat Mittal and Nitin Saxena", "title": "Efficiently factoring polynomials modulo $p^4$", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DS cs.SC math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Polynomial factoring has famous practical algorithms over fields-- finite,\nrational \\& $p$-adic.

Standard graph traversal algorithms such as\nDFS and BFS take linear time to decide reachability however their space\ncomplexity is also linear. On the other hand, Savitch's algorithm takes\nquasipolynomial time although the space bound is $O(\\log^2 n)$. Here, we study\nspace efficient algorithms for deciding reachability that runs simultaneously\nin polynomial time.\n  In this paper, we show that given an $n$ vertex directed graph of treewidth\n$w$ along with its tree decomposition, there exists an algorithm running in\npolynomial time and $O(w\\log n)$ space, that solves reachability in the graph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:35:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 07:18:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Rahul", ""], ["Tewari", "Raghunath", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.11343", "submitter": "Daniel Krenn", "authors": "Christian Elsholtz, Clemens Heuberger, Daniel Krenn", "title": "Algorithmic counting of nonequivalent compact Huffman codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CC cs.DM cs.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is known that the following five counting problems lead to the same\ninteger sequence~$f_t(n)$: the number of nonequivalent compact Huffman codes of\nlength~$n$ over an alphabet of $t$ letters, the number of `nonequivalent'\ncanonical rooted $t$-ary trees (level-greedy trees) with $n$~leaves, the number\nof `proper' words, the number of bounded degree sequences, and the number of\nways of writing $1= \\frac{1}{t^{x_1}}+ \\dots + \\frac{1}{t^{x_n}}$ with integers\n$0 \\leq x_1 \\leq x_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq x_n$. In this work, we show that one can\ncompute this sequence for \\textbf{all} $n<N$ with essentially one power series\ndivision. In total we need at most $N^{1+\\varepsilon}$ additions and\nmultiplications of integers of $cN$ bits, $c<1$, or $N^{2+\\varepsilon}$ bit\noperations, respectively.
