Quantum supremacy\nexperiments have been a major step forward, but gaps remain between the theory\nbehind these experiments and their actual implementations. In this work we\ninitiate the study of the complexity of quantum random circuit sampling\nexperiments with realistic amounts of noise.\n  Actual quantum supremacy experiments have high levels of uncorrected noise\nand exponentially decaying fidelities. It is natural to ask if there is any\nsignal of exponential complexity in these highly noisy devices. Surprisingly,\nwe show that it remains hard to compute the output probabilities of noisy\nrandom quantum circuits without error correction. More formally, so long as the\nnoise rate of the device is below the error detection threshold, we show it is\n#P-hard to compute the output probabilities of random circuits with a constant\nrate of noise per gate. This hardness persists even though these probabilities\nare exponentially close to uniform.\n  Interestingly these hardness results also have implications for the\ncomplexity of experiments in a low-noise setting. The issue here is that prior\nhardness results for computing output probabilities of random circuits are not\nrobust enough to imprecision to connect with the Stockmeyer argument for\nhardness of sampling from circuits with constant fidelity. We exponentially\nimprove the robustness of prior results to imprecision, both in the cases of\nRandom Circuit Sampling and BosonSampling.

The main component of our data structure is\na generalization of transitive closure called timed transitive closure (TTC),\nwhich allows us to maintain reachability information relative to all nested\ntime intervals, without storing all these intervals, nor the journeys\nthemselves. TTCs are of independent interest and we study a number of their\ngeneral properties. Let $n$ be the number of nodes and $\\tau$ be the number of\ntimestamps in the lifetime of the temporal graph. Our data structure answers\nreachability queries regarding the existence of a journey from a given node to\nanother within given time interval in time $O(\\log\\tau)$; it has an amortized\ninsertion time of $O(n^2\\log\\tau)$; and it can reconstruct a valid journey that\nwitnesses reachability in time $O(k\\log\\tau)$, where $k<n$ is the maximum\nnumber of edges of this journey. Finally, the space complexity of our\nreachability data structure is $O(n^2\\tau)$, which remains within the\nworst-case size of the temporal graph itself.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2021 13:41:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 19:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Brito", "Luiz F.

Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe et al., JCSS,\n2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\\{u,v\\}$\nwith time-label $t$ specifies that \"$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$\".\nThis is a symmetric relation between $u$ and $v$, and it can be interpreted\nthat the information can flow in either direction. In this paper we make a\nfirst attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge\ncan impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically,\nwe introduce the notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we\nsystematically investigate its algorithmic behavior in various situations. An\norientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever\n$u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a\ndirected edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a\ndirected edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\\geq t_2$.

SPIRE 2017, ICALP 2019) can be seen as such graphs, and we introduce\nhere their generalization: elastic founder graphs. We first prove that even\nsuch induced graphs are hard to index under OVH. Then we introduce two\nsubclasses, repeat-free and semi-repeat-free graphs, that are easy to index. We\ngive a linear time algorithm to construct a repeat-free non-elastic founder\ngraph from a gapless MSA, and (parameterized) near-linear time algorithms to\nconstruct semi-repeat-free (repeat-free, respectively) elastic founder graphs\nfrom general MSAs. Finally, we show that repeat-free elastic founder graphs\nadmit a reduction to Wheeler graphs in polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2021 12:47:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2021 08:33:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 17 Mar 2021 18:39:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 20 May 2021 11:19:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Equi", "Massimo", ""], ["Norri", "Tuukka", ""], ["Alanko", "Jarno", ""], ["Cazaux", "Bastien", ""], ["Tomescu", "Alexandru I.", ""], ["M\u00e4kinen", "Veli", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13095", "submitter": "Dmitry Chistikov", "authors": "Dmitry Chistikov and Rupak Majumdar and Philipp Schepper", "title": "Subcubic Certificates for CFL Reachability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CC cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many problems in interprocedural program analysis can be modeled as the\ncontext-free language (CFL) reachability problem on graphs and can be solved in\ncubic time. Despite years of efforts, there are no known truly sub-cubic\nalgorithms for this problem. We study the related certification task: given an\ninstance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable\ncertificates for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show\nthat, in both scenarios, there exist succinct certificates ($O(n^2)$ in the\nsize of the problem) and these certificates can be checked in subcubic (matrix\nmultiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression\nof paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix\nconstraints (for negative instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in\nnondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic time.\n  A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will\nlead to faster algorithms for combinatorial problems such as Boolean\nsatisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification results, we show\nthat there cannot be a fine-grained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for\na conditional lower bound stronger than $n^\\omega$, unless the nondeterministic\nstrong exponential time hypothesis (NSETH) fails.\n  Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown\nreachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language\nrecognition. For example, we describe succinct certificates for pushdown\nnon-reachability (inductive invariants) and observe that they can be checked in\nmatrix multiplication time. We also extract a new hardest 2NPDA language,\ncapturing the \"hard core\" of all these problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:58:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chistikov", "Dmitry", ""], ["Majumdar", "Rupak", ""], ["Schepper", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13220", "submitter": "Chenyang Yuan", "authors": "Chenyang Yuan and Pablo A.
