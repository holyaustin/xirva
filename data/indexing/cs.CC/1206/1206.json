The complexity of this problem has\nreceived substantial amount of attention in the past decade. In this paper we\nstudy the fixed-parameter tractability of constraint satisfaction problems\nparameterized by the size of the solution in the following sense: one of the\npossible values, say 0, is \"free,\" and the number of variables allowed to take\nother, \"expensive,\" values is restricted. A size constraint requires that\nexactly $k$ variables take nonzero values. We also study a more refined version\nof this restriction: a global cardinality constraint prescribes how many\nvariables have to be assigned each particular value. We study the parameterized\ncomplexity of these types of CSPs where the parameter is the required number\n$k$ of nonzero variables. As special cases, we can obtain natural and\nwell-studied parameterized problems such as Independent Set, Vertex Cover,\nd-Hitting Set, Biclique, etc.\n  In the case of constraint languages closed under substitution of constants,\nwe give a complete characterization of the fixed-parameter tractable cases of\nCSPs with size constraints, and we show that all the remaining problems are\nW[1]-hard. For CSPs with cardinality constraints, we obtain a similar\nclassification, but for some of the problems we are only able to show that they\nare Biclique-hard. The exact parameterized complexity of the Biclique problem\nis a notorious open problem, although it is believed to be W[1]-hard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 12:35:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 20:59:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bulatov", "Andrei A.", ""], ["Marx", "D\u00e1niel", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4912", "submitter": "Bart M.

A classical problem L AND/OR-cross-composes into a parameterized\nproblem Q if it is possible to efficiently construct an instance of Q with\npolynomially bounded parameter value that expresses the logical AND or OR of a\nsequence of instances of L. Building on work by Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008)\nand using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008) with a refinement by\nDell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010), we show that if an NP-hard problem\nOR-cross-composes into a parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a\npolynomial kernel unless NP \\subseteq coNP/poly and the polynomial hierarchy\ncollapses. Similarly, an AND-cross-composition for Q rules out polynomial\nkernels for Q under Bodlaender et al.'s AND-distillation conjecture.\n  Our technique generalizes and strengthens the recent techniques of using\ncomposition algorithms and of transferring the lower bounds via polynomial\nparameter transformations. We show its applicability by proving kernelization\nlower bounds for a number of important graphs problems with structural\n(non-standard) parameterizations, e.g., Clique, Chromatic Number, Weighted\nFeedback Vertex Set, and Weighted Odd Cycle Transversal do not admit polynomial\nkernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs unless the\npolynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these problems are\ntrivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter.\n  After learning of our results, several teams of authors have successfully\napplied the cross-composition framework to different parameterized problems.\nFor completeness, our presentation of the framework includes several extensions\nbased on this follow-up work. For example, we show how a relaxed version of\nOR-cross-compositions may be used to give lower bounds on the degree of the\npolynomial in the kernel size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 10:06:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bodlaender", "Hans L.", ""], ["Jansen", "Bart M.
