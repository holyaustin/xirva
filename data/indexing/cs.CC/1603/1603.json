There is a class ${\\cal H}$ of\nhost graphs. One selects a graph $H\\in{\\cal H}$ and plants in it a balanced\n$k$-coloring (by partitioning the vertex set into $k$ roughly equal parts, and\nremoving all edges within each part). The resulting graph $G$ is given as input\nto a polynomial time algorithm that needs to $k$-color $G$ (any legal\n$k$-coloring would do -- the algorithm is not required to recover the planted\n$k$-coloring). Earlier planted models correspond to the case that ${\\cal H}$ is\nthe class of all $n$-vertex $d$-regular graphs, a member $H\\in{\\cal H}$ is\nchosen at random, and then a balanced $k$-coloring is planted at random. Blum\nand Spencer [1995] designed algorithms for this model when $d=n^{\\delta}$ (for\n$0<\\delta\\le1$), and Alon and Kahale [1997] managed to do so even when $d$ is a\nsufficiently large constant.\n  The new aspect in our framework is that it need not involve randomness.
