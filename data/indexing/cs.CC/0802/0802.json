Its variant called \"Maximum Compatible Tree\" (MCT) is less stringent,\nas it allows the input trees to be refined. Both problems are of particular\ninterest in computational biology, where trees encountered have often small\ndegrees.\n  In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of MAST and MCT with\nrespect to the maximum degree, denoted by D, of the input trees. It is known\nthat MAST is polynomial for bounded D. As a counterpart, we show that the\nproblem is W[1]-hard with respect to parameter D. Moreover, relying on recent\nadvances in parameterized complexity we obtain a tight lower bound: while MAST\ncan be solved in O(N^{O(D)}) time where N denotes the input length, we show\nthat an O(N^{o(D)}) bound is not achievable, unless SNP is contained in SE. We\nalso show that MCT is W[1]-hard with respect to D, and that MCT cannot be\nsolved in O(N^{o(2^{D/2})}) time, SNP is contained in SE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2008 16:18:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2008 01:54:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2008 10:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Guillemot", "Sylvain", ""], ["Nicolas", "Francois", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.0116", "submitter": "Lutz Schr\\\"oder", "authors": "Lutz Schr\\\"oder and Dirk Patinson", "title": "Shallow Models for Non-Iterative Modal Logics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Imperial College TR Computing 2008/3", "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC cs.MA", "license": null, "abstract": "  The methods used to establish PSPACE-bounds for modal logics can roughly be\ngrouped into two classes: syntax driven methods establish that exhaustive proof\nsearch can be performed in polynomial space whereas semantic approaches\ndirectly construct shallow models.

Starting\nwith a very natural setting for strategies available to the advertisers, and\nvia a careful look through the algorithmic lens, we first propose solution\nconcepts for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as\nthey try to optimize their budget allocation across various keywords. Next, we\nconsider two broad match scenarios based on factors such as information\nasymmetry between advertisers and the auctioneer, and the extent of\nauctioneer's control on the budget splitting.

We show that, the same broad match may lead to different equilibria,\none leading to a revenue improvement, whereas another to a revenue loss. This\nleaves the auctioneer in a dilemma - whether to broad-match or not.

Through the inequality that relates\nstochasticity and chaoticity of random binary sequences we maintain that Lin's\nnotion of stability corresponds to the stability of the frequency of 1s in the\nselected subsequence. This explains why more complex static structures are less\nstable. Lin's third law is represented as the inevitable change that static\nstructure undergo towards conforming to the universe's perfect randomness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 12:41:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Mar 2008 15:50:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ratsaby", "Joel", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4307", "submitter": "Moustapha Diaby", "authors": "Moustapha Diaby", "title": "A O(n^8) X O(n^7) Linear Programming Model of the Quadratic Assignment\n  Problem", "comments": "Theorem 21 and Corollary 22 are in error; The modeling needs\n  9-dimensional variables instead of the 8-dimensional variables defined in\n  notations 6.9", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn because Theorem 21 and Corollary 22 are in\nerror; The modeling idea is OK, but it needs 9-dimensional variables instead of\nthe 8-dimensional variables defined in notations 6.9.\n  Examples of the correct model (with 9-index variables) are: (1) Diaby, M.,\n\"Linear Programming Formulation of the Set Partitioning Problem,\" International\nJournal of Operational Research 8:4 (August 2010) pp. 399-427; (2) Diaby, M.,\n\"Linear Programming Formulation of the Vertex Coloring Problem,\" International\nJournal of Mathematics in Operational Research 2:3 (May 2010) pp. 259-289; (3)\nDiaby, M., \"The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Linear Programming Formulation,\"\nWSEAS Transactions on Mathematics, 6:6 (June 2007) pp. 745-754.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 00:03:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 17:35:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Sep 2010 21:07:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2013 03:17:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 15:12:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 19:35:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Diaby", "Moustapha", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4312", "submitter": "Xiaoyang Gu", "authors": "Xiaoyang Gu, Jack H.
