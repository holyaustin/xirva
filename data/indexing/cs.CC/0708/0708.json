I call devices with\nthat structure \"inference devices\". I present a set of existence and\nimpossibility results concerning inference devices. These results hold\nindependent of the precise physical laws governing our universe. In a limited\nsense, the impossibility results establish that Laplace was wrong to claim that\neven in a classical, non-chaotic universe the future can be unerringly\npredicted, given sufficient knowledge of the present. Alternatively, these\nimpossibility results can be viewed as a non-quantum mechanical \"uncertainty\nprinciple\". Next I explore the close connections between the mathematics of\ninference devices and of Turing Machines. In particular, the impossibility\nresults for inference devices are similar to the Halting theorem for TM's.\nFurthermore, one can define an analog of Universal TM's (UTM's) for inference\ndevices. I call those analogs \"strong inference devices\". I use strong\ninference devices to define the \"inference complexity\" of an inference task,\nwhich is the analog of the Kolmogorov complexity of computing a string. However\nno universe can contain more than one strong inference device. So whereas the\nKolmogorov complexity of a string is arbitrary up to specification of the UTM,\nthere is no such arbitrariness in the inference complexity of an inference\ntask. I end by discussing the philosophical implications of these results,\ne.g., for whether the universe \"is\" a computer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2007 03:19:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2008 22:11:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wolpert", "David H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1529", "submitter": "Iddo Tzameret", "authors": "Ran Raz, Iddo Tzameret", "title": "Resolution over Linear Equations and Multilinear Proofs", "comments": "44 pages", "journal-ref": "Annals of Pure and Applied Logic , 155(3):194-224, 2008;", "doi": "10.1016/j.apal.2008.04.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.LO", "license": null, "abstract": "  We develop and study the complexity of propositional proof systems of varying\nstrength extending resolution by allowing it to operate with disjunctions of\nlinear equations instead of clauses.
