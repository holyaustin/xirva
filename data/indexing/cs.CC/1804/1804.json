This unifies and\ngeneralizes a sequence of past works on matrix, operator and tensor scaling.\nOur algorithm provides an efficient weak membership oracle for the associated\nmoment polytopes, an important family of implicitly-defined convex polytopes\nwith exponentially many facets and a wide range of applications. These include\nthe entanglement polytopes from quantum information theory (in particular, we\nobtain an efficient solution to the notorious one-body quantum marginal\nproblem) and the Kronecker polytopes from representation theory (which capture\nthe asymptotic support of Kronecker coefficients). Our algorithm can be applied\nto succinct descriptions of the input tensor whenever the marginals can be\nefficiently computed, as in the important case of matrix product states or\ntensor-train decompositions, widely used in computational physics and numerical\nmathematics.\n  We strengthen and generalize the alternating minimization approach of\nprevious papers by introducing the theory of highest weight vectors from\nrepresentation theory into the numerical optimization framework. We show that\nhighest weight vectors are natural potential functions for scaling algorithms\nand prove new bounds on their evaluations to obtain polynomial-time\nconvergence. Our techniques are general and we believe that they will be\ninstrumental to obtain efficient algorithms for moment polytopes beyond the\nones consider here, and more broadly, for other optimization problems\npossessing natural symmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2018 22:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2018 02:16:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00fcrgisser", "Peter", ""], ["Franks", "Cole", ""], ["Garg", "Ankit", ""], ["Oliveira", "Rafael", ""], ["Walter", "Michael", ""], ["Wigderson", "Avi", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.04993", "submitter": "Stanislav Zivny", "authors": "Miriam Backens, Andrei Bulatov, Leslie Ann Goldberg, Colin McQuillan\n  and Stanislav \\v{Z}ivn\\'y", "title": "Boolean approximate counting CSPs with weak conservativity, and\n  implications for ferromagnetic two-spin", "comments": "37 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computer and System Sciences 109 95-125 (2020)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcss.2019.12.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyse the complexity of approximate counting constraint satisfactions\nproblems $\\mathrm{\\#CSP}(\\mathcal{F})$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ is a set of\nnonnegative rational-valued functions of Boolean variables.

This class of objectives gives rise to an interesting trade-off between\nfull and partial information. As in full observation, the strategy in the MDP\ncan depend on the state of the system, but similar to partial information, the\nstrategy needs to account for all the states at the same time. In this paper,\nwe focus on two safety problems that arise naturally in this context, namely,\nexistential and universal safety. Given an MDP A and a closed and convex\npolytope H of probability distributions over the states of A, the existential\nsafety problem asks whether there exists some distribution d in H and a\nstrategy of A, such that starting from d and repeatedly applying this strategy\nkeeps the distribution forever in H. The universal safety problem asks whether\nfor all distributions in H, there exists such a strategy of A which keeps the\ndistribution forever in H. We prove that both problems are decidable, with\ntight complexity bounds: we show that existential safety is PTIME-complete,\nwhile universal safety is co-NP-complete. Further, we compare these results\nwith existential and universal safety problems for Rabin's probabilistic\nfinite-state automata (PFA), the subclass of Partially Observable MDPs which\nhave zero observation. Compared to MDPs, strategies of PFAs are not\nstate-dependent. In sharp contrast to the PTIME result, we show that\nexistential safety for PFAs is undecidable, with H having closed and open\nboundaries. On the other hand, it turns out that the universal safety for PFAs\nis decidable in EXPTIME, with a co-NP lower bound. Finally, we show that an\nalternate representation of the input polytope allows us to improve the\ncomplexity of universal safety for MDPs and PFAs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2018 04:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Akshay", "S.", ""], ["Genest", "Blaise", ""], ["Vyas", "Nikhil", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09787", "submitter": "Timothy Gowers", "authors": "W.
