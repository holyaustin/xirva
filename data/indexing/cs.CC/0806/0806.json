In such\ncontrol scenarios, an external agent seeks to change the outcome of an election\nvia actions such as adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters.\nSP-AV combines the voters' preference rankings with their approvals of\ncandidates, where in elections with at least two candidates the voters'\napproval strategies are adjusted--if needed--to approve of their most-preferred\ncandidate and to disapprove of their least-preferred candidate. This rule\ncoerces admissibility of the votes even in the presence of control actions, and\nhybridizes, in effect, approval with pluralitiy voting.\n  We prove that this system is computationally resistant (i.e., the\ncorresponding control problems are NP-hard) to 19 out of 22 types of\nconstructive and destructive control. Thus, SP-AV has more resistances to\ncontrol than is currently known for any other natural voting system with a\npolynomial-time winner problem. In particular, SP-AV is (after Copeland voting,\nsee Faliszewski et al. [AAIM-2008, Springer LNCS 5034, pp. 165-176, 2008]) the\nsecond natural voting system with an easy winner-determination procedure that\nis known to have full resistance to constructive control, and unlike Copeland\nvoting it in addition displays broad resistance to destructive control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 13:27:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 22:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Sep 2008 21:57:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 09:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 15:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Erdelyi", "Gabor", ""], ["Nowak", "Markus", ""], ["Rothe", "Joerg", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0837", "submitter": "Leonid Reyzin", "authors": "Nenad Dedi\\'c, Gene Itkis, Leonid Reyzin, Scott Russell", "title": "Upper and Lower Bounds on Black-Box Steganography", "comments": "27 pages; to be published in Journal of Cryptology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00145-008-9020-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the limitations of steganography when the sender is not using any\nproperties of the underlying channel beyond its entropy and the ability to\nsample from it.

One\npossible approach to overcome this difficulty is to establish a one-to-one\ncorrespondence (i.e. a matching) between genes of both genomes, where the\ncorrespondence is chosen in order to optimize the studied measure. In this\npaper, we are interested in three measures (number of breakpoints, number of\ncommon intervals and number of conserved intervals) and three models of\nmatching (exemplar, intermediate and maximum matching models). We prove that,\nfor each model and each measure M, computing a matching between two genomes\nthat optimizes M is APX-hard. We also study the complexity of the following\nproblem: is there an exemplarization (resp. an intermediate/maximum matching)\nthat induces no breakpoint? We prove the problem to be NP-Complete in the\nexemplar model for a new class of instances, and we show that the problem is in\nP in the maximum matching model. We also focus on a fourth measure: the number\nof adjacencies, for which we give several approximation algorithms in the\nmaximum matching model, in the case where genomes contain the same number of\nduplications of each gene.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jun 2008 08:15:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Angibaud", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "LINA"], ["Fertin", "Guillaume", "", "LINA"], ["Rusu", "Irena", "", "LINA"], ["Thevenin", "Annelyse", "", "LRI"], ["Vialette", "St\u00e9phane", "", "IGM"]]}, {"id": "0806.1413", "submitter": "Olivier Finkel", "authors": "Olivier Finkel (ELM, IMJ, LIP)", "title": "Topological Complexity of Context-Free omega-Languages: A Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "LIP Research Report RR 2008-17", "categories": "cs.LO cs.CC math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We survey recent results on the topological complexity of context-free\nomega-languages which form the second level of the Chomsky hierarchy of\nlanguages of infinite words.

The\nprincipal question we address in this thesis is: How to recognize if an\nNP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the\nmain reasons for this?

We describe new properties of the space of solutions\nin two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random\nsatisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the\nexistence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a\nproblem.
