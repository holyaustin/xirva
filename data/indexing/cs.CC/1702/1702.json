In the\nwell-studied cooperative, or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is\nknown that there is a tile set to simulate any Turing machine and an\nintrinsically universal tile set that simulates the shapes and dynamics of any\ninstance of the model, up to spatial rescaling. It has been an open question as\nto whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is\ncapable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing\nthat there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically\nuniversal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a\nbounded region of the plane.\n  Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity\nand power of the cooperative model it was not obvious how to prove this. One\nreason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of\ncomplicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A\nsecond reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the\nmodel (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles\nthat repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great\ncomputational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all\nof these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation\npower. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic\nnoncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the\nfact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D\nnoncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal\ntilesets. Our second main result gives a new technique (reduction to\nsimulation) for proving negative results about computation in tile assembly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 16:55:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 May 2017 17:13:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Meunier", "Pierre-\u00c9tienne", ""], ["Woods", "Damien", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00467", "submitter": "Cristopher Moore", "authors": "Cristopher Moore", "title": "The Computer Science and Physics of Community Detection: Landscapes,\n  Phase Transitions, and Hardness", "comments": "This review article first appeared in the Bulletin of the EATCS; I\n  plan to update it sporadically, and this is the first such update.

While there are many\nways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where\nthere is a \"ground truth\" community structure built into the graph somehow. The\ntask is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph.\n  Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then\nrigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase\ntransition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too\nsparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no\nalgorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or\neven tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely\nrandom one with high probability. Above this information-theoretic threshold,\nthere is a second threshold beyond which polynomial-time algorithms are known\nto succeed; in between, there is a regime in which community detection is\npossible, but conjectured to require exponential time.\n  For computer scientists, this field offers a wealth of new ideas and open\nquestions, with connections to probability and combinatorics, message-passing\nalgorithms, and random matrix theory.
