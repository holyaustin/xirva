Such statements would be natural candidates for being added as\naxioms, but how can we obtain them? One classical (and well studied) approach\nis to add to some theory T an axiom that claims the consistency of T. In this\npaper we discuss another approach motivated by Chaitin's version of G\u007f\\\"odel's\ntheorem where axioms claiming the randomness (or incompressibility) of some\nstrings are probabilistically added, and show that it is not really useful, in\nthe sense that this does not help us to prove new interesting theorems. This\nresult answers a question recently asked by Lipton. The situation changes if we\ntake into account the size of the proofs: randomly chosen axioms may help\nmaking proofs much shorter, unless NP=PSPACE. We then study the axiomatic power\nof the statements of type \"the Kolmogorov complexity of x exceeds n\" in\ngeneral. They are \\Pi_1 (universally quantified) statements of Peano\narithmetic. We show that by adding all true statements of this type, we obtain\na theory that proves all true \\Pi_1-statements, and also provide a more\ndetailed classification. In particular, to derive all true \\Pi_1-statements it\nis sufficient to add one statement of this type for each n (or even for\ninfinitely many n) if strings are chosen in a special way. On the other hand,\none may add statements of this type for most x of length n (for every n) and\nstill obtain a weak theory. We also study other logical questions related to\n\"random axioms\". Finally, we consider a theory that claims Martin-L\u007f\\\"of\nrandomness of a given infinite binary sequence. This claim can be formalized in\ndifferent ways. We show that different formalizations are closely related but\nnot equivalent, and study their properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 16:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bienvenu", "Laurent", ""], ["Romashchenko", "Andrei", ""], ["Shen", "Alexander", ""], ["Taveneaux", "Antoine", ""], ["Vermeeren", "Stijn", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3771", "submitter": "Shinnosuke Seki", "authors": "Shinnosuke Seki", "title": "Combinatorial Optimization in Pattern Assembly", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pattern self-assembly tile set synthesis (PATS) is a combinatorial\noptimization problem which aim at minimizing a rectilinear tile assembly system\n(RTAS) that uniquely self-assembles a given rectangular pattern, and is known\nto be NP-hard.
