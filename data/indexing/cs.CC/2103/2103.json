In (sequential) token\nswapping, the goal is to use the shortest possible sequence of swaps, each of\nwhich exchanges the tokens at the two endpoints of an edge of the graph. In\nparallel token swapping, the goal is to use the fewest rounds, each of which\nconsists of one or more swaps on the edges of a matching. We prove that both of\nthese problems remain NP-hard when the graph is restricted to be a tree.\n  These token swapping problems have been studied by disparate groups of\nresearchers in discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, robot motion\nplanning, game theory, and engineering. Previous work establishes\nNP-completeness on general graphs (for both problems); polynomial-time\nalgorithms for simple graph classes such as cliques, stars, paths, and cycles;\nand constant-factor approximation algorithms in some cases. The two natural\ncases of sequential and parallel token swapping in trees were first studied\nover thirty years ago (as \"sorting with a transposition tree\") and over\ntwenty-five years ago (as \"routing permutations via matchings\"), yet their\ncomplexities were previously unknown.\n  We also show limitations on approximation of sequential token swapping on\ntrees: we identify a broad class of algorithms that encompass all three known\npolynomial-time algorithms that achieve the best known approximation factor\n(which is $2$) and show that no such algorithm can achieve an approximation\nfactor less than $2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Mar 2021 14:51:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Aichholzer", "Oswin", ""], ["Demaine", "Erik D.", ""], ["Korman", "Matias", ""], ["Lynch", "Jayson", ""], ["Lubiw", "Anna", ""], ["Mas", "Zuzana", ""], ["Rudoy", "Mikhail", ""], ["Williams", "Virginia Vassilevska", ""], ["Wein", "Nicole", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.06914", "submitter": "Konstantinos Meichanetzidis", "authors": "Alex Townsend-Teague and Konstantinos Meichanetzidis", "title": "Classifying Complexity with the ZX-Calculus: Jones Polynomials and Potts\n  Partition Functions", "comments": "QPL 2021 submission", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The ZX-calculus is a graphical language which allows for reasoning about\nsuitably represented tensor networks - namely ZX-diagrams - in terms of rewrite\nrules.

The\nnotion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or\ntopological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical\ntopology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for\nconstructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of\nlocal computations. In 1991, Abello et al. asked for a classification of the\ncomputational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target\ngraph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many\ngeneral results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of\nthat, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of\nnormal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges.\nSemi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph\ntheory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the\nlocal computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering\ngraph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem\nconsiderably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex\nmapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge\nmapping as well. We show some solvable cases, and completely characterize the\ncomplexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and\ntwo-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven\nfor simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs,\neven for bipartite ones.
