As a consequence, they have been successfully employed\nin discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety\nof mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold\ntopology, geometry, and others). However, due to the large variety of\napplications, requirements vary from field to field and thus different types of\ntriangulations, different tools, and different frameworks are used in different\nareas of research. This is why today closely related research areas are\nsometimes largely disjoint leaving potential reciprocal benefits unused.\n  To address these potentials a workshop on Triangulations was held at\nOberwolfach Research Institute in 2012. Since then many new collaborations\nbetween researchers of different mathematical communities have been\nestablished. Regarding the computational geometry community, the theory of\nmanifolds continues to contribute to advances in more applied areas of the\nfield. Many researchers are interested in fundamental mathematical research\nabout triangulations and thus will benefit from a broad set of knowledge about\ndifferent research areas using different techniques.\n  We hope that this workshop brought together researchers from many different\nfields of computational geometry to have fruitful discussions which will lead\nto new interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 11:36:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Spreer", "Jonathan", "", "Organisers"], ["Wagner", "Uli", "", "Organisers"], ["Burton", "Benjamin A.", ""], ["Murai", "Satoshi", ""], ["Sedgwick", "Eric", ""], ["Segerman", "Henry", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.0373", "submitter": "Ryuhei Mori", "authors": "Ryuhei Mori, Takeshi Koshiba, Osamu Watanabe, and Masaki Yamamoto", "title": "Linear Programming Relaxations for Goldreich's Generators over\n  Non-Binary Alphabets", "comments": "14 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Goldreich suggested candidates of one-way functions and pseudorandom\ngenerators included in $\\mathsf{NC}^0$.
