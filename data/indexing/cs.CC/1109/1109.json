In recent years, major breakthroughs have\nbeen made in a study of counting constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs).\nIn particular, a computational complexity classification of bounded-degree\n#CSPs has been discovered for all degrees except for two, where the \"degree\" of\nan input instance is the maximal number of times that each input variable\nappears in a given set of constraints. Despite the efforts of recent studies,\nhowever, a complexity classification of degree-2 #CSPs has eluded from our\nunderstandings. This paper challenges this open problem and gives its partial\nsolution by applying two novel proof techniques--T_{2}-constructibility and\nparametrized symmetrization--which are specifically designed to handle\n\"arbitrary\" constraints under randomized approximation-preserving reductions.\nWe partition entire constraints into four sets and we classify the\napproximation complexity of all degree-2 #CSPs whose constraints are drawn from\ntwo of the four sets into two categories: problems computable in\npolynomial-time or problems that are at least as hard as #SAT.
