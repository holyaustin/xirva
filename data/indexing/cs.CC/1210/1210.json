We consider in this paper\ntwo problems involving maximal scoring subsequences of a sequence. Both of\nthese problems arise in the context of buffer memory minimization in computer\nnetworks. The first one, which is called {\\sc Insertion in a Sequence with\nScores (ISS)}, consists in inserting a given real number $x$ in $A$ in such a\nway to minimize the sum of a maximum scoring subsequence of the resulting\nsequence, which can be easily done in $O(n^2)$ time by successively applying\nKadane's algorithm to compute the maximum scoring subsequence of the resulting\nsequence corresponding to each possible insertion position for $x$. We show in\nthis paper that the ISS problem can be solved in linear time and space with a\nmore specialized algorithm. The second problem we consider in this paper is the\n{\\sc Sorting a Sequence by Scores (SSS)} one, stated as follows: find a\npermutation $A'$ of $A$ that minimizes the sum of a maximum scoring\nsubsequence.
