This rather limited result is also\nsensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier\ntransform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix\n(which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgenstern's arguments,\nunder proper scaling).\n  In this work we extend the arguments of Ailon (2013).

Nonetheless, a variety\nof models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in\nwhich temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation\nthrough a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several\nof those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate\nthe stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.\n  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1\nsystems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)\nin which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is\nalso unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2\naTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the\nDupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a\nmodel which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at\ntemperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any\naTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be\nsimulated by any system in the aTAM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Mar 2014 18:41:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hendricks", "Jacob", ""], ["Patitz", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Rogers", "Trent A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3881", "submitter": "Seyed Rasoul Etesami", "authors": "Seyed Rasoul Etesami, Tamer Basar", "title": "Complexity of Equilibrium in Diffusion Games on Social Networks", "comments": "A shorter version of this paper has been appeared in 2014 American\n  Control Conference (ACC2014)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.DC cs.DM cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the competitive diffusion game, and study the\nexistence of its pure-strategy Nash equilibrium when defined over general\nundirected networks.

We study the complexity of two\nconnection games among the most widely played. Namely, we prove that Havannah\nand TwixT are PSPACE-complete. The proof for Havannah involves a reduction from\nGeneralized Geography and is based solely on ring-threats to represent the\ninput graph. On the other hand, the reduction for TwixT builds up on previous\nwork as it is a straightforward encoding of Hex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 21:55:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bonnet", "Edouard", ""], ["Jamain", "Florian", ""], ["Saffidine", "Abdallah", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6710", "submitter": "G\\'abor Braun", "authors": "G\\'abor Braun and Sebastian Pokutta", "title": "The matching polytope does not admit fully-polynomial size relaxation\n  schemes", "comments": "21 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of SODA 2015, 837-846", "doi": "10.1137/1.9781611973730.57", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The groundbreaking work of Rothvo{\\ss} [arxiv:1311.2369] established that\nevery linear program expressing the matching polytope has an exponential number\nof inequalities (formally, the matching polytope has exponential extension\ncomplexity). We generalize this result by deriving strong bounds on the\npolyhedral inapproximability of the matching polytope: for fixed $0 <\n\\varepsilon < 1$, every polyhedral $(1 + \\varepsilon / n)$-approximation\nrequires an exponential number of inequalities, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices. This is sharp given the well-known $\\rho$-approximation of size\n$O(\\binom{n}{\\rho/(\\rho-1)})$ provided by the odd-sets of size up to\n$\\rho/(\\rho-1)$. Thus matching is the first problem in $P$, whose natural\nlinear encoding does not admit a fully polynomial-size relaxation scheme (the\npolyhedral equivalent of an FPTAS), which provides a sharp separation from the\npolynomial-size relaxation scheme obtained e.g., via constant-sized odd-sets\nmentioned above.\n  Our approach reuses ideas from Rothvo{\\ss} [arxiv:1311.2369], however the\nmain lower bounding technique is different. While the original proof is based\non the hyperplane separation bound (also called the rectangle corruption\nbound), we employ the information-theoretic notion of common information as\nintroduced in Braun and Pokutta [http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/056/],\nwhich allows to analyze perturbations of slack matrices. It turns out that the\nhigh extension complexity for the matching polytope stem from the same source\nof hardness as for the correlation polytope: a direct sum structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:25:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 15:43:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 20:37:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 19:44:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2015 19:45:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2015 15:16:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Braun", "G\u00e1bor", ""], ["Pokutta", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7428", "submitter": "Egor Ianovski", "authors": "Egor Ianovski", "title": "DValue for Boolean games is EXP-complete", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the following problem is EXP-complete: given a rational v and a\ntwo player, zero-sum Boolean game G determine whether the value of G is at\nleast v.
