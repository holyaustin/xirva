Assuming the truth of a deep conjecture from\nconvex geometry, known as the Hyperplane conjecture, we can extend our results\nto arbitrary linear queries giving nearly matching upper and lower bounds.\n  Our bound translates to error\n$O(\\min\\{d/\\epsilon,\\sqrt{d\\log(n/d)}/\\epsilon\\})$ per answer. The best\nprevious upper bound (Laplacian mechanism) gives a bound of\n$O(\\min\\{d/\\eps,\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon\\})$ per answer, while the best known lower\nbound was $\\Omega(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon)$. In contrast, our lower bound is strong\nenough to separate the concept of differential privacy from the notion of\napproximate differential privacy where an upper bound of $O(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon)$\ncan be achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2009 22:26:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 00:40:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2009 20:53:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hardt", "Moritz", ""], ["Talwar", "Kunal", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.3780", "submitter": "Srikanth Srinivasan", "authors": "V.

We show that there are universal ANEPFCs of size 10, by devising a\nmethod for simulating 2-Tag Systems. This result significantly improves the\nknown upper bound for the size of universal ANEPFCs which is 18.\n  We also propose a new, computationally and descriptionally efficient\nsimulation of nondeterministic Turing machines by ANEPFCs. More precisely, we\ndescribe (informally, due to space limitations) how ANEPFCs with 16 nodes can\nsimulate in O(f(n)) time any nondeterministic Turing machine of time complexity\nf(n). Thus the known upper bound for the number of nodes in a network\nsimulating an arbitrary Turing machine is decreased from 26 to 16.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2009 13:57:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Loos", "Remco", ""], ["Manea", "Florin", ""], ["Mitrana", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5257", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "J\\\"urgen Dassow, Giovanni Pighizzini, Bianca Truthe", "title": "Proceedings Eleventh International Workshop on Descriptional Complexity\n  of Formal Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 3, 2009", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The 11th workshop, Descriptional Complexity of Formal Systems 2009, is taking\nplace in Magdeburg, Germany, on July 6-9, 2009.
