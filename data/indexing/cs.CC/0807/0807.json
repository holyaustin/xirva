Such a complexity measure, known as state complexity of\noperations, is useful in measuring how much information is necessary to convert\nlanguages. We focus on intersection, union, reversals, and catenation\noperations and show some upper bounds of state complexity of operations on\n2qfa's. Also, we present a number of non-regular languages and prove that these\nlanguages can be accepted by 2qfa's with one-sided error probabilities within\nlinear time. Notably, these examples show that our bounds obtained for these\noperations are not tight, and therefore worth improving. We give an instance to\nshow that the upper bound of the state number for the simulation of one-way\ndeterministic finite automata by two-way reversible finite automata is not\ntight in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2008 02:26:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Qiu", "Daowen", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.0672", "submitter": "Mark Burgin", "authors": "Mark Burgin", "title": "Algorithmic Problem Complexity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  People solve different problems and know that some of them are simple, some\nare complex and some insoluble.

Then we consider problems for such\ninfinite objects as functions and study algorithmic complexity of these\nproblems, also building optimal complexity measures. In the second part of the\nwork, complexity of algorithmic problems, such as the halting problem for\nTuring machines, is measured by the classes of automata that are necessary to\nsolve this problem. To classify different problems with respect to their\ncomplexity, inductive Turing machines, which extend possibilities of Turing\nmachines, are used. A hierarchy of inductive Turing machines generates an\ninductive hierarchy of algorithmic problems.

These abstractions\nare fundamental coordination problems in cooperative mobile robotics. Moreover,\ntheir oblivious characteristics makes them appealing for self-stabilization\nsince they are self-stabilizing with no extra-cost. Given a set of robots with\narbitrary initial location and no initial agreement on a global coordinate\nsystem, gathering requires that all robots reach the exact same but not\npredetermined location while scattering aims at scatter robots such that no two\nrobots share the same location. Both deterministic gathering and scattering\nhave been proved impossible under arbitrary schedulers therefore probabilistic\nsolutions have been recently proposed. The contribution of this paper is\ntwofold. First, we propose a detailed complexity analysis of the existent\nprobabilistic gathering algorithms in both fault-free and fault-prone\nenvironments. We consider both crash and byzantine-prone environments.\nMoreover, using Markov chains tools and additional assumptions on the\nenvironment we prove that the gathering convergence time can be reduced from\nO(n^2) (the best known tight bound) to O(nln(n)). Additionally, we prove that\nin crash-prone environments gathering is achieved in O(nln(n)+2f). Second,\nusing the same technique we prove that the best known scattering strategy\nconverges in fault-free systems is O(n) (which is one to optimal) while in\ncrash-prone environments it needs O(n-f).
