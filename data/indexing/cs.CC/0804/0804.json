In this model, Alice gets\nan input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output\na,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).\n  We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity\ndistributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which\ngives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum\ncommunication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.\nWe show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they\ncoincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual\nexpressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These\nlower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,\nmost notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special\ncase of Boolean functions.\n  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at\nmost linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend\non the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between\nmaximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known\nonly for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.\n  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical\ncommunication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any\nnon-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum\ndistribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of\ncommunication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 16:08:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2008 21:29:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2009 15:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 20:40:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 15:15:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Degorre", "Julien", ""], ["Kaplan", "Marc", ""], ["Laplante", "Sophie", ""], ["Roland", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie", ""]]}]
