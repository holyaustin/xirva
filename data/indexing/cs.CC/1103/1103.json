Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as\nconjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and\nhence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant's\nframework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether\nconjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant,\n2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new\ncombinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of\nlearning from correlations.\n  We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions\nhaving a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable\ndistribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm\nrelies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses\ninstead of 0-1 loss in Valiant's (2007) original definition. The proof of\nevolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions\nthat are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in\nseveral other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Valiant, 2010). An important\nproperty of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm\nguarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance.
