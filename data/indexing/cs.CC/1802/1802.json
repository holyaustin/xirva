The input to an $n$-fold integer\nprogram (IP) consists of parameter $A$, dimension $n$, and numerical data of\nbinary encoding length $L$. It was known for some time that such programs can\nbe solved in polynomial time using $O(n^{g(A)}L)$ arithmetic operations where\n$g$ is an exponential function of the parameter. In 2013 it was shown that it\ncan be solved in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time using $O(f(A)n^3L)$\narithmetic operations for a single-exponential function $f$. This, and a faster\nalgorithm for a special case of combinatorial $n$-fold IP, have led to several\nvery recent breakthroughs in the parameterized complexity of scheduling,\nstringology, and computational social choice. In 2015 it was shown that it can\nbe solved in strongly polynomial time using $O(n^{g(A)})$ arithmetic\noperations.\n  Here we establish a result which subsumes all three of the above results by\nshowing that $n$-fold IP can be solved in strongly polynomial FPT time using\n$O(f(A)n^3)$ arithmetic operations.

We consider elections with partitioned\nprofiles over positional scoring rules, with an unbounded number of candidates,\nand unweighted voters. Our first result is a polynomial time algorithm for\nvoting rules with $2$ distinct values, which include the well-known\n$k$-approval voting rule. We then go on to prove NP-hardness for a class of\nrules that contain all voting rules that produce scoring vectors with at least\n$4$ distinct values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Feb 2018 13:21:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kenig", "Batya", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.09022", "submitter": "Eduard Gorbunov", "authors": "Eduard Gorbunov and Pavel Dvurechensky and Alexander Gasnikov", "title": "An Accelerated Method for Derivative-Free Smooth Stochastic Convex\n  Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an unconstrained problem of minimizing a smooth convex function\nwhich is only available through noisy observations of its values, the noise\nconsisting of two parts.
