It is\nwell-known that the standard oracularization technique completely fails in some\nproof systems under the existence of prior entanglement. This paper studies two\nconstructions of two-prover one-round interactive proof systems based on\noracularization. First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially\nsmall soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest\nprovers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use\narbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time\nhierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still\nadvantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use\nquantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round\ninteractive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query\nprobabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even\nagainst dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a\nconsequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive\nproof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap\nbetween completeness and soundness, in which each prover responds with only two\nbits. In other words, it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse-polynomial\nthe value of a classical two-prover one-round game, even when provers are\nentangled and each sends a two-bit answer to a verifier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 18:24:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Tsuyoshi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Hirotada", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Keiji", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1018", "submitter": "Alexander Russell", "authors": "Cristopher Moore and Alexander Russell", "title": "A simple constant-probability RP reduction from NP to Parity P", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The proof of Toda's celebrated theorem that the polynomial hierarchy is\ncontained in $\\P^{# P}$ relies on the fact that, under mild technical\nconditions on the complexity class $C$, we have $\\exists C \\subset BP \\cdot\n\\oplus C$.

We prove\nextensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur MA and Quantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur\nQCMA. Our results have implications for the complexity of approximating the\nground state energy of a quantum local Hamiltonian with a unique ground state\nand an inverse polynomial spectral gap. We show that the estimation (to within\npolynomial accuracy) of the ground state energy of poly-gapped 1-D local\nHamiltonians is QCMA-hard [AN02], under randomized reductions. This is in stark\ncontrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D Hamiltonians, which is in NP\n[Has07]. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be reduced to NP by randomized\nreductions, there is no classical description of the ground state of every\npoly-gapped local Hamiltonian that allows efficient calculation of expectation\nvalues.\n  Finally, we discuss a few of the obstacles to the establishment of an\nanalogous result to the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA).
