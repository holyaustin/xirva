A significant source of timing\nvariation comes from nondeterministic hardware interactions such as cache\nmisses. While data race detectors and model checkers can check races, the\nenormous state space of complex software makes it difficult to identify all of\nthe races and those residual implementation errors still remain a big\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose deterministic real-time scheduling methods\nto address scheduling nondeterminism in uniprocessor systems. The main idea is\nto use timing insensitive deterministic events, e.g, an instruction counter, in\nconjunction with a real-time clock to schedule threads. By introducing the\nconcept of Worst Case Executable Instructions (WCEI), we guarantee both\ndeterminism and real-time performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2011 04:06:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Yun", "Heechul", ""], ["Kim", "Cheolgi", ""], ["Sha", "Lui", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.3523", "submitter": "Paul Regnier M.", "authors": "Paul Regnier and George Lima and Ernesto Massa", "title": "An Optimal Real-Time Scheduling Approach: From Multiprocessor to\n  Uniprocessor", "comments": "10 pages - rejected for publication by ECRTS 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An optimal solution to the problem of scheduling real-time tasks on a set of\nidentical processors is derived.
