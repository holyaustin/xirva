It focuses on the Open Mobile API as an open interface to access\nsecure elements from Android applications. The overall architecture of the Open\nMobile API is described and current Android devices are analyzed with regard to\nthe availability of this API. Moreover, this report summarizes our efforts of\nreverse engineering the stock ROM of a Samsung Galaxy S3 in order to analyze\nthe integration of the Open Mobile API and the interface that is used to\nperform APDU-based communication with the UICC (Universal Integrated Circuit\nCard). It further provides a detailed explanation on how to integrate this\nfunctionality into CyanogenMod (an after-market firmware for Android devices).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:46:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Roland", "Michael", ""], ["H\u00f6lzl", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.05851", "submitter": "Flavio Lombardi", "authors": "Roberto di Pietro and Federico Franzoni and Flavio Lombardi", "title": "HyBIS: Windows Guest Protection through Advanced Memory Introspection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-58469-0_13", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Effectively protecting the Windows OS is a challenging task, since most\nimplementation details are not publicly known. Windows has always been the main\ntarget of malwares that have exploited numerous bugs and vulnerabilities.\nRecent trusted boot and additional integrity checks have rendered the Windows\nOS less vulnerable to kernel-level rootkits. Nevertheless, guest Windows\nVirtual Machines are becoming an increasingly interesting attack target. In\nthis work we introduce and analyze a novel Hypervisor-Based Introspection\nSystem (HyBIS) we developed for protecting Windows OSes from malware and\nrootkits. The HyBIS architecture is motivated and detailed, while targeted\nexperimental results show its effectiveness. Comparison with related work\nhighlights main HyBIS advantages such as: effective semantic introspection,\nsupport for 64-bit architectures and for latest Windows (8.x and 10), advanced\nmalware disabling capabilities. We believe the research effort reported here\nwill pave the way to further advances in the security of Windows OSes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 01:22:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["di Pietro", "Roberto", ""], ["Franzoni", "Federico", ""], ["Lombardi", "Flavio", ""]]}]
