By conducting a comprehensive\nexperiments, we have observed that such studies lack to consider very important\naspects of hybrid memories including the effect of: a) data migrations on\nperformance, b) data migrations on power, and c) the granularity of data\nmigration. This paper presents an efficient data migration scheme at the\nOperating System level in a hybrid DRAMNVM memory architecture. In the proposed\nscheme, two Least Recently Used (LRU) queues, one for DRAM section and one for\nNVM section, are used for the sake of data migration. With careful\ncharacterization of the workloads obtained from PARSEC benchmark suite, the\nproposed scheme prevents unnecessary migrations and only allows migrations\nwhich benefits the system in terms of power and performance. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed scheme can reduce the power consumption up to\n79% compared to DRAM-only memory and up to 48% compared to the state-of-the art\ntechniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2018 07:36:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Salkhordeh", "Reza", ""], ["Asadi", "Hossein", ""]]}]
