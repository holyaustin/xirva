Scheduling is a process which\ndecides order of task from a set of multiple tasks that are ready to execute.\nThere are number of CPU scheduling algorithms available, but it is very\ndifficult task to decide which one is better. This paper discusses the design\nand implementation of modified fuzzy based CPU scheduling algorithm. This paper\npresent a new set of fuzzy rules. It demonstrates that scheduling done with new\npriority improves average waiting time and average turnaround time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 May 2017 16:39:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kumari", "Rajani", ""], ["Sharma", "Vivek Kumar", ""], ["Kumar", "Sandeep", ""]]}]
