This paper addresses the problem of\nenergy-aware static partitioning of periodic real-time tasks on heterogeneous\nmultiprocessor platforms. A Particle Swarm Optimization variant based on\nMin-min technique for task partitioning is proposed. The proposed approach aims\nto minimize the overall energy consumption, meanwhile avoid deadline\nviolations. An energy-aware cost function is proposed to be considered in the\nproposed approach. Extensive simulations and comparisons are conducted in order\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The achieved results\ndemonstrate that the proposed partitioning scheme significantly surpasses\nprevious approaches in terms of both number of iterations and energy savings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2012 18:22:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Elsayed", ""], ["Awadalla", "Medhat", ""], ["Shalan", "Mohamed", ""], ["Elewi", "Abdullah", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6213", "submitter": "Valentin Puente", "authors": "Javier Merino, Valentin Puente, Jos\\'e \\'Angel Gregorio", "title": "The Necessity for Hardware QoS Support for Server Consolidation and\n  Cloud Computing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AR cs.OS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are ubiquitous in most of today's computing\nfields. Although they provide noticeable benefits in terms of performance, cost\nand power efficiency, they also introduce some new issues. In this paper we\nanalyze how the interference from Virtual Private Servers running in other\ncores is a significant component of performance unpredictability and can\nthreaten the attainment of cloud computing. Even if virtualization is used, the\nsharing of the on-chip section of the memory hierarchy by different cores makes\nperformance isolation strongly dependent on what is running elsewhere in the\nsystem. We will show in three actual computing systems, based on Sun UltraSparc\nT1, Sun UltraSparc T2 and Intel Xeon processors, how state-of-the-art\nvirtualization techniques are unable to guarantee performance isolation in a\nrepresentative workload such as SPECweb2005. In an especially conceived near\nworst-case scenario, it is possible to reduce the performance achieved by a\nSolaris Zones consolidated server for this suite of benchmarks in a Sun Fire\nT1000 and a Sun Enterprise T5120 by up to 80%. The performance drop observed by\na Xen consolidated server running in a HP Proliant DL160 G5 is almost 45%. For\nall systems under study, off-chip bandwidth is shown to be the most critical\nresource.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 09:33:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Merino", "Javier", ""], ["Puente", "Valentin", ""], ["Gregorio", "Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel", ""]]}]
