We therefore developed a novel OS\ndebugging method using a lightweight virtual machine. We evaluated this\ndebugging method experimentally and confirmed that it can transfer data about\n5.4 times as fast as the conventional virtual machine monitor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2007 08:09:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Takeuchi", "Tadashi", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4746", "submitter": "EDA Publishing Association", "authors": "M.
