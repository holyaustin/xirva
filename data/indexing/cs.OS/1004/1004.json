This approach seems to be the easiest since, once the partitioning\nof the task set has been done, the problem reduces to well understood\nuniprocessor issues. Meanwhile, there is no optimal and polynomial solution to\npartition tasks on processors. In this paper we analyze partitioning algorithms\nfrom several points of view such that for a given task set and specific\nconstraints (processor number, task set type, etc.) we should be able to\nidentify the best heuristic and the best schedulability test. We also analyze\nthe influence of the heuristics on the performance of the uniprocessor tests\nand the impact of a specific task order on the schedulability. A study on\nperformance difference between Fixed Priority schedulers and EDF in the case of\npartitioning scheduling is also considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2010 14:24:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lupu", "Irina", "", "U.L.B"], ["Courbin", "Pierre", "", "ECE"], ["George", "Laurent", "", "ECE"], ["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", "", "U.L.B"]]}]
