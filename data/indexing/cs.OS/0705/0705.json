In the meantime, it has been almost forgotten, that\nvirtual machines are not so perfect isolating environments as it seems, when\nlooking at the principles. These lessons were already learnt earlier when the\nfirst virtualized systems have been exposed to real life usage.\n  Contemporary virtualization software enables instant creation and destruction\nof virtual machines on a host, live migration from one host to another,\nexecution history manipulation, etc. These features are very useful in\npractice, but also causing headaches among security specialists, especially in\ncurrent hostile network environments.\n  In the present contribution we discuss the principles, potential benefits and\nrisks of virtualization in a deja vu perspective, related to previous\nexperiences with virtualization in the mainframe era.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 May 2007 00:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wlodarz", "Joachim J.", ""]]}]
