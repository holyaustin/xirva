We propose two distinct algorithms. Our first\nalgorithm is an off-line speed determination mechanism which provides an\nidentical speed for each processor. That speed guarantees that all deadlines\nare met if the jobs are scheduled using EDF. The second algorithm is an on-line\nand adaptive speed adjustment mechanism which reduces the energy consumption\nwhile the system is running.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2007 13:42:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:10:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["N\u00e9lis", "Vincent", ""], ["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", ""], ["Navet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Devillers", "Raymond", ""], ["Milojevic", "Dragomir", ""]]}]
