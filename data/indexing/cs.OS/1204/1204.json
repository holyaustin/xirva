In essence, an operating system\nis a collection of software programs whose role is to manage computer resources\nand provide an interface for client applications to interact with the different\ncomputer hardware. Most of the commercial operating systems available today on\nthe market have buggy code and they exhibit security flaws and vulnerabilities.\nIn effect, building a trusted operating system that can mostly resist attacks\nand provide a secure computing environment to protect the important assets of a\ncomputer is the goal of every operating system manufacturer. This paper deeply\ninvestigates the various security features of the two most widespread and\nsuccessful operating systems, Microsoft Windows and Linux. The different\nsecurity features, designs, and components of the two systems are to be covered\nelaborately, pin-pointing the key similarities and differences between them. In\ndue course, a head-to-head comparison is to be drawn for each security aspect,\nexposing the advantage of one system over the other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 11:05:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bassil", "Youssef", ""]]}]
