Various modifications to the EDF and FCFS\npolicies have been proposed in the literature, with a view to improving\nperformance. In this article, we compare the loss ratios of these two policies\nalong with some of the said modifications, as well as their counterparts with\ndeterministic deadlines. The results include some formal inequalities and some\ncounter-examples to establish non-existence of an order. A few relations\ninvolving loss ratios are posed as conjectures, and simulation results in\nsupport of these are reported. These results lead to a complete picture of\ndominance and non-dominance relations between pairs of scheduling policies, in\nterms of loss ratios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jan 2011 10:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Sudipta", ""], ["Jenkins", "Lawrence", ""], ["Sengupta", "Debasis", ""]]}]
