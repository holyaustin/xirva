As processor is the important\nresource, CPU scheduling becomes very important in accomplishing the operating\nsystem (OS) design goals. The intention should be allowed as many as possible\nrunning processes at all time in order to make best use of CPU. This paper\npresents a state diagram that depicts the comparative study of various\nscheduling algorithms for a single CPU and shows which algorithm is best for\nthe particular situation. Using this representation, it becomes much easier to\nunderstand what is going on inside the system and why a different set of\nprocesses is a candidate for the allocation of the CPU at different time. The\nobjective of the study is to analyze the high efficient CPU scheduler on design\nof the high quality scheduling algorithms which suits the scheduling goals.

CPU scheduling becomes very\nimportant in accomplishing the operating system (OS) design goals. The\nintention should be allowed as many as possible running processes at all time\nin order to make best use of CPU. CPU scheduling has strong effect on resource\nutilization as well as overall performance of the system. Round Robin algorithm\nperforms optimally in time-shared systems, but it is not suitable for soft real\ntime systems, because it gives more number of context switches, larger waiting\ntime and larger response time. In this paper, a new CPU scheduling algorithm\ncalled An Optimum Multilevel Dynamic Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm is\nproposed, which calculates intelligent time slice and changes after every round\nof execution. The suggested algorithm was evaluated on some CPU scheduling\nobjectives and it was observed that this algorithm gave good performance as\ncompared to the other existing CPU scheduling algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2013 05:25:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Goel", "Neetu", ""], ["Garg", "R.
