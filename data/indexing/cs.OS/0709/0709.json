We present an algorithm which elegantly and\npractically solves this problem on small processors that are often found in\nembedded systems. The algorithm does not require special CPU instructions (such\nas atomic CAS), and therefore is more robust than many existing methods that\nsuffer the ABA problem associated with swing pointers. The algorithm gives\n\"first-in, almost first-out\" guarantees under pathological interrupt\nconditions, which manifests as arbitrary \"shoving\" among nearly-simultaneous\narrivals at the end of the queue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Jeremy", ""]]}]
