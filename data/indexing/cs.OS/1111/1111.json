Software\nsystems provide a unique opportunity to understand biological processes using\nconcepts from network theory. The Debian GNU/Linux operating system allows us\nto explore the evolution of a complex network in a novel way. The modular\ndesign detected during its growth is based on the reuse of existing code in\norder to minimize costs during programming. The increase of modularity\nexperienced by the system over time has not counterbalanced the increase in\nincompatibilities between software packages within modules. This negative\neffect is far from being a failure of design. A random process of package\ninstallation shows that the higher the modularity the larger the fraction of\npackages working properly in a local computer. The decrease in the relative\nnumber of conflicts between packages from different modules avoids a failure in\nthe functionality of one package spreading throughout the entire system. Some\npotential analogies with the evolutionary and ecological processes determining\nthe structure of ecological networks of interacting species are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2011 17:00:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fortuna", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Bonachela", "Juan A.", ""], ["Levin", "Simon A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5348", "submitter": "Seifedine Kadry Seifedine Kadry", "authors": "Abbas Noon, Ali Kalakech, Seifedine Kadry", "title": "A New Round Robin Based Scheduling Algorithm for Operating Systems:\n  Dynamic Quantum Using the Mean Average", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8,\n  Issue 3, No. 1, 2011, 224-229", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Round Robin, considered as the most widely adopted CPU scheduling algorithm,\nundergoes severe problems directly related to quantum size.
