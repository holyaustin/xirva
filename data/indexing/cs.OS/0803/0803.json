SAFIUS provides strong security guarantees like\nconfidentiality, integrity, prevention from rollback attacks, and\naccountability. SAFIUS also enables read/write sharing of data and provides the\nstandard UNIX-like interface for applications. To achieve accountability with\ngood performance, it uses asynchronous signatures; to reduce the space required\nfor storing these signatures, a novel signature pruning mechanism is used.\nSAFIUS has been implemented on a GNU/Linux based system modifying OpenGFS.\nPreliminary performance studies show that SAFIUS has a tolerable overhead for\nproviding secure storage: while it has an overhead of about 50% of OpenGFS in\ndata intensive workloads (due to the overhead of performing\nencryption/decryption in software), it is comparable (or better in some cases)\nto OpenGFS in metadata intensive workloads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Mar 2008 18:24:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sriram", "V", ""], ["Narayan", "Ganesh", ""], ["Gopinath", "K", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3230", "submitter": "Avik Chaudhuri", "authors": "Avik Chaudhuri, Prasad Naldurg, and Sriram Rajamani", "title": "A Type System for Data-Flow Integrity on Windows Vista", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.OS cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Windows Vista operating system implements an interesting model of\nmulti-level integrity.

However, such algorithms run on planar graphs only. To efficiently\nconstruct a planar graph, they require a unit-disk graph. To make the topology\nunit-disk, the maximum link length in the network has to be selected\nconservatively. In practical setting this leads to the designs where the node\ndensity is rather high. Moreover, the network diameter of a planar subgraph is\ngreater than the original graph, which leads to longer routes.
