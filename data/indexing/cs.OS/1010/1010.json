This has allowed us to formulate\ndeadlock prevention in terms of prohibiting the occurrence of directed cycles\neven in the most general of wait models (the so-called AND-OR model, in which\nprohibiting wait-for directed cycles is generally overly restrictive). For a\nparticular case in which the priority digraphs are somewhat simplified, we\nintroduce a Las Vegas probabilistic mechanism for resource granting and analyze\nits key aspects in detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Oct 2010 10:12:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Fabiano de S.", ""], ["Barbosa", "Valmir C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5571", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Matthieu Lemerre (CEA LIST), Vincent David (CEA LIST), Christophe\n  Aussagu\\`es (CEA LIST), Guy Vidal-Naquet (SUPELEC)", "title": "An Introduction to Time-Constrained Automata", "comments": "In Proceedings ICE 2010, arXiv:1010.5308", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 38, 2010, pp. 83-98", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.38.9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.OS cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present time-constrained automata (TCA), a model for hard real-time\ncomputation in which agents behaviors are modeled by automata and constrained\nby time intervals.\n  TCA actions can have multiple start time and deadlines, can be aperiodic, and\nare selected dynamically following a graph, the time-constrained automaton.\nThis allows expressing much more precise time constraints than classical\nperiodic or sporadic model, while preserving the ease of scheduling and\nanalysis.\n  We provide some properties of this model as well as their scheduling\nsemantics. We show that TCA can be automatically derived from source-code, and\noptimally scheduled on single processors using a variant of EDF. We explain how\ntime constraints can be used to guarantee communication determinism by\nconstruction, and to study when possible agent interactions happen.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Oct 2010 05:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Lemerre", "Matthieu", "", "CEA LIST"], ["David", "Vincent", "", "CEA LIST"], ["Aussagu\u00e8s", "Christophe", "", "CEA LIST"], ["Vidal-Naquet", "Guy", "", "SUPELEC"]]}]
