At the same time, such devices often\nenjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and\ndesktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and\nimplementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile\napplications to benefit from the cloud. The system is a flexible application\npartitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodified mobile applications\nrunning in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of\ntheir execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a\ncomputational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and\ndynamic profiling to optimally and automatically partition an application so\nthat it migrates, executes in the cloud, and re-integrates computation in a\nfine-grained manner that makes efficient use of resources. Our evaluation shows\nthat CloneCloud can achieve up to 21.2x speedup of smartphone applications we\ntested and it allows different partitioning for different inputs and networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Sep 2010 04:43:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:40:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chun", "Byung-Gon", ""], ["Ihm", "Sunghwan", ""], ["Maniatis", "Petros", ""], ["Naik", "Mayur", ""]]}]
