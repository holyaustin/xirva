We survey current countermeasures to such failures,\nargue that they are not satisfactory, and sketch alternative solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 09:14:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Di Cosmo", "Roberto", "", "PPS"], ["Zacchiroli", "Stefano", "", "PPS"], ["Trezentos", "Paulo", ""]]}]
