Different algorithms are available for CPU scheduling amongst them RR\n(Round Robin) is considered as optimal in time shared environment. The\neffectiveness of Round Robin completely depends on the choice of time quantum.\nIn this paper a new CPU scheduling algorithm has been proposed, named as DABRR\n(Dynamic Average Burst Round Robin). That uses dynamic time quantum instead of\nstatic time quantum used in RR. The performance of the proposed algorithm is\nexperimentally compared with traditional RR and some existing variants of RR.\nThe results of our approach presented in this paper demonstrate improved\nperformance in terms of average waiting time, average turnaround time, and\ncontext switching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 May 2016 06:24:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dash", "Amar Ranjan", ""], ["Sahu", "Sandipta kumar", ""], ["Samantra", "Sanjay Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01168", "submitter": "Junaid Shuja", "authors": "Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Sajjad A.

Virtualization was previously not deemed\nas feasible technology for mobile and embedded devices due to their limited\nprocessing and memory resource. However, the enterprises are advocating Bring\nYour Own Device (BYOD) applications that enable co-existence of heterogeneous\nOSs on a single mobile device. Moreover, embedded device require virtualization\nfor logical isolation of secure and general purpose OSs on a single device. In\nthis paper, we investigate the processor architectures in the mobile and\nembedded space while examining their formal visualizability. We also compare\nthe virtualization solutions enabling coexistence of multiple OSs in Multicore\nProcessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) mobile and embedded systems.
