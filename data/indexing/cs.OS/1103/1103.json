It has been shown that\nthis problem can be solved by adding an ultra low-power processor to execute\nsimple, frequent sensor data processing. While very effective in saving energy,\nthis resulting heterogeneous, distributed architecture poses a significant\nchallenge to application development.\n  We present Reflex, a suite of runtime and compilation techniques to conceal\nthe heterogeneous, distributed nature from developers. The Reflex automatically\ntransforms the developer's code for distributed execution with the help of the\nReflex runtime. To create a unified system illusion, Reflex features a novel\nsoftware distributed shared memory (DSM) design that leverages the extreme\narchitectural asymmetry between the low-power processor and the powerful\ncentral processor to achieve both energy efficiency and performance.\n  We report a complete realization of Reflex for heterogeneous smartphones with\nMaemo/Linux as the central kernel. Using a tri-processor hardware prototype and\nsensing applications reported in recent literature, we evaluate the Reflex\nrealization for programming transparency, energy efficiency, and performance.\nWe show that Reflex supports a programming style that is very close to\ncontemporary smartphone programming. It allows existing sensing applications to\nbe ported with minor source code changes. Reflex reduces the system power in\nsensing by up to 83%, and its runtime system only consumes 10% local memory on\na typical ultra-low power processor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2011 19:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Felix Xiaozhu", ""], ["Wang", "Zhen", ""], ["LiKamWa", "Robert", ""], ["Zhong", "Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3831", "submitter": "Himansu Sekhar Behera", "authors": "H.

It\nhelps in choosing the processes for execution. Round Robin (RR) is one of the\nmost widely used CPU scheduling algorithm. But, its performance degrades with\nrespect to context switching, which is an overhead and it occurs during each\nscheduling. Overall performance of the system depends on choice of an optimal\ntime quantum, so that context switching can be reduced. In this paper, we have\nproposed a new variant of RR scheduling algorithm, known as Dynamic Quantum\nwith Readjusted Round Robin (DQRRR) algorithm. We have experimentally shown\nthat performance of DQRRR is better than RR by reducing number of context\nswitching, average waiting time and average turn around time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Mar 2011 06:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Behera", "H.

The original time slice has been calculated for\neach process based on its burst time.This is mostly suited for soft real time\nsystems where meeting of deadlines is desirable to increase its performance.\nThe advantage is that processes that are closer to their remaining completion\ntime will get more chances to execute and leave the ready queue. This will\nreduce the number of processes in the ready queue by knocking out short jobs\nrelatively faster in a hope to reduce the average waiting time, turn around\ntime and number of context switches.
