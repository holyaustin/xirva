Most of the time, deterministic execution lengths for tasks\nwere considered, but this model fits less and less with the reality, especially\nwith the increasing number of multimedia applications. It's why a lot of\nresearch is starting to consider stochastic models, where execution times are\nonly known stochastically. However, authors consider that they have a pretty\nmuch precise knowledge about the properties of the system, especially regarding\nto the worst case execution time (or worst case execution cycles, WCEC).\n  In this work, we try to relax this hypothesis, and assume that the WCEC can\nvary. We propose miscellaneous methods to react to such a situation, and give\nmany simulation results attesting that with a small effort, we can provide very\ngood results, allowing to keep a low deadline miss rate as well as an energy\nconsumption similar to clairvoyant algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Sep 2008 04:38:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Berten", "Vandy", ""], ["Chang", "Chi-Ju", ""], ["Kuo", "Tei-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.4082", "submitter": "Vandy Berten", "authors": "Vandy Berten and Jo\\\"el Goossens", "title": "Multiprocessor Global Scheduling on Frame-Based DVFS Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this ongoing work, we are interested in multiprocessor energy efficient\nsystems, where task durations are not known in advance, but are know\nstochastically.
