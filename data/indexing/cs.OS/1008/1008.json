For a chip multi-processor(CMP)\nthat has a small number of physical cores and a small set of performance\nstates, deciding the Turbo Boost frequency to use on a given core might not be\ndifficult. However, we do not know the complexity of this decision making\nprocess in the context of a large number of cores, scaling to the 100s, as\npredicted by researchers in the field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Aug 2010 19:23:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["S", "Ananth Narayan", ""], ["Sharangi", "Somsubhra", ""], ["Fedorova", "Alexandra", ""]]}]
