We first show two very general properties which are\nwell-known for uniprocessor platforms and which remain for multiprocessor\nplatforms: (i) under few and not so restrictive assumptions, we show that\nfeasible schedules of periodic task systems are periodic from some point with a\nperiod equal to the least common multiple of task periods and (ii) for the\nspecific case of synchronous periodic task systems, we show that feasible\nschedules repeat from the origin. We then present our main result: we\ncharacterize, for task-level fixed-priority schedulers and for asynchronous\nconstrained or arbitrary deadline periodic task models, upper bounds of the\nfirst time instant where the schedule repeats. We show that job-level\nfixed-priority schedulers are predictable upon unrelated multiprocessor\nplatforms. For task-level fixed-priority schedulers, based on the upper bounds\nand the predictability property, we provide for asynchronous constrained or\narbitrary deadline periodic task sets, exact feasibility tests. Finally, for\nthe job-level fixed-priority EDF scheduler, for which such an upper bound\nremains unknown, we provide an exact feasibility test as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2008 14:30:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cucu", "Liliana", ""], ["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", ""]]}]
