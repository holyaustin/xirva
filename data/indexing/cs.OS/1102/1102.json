At run-time, such systems can, at any time, be requested to\nswitch from its current operating mode to another mode (called \"new mode\") by\nreplacing the current set of tasks with that of the new-mode. Thereby, ensuring\nthat all the timing requirements are met not only requires that a\nschedulability test is performed on the tasks of each mode but also that (i) a\nprotocol for transitioning from one mode to another is specified and (ii) a\nschedulability test for each transition is performed. We propose two distinct\nprotocols that manage the mode transitions upon uniform and identical\nmultiprocessor platforms at run-time, each specific to distinct task\nrequirements. For each protocol, we formally establish schedulability analyses\nthat indicate beforehand whether all the timing requirements will be met during\nany mode transition of the system. This is performed assuming both\nFixed-Task-Priority and Fixed-Job-Priority schedulers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 12:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nelis", "Vincent", ""], ["Yomsi", "Patrick Meumeu", ""], ["Andersson", "Bj\u00f6rn", ""], ["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", ""]]}]
