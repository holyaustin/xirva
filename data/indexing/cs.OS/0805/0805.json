We first show three\nphenomena: (i) choosing, for each task, the initial k-sequence 1^k is not\noptimal, (ii) we can even start the scheduling from a (fictive) error state (in\nregard to the initial k-sequence) and (iii) the period of feasible\nDBP-schedules is not necessarily the task hyper-period. We then show that any\nfeasible DBP-schedule is periodic and we upper-bound the length of that period.\nLastly, based on our periodicity result we provide an exact schedulability\ntest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 09:32:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Sep 2008 09:22:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3237", "submitter": "Sebastien Collette", "authors": "S.

We propose a scheduling\nalgorithm theoretically optimal (i.e., preemptions and migrations neglected).\nMoreover, we provide an exact feasibility utilization bound.

Users operate on\ntheir local, persistent replica of shared documents; they can work disconnected\nand suffer no network latency. The Telex approach to detect and correct\nconflicts is application independent, based on an action-constraint graph (ACG)\nthat summarises the concurrency semantics of applications. The ACG is stored\nefficiently in a multilog structure that eliminates contention and is optimised\nfor locality. Telex supports multiple applications and multi-document updates.\nThe Telex system clearly separates system logic (which includes replication,\nviews, undo, security, consistency, conflicts, and commitment) from application\nlogic. An example application is a shared calendar for managing multi-user\nmeetings; the system detects meeting conflicts and resolves them consistently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2008 07:01:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 08:40:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 07:13:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Benmouffok", "Lamia", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt, LIP6"], ["Busca", "Jean-Michel", "", "INRIA\n  Rocquencourt, LIP6"], ["Marqu\u00e8s", "Joan Manuel", "", "LIP6, UOC"], ["Shapiro", "Marc", "", "INRIA\n  Rocquencourt, LIP6"], ["Sutra", "Pierre", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt, LIP6"], ["Tsoukalas", "Georgios", "", "NTUA"]]}]
