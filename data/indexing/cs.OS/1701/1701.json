Furthermore, both properties are directly related to the safety\nrequirements of many embedded systems. With regard to availability\nrequirements, power considerations are of uttermost importance for battery\noperated systems. Validation of timing and power requires observability of\nthese properties. In many cases this is difficult, because the observability is\neither not possible or requires big extra effort in the system validation\nprocess. In this paper, we present a measurement-based approach for the joint\ntiming and power analysis of Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) applications running on\na shared memory multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoC) architecture. As a\nproof-of-concept, we implement an MPSoC system with configurable power and\ntiming measurement interfaces inside a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).\nOur experiments demonstrate the viability of our approach being able of\naccurately analyzing different mappings of image processing applications (Sobel\nfilter and JPEG encoder) on an FPGA-based MPSoC implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 16:15:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Schlaak", "Christof", ""], ["Fakih", "Maher", ""], ["Stemmer", "Ralf", ""]]}]
