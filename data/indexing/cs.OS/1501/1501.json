The flexibility is\nachieved when computing platform designed with heterogeneous resources to\nsupport multifarious tasks of an application where as task scheduling brings\nparallel processing. The efficient task scheduling is critical to obtain\noptimized performance in heterogeneous computing Systems (HCS). In this paper,\nwe brought a review of various application scheduling models which provide\nparallelism for homogeneous and heterogeneous computing systems. In this paper,\nwe made a review of various scheduling methodologies targeted to high speed\ncomputing systems and also prepared summary chart. The comparative study of\nscheduling methodologies for high speed computing systems has been carried out\nbased on the attributes of platform & application as well. The attributes are\nexecution time, nature of task, task handling capability, type of host &\ncomputing platform. Finally a summary chart has been prepared and it\ndemonstrates that the need of developing scheduling methodologies for\nHeterogeneous Reconfigurable Computing Systems (HRCS) which is an emerging high\nspeed computing platform for real time applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 05:51:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Vucha", "Mahendra", ""], ["Rajawat", "Arvind", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.07084", "submitter": "Jian-Jia Chen", "authors": "Jian-Jia Chen and Wen-Hung Huang and Cong Liu", "title": "k2U: A General Framework from k-Point Effective Schedulability Analysis\n  to Utilization-Based Tests", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To deal with a large variety of workloads in different application domains in\nreal-time embedded systems, a number of expressive task models have been\ndeveloped. For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop\ndifferent types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different\ncomputation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general\nschedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be\npotentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any\nfixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor\nscheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which\ncan be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding\nk-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient\nutilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of\nk2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved\ntests compared to the state-of-the-art.\n  Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different\nformulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k2Q, which\nprovides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different\nformulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms,\nk2Q and k2U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be\nmeasured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only\nfor uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling. These\nframeworks can be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface for schedulability tests and\nresponse-time analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 12:38:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 May 2015 19:46:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 21:25:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jian-Jia", ""], ["Huang", "Wen-Hung", ""], ["Liu", "Cong", ""]]}]
