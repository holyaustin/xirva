An important property for the schedulability analysis, the\npredictability (regardless to the execution times), is studied for\nheterogeneous multiprocessor platforms. Our main contribution is to show that\nany FJP schedulers are predictable on unrelated platforms. A convenient\nconsequence is the fact that any FJP schedulers are predictable on uniform\nmultiprocessors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2009 12:46:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cucu-Grosjean", "Liliana", ""], ["Goossens", "Jo\u00ebl", ""]]}]
