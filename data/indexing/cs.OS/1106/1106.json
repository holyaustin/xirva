This paper proposes a novel approach that combines the constant\nbandwidth server abstraction with a work-stealing load balancing scheme which,\nwhile ensuring isolation among tasks, enables a task to be executed on more\nthan one processor at a given time instant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 17:26:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Nogueira", "Lu\u00eds", ""], ["Pinho", "Lu\u00eds Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2992", "submitter": "Michiel W. van Tol", "authors": "Michiel W. van Tol", "title": "A Characterization of the SPARC T3-4 System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.DC cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This technical report covers a set of experiments on the 64-core SPARC T3-4\nsystem, comparing it to two similar AMD and Intel systems.

Scalability tests\nwith a fine grained multithreaded runtime are performed, showing problems with\natomic CAS operations on such physically highly parallel systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["van Tol", "Michiel W.", ""]]}]
