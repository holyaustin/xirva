In addition to providing a collision-free\ncommunication service, such algorithms enable the transformation of programs\nwritten in abstract models considered in distributed computing literature into\na model consistent with sensor networks, i.e., write all with collision (WAC)\nmodel. Existing TDMA slot assignment algorithms have one or more of the\nfollowing properties: (i) compute slots using a randomized algorithm, (ii)\nassume that the topology is known upfront, and/or (iii) assign slots\nsequentially. If these algorithms are used to transform abstract programs into\nprograms in WAC model then the transformed programs are probabilistically\ncorrect, do not allow the addition of new nodes, and/or converge in a\nsequential fashion. In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing deterministic\nTDMA algorithm where a sensor is aware of only its neighbors. We show that the\nslots are assigned to the sensors in a concurrent fashion and starting from\narbitrary initial states, the algorithm converges to states where\ncollision-free communication among the sensors is restored. Moreover, this\nalgorithm facilitates the transformation of abstract programs into programs in\nWAC model that are deterministically correct.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Aug 2008 20:33:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Arumugam", "Mahesh", ""]]}]
