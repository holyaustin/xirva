In this\ndata-centric systems paradigm, data items can be enabled to retain all or some\nof their previous values. We call this ability \"remembrance\" and posit that it\nempowers significant leaps in the security, availability, and general\noperational dimensions of systems. With the explosion in cheap, fast memories\nand storage, large-scale remembrance will soon become practical. Here, we\nintroduce and explore the advantages of such a paradigm and the challenges in\nmaking it a reality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 18:09:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Hasan", "Ragib", "", "University of Illinois"], ["Sion", "Radu", "", "Stony Brook\n  University"], ["Winslett", "Marianne", "", "University of Illinois"]]}, {"id": "0909.5064", "submitter": "Norbert B\\'atfai", "authors": "Norbert B\\'atfai", "title": "A Conceivable Origin of Machine Consciousness in the IDLE process", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short paper, we would like to call professional community's attention\nto a daring idea that is surely unhelpful, but is exciting for programmers and\nanyway conflicts with the trend of energy consumption in computer systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 10:54:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e1tfai", "Norbert", ""]]}]
