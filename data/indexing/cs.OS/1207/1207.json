Integrating a set of clusters of\nworkstations into one large computing environment can improve the availability\nof computing power. The goal of scheduling is to achieve highest possible\nsystem throughput and to match the application need with the available\ncomputing resources. A secure scheduling model is presented, that performs job\ngrouping activity at runtime. In a Grid environment, security is necessary\nbecause grid is a dynamic environment and participates are independent bodies\nwith different policies, objectives and requirements. Authentication should be\nverified for Grid resource owners as well as resource requesters before they\nare allowed to join in scheduling activities. In order to achieve secure\nresource and job scheduling including minimum processing time and maximum\nresource utilization, A Secure Resource by using RSA algorithm on Networking\nand Job Scheduling model with Job Grouping strategy(JGS) in Grid Computing has\nbeen proposed. The result shows significant improvement in the processing time\nof jobs and resource utilization as compared to dynamic job grouping (DJG)\nbased scheduling on smart grids (SG).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 11:48:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Reddy", "P.
