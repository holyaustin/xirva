The system, called XUFS, allows private distributed name\nspaces to be created for transparent access to personal files across over 9000\ncomputer nodes. XUFS builds on many principles from prior distributed file\nsystems research, but extends key design goals to support the workflow of\ncomputational science researchers. Specifically, XUFS supports file access from\nthe desktop to the wide-area network seamlessly, survives transient\ndisconnected operations robustly, and demonstrates comparable or better\nthroughput than some current high performance file systems on the wide-area\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2010 00:34:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Walker", "Edward", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3727", "submitter": "T.R.

First, we propose an\nimprovement of the optimal algorithm BF. We formally prove that our adaptation\nis (i) optimal, i.e., it always generates a feasible schedule as long as such a\nschedule exists, and (ii) valid, i.e., it complies with the all the\nrequirements. We also show that it outperforms BF by providing a computing\ncomplexity of O(n), where n is the number of tasks to be scheduled. Next, we\npropose a schedulability analysis which indicates a priori whether the\nreal-time application can be scheduled by our improvement of BF without missing\nany deadline. This analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first such\ntest for multiprocessors that takes into account all the main overheads\ngenerated by the Operating System.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2010 08:09:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 10:09:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Jan 2011 12:39:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Funk", "Shelby", ""], ["Nelis", "Vincent", ""], ["Goossens", "Joel", ""], ["Milojevic", "Dragomir", ""], ["Nelissen", "Geoffrey", ""]]}]
