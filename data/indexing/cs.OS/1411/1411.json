This results in a large code base with a wide high-level interface\nmaking the driver vulnerable to security attacks. This is particularly\nproblematic for increasingly popular accelerators like GPUs that have large,\ncomplex drivers. We solve this problem with library drivers, a new driver\narchitecture. A library driver implements resource management as an untrusted\nlibrary in the application process address space, and implements isolation as a\nkernel module that is smaller and has a narrower lower-level interface (i.e.,\ncloser to hardware) than a legacy driver. We articulate a set of device and\nplatform hardware properties that are required to retrofit a legacy driver into\na library driver. To demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of library\ndrivers, we present Glider, a library driver implementation for two GPUs of\npopular brands, Radeon and Intel. Glider reduces the TCB size and attack\nsurface by about 35% and 84% respectively for a Radeon HD 6450 GPU and by about\n38% and 90% respectively for an Intel Ivy Bridge GPU. Moreover, it incurs no\nperformance cost. Indeed, Glider outperforms a legacy driver for applications\nrequiring intensive interactions with the device driver, such as applications\nusing the OpenGL immediate mode API.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 02:30:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sani", "Ardalan Amiri", ""], ["Zhong", "Lin", ""], ["Wallach", "Dan S.", ""]]}]
