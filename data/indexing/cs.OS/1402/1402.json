Efficient virtual memory can overcome this\nproblem. And the efficiency of virtual memory depends on the replacement policy\nused for cache. In this paper, our algorithm not only based on the time to last\naccess and frequency index but, we also consider the power consumption. We show\nthat Low Power Consumption Weighting Replacement Policy (LWRP) has better\nperformance and low power consumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 06:26:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bhalgama", "S.
