Many previous studies have taken\nadvantage of demotions on low-power states for energy saving. However, most of\nthe demotion schemes are statically performed on a limited number of\npre-selected low-power states, and are suboptimal for different workloads and\nmemory architectures. Even worse, the idle periods are often too short for\neffective power state transitions, especially for memory intensive\napplications. Wrong decisions on power state transition incur significant\nenergy and delay penalties. In this paper, we propose a novel memory system\ndesign named RAMZzz with rank-aware energy saving optimizations including\ndynamic page migrations and adaptive demotions. Specifically, we group the\npages with similar access locality into the same rank with dynamic page\nmigrations. Ranks have their hotness: hot ranks are kept busy for high\nutilization and cold ranks can have more lengthy idle periods for power state\ntransitions. We further develop adaptive state demotions by considering all\nlow-power states for each rank and a prediction model to estimate the\npower-down timeout among states. We experimentally compare our algorithm with\nother energy saving policies with cycle-accurate simulation. Experiments with\nbenchmark workloads show that RAMZzz achieves significant improvement on\nenergy-delay2 and energy consumption over other energy saving techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 09:30:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Yanchao", ""], ["Wu", "Donghong", ""], ["He", "Bingsheng", ""], ["Tang", "Xueyan", ""], ["Xu", "Jianliang", ""], ["Guo", "Minyi", ""]]}]
