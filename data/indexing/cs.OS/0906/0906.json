We propose an online slack reclamation scheme which profits from the\ndiscrepancy between the worst- and actual-case execution time of the tasks by\nslowing down the speed of the processors in order to save energy. Our algorithm\ncalled MORA takes into account the application-specific consumption profile of\nthe tasks. We demonstrate that MORA does not jeopardize the system\nschedulability and we show by performing simulations that it can save up to 32%\nof energy (in average) compared to execution without using any energy-aware\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2009 12:10:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nelis", "Vincent", ""], ["Goossens", "Joel", ""]]}]
