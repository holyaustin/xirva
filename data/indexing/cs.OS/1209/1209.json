We\nargue that such vulnerabilities are largely related to the interplay among\nlayers composing the Android stack. Thus, we also argue that such interplay has\nbeen underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of\nthe Android interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper\nwe provide a simple model of the Android cross-layer interactions based on the\nconcept of flow, as a basis for analyzing the Android interplay. In particular,\nour model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with\nthe cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered\nvulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices\ntotally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical\nassessment of some flows within the Android cross-layered architecture. Our\nexperiments indicate that little control is exercised by the Android Security\nFramework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we\nobserved that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and\nsensitive security issues arise between the Android stack and the Linux kernel,\nthereby indicating that the attack surface of the Android platform is wider\nthan expected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 16:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Armando", "Alessandro", ""], ["Merlo", "Alessio", ""], ["Verderame", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4600", "submitter": "Kamlesh Sharma", "authors": "Kamlesh Sharma, T.V.Prasad", "title": "Classification Of Heterogeneous Operating System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Operating system is a bridge between system and user. An operating system\n(OS) is a software program that manages the hardware and software resources of\na computer. The OS performs basic tasks, such as controlling and allocating\nmemory, prioritizing the processing of instructions, controlling input and\noutput devices, facilitating networking, and managing files. It is difficult to\npresent a complete as well as deep account of operating systems developed till\ndate. So, this paper tries to overview only a subset of the available operating\nsystems and its different categories. OS are being developed by a large number\nof academic and commercial organizations for the last several decades. This\npaper, therefore, concentrates on the different categories of OS with special\nemphasis to those that had deep impact on the evolution process.
