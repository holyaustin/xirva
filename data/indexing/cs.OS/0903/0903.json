These applications have different composition,\nconfiguration, and deployment requirements. Quantifying the performance of\nscheduling and allocation policy on a Cloud infrastructure (hardware, software,\nservices) for different application and service models under varying load,\nenergy performance (power consumption, heat dissipation), and system size is an\nextremely challenging problem to tackle. To simplify this process, in this\npaper we propose CloudSim: a new generalized and extensible simulation\nframework that enables seamless modelling, simulation, and experimentation of\nemerging Cloud computing infrastructures and management services. The\nsimulation framework has the following novel features: (i) support for\nmodelling and instantiation of large scale Cloud computing infrastructure,\nincluding data centers on a single physical computing node and java virtual\nmachine; (ii) a self-contained platform for modelling data centers, service\nbrokers, scheduling, and allocations policies; (iii) availability of\nvirtualization engine, which aids in creation and management of multiple,\nindependent, and co-hosted virtualized services on a data center node; and (iv)\nflexibility to switch between space-shared and time-shared allocation of\nprocessing cores to virtualized services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2009 04:28:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Calheiros", "Rodrigo N.", ""], ["Ranjan", "Rajiv", ""], ["De Rose", "Cesar A.
