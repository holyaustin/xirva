Over the last decade,\nlarge-scale knowledge bases, also known as knowledge graphs, have been\nautomatically constructed from web contents and text sources, and have become a\nkey asset for search engines. This machine knowledge can be harnessed to\nsemantically interpret textual phrases in news, social media and web tables,\nand contributes to question answering, natural language processing and data\nanalytics. This article surveys fundamental concepts and practical methods for\ncreating and curating large knowledge bases. It covers models and methods for\ndiscovering and canonicalizing entities and their semantic types and organizing\nthem into clean taxonomies. On top of this, the article discusses the automatic\nextraction of entity-centric properties. To support the long-term life-cycle\nand the quality assurance of machine knowledge, the article presents methods\nfor constructing open schemas and for knowledge curation. Case studies on\nacademic projects and industrial knowledge graphs complement the survey of\nconcepts and methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2020 09:28:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2021 23:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Weikum", "Gerhard", ""], ["Dong", "Luna", ""], ["Razniewski", "Simon", ""], ["Suchanek", "Fabian", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14116", "submitter": "Pawan Kumar", "authors": "Pawan Kumar and Srikanta Bedathur", "title": "A Survey on Semantic Parsing from the perspective of Compositionality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Different from previous surveys in semantic parsing (Kamath and Das, 2018)\nand knowledge base question answering(KBQA)(Chakraborty et al., 2019; Zhu et\nal., 2019; Hoffner et al., 2017) we try to takes a different perspective on the\nstudy of semantic parsing. Specifically, we will focus on (a)meaning\ncomposition from syntactical structure(Partee, 1975), and (b) the ability of\nsemantic parsers to handle lexical variation given the context of a knowledge\nbase (KB). In the following section after an introduction of the field of\nsemantic parsing and its uses in KBQA, we will describe meaning representation\nusing grammar formalism CCG (Steedman, 1996). We will discuss semantic\ncomposition using formal languages in Section 2. In section 3 we will consider\nsystems that uses formal languages e.g. $\\lambda$-calculus (Steedman, 1996),\n$\\lambda$-DCS (Liang, 2013). Section 4 and 5 consider semantic parser using\nstructured-language for logical form. Section 6 is on different benchmark\ndatasets ComplexQuestions (Bao et al.,2016) and GraphQuestions (Su et al.,\n2016) that can be used to evaluate semantic parser on their ability to answer\ncomplex questions that are highly compositional in nature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:03:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Pawan", ""], ["Bedathur", "Srikanta", ""]]}]
