Within academia, and in computer science in particular,\nrankings not only capture our attention but also widely influence people who\nhave a limited understanding of computing science research, including\nprospective students, university administrators, and policy-makers. In short,\nrankings matter. This position paper advocates for the adoption of \"GOTO\nrankings\": rankings that use Good data, are Open, Transparent, and Objective,\nand the rejection of rankings that do not meet these criteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2018 21:23:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2019 22:23:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Berger", "Emery", ""], ["Blackburn", "Stephen M.", ""], ["Brodley", "Carla", ""], ["Jagadish", "H.
