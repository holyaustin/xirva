As designers of software technology, we\ncause change and are responsible for the effects of our design choices. We\nrecognize that there is a rapidly increasing awareness of the fundamental need\nand desire for a more sustainable world, and there is a lot of genuine\ngoodwill. However, this alone will be ineffective unless we come to understand\nand address our persistent misperceptions. The Karlskrona Manifesto for\nSustainability Design aims to initiate a much needed conversation in and beyond\nthe software community by highlighting such perceptions and proposing a set of\nfundamental principles for sustainability design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 22:43:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 16:57:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2015 00:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 10 May 2015 16:23:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Becker", "Christoph", ""], ["Chitchyan", "Ruzanna", ""], ["Duboc", "Leticia", ""], ["Easterbrook", "Steve", ""], ["Mahaux", "Martin", ""], ["Penzenstadler", "Birgit", ""], ["Rodriguez-Navas", "Guillermo", ""], ["Salinesi", "Camille", ""], ["Seyff", "Norbert", ""], ["Venters", "Colin", ""], ["Calero", "Coral", ""], ["Kocak", "Sedef Akinli", ""], ["Betz", "Stefanie", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8027", "submitter": "Mateusz Malinowski", "authors": "Mateusz Malinowski and Mario Fritz", "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "comments": "Published in the NIPS 2014 Workshop on Learning Semantics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.GL cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As language and visual understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are\nobserving an increasing interest in holistic architectures that tightly\ninterlink both modalities in a joint learning and inference process. This trend\nhas allowed the community to progress towards more challenging and open tasks\nand refueled the hope at achieving the old AI dream of building machines that\ncould pass a turing test in open domains. In order to steadily make progress\ntowards this goal, we realize that quantifying performance becomes increasingly\ndifficult. Therefore we ask how we can precisely define such challenges and how\nwe can evaluate different algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we\nsummarize and discuss such challenges as well as try to give answers where\nappropriate options are available in the literature. We exemplify some of the\nsolutions on a recently presented dataset of question-answering task based on\nreal-world indoor images that establishes a visual turing challenge. Finally,\nwe argue despite the success of unique ground-truth annotation, we likely have\nto step away from carefully curated dataset and rather rely on 'social\nconsensus' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks. Providing\ncoverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging challenge\nthat we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 15:38:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:09:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 18:03:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Malinowski", "Mateusz", ""], ["Fritz", "Mario", ""]]}]
