As instructors we want to develop curriculum that\nnot only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, but\nalso to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that\nartificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we provide\npractical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also\nprovide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general\nartificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial\nintelligence ethics course.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:52:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Burton", "Emanuelle", ""], ["Goldsmith", "Judy", ""], ["Koenig", "Sven", ""], ["Kuipers", "Benjamin", ""], ["Mattei", "Nicholas", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}]
