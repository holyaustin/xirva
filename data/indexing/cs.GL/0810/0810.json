Since 1980 the computerization of the\nstock market offers real time processing of financial information. This\ntechnological revolution has offered processes and mathematic methods to\nidentify best return on transactions. Current research relates to autonomous\ntransaction systems programmed in certain periods and some algorithms. This\noffers return opportunities where traders can not intervene. There are about\nthirty algorithms to assist the traders, the best known are the VWAP, the TWAP,\nTVOL. The algorithms offer the latest strategies and decision-making are the\nsubject of much research. These advances in modeling decision-making autonomous\nagent can envisage a rich future for these technologies, the players already in\nuse for more than 30% of their trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2008 08:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 10:38:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lebreton", "Victor", "", "CES"]]}]
