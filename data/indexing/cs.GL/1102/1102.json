To the contrary, the historical\nrecord demonstrates that innovations in CSE come from improvements to the\nmathematics embodied by computer programs. Whether scientists and engineers\nbecome inventors who make these breakthroughs depends on circumstances and the\ninterdisciplinary extent of their educations. The USA currently has the largest\nCSE professorate, but the data suggest this prominence is ephemeral.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Feb 2011 02:31:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2011 20:46:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2011 20:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Grcar", "Joseph F.", ""]]}]
