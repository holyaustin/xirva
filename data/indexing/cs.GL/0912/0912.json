In this area a particular interest has the study of community\nstructures. The analysis of this type of structure requires the formalization\nof the intuitive concept of community and the definition of indices of goodness\nfor the obtained results. A lot of algorithms has been presented to reach this\ngoal. In particular, an interesting problem is the search of overlapped\ncommunities and it is field seems very interesting a solution based on the use\nof genetic algorithms. The approach discusses in this paper is based on a\nparallel implementation of a genetic algorithm and shows the performance\nbenefits of this solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2009 20:54:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2009 11:09:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Carchiolo", "Vincenza", ""], ["Longheu", "Alessandro", ""], ["Malgeri", "Michele", ""], ["Mangioni", "Giuseppe", ""]]}]
