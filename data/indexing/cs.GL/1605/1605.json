The computational advances have come on many\nfronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and\nalgorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal\narray of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics;\ngenome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies;\nstructural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular\nassemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of\npost-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology.\nThe ability to design and write computer programs is among the most\nindispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become\na popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its\nstraightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first\nlanguage; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming,\nas well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and\nthird-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into\nvirtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses,\nphylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic\nintroduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and\nexercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text\nculminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of\nSupplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as\nthat of a 'variable', the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point\nof writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between\ntwo DNA sequences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2016 02:21:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ekmekci", "Berk", ""], ["McAnany", "Charles E.", ""], ["Mura", "Cameron", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05566", "submitter": "Joseph M.

He has been a global leader of the\ndatabase research field, deepening its core and pushing its boundaries. Many of\nNaughton's ideas were translated directly into practice in commercial and\nopen-source systems. But software comes and goes. In the end, it is the ideas\nthemselves that have had impact, ideas written down in papers.\n  Naughton has been a prolific scholar over the last thirty years, with over\n175 publications in his bibliography, covering a wide range of topics. This\ndocument does not attempt to enumerate or even summarize the wealth of ideas\nthat Naughton has published over the course of his academic career--the task is\ntoo daunting. Instead, the best this short note aims to do is to serve as a\nrough map of the territory: something to help other researchers navigate the\nwide spaces of Naughton's work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 05:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hellerstein", "Joseph M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.08639", "submitter": "Craig Alan Feinstein", "authors": "Craig Alan Feinstein", "title": "Dialogue Concerning The Two Chief World Views", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": "Progress in Physics, 2016 (vol. 12), issue 3, pp. 280-283", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In 1632, Galileo Galilei wrote a book called \\textit{Dialogue Concerning the\nTwo Chief World Systems} which compared the new Copernican model of the\nuniverse with the old Ptolemaic model.
