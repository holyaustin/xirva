The method is developed in the context\non a concrete example: that of estimation of the parameter in an exponential\ndistribution. We compare the performance of our method with the bayesian and\nmaximum likelihood approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 19:36:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gzyl", "Henryk", ""], ["ter Horst", "Enrique", ""]]}]
