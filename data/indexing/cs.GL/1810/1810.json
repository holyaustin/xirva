In this paper, after introducing pathways\nto AI personhood, we analyze consequences of such AI empowerment on human\ndignity, human safety and AI rights. We emphasize possibility of creating\nselfish memes and legal system hacking in the context of artificial entities.\nFinally, we consider some potential solutions for addressing described\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 20:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yampolskiy", "Roman V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10881", "submitter": "Alexey Medvedev N.", "authors": "Alexey N.

Understanding how people behave in online\nforums may shed light on the fundamental mechanisms by which collective\nthinking emerges in a group of individuals, but it has also important practical\napplications, for instance to improve user experience, increase engagement or\nautomatically identify bullying. Importantly, the datasets generated by the\nactivity of the users are often openly available for researchers, in contrast\nto other sources of data in computational social science. In this survey, we\nmap the main research directions that arose in recent years and focus primarily\non the most popular platform, Reddit. We distinguish and categorise research\ndepending on their focus on the posts or on the users, and point to different\ntypes of methodologies to extract information from the structure and dynamics\nof the system. We emphasize the diversity and richness of the research in terms\nof questions and methods, and suggest future avenues of research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2018 13:57:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2020 07:44:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Medvedev", "Alexey N.", ""], ["Lambiotte", "Renaud", ""], ["Delvenne", "Jean-Charles", ""]]}]
