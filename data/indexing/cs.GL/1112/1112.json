PROs provide an alternative window into treatment\neffectiveness based on client perception and facilitate detection of\nproblems/symptoms for which there is no discernible measure (e.g. pain). The\nprincipal focus of the study was to evaluate the utility of the CDOI for\npredictive modeling of outcomes in a live clinical setting. Implementation\nfactors were also addressed within the framework of the Theory of Planned\nBehavior by linking adoption rates to implementation practices and clinician\nperceptions. The results showed that the CDOI does contain significant capacity\nto predict outcome delta over time based on baseline and early change scores in\na large, real-world clinical setting, as suggested in previous research. The\nimplementation analysis revealed a number of critical factors affecting\nsuccessful implementation and adoption of the CDOI outcome measure, though\nthere was a notable disconnect between clinician intentions and actual\nbehavior. Most importantly, the predictive capacity of the CDOI underscores the\nutility of direct client feedback measures such as PROs and their potential use\nas the basis for next generation clinical decision support tools and\npersonalized treatment approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 19:44:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bennett", "Casey", ""], ["Doub", "Thomas", ""], ["Bragg", "April", ""], ["Luellen", "Jason", ""], ["Van Regenmorter", "Christina", ""], ["Lockman", "Jennifer", ""], ["Reiserer", "Randall", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.4082", "submitter": "Erika Rogers", "authors": "Theodore P.
