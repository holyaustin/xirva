We describe how some very minor changes\nin the rules of the Hanoi Tower yield various increases of complexity in the\nsolution, so that they require a deeper analysis than the classical Hanoi Tower\nproblem while still yielding exponential solutions. In particular, we analyze\nthe problem fo the Bouncing Tower, where just changing the insertion and\nextraction position from the top to the middle of the tower results in a\nsurprising increase of complexity in the solution: such a tower of $n$ disks\ncan be optimally moved in $\\sqrt{3}^n$ moves for $n$ even (i.e. less than a\nHanoi Tower of same height), via $5$ recursive functions (or, equivalently, one\nrecursion function with $5$ states).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 00:19:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 19:54:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Barbay", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07646", "submitter": "Gary Prok", "authors": "Gary R.
