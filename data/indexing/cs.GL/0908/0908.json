The proponents of the Web of Data envision much of\nthe world's data being interrelated and openly accessible to the general\npublic. This vision is analogous in many ways to the Web of Documents of common\nknowledge, but instead of making documents and media openly accessible, the\nfocus is on making data openly accessible. In providing data for public use,\nthere has been a stimulated interest in a movement dubbed Open Data. Open Data\nis analogous in many ways to the Open Source movement. However, instead of\nfocusing on software, Open Data is focused on the legal and licensing issues\naround publicly exposed data. Together, various technological and legal tools\nare laying the groundwork for the future of global-scale data management on the\nWeb. As of today, in its early form, the Web of Data hosts a variety of data\nsets that include encyclopedic facts, drug and protein data, metadata on music,\nbooks and scholarly articles, social network representations, geospatial\ninformation, and many other types of information. The size and diversity of the\nWeb of Data is a demonstration of the flexibility of the underlying standards\nand the overall feasibility of the project as a whole. The purpose of this\narticle is to provide a review of the technological underpinnings of the Web of\nData as well as some of the hurdles that need to be overcome if the Web of Data\nis to emerge as the defacto medium for data representation, distribution, and\nultimately, processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 01:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4353", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Azeez Nureni Ayofe, Azeez Raheem Ajetola", "title": "Exploration of the Gap Between Computer Science Curriculum and\n  Industrial I.T Skills Requirements", "comments": "10 pages IEEE Format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 4, No. 1 & 2, August 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.GL cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper sets out to examine the skills gaps between the industrial\napplication of Information Technology and university academic programmes\n(curriculum).

It also\nhighlights strategies to abolish the misalignment between university and\nindustry.
