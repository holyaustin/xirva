Recent studies have shown that hearing outcome\nis correlated with intra-cochlear anatomy and electrode placement. Our group\nhas developed image-guided CI programming (IGCIP) techniques that use image\nanalysis methods to both segment the inner ear structures in pre- or\npost-implantation CT images and localize the CI electrodes in post-implantation\nCT images. This permits to assist audiologists with CI programming by\nsuggesting which among the contacts should be deactivated to reduce electrode\ninteraction that is known to affect outcomes. Clinical studies have shown that\nIGCIP can improve hearing outcomes for CI recipients. However, the sensitivity\nof IGCIP with respect to the accuracy of the two major steps: electrode\nlocalization and intra-cochlear anatomy segmentation, is unknown. In this\narticle, we create a ground truth dataset with conventional CT and micro-CT\nimages of 35 temporal bone specimens to both rigorously characterize the\naccuracy of these two steps and assess how inaccuracies in these steps affect\nthe overall results. Our study results show that when clinical pre- and\npost-implantation CTs are available, IGCIP produces results that are comparable\nto those obtained with the corresponding ground truth in 86.7% of the subjects\ntested. When only post-implantation CTs are available, this number is 83.3%.\nThese results suggest that our current method is robust to errors in\nsegmentation and localization but also that it can be improved upon.\n  Keywords: cochlear implant, ground truth, segmentation, validation\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:16:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2020 14:13:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Yiyuan", ""], ["Wang", "Jianing", ""], ["Li", "Rui", ""], ["Labadie", "Robert F.", ""], ["Dawant", "Benoit M.", ""], ["Noble", "Jack H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.10922", "submitter": "Yiyuan Zhao", "authors": "Yiyuan Zhao", "title": "Automatic techniques for cochlear implant CT image analysis", "comments": "This is a preprint of Yiyuan Zhao's Ph.D. dissertation from\n  Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.
