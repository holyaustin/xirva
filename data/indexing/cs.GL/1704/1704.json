Although existing studies have explored various aspects of this topic,\nfew of them have categorized and summarized these areas of research in\nrequire-ments modeling and analysis. This study aims to investigate the\nresearch themes based on the utilized modeling methods and RE activities. We\nconduct a thematic study in the systematic literature review. The results are\nderived by synthesizing the extracted data with statistical methods. This paper\nprovides an updated review of the research literature, enabling researchers and\npractitioners to better understand the research themes in these areas and\nidentify research gaps which need to be further studied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 04:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Zhuoqun", ""], ["Li", "Zhi", ""], ["Jin", "Zhi", ""]]}]
