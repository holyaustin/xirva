Accordingly, it is not surprising that within the viewpoints expressed\nhere is some unabashed speculation, occasionally bordering on just partially\njustified guesswork, while elsewhere we find a good deal of precise reasoning,\nsome in the form of rigorous mathematical theorems. Both of these are as should\nbe, for without some inspired guesswork we cannot have new ideas as to where\nlook in order to make genuinely new progress, and without precise mathematical\nreasoning, no less than in precise observation, we cannot know when we are\nright -- or, more usually, when we are wrong.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 21:04:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Penrose", "Roger", ""]]}]
