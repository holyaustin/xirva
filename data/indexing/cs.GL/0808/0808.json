Cost reduction, less vendor dependency and\nincreased potential for local capacity development have been their main\narguments. In spite of its advantages, Free and Open Source Software is not\nwidely adopted at the African continent. In this book the authors will explore\nthe grounds on with these expectations are based. Where do they come from and\nis there evidence to support these expectations? Over the past years several\nprojects have been initiated and some good results have been achieved, but at\nthe same time many challenges were encountered. What lessons can be drawn from\nthese experiences and do these experiences contain enough evidence to support\nthe high expectations? Several projects and their achievements will be\nconsidered. In the final part of the book the future of Free and Open Source\nSoftware for Development will be explored. Special attention is given to the\nAfrican continent since here challenges are highest. What is the role of Free\nand open Source Software for Development and how do we need to position and\nexplore the potential? What are the threats?
