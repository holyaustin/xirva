Our approach enhances contemporary\nco-citation network analysis by enabling analysts to identify co-citation\nclusters of cited references intuitively, synthesize thematic contexts in which\nthese clusters are cited, and trace how research focus evolves over time. The\nnew approach integrates and streamlines a few previously isolated techniques\nsuch as spectral clustering and feature selection algorithms. The integrative\nprocedure is expected to empower and strengthen analytical and sense making\ncapabilities of scientists, learners, and researchers to understand the\ndynamics of the evolution of scientific domains in a wide range of scientific\nfields, science studies, and science policy evaluation and planning. We\ndemonstrate the potential of our approach through a visual analysis of the\nevolution of astronomical research associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) using bibliographic data between 1994 and 2008. In addition, we also\ndemonstrate that the approach can be consistently applied to a set of\nheterogeneous data sources such as e-prints on arXiv, publications on ADS, and\nNSF awards related to the same topic of SDSS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2010 20:54:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Chaomei", ""], ["Zhang", "Jian", ""], ["Vogeley", "Michael S.", ""]]}]
