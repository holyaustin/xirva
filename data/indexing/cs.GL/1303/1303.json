The face of science has changed.\nSurprisingly, when we start asking about the essence of these changes and then\ncritically analyse the answers, the result are mostly discouraging. Most of the\nanswers are related to the properties that have been in the focus of scientific\nresearch already for more than a century (like non-linearity). This paper is\nPreface to the special issue \"Grasping Complexity\" of the journal \"Computers\nand Mathematics with Applications\". We analyse the change of era in science,\nits reasons and main changes in scientific activity and give a brief review of\nthe papers in the issue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 18:40:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gorban", "A.
