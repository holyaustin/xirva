The\nSemantic Web effort has brought forth an array of technologies that support the\nencoding, storage, and querying of the semantic network data structure at the\nworld stage. Currently, the popular conception of the Semantic Web is that of a\ndata modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in\nsemantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly\nencode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these\nnew technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a\ncomputational medium. This article provides a classification of existing\ncomputational modeling efforts and the requirements of supporting technologies\nthat will aid in the further growth of this burgeoning domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2007 21:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Bollen", "Johan", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.0484", "submitter": "David Wright", "authors": "David R.
