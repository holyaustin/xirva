The proliferation of digital mobility data, such as phone\nrecords, GPS traces, and social media posts, combined with the predictive power\nof artificial intelligence, triggered the application of deep learning to human\nmobility. Existing surveys focus on single tasks, data sources, mechanistic or\ntraditional machine learning approaches, while a comprehensive description of\ndeep learning solutions is missing. This survey provides a taxonomy of mobility\ntasks, a discussion on the challenges related to each task and how deep\nlearning may overcome the limitations of traditional models, a description of\nthe most relevant solutions to the mobility tasks described above and the\nrelevant challenges for the future. Our survey is a guide to the leading deep\nlearning solutions to next-location prediction, crowd flow prediction,\ntrajectory generation, and flow generation. At the same time, it helps deep\nlearning scientists and practitioners understand the fundamental concepts and\nthe open challenges of the study of human mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:59:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 27 Jun 2021 09:36:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Luca", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Barlacchi", "Gianni", ""], ["Lepri", "Bruno", ""], ["Pappalardo", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.05965", "submitter": "Corey Maley", "authors": "Corey J.

To the extent that attention has been paid to analog\ncomputation, it has been misunderstood. The received view -- that analog\ncomputation has to do essentially with continuity -- is simply wrong, as shown\nby careful attention to historical examples of discontinuous, discrete analog\ncomputers. Instead of the received view, I develop an account of analog\ncomputation in terms of a particular type of analog representation that allows\nfor discontinuity. This account thus characterizes all types of analog\ncomputation, whether continuous or discrete. Furthermore, the structure of this\naccount can be generalized to other types of computation: analog computation\nessentially involves analog representation, whereas digital computation\nessentially involves digital representation. Besides being a necessary\ncomponent of a complete philosophical understanding of computation in general,\nunderstanding analog computation is important for computational explanation in\ncontemporary neuroscience and cognitive science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2020 20:44:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Maley", "Corey J.", ""]]}]
