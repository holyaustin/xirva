Although\nprogrammes have been put in place to support such work, the complex dynamics of\ninterdisciplinarity are still poorly understood. In this paper we interrogate\nthe nature of interdisciplinary research and how we might measure its\n\"success\", identify potential barriers to its implementation, and suggest\npossible mechanisms for removing these impediments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Dec 2010 14:06:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Nov 2012 12:10:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Jacobs", "Naomi", ""], ["Amos", "Martyn", ""]]}]
