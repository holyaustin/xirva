However, realization of these benefits\nlargely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into upcoming as\nwell as existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to\nbroadcast and receive data to and from other CVs [vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)\ncommunication], to and from infrastructure [vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)\ncommunication], and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists or\npedestrians (vehicle-to-other road users communication). Further, the\ninfrastructure and transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications\nmust be able to collect, process, distribute, and archive these data quickly,\nreliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications and investigates\ncurrent digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the\nimportance of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment\nin more traditional transportation infrastructure to keep up with the auto\nindustry push toward increasing intervehicular communication. By studying\ncurrent CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital\ninfrastructure being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies\nlimited budgeting for digital infrastructure and finds that current expenditure\nis inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications.\nFinally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of\ncurrent practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for\ntransportation infrastructure. It stresses the importance of collaboration for\nestablishing national and international platforms for the planning, deployment,\nand management of digital infrastructure to support connected transportation\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2018 05:50:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2018 02:10:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Dec 2018 21:23:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:29:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Sakib Mahmud", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Mashrur", ""], ["Morris", "Eric A", ""], ["Deka", "Lipika", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.05998", "submitter": "Attila Egri-Nagy", "authors": "Attila Egri-Nagy", "title": "|{Math, Philosophy, Programming, Writing}| = 1", "comments": "v4 some clarifications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Philosophical thinking has a side effect: by aiming to find the essence of a\ndiverse set of phenomena, it often makes it difficult to see the differences\nbetween them.

This paper provides an overview of recent measurement models and\napproaches to establishing and enhancing SA in aviation environments. Many\naspects of SA are examined including the classification of SA techniques into\nsix categories, and different theoretical SA models from individual, to shared\nor team, and to distributed or system levels. Quantitative and qualitative\nperspectives pertaining to SA methods and issues of SA for unmanned vehicles\nare also addressed. Furthermore, future research directions regarding SA\nassessment approaches are raised to deal with shortcomings of the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2018 11:17:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2018 22:59:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2019 02:34:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Thanh", ""], ["Lim", "Chee Peng", ""], ["Nguyen", "Ngoc Duy", ""], ["Gordon-Brown", "Lee", ""], ["Nahavandi", "Saeid", ""]]}]
