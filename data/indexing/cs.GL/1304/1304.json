Not only are experiments rarely replicated, they are rarely even\nreplicable in a meaningful way. Scientists are being encouraged to make their\nsource code available, but this is only a small step. Even in the happy event\nthat source code can be built and run successfully, running code is a long way\naway from being able to replicate the experiment that code was used for. I\npropose that the discipline of Computer Science must embrace replication of\nexperiments as standard practice. I propose that the only credible technique to\nmake experiments truly replicable is to provide copies of virtual machines in\nwhich the experiments are validated to run. I propose that tools and\nrepositories should be made available to make this happen. I propose to be one\nof those who makes it happen.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Apr 2013 16:29:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Gent", "Ian P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.5385", "submitter": "Stuart Barry Cooper", "authors": "S.

The mismatch between the Turing machine conception, and the\nexperiences of those more practically engaged in computing, has parallels with\nthe wider one between science and those working creatively or intuitively out\nin the 'real' world. The scientific outlook is more flexible and basic than\nsome understand or want to admit. The science is subject to limitations which\nthreaten careers. We look at embodiment and disembodiment of computation as the\nkey to the mismatch, and find Turing had the right idea all along - amongst a\nproductive confusion of ideas about computation in the real and the abstract\nworlds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 12:01:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cooper", "S.
