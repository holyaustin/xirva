The COMPUTING NATURE is about nature considered as the totality of\nphysical existence, the universe. By physical we mean all phenomena, objects\nand processes, that are possible to detect either directly by our senses or via\ninstruments. Historically, there have been many ways of describing the universe\n(cosmic egg, cosmic tree, theistic universe, mechanistic universe) while a\nparticularly prominent contemporary approach is computational universe, as\ndiscussed in this article.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2012 19:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Crnkovic", "Gordana Dodig", ""], ["Giovagnoli", "Raffaela", ""]]}]
