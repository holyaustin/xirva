Despite major advances in many fields, there\nis still no plausible link between subjective experience (qualia) and its\nrealization in the body. This paper outlines some of the elements of a rigorous\nscience of mind (SoM) - key ideas include scientific realism of mind, agnostic\nmysterianism, careful attention to language, and a focus on concrete\n(touchstone) questions and results. A core suggestion is to focus effort on the\n(still mysterious) mapping from neural activity to subjective experience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2018 18:02:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2019 20:44:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 16:58:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "Jerome", "", "ICSI and UC Berkeley"]]}]
