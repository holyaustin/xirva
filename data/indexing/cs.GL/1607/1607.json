Today's undergraduate students are familiar with data\nscience projects and they judge statistics against what they have seen.\nStatistics, especially at the introductory level, should take inspiration from\ndata science so that the discipline is not seen as somehow lesser than data\nscience. This article provides a brief overview of data science, outlines ideas\nfor how introductory courses could take inspiration from data science, and\nprovides a reference to materials for developing stand-alone data science\ncourses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 12:40:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Loy", "Adam", ""]]}]
