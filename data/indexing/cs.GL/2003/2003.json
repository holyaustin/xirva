Their powerful predictive capabilities appear in\nnumerous disciplines, including chaotic dynamics, but they miss understanding.\nThe main thesis here is that prediction and understanding are two very\ndifferent and important ideas that should guide us about the progress of\nscience. Furthermore, it is emphasized the important role played by that\nnonlinear dynamical systems for the process of understanding. The path of the\nfuture of science will be marked by a constructive dialogue between big data\nand big theory, without which we cannot understand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2020 20:10:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 17:31:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Sanjuan", "Miguel A.
