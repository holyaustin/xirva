The aim of the paper is to retrace some steps of the\nCEP project, carried out by the University of Pisa in collaboration with\nOlivetti, by reassessing the documents preserved in the University archives.\nThe project was a seminal enterprise for Italy, and among its accomplishments\nit delivered in 1957 the first Italian computer. The mix of public sector\nfunding and industrial foretelling witnessed by the project is one of the\nleading examples in Italy of best practices, and its success paved the way for\nthe birth of Computer Science in the country as an industry as well as a\nscientific discipline.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2019 23:40:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cignoni", "Giovanni A.", ""], ["Gadducci", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12320", "submitter": "Laurent Bou\\'e", "authors": "Laurent Bou\\'e", "title": "Real numbers, data science and chaos: How to fit any dataset with a\n  single parameter", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.DM cs.GL cs.IR stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how any dataset of any modality (time-series, images, sound...) can\nbe approximated by a well-behaved (continuous, differentiable...) scalar\nfunction with a single real-valued parameter.
