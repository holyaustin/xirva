A dedicated\nterminology is developed concerning general aspects of sourcing. The term\nsourcement is coined to denote a building block for sourcing. No- tions of\nallocation, functional architecture and allocational architecture, equilibrium,\nand configuration are discussed. Limitations of the concept of outsourcing are\noutlined. This theoretical work is meant to serve as a point of departure for\nthe subsequent development of a detailed theory of sourcing and sourcing\ntransformations, which can be a tool for dealing with practical applica- tions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Jul 2011 12:12:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "J.
