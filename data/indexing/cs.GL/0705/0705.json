The detector employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to compute\nbit reliabilities from the signals received and is thus suited for coded MIMO\nsystems. It offers a good trade-off between achievable performance and\nalgorithmic complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2007 12:04:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sundaram", "V.", ""], ["Murthy", "K.
