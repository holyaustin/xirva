We try to figure out what the info-computational\nparadigm would mean, in particular its pancomputationalism. We make some steps\ntowards developing the notion of computing that is necessary here, especially\nin relation to traditional notions. We investigate whether pancomputationalism\ncan possibly provide the basic causal structure to the world, whether the\noverall research programme appears productive and whether it can revigorate\ncomputationalism in the philosophy of mind.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2009 22:50:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Dodig-Crnkovic", "Gordana", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Vincent C.", ""]]}]
