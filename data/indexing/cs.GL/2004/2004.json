The central\nrole of data highlights the need for reliable and clean data. Unreliable,\nerroneous, and incomplete data lead to critical bottlenecks in processing\npipelines and, ultimately, service failures, which are disastrous for the\ncompetitive performance of the organization. Given its central importance,\nthose organizations which recognize and react to the need for reliable data\nwill have the advantage in the coming decade. We argue that the technologies\nfor reliable data are driven by distinct concerns and expertise which\ncomplement those of the data scientist and the data engineer. Those\norganizations which identify the central importance of meaningful, explainable,\nreproducible, and maintainable data will be at the forefront of the\ndemocratization of reliable data. We call the new role which must be developed\nto fill this critical need the Knowledge Scientist. The organizational\nstructures, tools, methodologies and techniques to support and make possible\nthe work of knowledge scientists are still in their infancy. As organizations\nnot only use data but increasingly rely on data, it is time to empower the\npeople who are central to this transformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 20:14:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fletcher", "George", ""], ["Groth", "Paul", ""], ["Sequeda", "Juan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.08382", "submitter": "Omar Sosa Tzec", "authors": "Omar Sosa-Tzec, Erik Stolterman Bergqvist, Marty A.

It discusses key challenges and measures involved in\neliciting, conceptualizing, prioritizing and respecting values in system\ndesign. Thereby it draws from software engineering, value sensitive design,\ndesign thinking and participatory design as well as from philosophical sources,\nespecially Material Ethics of Value. The article recognizes timely challenges\nfor Value-based Engineering, such as compatibility with agile forms of system\ndevelopment, responsibility in hardly controllable ecosystems of interconnected\nservices, fearless integration of external stakeholders and the difficulty in\nmeasuring the ethicality of a system. Finally, the Value-based Engineering\nmethodology presented here benefits from learnings collected in the IEEE P7000\nstandardization process as well as from a case study. P7000 has been set up by\nIEEE to establish a process model, which addresses ethical considerations\nthroughout the various stages of system initiation, analysis and design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 17:30:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2020 12:28:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Spiekermann", "Sarah", ""], ["Winkler", "Till", ""]]}]
