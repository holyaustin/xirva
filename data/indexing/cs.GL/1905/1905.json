The modeling includes parameters such as amplitude gains and phase\ndifferences of RF chains between the eNBs. The calibration method used for\ninter-cell antenna calibration is based on precoding matrix indicator (PMI)\nfeedback by UE. Furthermore, we provide some simulation results for evaluating\nthe performance of the calibration method in different cases such as varying\nestimation-period, cell-specific reference signals (CRS) ports configuration,\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR), phase difference, etc. The main conclusion is that\nthe proposed method for intercell antenna calibration has good performance for\nestimating the residual phase difference.

There\nhas been a tremendous success in applying them for narrow intellectual tasks\nsuch as pattern recognition, natural language processing and playing Go. The\nlatter application vastly outperforms the strongest human player in recent\nyears. However, these tasks are formalized by people in such ways that it has\nbecome \"easy\" for automated recipes to find better solutions than humans do. In\nthe sense of John Searle's Chinese Room Argument, the computer playing Go does\nnot actually understand anything from the game. Thinking like a human mind\nrequires to go beyond the curve fitting paradigm of current systems. There is a\nfundamental limit to what they can achieve currently as only very specific\nproblem formalization can increase their performances in particular tasks. In\nthis paper, we argue than one of the most important aspects of the human mind\nis its capacity for logical thinking, which gives rise to many intellectual\nexpressions that differentiate us from animal brains. We propose to model the\nemergence of logical thinking based on Piaget's theory of cognitive\ndevelopment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 May 2019 15:46:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ivan", "Cristian", ""], ["Indurkhya", "Bipin", ""]]}]
