On the one\nhand, it encourages a digital ontology, with a perceived flatness of\ncomputational structure comprehensively hosting causality at the physical level\nand beyond. On the other (the main point of Turing's paper), it can give an\ninsight into the way in which higher order information arises and leads to loss\nof computational control - while demonstrating how the control can be\nre-established, in special circumstances, via suitable type reductions. We\nexamine the classical computational framework more closely than is usual,\ndrawing out lessons for the wider application of information-theoretical\napproaches to characterizing the real world. The problem which arises across a\nrange of contexts is the characterizing of the balance of power between the\ncomplexity of informational structure (with emergence, chaos, randomness and\n'big data' prominently on the scene) and the means available (simulation,\ncodes, statistical sampling, human intuition, semantic constructs) to bring\nthis information back into the computational fold. We proceed via appropriate\nmathematical modelling to a more coherent view of the computational structure\nof information, relevant to a wide spectrum of areas of investigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2015 17:07:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cooper", "S.
