In the 1970s, he had the vision of formally verifying\nsystem designs, proving their correctness using mathematics and logic. He\ndemonstrated his ideas on real-world computer designs. His students extended\nthe work to such diverse areas as the verification of floating-point\nalgorithms, the verification of probabilistic algorithms and the verified\ntranslation of source code to correct machine code. He was elected to the Royal\nSociety in 1994, and he continued to produce outstanding research until\nretirement.\n  His achievements include his work at Edinburgh University helping to create\nEdinburgh LCF, the first interactive theorem prover of its kind, and the ML\nfamily of functional programming languages. He adopted higher-order logic as a\ngeneral formalism for verification, showing that it could specify hardware\ndesigns from the gate level right up to the processor level. It turned out to\nbe an ideal formalism for many problems in computer science and mathematics.\nHis tools and techniques have exerted a huge influence across the field of\nformal verification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2018 14:09:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Aug 2018 09:10:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Paulson", "Lawrence C", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.09525", "submitter": "Daniel N\\\"ust", "authors": "Daniel N\\\"ust, Carl Boettiger and Ben Marwick", "title": "How to Read a Research Compendium", "comments": "Manuscript repository publicly available at\n  https://github.com/nuest/how-to-read-a-research-compendium/", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers.
