For\nmaking decisions and triggering actions stakeholders require notifications\nabout significant events and reliable background information that meet their\nindividual requirements in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and completeness. As\none of Europe's leading providers of financial data and regulatory solutions\nvwd processes an average of 18 billion event notifications from 500+ data\nsources for 30 million symbols per day. Our large-scale distributed event-based\nsystems handle daily peak rates of 1+ million event notifications per second\nand additional load generated by singular pivotal events with global impact. In\nthis poster we give practical insights into our IT systems. We outline the\ninfrastructure we operate and the event-driven architecture we apply at vwd. In\nparticular we showcase the (geo)distributed publish/subscribe broker network we\noperate across locations and countries to provide market data to our customers\nwith varying quality of information (QoI) properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 13:14:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Frischbier", "Sebastian", ""], ["Paic", "Mario", ""], ["Echler", "Alexander", ""], ["Roth", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.02455", "submitter": "Butler Lampson", "authors": "Butler Lampson", "title": "Hints and Principles for Computer System Design", "comments": "There is also a short version of this paper, about half the length of\n  this one", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.GL cs.OS cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This new long version of my 1983 paper suggests the goals you might have for\nyour system -- Simple, Timely, Efficient, Adaptable, Dependable, Yummy (STEADY)\n-- and techniques for achieving them -- Approximate, Incremental, Divide &\nConquer (AID).

To achieve this goal, we have to develop a\nco-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the\ncybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the\ndefinition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid\nof cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work\ntogether efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that\npublic interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law\nenforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek\nto resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data\nsharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as\ncybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be\nreconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and\nsharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to\nco-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good\npractices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple\nthird-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse\ndata. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising\nco-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common\nstandards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon.\nWe propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and\nsharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and\nstandardised in order to mitigate the paradox.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:23:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Atapour-Abarghouei", "Amir", ""], ["McGough", "Andrew Stephen", ""], ["Wall", "David Stanley", ""]]}]
