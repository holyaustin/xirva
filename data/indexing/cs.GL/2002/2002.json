In view of the potential of IoT-based devices, how can we reduce\nthe obstacles of a cohort with low digital literacy and technology anxiety and\nenable them to be equal participants in the digitalized world? This article\nshows the method and results achieved in a community-stakeholder workshop,\ndeveloped through the participatory design methodology, aiming at brainstorming\nproblems and scenarios through a focus group and a structured survey. The\nresearch activity focused on understanding factors to increase the usability of\noff-the-shelf IoT devices for hesitant users and identify strategies for\nimproving digital literacy and reducing technology anxiety. A notable result\nwas a series of feedback items pointing to the importance of creating learning\nresources to support individuals with different abilities, age, gender\nexpression, to better adopt off-the-shelf IoT-based solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Feb 2020 03:06:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:36:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 23:13:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Zallio", "Matteo", ""], ["McGrory", "John", ""], ["Berry", "Damon", ""]]}]
