This\narticle is a description of Vim and a set of considerations about its usage and\ndesign. It results from more than ten years of experience in using Vim for\nwriting and editing various types of documents, e.g. Python, C++, JavaScript,\nChucK programs; \\LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, RDF, Make and other markup files; % TTM\nbinary files. It is commonplace, in the Vim users and developers communities,\nto say that it takes about ten years to master (or start mastering) this text\neditor, and I find that other experienced users have a different view of Vim\nand that they use a different set of features. Therefore, this document exposes\nmy understandings in order to confront my usage with that of other Vim users.\nAnother goal is to make available a reference document with which new users can\ngrasp a sound overview by reading it and the discussions that it might\ngenerate. Also, it should be useful for users of any degree of experience,\nincluding me, as a compendium of commands, namespaces and tweaks. Upon\nfeedback, and maturing of my Vim usage, this document might be enhanced and\nexpanded.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Dec 2017 14:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fabbri", "Renato", ""]]}]
