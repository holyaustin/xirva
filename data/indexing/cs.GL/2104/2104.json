E-commerce, very\ndifferent from the usual shopping concept, is compatible with today's economic\ndynamics. E-commerce is becoming an indispensable method with the increase of\ninternet usage. With the use of E-commerce, there are also a number of\nadvantages for companies. On the other hand, SAP is a pioneer and leader in the\ncompany resource planning software sector. SAP is very important for\nlarge-scale companies. They manage all their processes on SAP and its\nintegration is very important with other related software.

Turing Award. In this\npaper, we attempt to shed light on the path to influential computer scientists\nby examining the characteristics of the 72 Turing Award laureates. To achieve\nthis goal, we build a comprehensive dataset of the Turing Award laureates and\nanalyze their characteristics, including their personal information, family\nbackground, academic background, and industry experience. The FP-Growth\nalgorithm is used for frequent feature mining. Logistic regression plot, pie\nchart, word cloud and map are generated accordingly for each of the interesting\nfeatures to uncover insights regarding personal factors that drive influential\nwork in the field of computer science. In particular, we show that the Turing\nAward laureates are most commonly white, male, married, United States citizen,\nand received a PhD degree. Our results also show that the age at which the\nlaureate won the award increases over the years; most of the Turing Award\nlaureates did not major in computer science; birth order is strongly related to\nthe winners' success; and the number of citations is not as important as one\nwould expect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Apr 2021 00:38:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Shangguan", "Zhongkai", ""], ["Zheng", "Zihe", ""], ["Luo", "Jiebo", ""]]}]
