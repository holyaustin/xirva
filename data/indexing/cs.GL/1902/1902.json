The promised\neffect of this decision is that the first large-scale practical quantum\ncomputer is within reach. Coming to grips with the strategy and the challenges\nof preparing reliable executions of an arbitrary quantum computation is not\ndifficult. Moreover, the article explains why defects are good.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2019 01:40:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Paler", "Alexandru", ""], ["Fowler", "Austin G.", ""], ["Wille", "Robert", ""]]}]
