The\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence research program aims to develop analytic\ntechniques with which to render opaque computing systems transparent, but lacks\na normative framework with which to evaluate these techniques' explanatory\nsuccess. The aim of the present discussion is to develop such a framework,\nwhile paying particular attention to different stakeholders' distinct\nexplanatory requirements. Building on an analysis of 'opacity' from philosophy\nof science, this framework is modeled after David Marr's influential account of\nexplanation in cognitive science. Thus, the framework distinguishes between the\ndifferent questions that might be asked about an opaque computing system, and\nspecifies the general way in which these questions should be answered. By\napplying this normative framework to current techniques such as input\nheatmapping, feature-detector identification, and diagnostic classification, it\nwill be possible to determine whether and to what extent the Black Box Problem\ncan be solved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 11:14:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2019 19:02:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zednik", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05941", "submitter": "Jan Claes", "authors": "Sarah Pissierssens, Jan Claes, Geert Poels", "title": "The \"Physics of Diagrams\": Revealing the scientific basis of graphical\n  representation design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.GL cs.SE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Data is omnipresent in the modern, digital world and a significant number of\npeople need to make sense of data as part of their everyday social and\nprofessional life.

These devices produced by various vendors\noften posses limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports\nor WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces. Meanwhile, with an increasing mainstream\nfocus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming\ncommonplace in consumer-level computing devices, and IoT devices are no\nexception. Under these circumstances, a significant challenge is presented to\ndigital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be\nanalysed. This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis\nliterature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT\ndevices. EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional\nelectromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data\nhandling of computing devices. The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel\napproaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations\nas these attacks require, and must result in, no modification to the target\ndevice. The literature on various EM side-channel analysis attack techniques\nare discussed - selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device\ninvestigation scenarios. The insight gained from the background study is used\nto identify promising future applications of the technique for digital forensic\nanalysis on IoT devices - potentially progressing a wide variety of currently\nhindered digital investigations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:27:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sayakkara", "Asanka", ""], ["Le-Khac", "Nhien-An", ""], ["Scanlon", "Mark", ""]]}]
