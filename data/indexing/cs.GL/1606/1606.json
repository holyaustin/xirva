In this paper, we investigate the energy implications\nof trading computation for locality using Hilbert and Morton space-filling\ncurves with dense matrix-matrix multiplication. The advantage of these curves\nis that they exhibit an inherent tiling effect without requiring specific\narchitecture tuning. By accessing the matrices in the order determined by the\nspace-filling curves, we can trade computation for locality. The index\ncomputation overhead of the Morton curve is found to be balanced against its\nlocality and energy efficiency, while the overhead of the Hilbert curve\noutweighs its improvements on our test system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 14:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Reissmann", "Nico", ""], ["Meyer", "Jan Christian", ""], ["Jahre", "Magnus", ""]]}]
