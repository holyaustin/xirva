The decisions whether to accept or reject articles is taken\nby the program committee (PC) members. Serving on a PC for the first time can\nbe a daunting experience. This guide will help new program-committee members to\nunderstand how the system works, and provide useful tips and guidelines. It\ndiscusses every phase of the paper-selection process, and the tasks associated\nto it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2021 19:40:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Dulek", "Yfke", ""], ["Jeffery", "Stacey", ""], ["Majenz", "Christian", ""], ["Schaffner", "Christian", ""], ["Speelman", "Florian", ""], ["de Wolf", "Ronald", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.05302", "submitter": "Charles Bodon", "authors": "Charles Bodon (UP1 UFR10)", "title": "Wittgenstein and Turing: Machines, Language games and Forms of life", "comments": "in French", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose here to make the connection between the definitions given by\nTuring and Wittgenstein about what it means to \"follow a rule\".

Various proposals have been\nmade in literature for defining regulatory bodies and/or related regulation. In\nthis paper, we present a pragmatic approach for providing a technology\nassurance regulatory framework. To the best knowledge of the authors this work\npresents the first national AI technology assurance legal and regulatory\nframework that has been implemented by a national authority empowered through\nlaw to do so. In aim of both providing assurances where required and not\nstifling innovation yet supporting it, herein it is proposed that such\nregulation should not be mandated for all AI-based systems and that rather it\nshould primarily provide a voluntary framework and only be mandated in sectors\nand activities where required and as deemed necessary by other authorities for\nregulated and critical areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:49:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ellul", "Joshua", ""], ["McCarthy", "Stephen", ""], ["Sammut", "Trevor", ""], ["Brockdorff", "Juanita", ""], ["Scerri", "Matthew", ""], ["Pace", "Gordon J.", ""]]}]
