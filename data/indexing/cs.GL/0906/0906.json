In this work, we propose an\nexact probabilistic error model that can compute the maximum error over all\npossible input space in a circuit specific manner and can handle various types\nof structural dependencies in the circuit. We also provide the worst-case input\nvector, which has the highest probability to generate an erroneous output, for\nany given logic circuit. We also present a study of circuit-specific error\nbounds for fault-tolerant computation in heterogeneous circuits using the\nmaximum error computed for each circuit. We model the error estimation problem\nas a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, over the joint error probability\nfunction of the entire circuit, calculated efficiently through an intelligent\nsearch of the entire input space using probabilistic traversal of a binary join\ntree using Shenoy-Shafer algorithm. We demonstrate this model using MCNC and\nISCAS benchmark circuits and validate it using an equivalent HSpice model. Both\nresults yield the same worst-case input vectors and the highest % difference of\nour error model over HSpice is just 1.23%. We observe that the maximum error\nprobabilities are significantly larger than the average error probabilities,\nand provides a much tighter error bounds for fault-tolerant computation. We\nalso find that the error estimates depend on the specific circuit structure and\nthe maximum error probabilities are sensitive to the individual gate failure\nprobabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2009 19:23:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 16:04:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 13:57:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lingasubramanian", "Karthikeyan", ""], ["Alam", "Syed M.", ""], ["Bhanja", "Sanjukta", ""]]}]
