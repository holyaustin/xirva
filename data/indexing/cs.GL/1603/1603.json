It is shown that the MRAM\nmodel empirically best models computation hardness. The P=?NP problem is shown\nto be a scientific rather than a mathematical problem. The assumptions involved\nin the current definition of the P?=NP problem as a problem involving non\ndeterministic Turing Machines (NDTMs) from axiomatic automata theory are\ncriticized. The problem is also shown to be neither a problem in pure nor\napplied mathematics. The details of The MRAM model and the well known Hartmanis\nand Simon construction that shows how to code and simulate NDTMs on MRAM\nmachines is described. Since the computation power of MRAMs is the same as\nNDTMs, P is equal to NP. The paper shows that the justification for the NDTM\nP?=NP problem using a letter from Kurt Godel to John Von Neumann is incorrect\nby showing Von Neumann explicitly rejected automata models of computation\nhardness and used his computer architecture for modeling computation that is\nexactly the MRAM model. The paper argues that Deolalikar's scientific solution\nshowing P not equal to NP if assumptions from statistical physics are used,\nneeds to be revisited.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 00:02:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Meyer", "Steven", ""]]}]
