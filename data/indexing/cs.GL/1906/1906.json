This research article focuses on this topic and\nproposes a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and awareness to be\nused when targeting Small-to-Medium-sized Enterprises/Businesses (SMEs/SMBs) at\na city-level. We ground this programme in existing research as well as unique\ninsight into an ongoing city-based project with similar aims. Findings: We find\nthat whilst literature can be informative at guiding education and awareness\nprogrammes, it may not always reach real-world programmes. On the other hand,\nexisting programmes, such as the one we explored, have great potential but\nthere can also be room for improvement. Knowledge from each of these areas can,\nand should, be combined to the benefit of the academic and practitioner\ncommunities. Originality/value: The study contributes to current research\nthrough the outline of a high-level programme for cybersecurity education and\nawareness targeting SMEs/SMBs. Through this research, we engage in a reflection\nof literature in this space, and present insights into the advances and\nchallenges faced by an on-going programme. These analyses allow us to craft a\nproposal for a core programme that can assist in improving the security\neducation, awareness and training that targets SMEs/SMBs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Jun 2019 13:13:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bada", "Maria", ""], ["Nurse", "Jason R.

The latest rise of Big\nData methods and systems is partly due to the new abilities these techniques\nprovide, partly to the simplicity of the software design and partly because the\nbuzzword itself has value to investors and clients. That said, popularity is\nnot a measure for suitability and the Big Data approach might not be the best\nsolution, or even an applicable one, to many common problems.
