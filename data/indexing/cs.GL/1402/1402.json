I will very briefly survey one of\nTuring's other contributions to the philosophy of information and computation,\nincluding similarities to Shannon's own methodological approach to information\nthrough communication, showing how crucial they are and have been as\nmethodological strategies to understanding key aspects of these concepts. While\nFloridi's concept of Levels of Abstraction is related to the novel methodology\nof Turing's imitation game for tackling the question of machine intelligence,\nTuring's other main contribution to the philosophy of information runs contrary\nto it. Indeed, the seminal concept of computation universality strongly\nsuggests the deletion of fundamental differences among seemingly different\nlevels of description. How might we reconcile these apparently contradictory\ncontributions? I will argue that Turing's contribution should prompt us to plot\nsome directions for a philosophy of information and computation, one that\nclosely parallels the most important developments in computer science, one that\nunderstands the profound implications of the works of Turing, Shannon and\nothers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 17:43:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zenil", "Hector", ""]]}]
