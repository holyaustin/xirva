Future progress of new computational devices capable of\ndealing with problems of big data, internet of things, semantic web, cognitive\nrobotics and neuroinformatics depends on the adequate models of computation. In\nthis article we first present the current state of the art through\nsystematization of existing models and mechanisms, and outline basic structural\nframework of computation. We argue that defining computation as information\nprocessing, and given that there is no information without (physical)\nrepresentation, the dynamics of information on the fundamental level is\nphysical/ intrinsic/ natural computation. As a special case, intrinsic\ncomputation is used for designed computation in computing machinery. Intrinsic\nnatural computation occurs on variety of levels of physical processes,\ncontaining the levels of computation of living organisms (including highly\nintelligent animals) as well as designed computational devices. The present\narticle offers a typology of current models of computation and indicates future\npaths for the advancement of the field; both by the development of new\ncomputational models and by learning from nature how to better compute using\ndifferent mechanisms of intrinsic computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Dec 2013 14:35:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Burgin", "Mark", ""], ["Dodig-Crnkovic", "Gordana", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.3213", "submitter": "Serge Abiteboul", "authors": "Serge Abiteboul (LSV, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France)", "title": "Les connaissances de la toile", "comments": "in French; Cultures num\\'eriques, \\'education aux m\\'edias et \\`a\n  l'information (2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How to manage knowledge on the Web.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Dec 2013 19:50:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Abiteboul", "Serge", "", "LSV, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"]]}]
