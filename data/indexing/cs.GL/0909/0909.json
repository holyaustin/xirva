Unfortunately, the wireless and\nmobile research community lacks such data. For instance, the largest available\nhuman contact traces contain only 100 nodes with very sparse connectivity,\nlimited by experimental logistics. In this paper we pose a challenge to the\ncommunity: how can we collect mobility data from billions of human\nparticipants? We re-assert the importance of large-scale datasets in\ncommunication network design, and claim that this could impact fundamental\nstudies in other academic disciplines. In effect, we argue that planet-scale\nmobility measurements can help to save the world. For example, through\nunderstanding large-scale human mobility, we can track and model and contain\nthe spread of epidemics of various kinds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 16:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Hui", "Pan", ""], ["Mortier", "Richard", ""], ["Henderson", "Tristan", ""], ["Crowcroft", "Jon", ""]]}]
