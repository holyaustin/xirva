It\noptimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds\nresearch knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself.\nResearch software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate,\nreproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research\neffectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable,\nand adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software\ntherefore requires an environment that supports sustainability. Hence, a change\nis needed in the way research software development and maintenance are\ncurrently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally\nsupported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and\nvalidity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research\nsoftware sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation,\nselection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure,\nand legal aspects. Besides researchers, we specifically address political and\nacademic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of\nsustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies\nand measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with\nthe ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid,\nreproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a first class\ncitizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany\nin 2019, at deRSE19 - the first International Conference of Research Software\nEngineers in Germany - and a dedicated DFG-supported follow-up workshop in\nBerlin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2020 11:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2020 16:42:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Anzt", "Hartwig", ""], ["Bach", "Felix", ""], ["Druskat", "Stephan", ""], ["L\u00f6ffler", "Frank", ""], ["Loewe", "Axel", ""], ["Renard", "Bernhard Y.", ""], ["Seemann", "Gunnar", ""], ["Struck", "Alexander", ""], ["Achhammer", "Elke", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Piush", ""], ["Appel", "Franziska", ""], ["Bader", "Michael", ""], ["Brusch", "Lutz", ""], ["Busse", "Christian", ""], ["Chourdakis", "Gerasimos", ""], ["Dabrowski", "Piotr W.", ""], ["Ebert", "Peter", ""], ["Flemisch", "Bernd", ""], ["Friedl", "Sven", ""], ["Fritzsch", "Bernadette", ""], ["Funk", "Maximilian D.", ""], ["Gast", "Volker", ""], ["Goth", "Florian", ""], ["Grad", "Jean-No\u00ebl", ""], ["Hermann", "Sibylle", ""], ["Hohmann", "Florian", ""], ["Janosch", "Stephan", ""], ["Kutra", "Dominik", ""], ["Linxweiler", "Jan", ""], ["Muth", "Thilo", ""], ["Peters-Kottig", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Rack", "Fabian", ""], ["Raters", "Fabian H.

Recent findings have revealed that biological systems\ncan be used to compromise computer systems and vice versa. While regular and\nsophisticated attacks are still years away, time is of the essence to better\nunderstand ways to deepen critique and grasp intersectional vulnerabilities\nwithin bioprocessing as processes involved become increasingly digitally\naccessible. Wargames have been shown to be successful with-in improving group\ndynamics in response to anticipated cyber threats, and they can be used towards\naddressing possible threats within biocybersecurity. Within this paper, we\ndiscuss the growing prominence of biocybersecurity, the importance of\nbiocybersecurity to bioprocessing , with respect to domestic and international\ncontexts, and reasons for emphasizing the biological component in the face of\nexplosive growth in biotechnology and thus separating the terms\nbiocybersecurity and cyberbiosecurity. Additionally, a discussion and manual is\nprovided for a simulation towards organizational learning to sense and shore up\nvulnerabilities that may emerge within an organization's bioprocessing pipeline\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:49:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Potter", "Lucas", ""], ["Palmer", "Xavier-Lewis", ""]]}]
