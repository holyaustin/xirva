The huge number of\nsmart devices and the complexity of networks has made it impossible to secure\nthe data and communication between devices. Various conventional security\ncontrols are insufficient to prevent numerous attacks against these\ninformation-rich devices. Along with enhancing existing approaches, a\nperipheral defence, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), proved efficient in most\nscenarios. However, conventional IDS approaches are unsuitable to mitigate\ncontinuously emerging zero-day attacks. Intelligent mechanisms that can detect\nunfamiliar intrusions seems a prospective solution. This article explores\npopular attacks against IoT architecture and its relevant defence mechanisms to\nidentify an appropriate protective measure for different networking practices\nand attack categories. Besides, a security framework for IoT architecture is\nprovided with a list of security enhancement techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2019 13:43:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tabassum", "Aliya", ""], ["Lebda", "Wadha", ""]]}]
