The coauthorship network was created from the\nbibliographic record of a multi-institution, interdisciplinary research group\nfocused on the study of sensor networks and wireless communication. Four\ndifferent community detection algorithms were employed to assign a structural\ncommunity to each scholar in the network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge\nbetweenness and spinglass. Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the\nscholars and include such information as their academic department, academic\naffiliation, country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson's $\\chi^2$\ntest, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best\nrepresent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and\nat the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests that, even in\ninterdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups, coauthorship is\nprimarily driven by departmental and institutional affiliation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 17:26:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Apr 2008 23:09:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2008 15:54:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Pepe", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3864", "submitter": "Alberto Pepe Mr", "authors": "Alberto Pepe and Johan Bollen", "title": "Between conjecture and memento: shaping a collective emotional\n  perception of the future", "comments": "6 pages.
