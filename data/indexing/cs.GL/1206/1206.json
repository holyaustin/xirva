Our cherished notions of\ncomputation and information are grounded in classical mechanics, but the\nphysics underlying our world is quantum. In the early 80s researchers began to\nask how computation would change if we adopted a quantum mechanical, instead of\na classical mechanical, view of computation. Slowly, a new picture of\ncomputation arose, one that gave rise to a variety of faster algorithms, novel\ncryptographic mechanisms, and alternative methods of communication. Small\nquantum information processing devices have been built, and efforts are\nunderway to build larger ones. Even apart from the existence of these devices,\nthe quantum view on information processing has provided significant insight\ninto the nature of computation and information, and a deeper understanding of\nthe physics of our universe and its connections with computation.\n  We start by describing aspects of quantum mechanics that are at the heart of\na quantum view of information processing. We give our own idiosyncratic view of\na number of these topics in the hopes of correcting common misconceptions and\nhighlighting aspects that are often overlooked. A number of the phenomena\ndescribed were initially viewed as oddities of quantum mechanics. It was\nquantum information processing, first quantum cryptography and then, more\ndramatically, quantum computing, that turned the tables and showed that these\noddities could be put to practical effect. It is these application we describe\nnext. We conclude with a section describing some of the many questions left for\nfuture work, especially the mysteries surrounding where the power of quantum\ninformation ultimately comes from.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 22:41:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Jun 2013 21:57:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Fitzsimons", "Joseph F.", ""], ["Rieffel", "Eleanor G.", ""], ["Scarani", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4708", "submitter": "Serban Vlad E.", "authors": "Serban E.

In real time, they map an 'admissible input' function\nu:R\\rightarrow{0,1}^{m} to a set f(u) of 'possible states' x\\inf(u), where\nx:R\\rightarrow{0,1}^{m}. When f is defined by making use of a 'generator\nfunction' {\\Phi}:{0,1}^{n}\\times{0,1}^{m}\\rightarrow{0,1}^{n}, the system is\ncalled regular. The usual definition of the serial connection of systems as\ncomposition of multi-valued functions does not bring the regular systems into\nregular systems, thus the first issue in this study is to modify in an\nacceptable manner the definition of the serial connection in a way that matches\nregularity. This intention was expressed for the first time, without proving\nthe regularity of the serial connection of systems, in a previous work. Our\npresent purpose is to restate with certain corrections and prove that result.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 20:14:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Vlad", "Serban E.", ""]]}]
