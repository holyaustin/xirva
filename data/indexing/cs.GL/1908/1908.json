Today the computing is in a similar\nposition: computing is a sound success story, with exponentially growing\nutilization, but with a growing number of difficulties and unexpected issues as\nmoving towards extreme utilization conditions. In physics studying the nature\nunder extreme conditions has lead to the understanding of the relativistic and\nquantal behavior. Quite similarly in computing some phenomena, acquired in\nconnection with extreme (computing) conditions, cannot be understood based on\nof the 'classic computing paradigm'. The paper draws the attention that under\nextreme conditions qualitatively different behaviors may be encountered in both\nphysics and computing, and pinpointing that certain, formerly unnoticed or\nneglected aspects enable to explain new phenomena as well as to enhance\ncomputing features. Moreover, an idea of modern computing paradigm\nimplementation is proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2019 07:00:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2019 18:50:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 5 Jan 2020 18:03:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["V\u00e9gh", "J\u00e1nos", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.03356", "submitter": "Niall Robinson PhD", "authors": "Niall H.

Basic experiments, design and construction\nof machine-1 were all done, partly concurrently, in the remarkably short time\nof about 14 months. Shortly after the electronic G 2 of Heinz Billing in\nGoettingen it was the 7th universal computer in Germany and the 1st in the GDR.\nThe Oprema consisted of two identical machines. One machine consisted of about\n8,300 relays, 45,000 selenium rectifiers and 250 km cable. The main reason for\nthe construction of the Oprema was the computational needs of CZJ, which was\nthe leading company for optics and precision mechanics in the GDR. During its\nlifetime (1955-1963) the Oprema was applied by CZJ and a number of other\ninstitutes and companies in the GDR. The paper presents new details of the\nOprema project and of the arithmetic operations implemented in the Oprema.\nAdditionally, it covers briefly the lives of the two protagonists, W. Kaemmerer\nand H. Kortum, and draws some comparisons with other early projects, namely\nColossus, ASCC/Mark 1 and ENIAC. Finally, it discusses the question, whether\nKortum is a German computer pioneer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Aug 2019 09:19:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Winkler", "Juergen F.
