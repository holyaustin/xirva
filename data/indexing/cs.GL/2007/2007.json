The framework is\ndesigned to be global and asynchronous, interactive, and to promote browsing\nand discovery. We developed the system to be sustainable and maintainable, in\nparticular ensuring that it is open-source, easy to setup, and scalable on\nminimal hardware. In this technical report, we discuss design decisions,\nprovide technical detail, and show examples of a case study deployment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:58:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Rush", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Strobelt", "Hendrik", ""]]}]
