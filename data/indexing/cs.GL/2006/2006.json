Do\nequations of state like second Newton law in Physics exist in Computer Science?\nCan Leibniz' principle of identification by indistinguishability be formalized?\n  In the computer, there are no coordinates, no distances, and no dimensions;\nmost of traditional mathematical approaches do not work. The computer processes\nfinite binary sequences i.e. the sequences of 0 and 1. A natural question\narises: Should we continue today, as we have done for many years, to approach\nComputer Science problems by using classical mathematical apparatus such as\n'mathematical modeling'? The first who drew attention to this question and gave\ninsightful answers to it was Kolmogorov in 1960s. Kolmogorov's empirical\npostulate about existence of a program that translates 'a natural number into\nits binary record and the record into the number' formulated in 1958 represents\na hint of Kolmogorov's approach to Computer Science.\n  Following his ideas, we interpret Kolmogorov algorithm, Kolmogorov machine,\nand Kolmogorov complexity in the context of modern information technologies\nshowing that they essentially represent fundamental elements of Algorithmic\nTheory of Informatics, Kolmogorov Programmable Technology, and new Komputer\nMathematics i.e. Mathematics of computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Jun 2020 16:35:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Levashkin", "Sergei", "", "Artificial Intelligence Lab, Moscow.
