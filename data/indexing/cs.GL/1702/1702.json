We first approach the problem in its full generality explaining its\ndesired mathematical properties and applications and then we propose and study\ntwo DRL metrics. Specifically, we define DRL as a function of at least four\nproperties of data: Noisiness, Believability, Relevance, and Coherence. The\ninformation-theoretic based metrics, Cosine Similarity and Document Disparity,\nare proposed as indicators of Relevance and Coherence for a piece of data. The\nproposed metrics are validated through a text-based experiment using Twitter\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:23:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Guan", "Hui", ""], ["Gentimis", "Thanos", ""], ["Krim", "Hamid", ""], ["Keiser", "James", ""]]}]
