In addition, any specific research needs a particular\nadjustment to the generalized approach and specializing them to suit the\nproject in hand. However, unlike most well-established science disciplines,\ncomputing research is not supported by well-defined, globally accepted methods.\nThis is because of its infancy and ambiguity in its definition, on one hand,\nand its extensive coverage and overlap with other fields, on the other hand.\nThis article discusses the research methods in science and engineering in\ngeneral and in computing in particular. It shows that despite several special\nparameters that make research in computing rather unique, it still follows the\nsame steps that any other scientific research would do. The article also shows\nthe particularities that researchers need to consider when they conduct\nresearch in this field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Mar 2017 08:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 07:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hassani", "Hossein", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.07194", "submitter": "Janetta Culita", "authors": "Dan Stefanoiu, Janetta Culita", "title": "Kalman Filtering of Distributed Time Series", "comments": "7 pages, 9 figures, International Conference on Control Systems and\n  Computer Science 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper aims to introduce an application to Kalman Filtering Theory, which\nis rather unconventional. Recent experiments have shown that many natural\nphenomena, especially from ecology or meteorology, could be monitored and\npredicted more accurately when accounting their evolution over some\ngeographical area. Thus, the signals they provide are gathered together into a\ncollection of distributed time series. Despite the common sense, such time\nseries are more or less correlated each other. Instead of processing each time\nseries independently, their collection can constitute the set of measurable\nstates provided by some open system. Modeling and predicting the system states\ncan take benefit from the family of Kalman filtering algorithms. The article\ndescribes an adaptation of basic Kalman filter to the context of distributed\nsignals collections and completes with an application coming from Meteorology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 12:57:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Stefanoiu", "Dan", ""], ["Culita", "Janetta", ""]]}]
