This\nclassification will be referred to as a parametrization of the L-space: the\nL-space is the phase space in which all possible L-developments are\nrepresented. This space is infinite, because there is no halting algorithm for\nL-grammars; but it is also subjected to hard conditions, because there are\ngrammars and developments which are not possible states of an L-system: a very\nwell-known example is the space of normal grammars. Just as the space of normal\ngrammars is parametrized into Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, and\nUnrestricted (with proper containment relations holding among them; see\nChomsky, 1959: Theorem 1), we contend here that the L-space is a very rich\nlandscape of grammars which cluster into kinds that are not mutually\ntranslatable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:36:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Krivochen", "Diego", ""], ["Saddy", "Douglas", ""]]}]
