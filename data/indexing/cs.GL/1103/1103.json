From the Montague's point of view, the meaning of an idea can be\nconsidered as particular extensions in different possible worlds. In this paper\nwe analyze the minimal intensional semantic enrichment of the syntax of the FOL\nlanguage, by unification of different views: Tarskian extensional semantics of\nthe FOL, modal interpretation of quantifiers, and a derivation of the Tarskian\ntheory of truth from unified semantic theory based on a single meaning\nrelation. We show that not all modal predicate logics are intensional, and that\nan equivalent modal Kripke's interpretation of logic quantifiers in FOL results\nin a particular pure extensional modal predicate logic (as is the standard\nTarskian semantics of the FOL). This minimal intensional enrichment is obtained\nby adopting the theory of properties, relations and propositions (PRP) as the\nuniverse or domain of the FOL, composed by particulars and universals (or\nconcepts), with the two-step interpretation of the FOL that eliminates the weak\npoints of the Montague's intensional semantics. Differently from the Bealer's\nintensional FOL, we show that it is not necessary the introduction of the\nintensional abstraction in order to obtain the full intensional properties of\nthe FOL. Final result of this paper is represented by the commutative\nhomomorphic diagram that holds in each given possible world of this new\nintensional FOL, from the free algebra of the FOL syntax, toward its\nintensional algebra of concepts, and, successively, to the new extensional\nrelational algebra (different from Cylindric algebras), and we show that it\ncorresponds to the Tarski's interpretation of the standard extensional FOL in\nthis possible world.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 13:32:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Majkic", "Zoran", ""]]}]
