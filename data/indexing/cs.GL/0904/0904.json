The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a\ndiverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge\ndiffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social\nnetwork analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of\nstructural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative\nnetworks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect\nunderlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and\ncollaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise\ndisparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in\ngeneral and transformative scientific discovery in particular.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2009 23:46:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Chaomei", "", "1 and 2"], ["Chen", "Yue", ""], ["Horowitz", "Mark", ""], ["Hou", "Haiyan", ""], ["Liu", "Zeyuan", ""], ["Pellegrino", "Don", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3243", "submitter": "Manuel Oriol", "authors": "Manuel Oriol", "title": "The Business of Selling Electronic Documents", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The music industry has huge troubles adapting to the new technologies. As\nmany pointed out, when copying music is essentially free and socially accepted\nit becomes increasingly tempting for users to infringe copyrights and copy\nmusic from one person to another. The answer of the music industry is to outlaw\na majority of citizens. This article describes how the music industry should\nreinvent itself and adapt to a world where the network is ubiquitous and\nexchanging information is essentially free. It relies on adapting prices to the\ndemand and lower costs of electronic documents in a dramatic way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2009 13:00:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Oriol", "Manuel", ""]]}]
