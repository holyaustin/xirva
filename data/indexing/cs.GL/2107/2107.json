These\ncomputers did not have a central processing unit. They optimize algorithms to\nhandle elementary operations on integers -- read, write, compare, and count.\nThe approach allowed them to achieve recording run times. Computers performed\ncalculations three orders of magnitude faster than similar calculations on the\nworld's best supercomputers. The approach made it possible to obtain\nfundamentally new results, some of which have not yet been surpassed in the\naccuracy of calculations. The report will present the main ideas for the\ndevelopment of specialized computers and the scientific results obtained with\ntheir help. The lessons of planning and execution of long-term complex\nscientific projects will also be discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jul 2021 06:01:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 08:47:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Shchur", "Lev N.", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.10375", "submitter": "Shaykh Siddique", "authors": "Shaykh Siddique", "title": "The Factors of Code Reviewing Process to Ensure Software Quality", "comments": "4 pages, 1 figures.

This poses the need to count on new generations of students,\nresearchers and practitioners with a solid background in ML applied to\nnetworks. During 2020, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has\norganized the \"ITU AI/ML in 5G challenge'', an open global competition that has\nintroduced to a broad audience some of the current main challenges in ML for\nnetworks. This large-scale initiative has gathered 23 different challenges\nproposed by network operators, equipment manufacturers and academia, and has\nattracted a total of 1300+ participants from 60+ countries. This paper narrates\nour experience organizing one of the proposed challenges: the \"Graph Neural\nNetworking Challenge 2020''. We describe the problem presented to participants,\nthe tools and resources provided, some organization aspects and participation\nstatistics, an outline of the top-3 awarded solutions, and a summary with some\nlessons learned during all this journey. As a result, this challenge leaves a\ncurated set of educational resources openly available to anyone interested in\nthe topic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Su\u00e1rez-Varela", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Ferriol-Galm\u00e9s", "Miquel", ""], ["L\u00f3pez", "Albert", ""], ["Almasan", "Paul", ""], ["Bern\u00e1rdez", "Guillermo", ""], ["Pujol-Perich", "David", ""], ["Rusek", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Bonniot", "Lo\u00efck", ""], ["Neumann", "Christoph", ""], ["Schnitzler", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Ta\u00efani", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Happ", "Martin", ""], ["Maier", "Christian", ""], ["Du", "Jia Lei", ""], ["Herlich", "Matthias", ""], ["Dorfinger", "Peter", ""], ["Hainke", "Nick Vincent", ""], ["Venz", "Stefan", ""], ["Wegener", "Johannes", ""], ["Wissing", "Henrike", ""], ["Wu", "Bo", ""], ["Xiao", "Shihan", ""], ["Barlet-Ros", "Pere", ""], ["Cabellos-Aparicio", "Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.14019", "submitter": "Stephen L.
