We explore anonymization effectiveness\nat ASE 2016, OOPSLA 2016, and PLDI 2016 by asking reviewers if they can guess\nauthor identities. We find that 74%-90% of reviews contain no correct guess and\nthat reviewers who self-identify as experts on a paper's topic are more likely\nto attempt to guess, but no more likely to guess correctly. We present our\nfindings, summarize the PC chairs' comments about administering double-blind\nreview, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of revealing author identities\npart of the way through the process, and conclude by advocating for the\ncontinued use of double-blind review.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 22:08:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Goues", "Claire Le", ""], ["Brun", "Yuriy", ""], ["Apel", "Sven", ""], ["Berger", "Emery", ""], ["Khurshid", "Sarfraz", ""], ["Smaragdakis", "Yannis", ""]]}]
