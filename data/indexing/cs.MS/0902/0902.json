Two fast solving methods,\nsuitable for solving full rank systems as well as rank deficient systems, are\nstudied. Computational experiments clearly show that the best method, in terms\nof speed, accuracy, and numerical stability, is based on a special {1, 2,\n3}-inverse, whose computation reduces to a very simple generalization of the\nusual \"Cholesky factorization-backward substitution\" method for solving linear\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2009 09:51:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 09:02:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Courrieu", "Pierre", "", "LPC"]]}, {"id": "0902.3088", "submitter": "Daniel Fulger", "authors": "Daniel Fulger and Guido Germano", "title": "Automatic generation of non-uniform random variates for arbitrary\n  pointwise computable probability densities by tiling", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures, submitted to a peer-reviewed journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a rejection method based on recursive covering of the probability\ndensity function with equal tiles.

The method works unattended for probability\ndensities with discontinuities (jumps and poles). The setup time is short,\nmarginally independent of the shape of the probability density and linear in\ntable size.
