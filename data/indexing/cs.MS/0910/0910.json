This\npaper proposes the Virtual Transmission Method (VTM), which is a new\ndistributed and stationary iterative algorithm to solve the linear system\nextracted from circuit. It tears the circuit by virtual transmission lines to\nachieve distributed computing. For the symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear\nsystem, VTM is proved to be convergent. For the unsymmetrical linear system,\nnumerical experiments show that VTM is possible to achieve better convergence\nproperty than the traditional stationary algorithms. VTM could be accelerated\nby some preconditioning techniques, and the convergence speed of VTM is fast\nwhen its preconditioner is properly chosen.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 03:08:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Nov 2009 09:42:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 09:17:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 06:48:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 7 Sep 2010 23:43:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 31 Oct 2010 02:42:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 9 Dec 2010 08:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Fei", ""], ["Yang", "Huazhong", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.1845", "submitter": "N Vunka Jungum", "authors": "Mandhapati P.
