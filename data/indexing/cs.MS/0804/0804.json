The algorithm is based on a baby steps/giant steps construction\nof Krylov subspaces, and computes the determinant as the constant term of a\ncharacteristic polynomial. For matrices over an abstract field and by the\nresults of Baur and Strassen 1983, the determinant algorithm, actually a\nstraight-line program, leads to an algorithm with the same complexity for\ncomputing the adjoint of a matrix [Kaltofen 1992]. However, the latter is\nobtained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation and somehow is not\n``explicit''. We study this adjoint algorithm, show how it can be implemented\n(without resorting to an automatic transformation), and demonstrate its use on\npolynomial matrices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Apr 2008 12:37:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Villard", "Gilles", "", "LIP"]]}]
