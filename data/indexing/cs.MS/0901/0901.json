We also present timings which confirm the\nefficiency of these methods and exceed the speed of the fastest implementations\nthe authors are aware of.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jan 2009 04:43:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Boothby", "Tomas J.", ""], ["Bradshaw", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1696", "submitter": "Julien Langou", "authors": "Fred G.

The standard\ntwo dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as full format) that are\nused to represent triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half of the\nstorage space but provide high performance via the use of Level 3 BLAS.\nStandard packed format arrays fully utilize storage (array space) but provide\nlow performance as there is no Level 3 packed BLAS. We combine the good\nfeatures of packed and full storage using RFPF to obtain high performance via\nusing Level 3 BLAS as RFPF is a standard full format representation. Also, RFPF\nrequires exactly the same minimal storage as packed format. Each LAPACK full\nand/or packed triangular, symmetric, and Hermitian routine becomes a single new\nRFPF routine based on eight possible data layouts of RFPF. This new RFPF\nroutine usually consists of two calls to the corresponding LAPACK full format\nroutine and two calls to Level 3 BLAS routines. This means {\\it no} new\nsoftware is required. As examples, we present LAPACK routines for Cholesky\nfactorization, Cholesky solution and Cholesky inverse computation in RFPF to\nillustrate this new work and to describe its performance on several commonly\nused computer platforms. Performance of LAPACK full routines using RFPF versus\nLAPACK full routines using standard format for both serial and SMP parallel\nprocessing is about the same while using half the storage. Performance gains\nare roughly one to a factor of 43 for serial and one to a factor of 97 for SMP\nparallel times faster using vendor LAPACK full routines with RFPF than with\nusing vendor and/or reference packed routines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2009 01:08:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gustavson", "Fred G.", ""], ["Wasniewski", "Jerzy", ""], ["Dongarra", "Jack J.", ""], ["Langou", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.2665", "submitter": "Eric Polizzi", "authors": "Eric Polizzi", "title": "A Density Matrix-based Algorithm for Solving Eigenvalue Problems", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevB.79.115112", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new numerical algorithm for solving the symmetric eigenvalue problem is\npresented.
