Sparse PCA seeks\nsparse factors, or linear combinations of the data variables, explaining a\nmaximum amount of variance in the data while having only a limited number of\nnonzero coefficients. PCA is often used as a simple clustering technique and\nsparse factors allow us here to interpret the clusters in terms of a reduced\nset of variables. We begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse\nPCA and detail our implementation of the algorithm in d'Aspremont et al.\n(2005). We then apply these results to some classic clustering and feature\nselection problems arising in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2007 21:53:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2008 18:41:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Luss", "Ronny", ""], ["d'Aspremont", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.1490", "submitter": "Gianluca Argentini", "authors": "Gianluca Argentini", "title": "Fast computing of velocity field for flows in industrial burners and\n  pumps", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures; paper accepted for Special Issue \"Application of\n  distributed and grid computing\", Future Generation Computer Systems journal,\n  2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.MS", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this work we present a technique of fast numerical computation for\nsolutions of Navier-Stokes equations in the case of flows of industrial\ninterest.
