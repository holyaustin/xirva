OPA has recently undergone a major rewriting, migrating to\nFORTRAN95, and its adjoint code needs to be rebuilt. For earlier versions, the\nadjoint of OPA was written by hand at a high development cost. We use the\nAutomatic Differentiation tool TAPENADE to build mechanicaly the tangent and\nadjoint codes of OPA. We validate the differentiated codes by comparison with\ndivided differences, and also with an identical twin experiment. We apply\nstate-of-the-art methods to improve the performance of the adjoint code. In\nparticular we implement the Griewank and Walther's binomial checkpointing\nalgorithm which gives us an optimal trade-off between time and memory\nconsumption. We apply a specific strategy to differentiate the iterative linear\nsolver that comes from the implicit time stepping scheme\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 08:04:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 09:09:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Tber", "Moulay Hicham", "", "INRIA Sophia Antipolis"], ["Hascoet", "Laurent", "", "INRIA\n  Sophia Antipolis, SEMA"], ["Vidard", "Arthur", "", "INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / LJK Laboratoire\n  Jean Kuntzmann"], ["Dauvergne", "Benjamin", "", "INRIA Sophia Antipolis"]]}]
