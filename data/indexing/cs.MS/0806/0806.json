Our approach is based on a careful adaptation of the Algorithmic Based\nFault Tolerance technique (Huang and Abraham, 1984) to the need of parallel\ndistributed computation. We obtain a strongly scalable mechanism for fault\ntolerance. We can also detect and correct errors (bit-flip) on the fly of a\ncomputation. To assess the viability of our approach, we have developed a fault\ntolerant matrix-matrix multiplication subroutine and we propose some models to\npredict its running time. Our parallel fault-tolerant matrix-matrix\nmultiplication scores 1.4 TFLOPS on 484 processors (cluster jacquard.nersc.gov)\nand returns a correct result while one process failure has happened. This\nrepresents 65% of the machine peak efficiency and less than 12% overhead with\nrespect to the fastest failure-free implementation. We predict (and have\nobserved) that, as we increase the processor count, the overhead of the fault\ntolerance drops significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2008 02:06:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bosilca", "George", ""], ["Delmas", "Remi", ""], ["Dongarra", "Jack", ""], ["Langou", "Julien", ""]]}]
