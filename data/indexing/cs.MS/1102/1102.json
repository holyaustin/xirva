Overall, three techniques\nare applied to improve performance: vectorizing calculations, avoiding copying\ndata in memory, and minimizing operation counts. We first present the NumPy\narray structure, then show how to use it for efficient computation, and finally\nhow to share array data with other libraries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 07:25:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Van Der Walt", "Stefan", "", "Parietal"], ["Colbert", "S.

Both computing the Pfaffian and a related problem,\ncomputing the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix under unitary\ncongruence, can be solved easily once the skew-symmetric matrix has been\nreduced to skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient numerical\nmethods for computing this tridiagonal form based on Gauss transformations,\nusing a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on\nunitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens\nrotations, that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We\nalso give a complete and fully optimized implementation of these algorithms in\nFortran, and also provide Python, Matlab and Mathematica implementations for\nconvenience. Finally, we apply these methods to compute the topological charge\nof a class D nanowire, and show numerically the equivalence of definitions\nbased on the Hamiltonian and the scattering matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 21:48:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2011 14:41:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wimmer", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3774", "submitter": "Hans-Rudolf Thomann", "authors": "Hans-Rudolf Thomann", "title": "Quantum Anticipation Explorer", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum anticipation explorer is a computer program allowing the numerical\nexploration of quantum anticipation which has been analyzed in arXiv:0810.183v1\nand arXiv:1003.1090v1 for H-Atom, equidistant, random and custom spectra.
