Edges describe the flow of data between primitive\noperations which are represented by vertices. These graphs have an interface\nmade of half-edges (edges which are drawn with an unconnected end) and enjoy\nrich compositional principles by connecting graphs along these half-edges. In\nparticular, this allows equations and rewrite rules to be specified between\ngraphs. Particular computational models can then be encoded as an axiomatic set\nof such rules. Further rules can be derived graphically and rewriting can be\nused to simulate the dynamics of a computational system, e.g. evaluating a\nprogram on an input. Examples of models which can be formalised in this way\ninclude traditional electronic circuits as well as recent categorical accounts\nof quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jul 2010 03:31:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Dixon", "Lucas", "", "University of Edinburgh"], ["Duncan", "Ross", "", "University of\n  Oxford"], ["Kissinger", "Aleks", "", "University of Oxford"]]}]
