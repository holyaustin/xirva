Fine grain parallelism becomes a major\nrequirement and introduces the necessity of loose synchronization in the\nparallel execution of an operation. This paper presents an algorithm for the\nCholesky, LU and QR factorization where the operations can be represented as a\nsequence of small tasks that operate on square blocks of data. These tasks can\nbe dynamically scheduled for execution based on the dependencies among them and\non the availability of computational resources. This may result in an out of\norder execution of the tasks which will completely hide the presence of\nintrinsically sequential tasks in the factorization. Performance comparisons\nare presented with the LAPACK algorithms where parallelism can only be\nexploited at the level of the BLAS operations and vendor implementations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Sep 2007 16:32:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2007 07:14:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 Jun 2008 18:09:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Buttari", "Alfredo", ""], ["Langou", "Julien", ""], ["Kurzak", "Jakub", ""], ["Dongarra", "Jack", ""]]}]
