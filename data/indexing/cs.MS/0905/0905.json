This is\ndespite the fact that the Windows is the most popular operating system used\namong life scientists. Therefore, we introduce in this initiative\nWinBioinfTools, a toolkit containing a number of bioinformatics tools running\nunder Windows High Performance Computing Server 2008. It is an open source code\npackage, where users and developers can share and add to. We currently start\nwith three programs from the area of sequence analysis: 1) CoCoNUT for pairwise\ngenome comparison, 2) parallel BLAST for biological database search, and 3)\nparallel global pairwise sequence alignment. In this report, we focus on\ntechnical aspects concerning how some components of these tools were ported\nfrom Linux/Unix environment to run under Windows. We also show the advantages\nof using the Windows HPC Cluster 2008. We demonstrate by experiments the\nperformance gain achieved when using a computer cluster against a single\nmachine. Furthermore, we show the results of comparing the performance of\nWinBioinfTools on the Windows and Linux Cluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2009 12:04:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Abouelhoda", "Mohamed", ""], ["Mohamed", "Hisham", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4430", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Valerian Antohe", "title": "Limits of Educational Soft \"GeoGebra\" in a Critical Constructive Review", "comments": "8 pages, exposed on 5th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2009, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
