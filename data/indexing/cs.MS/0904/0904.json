HONEI abstracts the hardware, and\napplications written on top of HONEI can be executed on a wide range of\ncomputer architectures such as CPUs, GPUs and the Cell processor. We\ndemonstrate the flexibility and performance of our approach with two test\napplications, a Finite Element multigrid solver for the Poisson problem and a\nrobust and fast simulation of shallow water waves. By linking against HONEI's\nlibraries, we achieve a twofold speedup over straight forward C++ code using\nHONEI's SSE backend, and additional 3-4 and 4-16 times faster execution on the\nCell and a GPU. A second important aspect of our approach is that the full\nperformance capabilities of the hardware under consideration can be exploited\nby adding optimised application-specific operations to the HONEI libraries.\nHONEI provides all necessary infrastructure for development and evaluation of\nsuch kernels, significantly simplifying their development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 13:00:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["van Dyk", "Danny", ""], ["Geveler", "Markus", ""], ["Mallach", "Sven", ""], ["Ribbrock", "Dirk", ""], ["Goeddeke", "Dominik", ""], ["Gutwenger", "Carsten", ""]]}]
