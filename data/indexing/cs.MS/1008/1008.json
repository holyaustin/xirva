Computational fluid\ndynamics, circuit simulation, power network analysis, and material science are\njust a few examples of the application areas in which large sparse linear\nsystems need to be solved effectively. In this paper we introduce a new\nparallel hybrid sparse linear system solver for distributed memory\narchitectures that contains both direct and iterative components. We show that\nby using our solver one can alleviate the drawbacks of direct and iterative\nsolvers, achieving better scalability than with direct solvers and more\nrobustness than with classical preconditioned iterative solvers. Comparisons to\nwell-known direct and iterative solvers on a parallel architecture are\nprovided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Aug 2010 12:14:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2011 14:00:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Manguoglu", "Murat", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.2909", "submitter": "Bjoern Andres", "authors": "Bjoern Andres, Ullrich Koethe, Thorben Kroeger, and Fred A.

In this\narticle, we discuss our new implementation called Marray, a package of class\ntemplates that fills this gap. Marray is based on views as an underlying\nconcept. This concept brings some of the flexibility known from script\nlanguages such as R and MATLAB to C++.
