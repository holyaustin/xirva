For\nsufficiently large x, we associate with x^3 a cube with edges of size x, with\nx(x-1)(x-2) a parallelepiped with edges x, x-1, x-2, with 3x(x-1+x) three\nparallelepipeds of edges x, x-1, 1, and with x a parallelepiped of edges x, 1,\n1. The problem we takle is the actual construction of the cube using the given\nparallelepipeds.

Also, it is as yet unclear how the wide\nsingle instruction multiple data (SIMD) units in current multi- and many-core\nprocessors should be used most efficiently if there is no structure in the\nsparsity pattern of the matrix. We suggest SELL-C-sigma, a variant of Sliced\nELLPACK, as a SIMD-friendly data format which combines long-standing ideas from\nGeneral Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and vector computer\nprogramming. We discuss the advantages of SELL-C-sigma compared to established\nformats like Compressed Row Storage (CRS) and ELLPACK and show its suitability\non a variety of hardware platforms (Intel Sandy Bridge, Intel Xeon Phi and\nNvidia Tesla K20) for a wide range of test matrices from different application\nareas. Using appropriate performance models we develop deep insight into the\ndata transfer properties of the SELL-C-sigma spMVM kernel. SELL-C-sigma comes\nwith two tuning parameters whose performance impact across the range of test\nmatrices is studied and for which reasonable choices are proposed. This leads\nto a hardware-independent (\"catch-all\") sparse matrix format, which achieves\nvery high efficiency for all test matrices across all hardware platforms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 12:50:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 14:54:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kreutzer", "Moritz", ""], ["Hager", "Georg", ""], ["Wellein", "Gerhard", ""], ["Fehske", "Holger", ""], ["Bishop", "Alan R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.6488", "submitter": "Ian Hinder", "authors": "Marek Blazewicz (1 and 2), Ian Hinder (3), David M.

It is intended for large-scale, complex multiphysics\nengineering and scientific applications. Epetra is one of its basic packages.\nIt provides serial and parallel linear algebra capabilities. Before Trilinos\nversion 11.0, released in 2012, Epetra used the C++ int data-type for storing\nglobal and local indices for degrees of freedom (DOFs). Since int is typically\n32-bit, this limited the largest problem size to be smaller than approximately\ntwo billion DOFs. This was true even if a distributed memory machine could\nhandle larger problems. We have added optional support for C++ long long\ndata-type, which is at least 64-bit wide, for global indices. To save memory,\nmaintain the speed of memory-bound operations, and reduce further changes to\nthe code, the local indices are still 32-bit. We document the changes required\nto achieve this feature and how the new functionality can be used. We also\nreport on the lessons learned in modifying a mature and popular package from\nvarious perspectives -- design goals, backward compatibility, engineering\ndecisions, C++ language features, effects on existing users and other packages,\nand build integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 06:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Jhurani", "Chetan", ""], ["Austin", "Travis M.", ""], ["Heroux", "Michael A.", ""], ["Willenbring", "James M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7042", "submitter": "Andrzej Kapanowski", "authors": "Andrzej Kapanowski", "title": "Python for education: permutations", "comments": "26 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "The Python Papers 9, 3 (2014)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS math.HO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Python implementation of permutations is presented.
