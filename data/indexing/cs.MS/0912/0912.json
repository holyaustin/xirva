However, the development of a method, which is\nboth fast and accurate, provides modular overlaps and partitions of a\nheterogeneous network, has proven to be rather difficult. Methodology/Principal\nFindings: Here we introduce the novel concept of ModuLand, an integrative\nmethod family determining overlapping network modules as hills of an influence\nfunction-based, centrality-type community landscape, and including several\nwidely used modularization methods as special cases. As various adaptations of\nthe method family, we developed several algorithms, which provide an efficient\nanalysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine pervasively\noverlapping modules with high resolution; (2) uncover a detailed hierarchical\nnetwork structure allowing an efficient, zoom-in analysis of large networks;\n(3) allow the determination of key network nodes and (4) help to predict\nnetwork dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The concept opens a wide range of\npossibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network\nrouting, classification, comparison and prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 10:36:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2009 12:58:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 13 Mar 2010 11:44:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 3 Sep 2010 06:14:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kovacs", "Istvan A.", ""], ["Palotai", "Robin", ""], ["Szalay", "Mate S.", ""], ["Csermely", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3398", "submitter": "Thomas Gorochowski", "authors": "Thomas E.

It is the job of the supervisor to rewire\nthe network topology and alter model parameters such that a user specified\nperformance measure is minimised.
