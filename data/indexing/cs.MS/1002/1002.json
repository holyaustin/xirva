The small number of molecules reported for this system tests\nthe limits of the continuous approximation underlying differential equations.\nWe investigate the difference between continuous-deterministic and\ndiscrete-stochastic approaches. Stochastic simulation and model-checking allow\nus to formulate new hypotheses on the system behaviour, such as the presence of\nself-sustained oscillations in single cells under constant light conditions.\n  We investigate how to model the timing of dawn and dusk in the context of\nmodel-checking, which we use to compute how the probability distributions of\nkey biochemical species change over time. These show that the relative\nvariation in expression level is smallest at the time of peak expression,\nmaking peak time an optimal experimental phase marker. Building on these\nanalyses, we use approaches from evolutionary systems biology to investigate\nhow changes in the rate of mRNA degradation impacts the phase of a key protein\nlikely to affect fitness. We explore how robust this circadian clock is towards\nsuch potential mutational changes in its underlying biochemistry.
