Significantly better\ncompression results show that GenBit compress algorithm is the best among the\nremaining Genome compression algorithms for non-repetitive DNA sequences in\nGenomes. The standard Compression algorithms such as gzip or compress cannot\ncompress DNA sequences but only expand them in size. In this paper we consider\nthe problem of DNA compression. It is well known that one of the main features\nof DNA Sequences is that they contain substrings which are duplicated except\nfor a few random Mutations. For this reason most DNA compressors work by\nsearching and encoding approximate repeats. We depart from this strategy by\nsearching and encoding only exact repeats. our proposed algorithm achieves the\nbest compression ratio for DNA sequences for larger genome. As long as 8 lakh\ncharacters can be given as input While achieving the best compression ratios\nfor DNA sequences, our new GenBit Compress program significantly improves the\nrunning time of all previous DNA compressors. Assigning binary bits for\nfragments of DNA sequence is also a unique concept introduced in this program\nfor the first time in DNA compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 07:37:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Rajeswari", "P.
