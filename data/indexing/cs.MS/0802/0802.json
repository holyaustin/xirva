This has allowed to carry out Factor\nAnalysis on arrays with more than two indices. The generic rank may be seen as\nan upper bound to the number of factors that can be extracted from a given\ntensor. We explain in this short paper how to obtain numerically the generic\nrank of tensors of arbitrary dimensions, and compare it with the rare algebraic\nresults already known at order three. In particular, we examine the cases of\nsymmetric tensors, tensors with symmetric matrix slices, or tensors with free\nentries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2008 09:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Comon", "P.", ""], ["Berge", "J. ten", ""]]}]
