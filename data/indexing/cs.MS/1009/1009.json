With the advances of mobile devices\ntechnologies, mobile learning could help the government in realizing the\ninitiative. This paper discusses the prospect of implementing mobile learning\nfor primary school students. It indicates significant and challenges and\nanalysis of user perceptions on potential mobile applications through a survey\ndone in primary school context. The authors propose the m-Learning for\nmathematics by allowing the extension of technology in the traditional\nclassroom in term of learning and teaching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Sep 2010 22:33:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mahamad", "Saipunidzam", ""], ["Ibrahim", "Mohammad Noor", ""], ["Taib", "Shakirah Mohd", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.1317", "submitter": "Jean-Guillaume Dumas", "authors": "Jean-Guillaume Dumas (LJK), Thierry Gautier (INRIA Rh\\^one-Alpes / LIG\n  Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble), Cl\\'ement Pernet (INRIA\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes / LIG Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble), B.

Not since the\narrival of the Beowulf cluster, which combined open source software with\ncommodity hardware to truly democratize high-performance computing, has the\ncommunity been so electrified. Like then, the opportunity comes with\nchallenges. The formulation of scientific algorithms to take advantage of the\nperformance offered by the new architecture requires rethinking core methods.\nHere, we have tackled fast summation algorithms (fast multipole method and fast\nGauss transform), and applied algorithmic redesign for attaining performance on\ngpus. The progression of performance improvements attained illustrates the\nexercise of formulating algorithms for the massively parallel architecture of\nthe gpu. The end result has been gpu kernels that run at over 500 Gigaflops on\none nvidia Tesla C1060 card, thereby reaching close to practical peak. We can\nconfidently say that gpu computing is not just a vogue, it is truly an\nirresistible trend in high-performance computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 15:47:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2011 14:38:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cruz", "Felipe A.", ""], ["Layton", "Simon K.", ""], ["Barba", "Lorena A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4647", "submitter": "Stephen Adler", "authors": "Stephen L.
