In this paper, we show how these calculations can\nbe performed within a theorem prover or proof assistant in a convenient and\nhighly automated as well as interactive way. First, we formally establish upper\nand lower bounds for elementary functions. Then, based on these bounds, we\ndevelop a rational interval arithmetic where real number calculations take\nplace in an algebraic setting. In order to reduce the dependency effect of\ninterval arithmetic, we integrate two techniques: interval splitting and taylor\nseries expansions. This pragmatic approach has been developed, and formally\nverified, in a theorem prover. The formal development also includes a set of\ncustomizable strategies to automate proofs involving explicit calculations over\nreal numbers. Our ultimate goal is to provide guaranteed proofs of numerical\nproperties with minimal human theorem-prover interaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2007 07:14:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Daumas", "Marc", "", "LIRMM, Eliaus"], ["Lester", "David", "", "UNIVERSITY of Manchester"], ["Mu\u00f1oz", "C\u00e9sar", "", "NIA"]]}, {"id": "0708.3722", "submitter": "Marc Daumas", "authors": "Sylvie Boldo (INRIA Futurs), Marc Daumas (LIRMM, Eliaus), Ren Cang Li", "title": "Formally Verified Argument Reduction with a Fused-Multiply-Add", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.PF", "license": null, "abstract": "  Cody & Waite argument reduction technique works perfectly for reasonably\nlarge arguments but as the input grows there are no bit left to approximate the\nconstant with enough accuracy.
