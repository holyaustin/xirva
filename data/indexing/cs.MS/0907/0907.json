Thus considerations of\noptimal implementation are important. The need to have high performance and\ncomputational reproducibility is paramount. Moreover, due to the need to\ncompose multiple Kronecker products, issues related to data structures, layout\nand indexing algebra require a new look at an old problem. This paper discusses\nthe outer product/tensor product and a special case of the tensor product: the\nKronecker product, along with optimal implementation when composed, and mapped\nto complex processor/memory hierarchies. We discuss how the use of ``A\nMathematics of Arrays\" (MoA), and the psi-Calculus, (a calculus of indexing\nwith shapes), provides optimal, verifiable, reproducible, scalable, and\nportable implementations of both hardware and software.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2009 20:38:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Mullin", "Lenore M.", ""], ["Raynolds", "James E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.2557", "submitter": "Johannes Bluemlein", "authors": "J.

Notably, we achieve explicit proven reductions of all MZVs\nwith weights $w\\le22$, and all Euler sums with weights $w\\le12$, to bases whose\ndimensions, bigraded by weight and depth, have sizes in precise agreement with\nthe Broadhurst--Kreimer and Broadhurst conjectures. Moreover, we lend further\nsupport to these conjectures by studying even greater weights ($w\\le30$), using\nmodular arithmetic. To obtain these results we derive a new type of relation\nfor Euler sums, the Generalized Doubling Relations. We elucidate the \"pushdown\"\nmechanism, whereby the ornate enumeration of primitive MZVs, by weight and\ndepth, is reconciled with the far simpler enumeration of primitive Euler sums.\nThere is some evidence that this pushdown mechanism finds its origin in\ndoubling relations. We hope that our data mine, obtained by exploiting the\nunique power of the computer algebra language {\\sc form}, will enable the study\nof many more such consequences of the double-shuffle algebra of MZVs, and their\nEuler cousins, which are already the subject of keen interest, to practitioners\nof quantum field theory, and to mathematicians alike.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jul 2009 11:14:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Nov 2009 18:08:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bl\u00fcmlein", "J.", ""], ["Broadhurst", "D.
