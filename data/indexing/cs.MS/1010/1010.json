The proposed algorithm\nconstitutes an elimination method which improves upon existing approaches in a\nnumber of points. First, the amount of purely symbolic operations is\nsignificantly reduced, that is, only resultant computation and square-free\nfactorization is still needed. Second, our algorithm neither assumes generic\nposition of the input system nor demands for any change of the coordinate\nsystem. The latter is due to a novel inclusion predicate to certify that a\ncertain region is isolating for a solution. Our implementation exploits\ngraphics hardware to expedite the resultant computation. Furthermore, we\nintegrate a number of filtering techniques to improve the overall performance.\nEfficiency of the proposed method is proven by a comparison of our\nimplementation with two state-of-the-art implementations, that is, LPG and\nMaple's isolate. For a series of challenging benchmark instances, experiments\nshow that our implementation outperforms both contestants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Oct 2010 10:18:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Berberich", "Eric", ""], ["Emeliyanenko", "Pavel", ""], ["Sagraloff", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1456", "submitter": "Fangzhou  Wei", "authors": "Fangzhou Wei and Ali E.
