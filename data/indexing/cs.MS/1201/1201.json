It provides a geometric-topological analysis\nof the decomposition of the plane induced by a finite number of algebraic\ncurves in terms of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition. From a high-level\nperspective, the overall method splits into two main subroutines, namely an\nalgorithm denoted Bisolve to isolate the real solutions of a zero-dimensional\nbivariate system, and an algorithm denoted GeoTop to analyze a single algebraic\ncurve.\n  Compared to existing approaches based on elimination techniques, we\nconsiderably improve the corresponding lifting steps in both subroutines. As a\nresult, generic position of the input system is never assumed, and thus our\nalgorithm never demands for any change of coordinates. In addition, we\nsignificantly limit the types of involved exact operations, that is, we only\nuse resultant and gcd computations as purely symbolic operations. The latter\nresults are achieved by combining techniques from different fields such as\n(modular) symbolic computation, numerical analysis and algebraic geometry.\n  We have implemented our algorithms as prototypical contributions to the\nC++-project CGAL. They exploit graphics hardware to expedite the symbolic\ncomputations. We have also compared our implementation with the current\nreference implementations, that is, LGP and Maple's Isolate for polynomial\nsystem solving, and CGAL's bivariate algebraic kernel for analyses and\narrangement computations of algebraic curves. For various series of challenging\ninstances, our exhaustive experiments show that the new implementations\noutperform the existing ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Jan 2012 11:57:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Berberich", "Eric", ""], ["Emeliyanenko", "Pavel", ""], ["Kobel", "Alexander", ""], ["Sagraloff", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.3179", "submitter": "Krasimir Yordzhev", "authors": "Krasimir Yordzhev, Lilyana Totina", "title": "Matrix representation of a solution of a combinatorial problem of the\n  group theory", "comments": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Scientific Conference --\n  FMNS2011, 8 -- 11 June 2011", "journal-ref": "Mathematics and natural science, v. 1, 2011, 144-152", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS math.CO math.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An equivalence relation in the symmetric group, where is a positive integer\nhas been considered.

Our study includes theoretical aspects on the shape of these curves,\nand algorithmic results which eventually lead to an algorithm for plotting the\n\"interesting parts\" of the curve, i.e. the parts showing the main geometrical\nfeatures of it. On the theoretical side, we prove that these curves, with the\nexceptions of lines and circles, cannot be algebraic (in cartesian\ncoordinates), we characterize the existence of infinitely many\nself-intersections, and we connect this with certain phenomena which are not\npossible in the algebraic world, namely the existence of limit circles, limit\npoints, or spiral branches. On the practical side, we provide an algorithm\nwhich has been implemented in the computer algebra system Maple to visualize\nthis kind of curves.
