It is based on the methods of numerical polynomial homotopy\ncontinuation, an alternative to the classical symbolic approaches of\ncomputational algebraic geometry. We present a package, the driving idea behind\nwhich is to interlink the existing symbolic methods of Macaulay2 and the\npowerful engine of numerical approximate computations. The core procedures of\nthe package exhibit performance competitive with the other homotopy\ncontinuation software.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2009 21:17:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 May 2011 09:40:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Leykin", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.2889", "submitter": "Vladimir Karlin", "authors": "V.

The code simulates dynamics of expansion of premixed\nspherical flames using an asymptotic model of Sivashinsky type and a spectral\nnumerical algorithm. As a result, the code heavily relies on global all-to-all\ninterprocessor communications implementing transposition of the distributed\ndata array in which numerical solution to the problem is stored. This global\ndata interdependence makes interprocessor connectivity of the HPC system as\nimportant as the floating-point power of the processors of which the system is\nbuilt. Our experiments show that efficient numerical simulation of this\nparticular model, with global data interdependence, on modern HPC systems is\npossible. Prospects of performance of more sophisticated models of flame\ndynamics are analysed as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Nov 2009 17:10:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Karlin", "V.", ""]]}]
