I have implemented a library for reasoning and computing with\ncomplete metric spaces in the Coq proof assistant and used this library to\nbuild a constructive real number implementation including elementary real\nnumber functions and proofs of correctness. Using this library, I have created\na tactic that automatically proves strict inequalities over closed elementary\nreal number expressions by computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2008 18:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["O'Connor", "Russell", ""]]}]
