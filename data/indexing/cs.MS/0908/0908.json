We have\nalso developed a reference implementation of Sieve in C++ as a library of\ngeneric algorithms operating on distributed containers conforming to the Sieve\ninterface. Sieve makes instances of the incidence relation, or \\emph{arrows},\nthe conceptual first-class objects represented in the containers. Further,\ngeneric algorithms acting on this arrow container are systematically used to\nprovide natural geometric operations on the topology and also, through duality,\non the data. Finally, coverings and duality are used to encode not only\nindividual meshes, but all types of hierarchies underlying PDE data structures,\nincluding multigrid and mesh partitions.\n  In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework, we show how the mesh\npartition data can be represented and manipulated using the same fundamental\nmechanisms used to represent meshes. We present the complete description of an\nalgorithm to encode a mesh partition and then distribute a mesh, which is\nindependent of the mesh dimension, element shape, or embedding. Moreover, data\nassociated with the mesh can be similarly distributed with exactly the same\nalgorithm. The use of a high level of abstraction within the Sieve leads to\nseveral benefits in terms of code reuse, simplicity, and extensibility. We\ndiscuss these benefits and compare our approach to other existing mesh\nlibraries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 21:53:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Knepley", "Matthew G.", ""], ["Karpeev", "Dmitry A.", ""]]}]
