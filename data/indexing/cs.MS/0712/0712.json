Optimization problems are inherent in machine learning\nalgorithms and hence many methods in machine learning were inherited from the\noptimization literature. Popularly known as the initialization problem, the\nideal set of parameters required will significantly depend on the given\ninitialization values. The recently developed TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under\nSTability-reTaining Equilibria CHaracterization) methodology systematically\nexplores the subspace of the parameters to obtain a complete set of local\noptimal solutions. In this thesis work, we propose TRUST-TECH based methods for\nsolving several optimization and machine learning problems. Two stages namely,\nthe local stage and the neighborhood-search stage, are repeated alternatively\nin the solution space to achieve improvements in the quality of the solutions.\nOur methods were tested on both synthetic and real datasets and the advantages\nof using this novel framework are clearly manifested. This framework not only\nreduces the sensitivity to initialization, but also allows the flexibility for\nthe practitioners to use various global and local methods that work well for a\nparticular problem of interest. Other hierarchical stochastic algorithms like\nevolutionary algorithms and smoothing algorithms are also studied and\nframeworks for combining these methods with TRUST-TECH have been proposed and\nevaluated on several test systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Dec 2007 03:14:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Reddy", "Chandan K.", ""]]}]
