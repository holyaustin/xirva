In this\npaper, we introduce a new strategy to compute very accurate approximations of\nfeasible points. This strategy takes advantage of the Newton method for\nunder-constrained systems of equations and inequalities. More precisely, it\nexploits the optimal solution of a linear relaxation of the problem to compute\nefficiently a promising upper bound. First experiments on the Coconuts\nbenchmarks demonstrate that this approach is very effective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2008 14:18:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Goldsztejn", "Alexandre", "", "I3S"], ["Lebbah", "Yahia", "", "I3S"], ["Michel", "Claude", "", "I3S"], ["Rueher", "Michel", "", "I3S"]]}]
