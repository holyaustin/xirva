When we started using Java for\nastronomical applications around 1999 they were the first of their kind in\nastronomy. Now a great deal of astronomy software is written in Java as are\nmany business applications.\n  We discuss the current environment and trends concerning the language and\npresent an actual example of scientific use of Java for high-performance\ndistributed computing: ESA's mission Gaia. The Gaia scanning satellite will\nperform a galactic census of about 1000 million objects in our galaxy. The Gaia\ncommunity has chosen to write its processing software in Java. We explore the\nmanifold reasons for choosing Java for this large science collaboration.\n  Gaia processing is numerically complex but highly distributable, some parts\nbeing embarrassingly parallel. We describe the Gaia processing architecture and\nits realisation in Java. We delve into the astrometric solution which is the\nmost advanced and most complex part of the processing. The Gaia simulator is\nalso written in Java and is the most mature code in the system. This has been\nsuccessfully running since about 2005 on the supercomputer \"Marenostrum\" in\nBarcelona. We relate experiences of using Java on a large shared machine.\n  Finally we discuss Java, including some of its problems, for scientific\ncomputing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2011 16:24:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["O'Mullane", "William", ""], ["Luri", "Xavier", ""], ["Parsons", "Paul", ""], ["Lammers", "Uwe", ""], ["Hoar", "John", ""], ["Hernandez", "Jose", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1548", "submitter": "Zhouchen Lin", "authors": "Zhouchen Lin", "title": "Some Software Packages for Partial SVD Computation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This technical report introduces some software packages for partial SVD\ncomputation, including optimized PROPACK, modified PROPACK for computing\nsingular values above a threshold and the corresponding singular vectors, and\nblock Lanczos with warm start (BLWS).
