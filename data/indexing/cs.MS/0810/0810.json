That is,\nwe determine the sparsity t, the shift s (a rational), the exponents 0 <= e1 <\ne2 < ... < et, and the coefficients c1,...,ct in Q\\{0} such that f(x) =\nc1(x-s)^e1+c2(x-s)^e2+...+ct(x-s)^et. The computed sparsity t is absolutely\nminimal over any shifted power basis. The novelty of our algorithm is that the\ncomplexity is polynomial in the (sparse) representation size, and in particular\nis logarithmic in deg(f). Our method combines previous celebrated results on\nsparse interpolation and computing sparsest shifts, and provides a way to\nhandle polynomials with extremely high degree which are, in some sense, sparse\nin information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2008 13:35:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 00:39:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2008 18:33:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2008 04:05:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2009 06:10:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 23 Aug 2010 16:20:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Giesbrecht", "Mark", ""], ["Roche", "Daniel S.", ""]]}]
