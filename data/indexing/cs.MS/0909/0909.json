We make the optimally tuned implementations available at {\\tt\nsparselab.stanford.edu}; they run `out of the box' with no user tuning: it is\nnot necessary to select thresholds or know the likely degree of sparsity. Our\nclass of algorithms includes iterative hard and soft thresholding with or\nwithout relaxation, as well as CoSaMP, subspace pursuit and some natural\nextensions. As a result, our optimally tuned algorithms dominate such\nproposals. Our notion of optimality is defined in terms of phase transitions,\ni.e. we maximize the number of nonzeros at which the algorithm can successfully\noperate. We show that the phase transition is a well-defined quantity with our\nsuite of random underdetermined linear systems. Our tuning gives the highest\ntransition possible within each class of algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2009 22:26:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Maleki", "Arian", ""], ["Donoho", "David L.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3248", "submitter": "Juan Gerardo Alcazar Arribas", "authors": "Juan Gerardo Alcazar, Gema Maria Diaz-Toca", "title": "Topology of 2D and 3D Rational Curves", "comments": "26 pages, 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cagd.2010.07.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SC cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present algorithms for computing the topology of planar and\nspace rational curves defined by a parametrization.

The algorithm uses a GMRES iterative\nsolver with a restricted additive Schwarz method (RASM) as a preconditioner and\na fast matrix-vector algorithm. Previous fast RBF methods, --,achieving at most\nO(NlogN) complexity,--, were developed using multiquadric and polyharmonic\nbasis functions. In contrast, the present method uses Gaussians with a small\nvariance (a common choice in particle methods for fluid simulation, our main\ntarget application). The fast decay of the Gaussian basis function allows rapid\nconvergence of the iterative solver even when the subdomains in the RASM are\nvery small. The present method was implemented in parallel using the PETSc\nlibrary (developer version). Numerical experiments demonstrate its capability\nin problems of RBF interpolation with more than 50 million data points, timing\nat 106 seconds (19 iterations for an error tolerance of 10^-15 on 1024\nprocessors of a Blue Gene/L (700 MHz PowerPC processors).
