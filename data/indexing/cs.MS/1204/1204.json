Ellipsoidal harmonics are used surprisingly infrequently,\nconsidering their substantial value for problems ranging in scale from\nmolecules to the entire solar system. In this article, we suggest two possible\nreasons for the paucity relative to spherical harmonics. The first is\nessentially historical---ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th\ncentury and early 20th, when it was found that only the lowest-order harmonics\nare expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution of\nan eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged\napplications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical: even\nwith modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in\nellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those\nin Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the\n\"barrier to entry\" by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin\nusing ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research. We demonstrate our\nimplementation using the specific and physiologically crucial problem of how\ncharged proteins interact with their environment, and ask: what other\nanalytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive computation?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 21:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2012 17:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bardhan", "Jaydeep P.", ""], ["Knepley", "Matthew G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.3020", "submitter": "Andrey Grozin", "authors": "Andrey Grozin", "title": "TeXmacs-Reduce interface", "comments": "html exported from TeXmacs (alas, arXiv does not accept TeXmacs\n  files)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This tutorial (based on the talk at the TeXmacs workshop in Faro, Portugal,\nFebruary 26 - March 2, 2012) describes the new and improved Reduce plugin in\nGNU TeXmacs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 16:36:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Grozin", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.3052", "submitter": "Vasanth Raja Chittampally", "authors": "Chittampally Vasanth Raja, Srinivas Balasubramanian, Prakash S\n  Raghavendra", "title": "Heterogeneous Highly Parallel Implementation of Matrix Exponentiation\n  Using GPU", "comments": "15 pages, 12 figures, International Journal of Distributed and\n  Parallel systems (IJDPS) ISSN : 0976 - 9757 [Online] ; 2229 - 3957 [Print]", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Distributed and Parallel Systems, Vol 3,\n  No. 2, March 2012 issue", "doi": "10.5121/ijdps.2012.3209", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.MS cs.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The vision of super computer at every desk can be realized by powerful and\nhighly parallel CPUs or GPUs or APUs.

The technique is\nsignificantly more efficient and automatic than standard algorithmic\ndifferentiation techniques. The approach relies on a high-level symbolic\nrepresentation of the forward problem. In contrast to developing a model\ndirectly in Fortran or C++, high-level systems allow the developer to express\nthe variational problems to be solved in near-mathematical notation. As such,\nthese systems have a key advantage: since the mathematical structure of the\nproblem is preserved, they are more amenable to automated analysis and\nmanipulation. The framework introduced here is implemented in a freely\navailable software package named dolfin-adjoint, based on the FEniCS Project.\nOur approach to automated adjoint derivation relies on run-time annotation of\nthe temporal structure of the model, and employs the FEniCS finite element form\ncompiler to automatically generate the low-level code for the derived models.\nThe approach requires only trivial changes to a large class of forward models,\nincluding complicated time-dependent nonlinear models. The adjoint model\nautomatically employs optimal checkpointing schemes to mitigate storage\nrequirements for nonlinear models, without any user management or intervention.\nFurthermore, both the tangent linear and adjoint models naturally work in\nparallel, without any need to differentiate through calls to MPI or to parse\nOpenMP directives. The generality, applicability and efficiency of the approach\nare demonstrated with examples from a wide range of scientific applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2012 07:25:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 15:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Farrell", "Patrick E.", "", "2 and 3"], ["Ham", "David A.", "", "2 and 3"], ["Funke", "Simon F.", "", "1 and\n  3"], ["Rognes", "Marie E.", ""]]}]
