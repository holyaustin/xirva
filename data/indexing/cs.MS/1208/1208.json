While previous studies have demonstrated\nthe benefit of GPUs for n-body simulations with thousands to millions of\nbodies, Swarm-NG focuses on many few-body systems, e.g., thousands of systems\nwith 3...15 bodies each, as is typical for the study of planetary systems.\nSwarm-NG parallelizes the simulation, including both the numerical integration\nof the equations of motion and the evaluation of forces using NVIDIA's \"Compute\nUnified Device Architecture\" (CUDA) on the GPU. Swarm-NG includes optimized\nimplementations of 4th order time-symmetrized Hermite integration and mixed\nvariable symplectic integration, as well as several sample codes for other\nalgorithms to illustrate how non-CUDA-savvy users may themselves introduce\ncustomized integrators into the Swarm-NG framework. To optimize performance, we\nanalyze the effect of GPU-specific parameters on performance under double\nprecision.\n  Applications of Swarm-NG include studying the late stages of planet\nformation, testing the stability of planetary systems and evaluating the\ngoodness-of-fit between many planetary system models and observations of\nextrasolar planet host stars (e.g., radial velocity, astrometry, transit\ntiming). While Swarm-NG focuses on the parallel integration of many planetary\nsystems,the underlying integrators could be applied to a wide variety of\nproblems that require repeatedly integrating a set of ordinary differential\nequations many times using different initial conditions and/or parameter\nvalues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 13:11:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2012 00:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Dindar", "Saleh", ""], ["Ford", "Eric B.", ""], ["Juric", "Mario", ""], ["Yeo", "Young In", ""], ["Gao", "Jianwei", ""], ["Boley", "Aaron C.", ""], ["Nelson", "Benjamin", ""], ["Peters", "Jorg", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.2504", "submitter": "Benjamin Burton", "authors": "Benjamin A.
