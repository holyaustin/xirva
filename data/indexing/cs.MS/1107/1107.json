Here we describe an algorithm which not only\novercomes such problematic points, but does so in the most general of settings.\nApplications of the algorithm are highlighted through two examples: the first\nprovides verification, while the second demonstrates a non-trivial application.\nThe latter is followed by a thorough run-time analysis. While both examples\ndeal with bivariate equations, it is discussed how the algorithm may be\ngeneralized for space curves in $\\R^{3}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jul 2011 15:07:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pollack", "Steven", ""], ["Badali", "Daniel", ""], ["Pollack", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1119", "submitter": "Christoph Hertzberg", "authors": "Christoph Hertzberg, Ren\\'e Wagner, Udo Frese, Lutz Schr\\\"oder", "title": "Integrating Generic Sensor Fusion Algorithms with Sound State\n  Representations through Encapsulation of Manifolds", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Common estimation algorithms, such as least squares estimation or the Kalman\nfilter, operate on a state in a state space S that is represented as a\nreal-valued vector. However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in\n3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a\nvector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For\nintegrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.\n  Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of\nthe manifold S is encapsulated by two operators, state displacement [+]:S x R^n\n--> S and its inverse [-]: S x S --> R^n. These operators provide a local\nvector-space view \\delta; --> x [+] \\delta; around a given state x. Generic\nestimation algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing +/-\nwith [+]/[-] where appropriate. We analyze these operators axiomatically, and\ndemonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the Unscented Kalman\nFilter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software\nengineering perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the [+]/[-] operators\nmediate between a \"flat-vector\" view for the generic algorithm and a\n\"named-members\" view for the problem specific functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2011 13:04:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hertzberg", "Christoph", ""], ["Wagner", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Frese", "Udo", ""], ["Schr\u00f6der", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3212", "submitter": "Josef Urban", "authors": "Jesse Alama, Michael Kohlhase, Adam Naumowicz, Piotr Rudnicki, Josef\n  Urban and Lionel Mamane", "title": "Licensing the Mizar Mathematical Library", "comments": "To appear in The Conference of Intelligent Computer Mathematics: CICM\n  2011", "journal-ref": "Intelligent Computer Mathematics 2011, LNCS 6824, pp. 133-148", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-22673-1_10", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) is a large corpus of formalised\nmathematical knowledge.
