The problem has motivated great and constantly growing\nnumber of investigations and generalizations. To prove the conjecture, we use\nalgebra with non-standard operations on a special class of matrices (row\nmonomial), induced by words in the alphabet of labels on edges. These matrices\ngenerate a space with respect to the mentioned operation. The proof is based on\nconnection between length of words u and dimension of the space generated by\nsolutions Lx of matrix equation MuLx =Ms for synchronizing word s, as well as\non the relation between ranks of Mu and Lx.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 May 2014 13:59:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Sat, 21 Oct 2017 06:26:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sun, 18 Jul 2021 14:02:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 11:05:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 07:17:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 08:31:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 6 May 2017 10:13:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 05:59:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:23:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 07:32:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Mon, 9 Oct 2017 09:11:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Trahtman", "A.

In this paper, we study new models\nfor optimizing fare inspection strategies in transit networks based on bilevel\nprogramming. In the first level, the leader (the network operator) determines\nprobabilities for inspecting passengers at different locations, while in the\nsecond level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing\ntheir routes given the inspection probabilities and travel times. To model the\nfollowers' behavior we study both a non-adaptive variant, in which passengers\nselect a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an\nadaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to\nupdate their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own\nright, we design exact and approximation algorithms and we prove a tight bound\nof 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and non-adaptive\nstrategies. For the leader's optimization problem, we study a fixed-fare and a\nflexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the\noperator's will. For the latter variant, we design an LP based approximation\nalgorithm. Finally, using a local search procedure that shifts inspection\nprobabilities within an initially determined support set, we perform an\nextensive computational study for all variants of the problem on instances of\nthe Dutch railway and the Amsterdam subway network.
