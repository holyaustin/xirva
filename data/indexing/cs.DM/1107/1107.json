Almost all these applications\nneed bipartite graphs of the order of tens of thousands in practice, whose\nnodes represent parallel computations. To reduce its implementation cost,\nreducing amount of system/hardware resources during design is an important\nengineering objective. In this context, we present a scheme to reduce resource\nutilization when performing computations derived from PG-based graphs. In a\nfully parallel design based on PG concepts, the number of processing units is\nequal to the number of vertices, each performing an atomic computation. To\nreduce the number of processing units used for implementation, we present an\neasy way of partitioning the vertex set. Each block of partition is then\nassigned to a processing unit. A processing unit performs the computations\ncorresponding to the vertices in the block assigned to it in a sequential\nfashion, thus creating the effect of folding the overall computation. These\nblocks have certain symmetric properties that enable us to develop a\nconflict-free schedule. The scheme achieves the best possible throughput, in\nlack of any overhead of shuffling data across memories while scheduling another\ncomputation on the same processing unit. This paper reports two folding\nschemes, which are based on same lattice embedding approach, based on\npartitioning.
