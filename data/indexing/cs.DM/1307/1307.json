Modeling the tunnel\nchannels is very important to design and evaluate the performance of CBTC\nsystems. Most of existing works on channel modeling do not consider the unique\ncharacteristics in CBTC systems, such as high mobility speed, deterministic\nmoving direction, and accurate train location information.

Unlike most\nexisting channel models, which are not related to specific locations, the\nproposed FSMC channel model takes train locations into account to have a more\naccurate channel model. The distance between the transmitter and the receiver\nis divided into intervals, and an FSMC model is applied in each interval. The\naccuracy of the proposed FSMC model is illustrated by the simulation results\ngenerated from the model and the real field measurement results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 04:18:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Hongwei", ""], ["Yu", "F.
