There, the goal for nodes (hosts with IP addresses) is to discover the\nIP addresses of all other hosts. In social networks, nodes (people) discover\nnew nodes through exchanging contacts with their neighbors (friends). In both\ncases the discovery of new nodes changes the underlying network - new edges are\nadded to the network - and the process continues in the changed network.\nRigorously analyzing such dynamic (stochastic) processes with a continuously\nself-changing topology remains a challenging problem with obvious applications.\n  This paper studies and analyzes two natural gossip-based discovery processes.\nIn the push process, each node repeatedly chooses two random neighbors and puts\nthem in contact (i.e., \"pushes\" their mutual information to each other). In the\npull discovery process, each node repeatedly requests or \"pulls\" a random\ncontact from a random neighbor. Both processes are lightweight, local, and\nnaturally robust due to their randomization.\n  Our main result is an almost-tight analysis of the time taken for these two\nrandomized processes to converge. We show that in any undirected n-node graph\nboth processes take O(n log^2 n) rounds to connect every node to all other\nnodes with high probability, whereas Omega(n log n) is a lower bound.

In our first contribution, we establish a relation between\nthe cover times of a pair of graphs, and the cover time of their Cartesian\nproduct. This extends previous work on special cases of the Cartesian product,\nin particular, the square of a graph.

For this problem, and\nvariants such as the Uniform Sparsest Cut problem where the goal is to minimize\nthe fraction of pairs on opposite sides of the cut that are connected by an\nedge, there are large gaps between the known approximation algorithms and\nnon-approximability results. While no constant factor approximation algorithms\nare known, even APX-hardness is not known either.\n  In this work we prove that for balanced separator and uniform sparsest cut,\nsemidefinite programs from the Lasserre hierarchy (which are the most powerful\nrelaxations studied in the literature) have an integrality gap bounded away\nfrom $1$, even for $\\Omega(n)$ levels of the hierarchy. This complements recent\nalgorithmic results in Guruswami and Sinop (2011) which used the Lasserre\nhierarchy to give an approximation scheme for these problems (with runtime\ndepending on the spectrum of the graph).
