The new algorithm is based on a\nnovel technique of eliminating difficult subgraphs via half-edges, a new method\nof edge coloring and a technique of exchanging edges. A half-edge of edge\n$e=(u,v)$ is informally speaking \"a half of $e$ containing either $u$ or $v$\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 07:34:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Mar 2016 22:10:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Dudycz", "Szymon", ""], ["Marcinkowski", "Jan", ""], ["Paluch", "Katarzyna", ""], ["Rybicki", "Bartosz", ""]]}]
