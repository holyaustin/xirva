Apart from conventional\nclustering techniques, biclustering is searching for homogeneous groups of\nobjects while keeping their common description, e.g., in binary setting, their\nshared attributes. In bioinformatics, biclustering is used to find genes, which\nare active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers.\nHowever, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene\nexpression analysis, may overlook the existing methods. For instance, BiMax\nalgorithm is aimed at finding biclusters, which are well-known for decades as\nformal concepts. Moreover, even if bioinformatics classify the biclustering\nmethods according to reasonable domain-driven criteria, their classification\ntaxonomies may be different from survey to survey and not full as well. So, in\nthis paper we propose to use concept lattices as a tool for taxonomy building\n(in the biclustering domain) and attribute exploration as means for\ncross-domain taxonomy completion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 15:12:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ignatov", "Dmitry I.", ""], ["Watson", "Bruce W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.05412", "submitter": "Ioannis Lamprou", "authors": "Ioannis Lamprou, Russell Martin, Paul Spirakis", "title": "Cover Time in Edge-Uniform Stochastically-Evolving Graphs", "comments": "removed a few erroneous proofs, refreshed related work and\n  experimental results", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We define a general model of stochastically-evolving graphs, namely the\n\\emph{Edge-Uniform Stochastically-Evolving Graphs}.

The stochastic rule is identical for each possible\nedge and may depend on the past $k \\ge 0$ observations of the edge's state. We\nexamine two kinds of random walks for a single agent taking place in such a\ndynamic graph: (i) The \\emph{Random Walk with a Delay} (\\emph{RWD}), where at\neach step the agent chooses (uniformly at random) an incident possible edge,\ni.e., an incident edge in the underlying static graph, and then it waits till\nthe edge becomes alive to traverse it. (ii) The more natural \\emph{Random Walk\non what is Available} (\\emph{RWA}) where the agent only looks at alive incident\nedges at each time step and traverses one of them uniformly at random. Our\nstudy is on bounding the \\emph{cover time}, i.e., the expected time until each\nnode is visited at least once by the agent. For \\emph{RWD}, we provide a first\nupper bound for the cases $k = 0, 1$ by correlating \\emph{RWD} with a simple\nrandom walk on a static graph.
