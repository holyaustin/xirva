In 1983, G.

However, the determination of the\nmaximizing arrangement for the semi-regular continuant turned out to be more\ndifficult. He showed that if $|A|=2$ then the maximizing arrangement is unique\n(up to reversal) and depends only on the partition $P$ and not on the values of\nthe $a_i$. He further conjectured that this should be true for general $A$ with\n$|A|\\geq 2.$ In this paper we confirm Ramharter's conjecture for sets $A$ with\n$|A|=3$ and give an algorithmic procedure for constructing the maximizing\narrangement.

While feature selection is\none of the most common approaches to reduce dimensionality in practice, most of\nthe known feature selection methods are heuristics. We study the following\nmathematical model. We assume that there are some inadvertent (or undesirable)\nfeatures of the input data that unnecessarily increase the cost of clustering.\nConsequently, we want to select a subset of the original features from the data\nsuch that there is a small-cost clustering on the selected features. More\nprecisely, for given integers $\\ell$ (the number of irrelevant features) and\n$k$ (the number of clusters), budget $B$, and a set of $n$ categorical data\npoints (represented by $m$-dimensional vectors whose elements belong to a\nfinite set of values $\\Sigma$), we want to select $m-\\ell$ relevant features\nsuch that the cost of any optimal $k$-clustering on these features does not\nexceed $B$. Here the cost of a cluster is the sum of Hamming distances\n($\\ell_0$-distances) between the selected features of the elements of the\ncluster and its center. The clustering cost is the total sum of the costs of\nthe clusters.

In this paper we are interested in\nunderstanding the structure of satisfiable and unsatisfiable sentences. In\nprevious work we initiated a new approach to SAT by formulating a mapping from\npropositional logic sentences to graphs, allowing us to find structural\nobstructions to 2SAT (clauses with exactly 2 literals) in terms of graphs. Here\nwe generalize these ideas to multi-hypergraphs in which the edges can have more\nthan 2 vertices and can have multiplicity. This is needed for understanding the\nstructure of SAT for sentences made of clauses with 3 or more literals (3SAT),\nwhich is a building block of NP-completeness theory. We introduce a decision\nproblem that we call GraphSAT, as a first step towards a structural view of\nSAT. Each propositional logic sentence can be mapped to a multi-hypergraph by\nassociating each variable with a vertex (ignoring the negations) and each\nclause with a hyperedge. Such a graph then becomes a representative of a\ncollection of possible sentences and we can then formulate the notion of\nsatisfiability of such a graph. With this coarse representation of classes of\nsentences one can then investigate structural obstructions to SAT. To make the\nproblem tractable, we prove a local graph rewriting theorem which allows us to\nsimplify the neighborhood of a vertex without knowing the rest of the graph. We\nuse this to deduce several reduction rules, allowing us to modify a graph\nwithout changing its satisfiability status which can then be used in a program\nto simplify graphs. We study a subclass of 3SAT by examining sentences living\non triangulations of surfaces and show that for any compact surface there\nexists a triangulation that can support unsatisfiable sentences, giving\nspecific examples of such triangulations for various surfaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 May 2021 16:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Karve", "Vaibhav", ""], ["Hirani", "Anil N.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.11799", "submitter": "Tony Huynh", "authors": "Tony Huynh and O-joung Kwon", "title": "On the Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property for long holes in $C_4$-free graphs", "comments": "19 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove that there exists a function $f(k)=\\mathcal{O}(k^2 \\log k)$ such\nthat for every $C_4$-free graph $G$ and every $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $G$ either\ncontains $k$ vertex-disjoint holes of length at least $6$, or a set $X$ of at\nmost $f(k)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has no hole of length at least $6$.

Because of the rapid expansion of\nmultiprocessor systems, the importance of fault diagnosis is becoming\nincreasingly prominent. The $h$-component diagnosability of $G$, denoted by\n$ct_{h}(G)$, is the maximum number of nodes of the faulty set $F$ that is\ncorrectly identified in a system, and the number of components in $G-F$ is at\nleast $h$. In this paper, we determine the $(h+1)$-component diagnosability of\ngeneral networks under the PMC model and MM$^{*}$ model. As applications, the\ncomponent diagnosability is explored for some well-known networks, including\ncomplete cubic networks, hierarchical cubic networks, generalized exchanged\nhypercubes, dual-cube-like networks, hierarchical hypercubes, Cayley graphs\ngenerated by transposition trees (except star graphs), and DQcube as well.\nFurthermore, we provide some comparison results between the component\ndiagnosability and other fault diagnosabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2021 13:06:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhuang", "Hongbin", ""], ["Guo", "Wenzhong", ""], ["Li", "Xiaoyan", ""], ["Liu", "Ximeng", ""], ["Lin", "Cheng-Kuan", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.12003", "submitter": "Hendrik Molter", "authors": "Nicolas Maack and Hendrik Molter and Rolf Niedermeier and Malte Renken", "title": "On Finding Separators in Temporal Split and Permutation Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Removing all connections between two vertices s and z in a graph by removing\na minimum number of vertices is a fundamental problem in algorithmic graph\ntheory.

It is\nused extensively in practice. In congestion (or potential) games, the dynamics\nconverges to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy\nprofiles, when interpreted as a Markov chain. In general, logit dynamics might\nconverge slowly to the Gibbs distribution, but beyond that, not much is known\nabout their algorithmic aspects, nor that of the Gibbs distribution. In this\nwork, we are interested in the following two questions for congestion games: i)\nIs there an efficient algorithm for sampling from the Gibbs distribution? ii)\nIf yes, do there also exist natural randomized dynamics that converges quickly\nto the Gibbs distribution?\n  We first study these questions in extension parallel congestion games, a\nwell-studied special case of symmetric network congestion games. As our main\nresult, we show that there is a simple variation on the logit dynamics (in\nwhich we in addition are allowed to randomly interchange the strategies of two\nplayers) that converges quickly to the Gibbs distribution in such games. This\nanswers both questions above affirmatively. We also address the first question\nfor the class of so-called capacitated $k$-uniform congestion games.\n  To prove our results, we rely on the recent breakthrough work of Anari, Liu,\nOveis-Gharan and Vinzant (2019) concerning the approximate sampling of the base\nof a matroid according to strongly log-concave probability distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 08:00:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kleer", "Pieter", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.13055", "submitter": "Hendrik Molter", "authors": "Maciej Rymar and Hendrik Molter and Andr\\'e Nichterlein and Rolf\n  Niedermeier", "title": "Towards Classifying the Polynomial-Time Solvability of Temporal\n  Betweenness Centrality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In static graphs, the betweenness centrality of a graph vertex measures how\nmany times this vertex is part of a shortest path between any two graph\nvertices.
