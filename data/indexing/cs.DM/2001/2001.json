In this paper, we provide constructive characterizations for five\nprinciple classes of radials and semiradials to be used for characterizing\ngeneral radials and semiradials. A bidirected graph is a graph in which each\nend of each edge has a sign $+$ or $-$. Bidirected graphs are a common\ngeneralization of digraphs and signed graphs. We define a new concept of\nradials as a generalization of a classical concept in matching theory, critical\ngraphs. Radials are also a generalization of a class of digraphs known as\nflowgraphs. We also define semiradials, which are a relaxed concept of radials.\nWe further define special classes of radials and semiradials, that is, absolute\nsemiradials, strong and almost strong radials, linear semiradials, and\nsublinear radials. We provide constructive characterizations for these five\nclasses of bidirected graphs. Our serial papers are a part of a series of works\nthat establish the strong component decomposition for bidirected graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 21:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kita", "Nanao", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.00257", "submitter": "Pattara Sukprasert", "authors": "Parinya Chalermsook, Samir Khuller, Pattara Sukprasert, Sumedha Uniyal", "title": "Multi-transversals for Triangles and the Tuza's Conjecture", "comments": "Accepted at SODA'20", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study a primal and dual relationship about triangles: For\nany graph $G$, let $\\nu(G)$ be the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in\n$G$, and $\\tau(G)$ be the minimum subset $F$ of edges such that $G \\setminus F$\nis triangle-free.

Despite these efforts, the conjecture in general graphs has remained\nwide open for almost four decades.\n  In this paper, we provide a proof of a non-trivial consequence of the\nconjecture; that is, for every $k \\geq 2$, there exist a (multi)-set $F\n\\subseteq E(G): |F| \\leq 2k \\nu(G)$ such that each triangle in $G$ overlaps at\nleast $k$ elements in $F$.

While graphs are a standard model for pairwise\nrelationships, hypergraphs provide the flexibility to model multi-way\nrelationships, and are now a standard model for complex data and systems.\nHowever, when generalizing from graphs to hypergraphs, the notion of a \"cut\nhyperedge\" is less clear, as a hyperedge's nodes can be split in several ways.\nHere, we develop a framework for hypergraph cuts by considering the problem of\nseparating two terminal nodes in a hypergraph in a way that minimizes a sum of\npenalties at split hyperedges. In our setup, different ways of splitting the\nsame hyperedge have different penalties, and the penalty is encoded by what we\ncall a splitting function.\n  Our framework opens a rich space on the foundations of hypergraph cuts. We\nfirst identify a natural class of cardinality-based hyperedge splitting\nfunctions that depend only on the number of nodes on each side of the split. In\nthis case, we show that the general hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problem can be\nreduced to a tractable graph $s$-$t$ cut problem if and only if the splitting\nfunctions are submodular. We also identify a wide regime of non-submodular\nsplitting functions for which the problem is NP-hard. We also analyze\nextensions to multiway cuts with at least three terminal nodes and identify a\nnatural class of splitting functions for which the problem can be reduced in an\napproximation-preserving way to the node-weighted multiway cut problem in\ngraphs, again subject to a submodularity property.

We present a\ntheoretical framework for formulating this problem and provide new techniques\nfor finding sampling algorithms that are optimal both statistically (in the\nsense of sampling accuracy) and information-theoretically (in the sense of\nentropy consumption). We leverage these results to build a system that, for a\nbroad family of measures of statistical accuracy, delivers a sampling algorithm\nwhose expected entropy usage is minimal among those that induce the same\ndistribution (i.e., is \"entropy-optimal\") and whose output distribution\n$(\\hat{p}_1, \\dots, \\hat{p}_n)$ is a closest approximation to the target\ndistribution $(p_1, \\dots, p_n)$ among all entropy-optimal sampling algorithms\nthat operate within the specified $k$-bit precision. This optimal approximate\nsampler is also a closer approximation than any (possibly entropy-suboptimal)\nsampler that consumes a bounded amount of entropy with the specified precision,\na class which includes floating-point implementations of inversion sampling and\nrelated methods found in many software libraries. We evaluate the accuracy,\nentropy consumption, precision requirements, and wall-clock runtime of our\noptimal approximate sampling algorithms on a broad set of distributions,\ndemonstrating the ways that they are superior to existing approximate samplers\nand establishing that they often consume significantly fewer resources than are\nneeded by exact samplers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 22:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Feras A.", ""], ["Freer", "Cameron E.", ""], ["Rinard", "Martin C.", ""], ["Mansinghka", "Vikash K.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04814", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Bruno Chagas (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais), Renato Portugal\n  (National Laboratory of Scientific Computing - LNCC)", "title": "Discrete-Time Quantum Walks on Oriented Graphs", "comments": "In Proceedings QSQW 2020, arXiv:2004.01061", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 315, 2020, pp. 26-37", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.315.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The interest in quantum walks has been steadily increasing during the last\ntwo decades.

We provide an algorithm generating the\n$2$-binomial equivalence class of a word. For $k \\geq 2$ and alphabet of $3$ or\nmore symbols, the language made of lexicographically least elements of every\n$k$-binomial equivalence class and the language of singletons, i.e., the words\nwhose $k$-binomial equivalence class is restricted to a single element, are\nshown to be non context-free. As a consequence of our discussions, we also\nprove that the submonoid generated by the generators of the free nil-$2$ group\non $m$ generators is isomorphic to the quotient of the free monoid $\\{ 1,\n\\ldots , m\\}^{*}$ by the $2$-binomial equivalence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:27:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lejeune", "Marie", ""], ["Rigo", "Michel", ""], ["Rosenfeld", "Matthieu", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11763", "submitter": "Lucas Mol", "authors": "Lucas Mol and Narad Rampersad", "title": "Lengths of extremal square-free ternary words", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A square-free word $w$ over a fixed alphabet $\\Sigma$ is extremal if every\nword obtained from $w$ by inserting a single letter from $\\Sigma$ (at any\nposition) contains a square.

In 2011, these searches were verified by D.\nRoy using an optimized C program and 16,000 hours on a cluster of desktop\nmachines. We performed a verification of these searches by reducing the problem\nto the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Our verification uses the\ncube-and-conquer SAT solving paradigm, symmetry breaking techniques using the\ncomputer algebra system Maple, and a result of Carter that there are ten\nnonisomorphic cases to check.
