To study\ntheir efficiency and compare it to one of the deterministic solutions, one is\nled to compute certain quantities, namely the hitting times and the cover time.\nUntil now, only bounds on these quantities were defined. First, this paper\npresents two generalizations of the notions of hitting and cover times to\nweighted graphs. Indeed, the properties of random walks on symmetrically\nweighted graphs provide interesting results on random walk based distributed\nalgorithms, such as local load balancing. Both of these generalization are\nproposed to precisely represent the behaviour of these algorithms, and to take\ninto account what the weights represent. Then, we propose an algorithm to\ncompute the n^2 hitting times on a weighted graph of n vertices, which we\nimprove to obtain a O(n^3) complexity. This complexity is the lowest up to now.\nThis algorithm computes both of the generalizations that we propose for the\nhitting times on a weighted graph. Finally, we provide the first algorithm to\ncompute the cover time (in both senses) of a graph. We improve it to achieve a\ncomplexity of O(n^3 2^n). The algorithms that we present are all robust to a\ntopological change in a limited number of edges. This property allows us to use\nthem on dynamic graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jul 2008 10:10:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bui", "Alain", ""], ["Sohier", "Devan", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3699", "submitter": "Francisco Arguello", "authors": "Francisco Arguello", "title": "Multiplication in Cyclotomic Rings and its Application to Finite Fields", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A representation of finite fields that has proved useful when implementing\nfinite field arithmetic in hardware is based on an isomorphism between subrings\nand fields.
