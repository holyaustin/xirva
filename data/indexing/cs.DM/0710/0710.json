A fraction of\nthe nodes denoted as L-nodes are assumed to have localization information while\nthe rest of the nodes denoted as NL nodes do not. The basic model assumes each\nnode has a certain radio coverage within which it can make relative distance\nmeasurements. We model both the case radio coverage is fixed and the case radio\ncoverage is determined by signal strength measurements in a Log-Normal\nShadowing environment. We apply the probabilistic method to determine the\nprobability of NL-node localization as a function of the coverage area to\ndomain area ratio and the density of L-nodes. We establish analytical\nexpressions for this probability and the transition thresholds with respect to\nkey parameters whereby marked change in the probability behavior is observed.\nThe theoretical results presented in the article are supported by simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Oct 2007 16:13:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Daneshgaran", "F.", ""], ["Laddomada", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Mondin", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5338", "submitter": "Toshiya Itoh", "authors": "Toshiya Itoh and Osamu Watanabe", "title": "Weighted Random Popular Matchings", "comments": "13 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Random Structures and Algorithms, 37(4), pp.477-494, 2010", "doi": "10.1002/rsa.20316", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC", "license": null, "abstract": "  For a set A of n applicants and a set I of m items, we consider a problem of\ncomputing a matching of applicants to items, i.e., a function M mapping A to I;\nhere we assume that each applicant $x \\in A$ provides a preference list on\nitems in I. We say that an applicant $x \\in A$ prefers an item p than an item q\nif p is located at a higher position than q in its preference list, and we say\nthat x prefers a matching M over a matching M' if x prefers M(x) over M'(x).\nFor a given matching problem A, I, and preference lists, we say that M is more\npopular than M' if the number of applicants preferring M over M' is larger than\nthat of applicants preferring M' over M, and M is called a popular matching if\nthere is no other matching that is more popular than M. Here we consider the\nsituation that A is partitioned into $A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{k}$, and that each\n$A_{i}$ is assigned a weight $w_{i}>0$ such that w_{1}>w_{2}>...>w_{k}>0$.
