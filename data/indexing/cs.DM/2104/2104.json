Yet subgraph\nmatching problem remains to be an NP-complete problem. This study proposes an\nend-to-end learning-based approximate method for subgraph matching task, called\nsubgraph matching network (Sub-GMN). The proposed Sub-GMN firstly uses graph\nrepresentation learning to map nodes to node-level embedding. It then combines\nmetric learning and attention mechanisms to model the relationship between\nmatched nodes in the data graph and query graph. To test the performance of the\nproposed method, we applied our method on two databases. We used two existing\nmethods, GNN and FGNN as baseline for comparison. Our experiment shows that, on\ndataset 1, on average the accuracy of Sub-GMN are 12.21\\% and 3.2\\% higher than\nthat of GNN and FGNN respectively. On average running time Sub-GMN runs 20-40\ntimes faster than FGNN. In addition, the average F1-score of Sub-GMN on all\nexperiments with dataset 2 reached 0.95, which demonstrates that Sub-GMN\noutputs more correct node-to-node matches.\n  Comparing with the previous GNNs-based methods for subgraph matching task,\nour proposed Sub-GMN allows varying query and data graphes in the\ntest/application stage, while most previous GNNs-based methods can only find a\nmatched subgraph in the data graph during the test/application for the same\nquery graph used in the training stage. Another advantage of our proposed\nSub-GMN is that it can output a list of node-to-node matches, while most\nexisting end-to-end GNNs based methods cannot provide the matched node pairs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 01:31:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2021 11:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lan", "Zixun", ""], ["Yu", "Limin", ""], ["Yuan", "Linglong", ""], ["Wu", "Zili", ""], ["Niu", "Qiang", ""], ["Ma", "Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.00292", "submitter": "Maurice Pouzet", "authors": "Lucien Haddad, Masahiro Miyakawa, Maurice Pouzet, Hisayuki Tatsumi", "title": "Hereditary rigidity, separation and density In memory of Professor I.G.\n  Rosenberg", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ISMVL 2021, May 2021, Nursultan, Kazakhstan", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We continue the investigation of systems of hereditarily rigid relations\nstarted in Couceiro, Haddad, Pouzet and Sch\\\"olzel [1].

The task is to partition A into k clusters such that the\nmedian objective of the clustering in the Hamming norm is at most B. That is,\nwe seek a partition {I_1,\\ldots,I_k} of {1,\\ldots,n} and vectors\nc_1,\\ldots,c_k\\in\\Sigma^m such that \\sum_{i=1}^k\\sum_{j\\in I_i}d_h(c_i,a_j)\\leq\nB, where d_H(a,b) is the Hamming distance between vectors a and b. Fomin,\nGolovach, and Panolan [ICALP 2018] proved that the problem is fixed-parameter\ntractable (for binary case \\Sigma={0,1}) by giving an algorithm that solves the\nproblem in time 2^{O(B\\log B)} (mn)^{O(1)}. We extend this algorithmic result\nto a popular capacitated clustering model, where in addition the sizes of the\nclusters should satisfy certain constraints. More precisely, in Capacitated\nClustering, in addition, we are given two non-negative integers p and q, and\nseek a clustering with p\\leq |I_i|\\leq q for all i\\in{1,\\ldots,k}. Our main\ntheorem is that Capacitated Clustering is solvable in time 2^{O(B\\log\nB)}|\\Sigma|^B(mn)^{O(1)}. The theorem not only extends the previous algorithmic\nresults to a significantly more general model, it also implies algorithms for\nseveral other variants of Categorical Clustering with constraints on cluster\nsizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:49:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Fomin", "Fedor V.", ""], ["Golovach", "Petr A.", ""], ["Purohit", "Nidhi", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.08003", "submitter": "Florent Foucaud", "authors": "Florent Foucaud, Herv\\'e Hocquard, Dimitri Lajou", "title": "Complexity and algorithms for injective edge-coloring in graphs", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Information Processing Letters 170:106121, 2021", "doi": "10.1016/j.ipl.2021.106121", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An injective $k$-edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an assignment of colors,\ni.e. integers in $\\{1, \\ldots , k\\}$, to the edges of $G$ such that any two\nedges each incident with one distinct endpoint of a third edge, receive\ndistinct colors.

The tree\ndistance can be computed in polynomial time with standard methods from convex\noptimization. It is based on the notion of fractional isomorphism, a\ncharacterization based on a natural system of linear equations whose integer\nsolutions correspond to graph isomorphism. By results of Tinhofer (1986, 1991)\nand Dvo\\v{r}\\'ak (2010), two graphs G and H are fractionally isomorphic if and\nonly if, for every tree T, the number of homomorphisms from T to G equals the\ncorresponding number from T to H, which means that the tree distance of G and H\nis zero. Our main result is that this correspondence between the equivalence\nrelations \"fractional isomorphism\" and \"equal tree homomorphism densities\" can\nbe extended to a correspondence between the associated distance measures. Our\nresult is inspired by a similar result due to Lov\\'asz and Szegedy (2006) and\nBorgs, Chayes, Lov\\'asz, S\\'os, and Vesztergombi (2008) that connects the cut\ndistance of graphs to their homomorphism densities (over all graphs), which is\na fundamental theorem in the theory of graph limits. We also introduce the path\ndistance of graphs and take the corresponding result of Dell, Grohe, and Rattan\n(2018) for exact path homomorphism counts to an approximate level. Our results\nanswer an open question of Grohe (2020).\n  We establish our main results by generalizing our definitions to graphons as\nthis allows us to apply techniques from functional analysis. We prove the\nfairly general statement that, for every \"reasonably\" defined graphon\npseudometric, an exact correspondence to homomorphism densities can be turned\ninto an approximate one. We also provide an example of a distance measure that\nviolates this reasonableness condition.
