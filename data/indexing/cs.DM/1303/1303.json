A convex cut of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a\n$2$-partition $V_1 \\dot{\\cup} V_2=V$ such that both $V_1$ and $V_2$ are convex,\n\\ie shortest paths between vertices in $V_i$ never leave $V_i$, $i \\in \\{1,\n2\\}$. Finding convex cuts is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard for general graphs. To\ncharacterize convex cuts, we employ the Djokovic relation, a reflexive and\nsymmetric relation on the edges of a graph that is based on shortest paths\nbetween the edges' end vertices.\n  It is known for a long time that, if $G$ is bipartite and the Djokovic\nrelation is transitive on $G$, \\ie $G$ is a partial cube, then the cut-sets of\n$G$'s convex cuts are precisely the equivalence classes of the Djokovic\nrelation. In particular, any edge of $G$ is contained in the cut-set of exactly\none convex cut. We first characterize a class of plane graphs that we call {\\em\nwell-arranged}. These graphs are not necessarily partial cubes, but any edge of\na well-arranged graph is contained in the cut-set(s) of at least one convex\ncut. We also present an algorithm that uses the Djokovic relation for computing\nall convex cuts of a (not necessarily plane) bipartite graph in $\\bigO(|E|^3)$\ntime. Specifically, a cut-set is the cut-set of a convex cut if and only if the\nDjokovic relation holds for any pair of edges in the cut-set.\n  We then characterize the cut-sets of the convex cuts of a general graph $H$\nusing two binary relations on edges: (i) the Djokovic relation on the edges of\na subdivision of $H$, where any edge of $H$ is subdivided into exactly two\nedges and (ii) a relation on the edges of $H$ itself that is not the Djokovic\nrelation. Finally, we use this characterization to present the first algorithm\nfor finding all convex cuts of a plane graph in polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 18:21:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 10:15:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 11:14:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Glantz", "Roland", ""], ["Meyerhenke", "Henning", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.4376", "submitter": "Dominique Rossin", "authors": "Adeline Pierrot (LIAFA), Dominique Rossin (LIX)", "title": "2-stack pushall sortable permutations", "comments": "41 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the 60's, Knuth introduced stack-sorting and serial compositions of\nstacks.

Most graphs are prime, although they can\nhave a rich product-like structure. The proposed algorithms are based on a\nlocal approach that covers a graph by small subgraphs, so-called partial star\nproducts, and then utilizes this information to derive the global factors and\nan embedding of the graph under investigation into Cartesian product graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 12:16:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2013 15:23:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 10:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hellmuth", "Marc", ""], ["Imrich", "Wilfried", ""], ["Kupka", "Tomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7205", "submitter": "Benjamin Doerr", "authors": "Benjamin Doerr", "title": "Winkler's Hat Guessing Game: Better Results for Imbalanced Hat\n  Distributions", "comments": "8 pages.

While Winkler's strategy guarantees in any\ncase that $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ of the $n$ player guess their hat color\ncorrect, our strategy ensures that the players produce $\\max\\{r,b\\} - 1.2\nn^{2/3} -2$ correct guesses for any distribution of $r$ red and $b = n - r$\nblue hats.
