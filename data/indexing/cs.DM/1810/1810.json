Given a circuit $\\mathcal{C}$ over the\nstandard basis $\\{\\vee_2,\\wedge_2,\\neg\\}$, the energy complexity of\n$\\mathcal{C}$, denoted by $\\mathrm{EC}(\\mathcal{C})$, is the maximum number of\nits activated inner gates over all inputs. The energy complexity of a Boolean\nfunction $f$, denoted by $\\mathrm{EC}(f)$, is the minimum of\n$\\mathrm{EC}(\\mathcal{C})$ over all circuits $\\mathcal{C}$ computing $f$. This\nconcept has attracted lots of attention in literature. Recently, Dinesh, Otiv,\nand Sarma [COCOON'18] gave $\\mathrm{EC}(f)$ an upper bound in terms of the\ndecision tree complexity, $\\mathrm{EC}(f)=O(\\mathrm{D}(f)^3)$.

This universal algorithmic approach sets limitations and conditions for\nirreducible information content analysis in comparing networks with a large\nnumber of dimensions, such as multilayer networks. Nevertheless, we show that\nthere are particular cases of infinite nesting families of finite\nmultidimensional networks with a unified recursive labeling such that each\nmember of these families is incompressible. From these results, we study\nnetwork topological properties and equivalences in irreducible information\ncontent of multidimensional networks in comparison to their isomorphic\nclassical graph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Oct 2018 22:07:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 23:52:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 23:32:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 26 Oct 2019 19:35:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:39:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 21:47:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sun, 31 May 2020 17:27:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:03:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 15:27:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Abrah\u00e3o", "Felipe S.", ""], ["Wehmuth", "Klaus", ""], ["Zenil", "Hector", ""], ["Ziviani", "Artur", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.11867", "submitter": "Erik Lindgren", "authors": "Erik M.

Several graph\nproblems that are NP-hard in general become solvable in polynomial time on\nchordal graphs, whereas many others remain NP-hard. For a large group of\nproblems among the latter, approximation algorithms, parameterized algorithms,\nand algorithms with moderately exponential or sub-exponential running time have\nbeen designed. Chordal graphs have also gained increasing interest during the\nrecent years in the area of enumeration algorithms. Being able to test these\nalgorithms on instances of chordal graphs is crucial for understanding the\nconcepts of tractability of hard problems on graph classes. Unfortunately, only\nfew studies give algorithms for generating chordal graphs. Even in these\npapers, only very few methods aim for generating a large variety of chordal\ngraphs. Surprisingly, none of these methods is directly based on the\n\"intersection of subtrees of a tree\" characterization of chordal graphs. In\nthis paper, we give an algorithm for generating chordal graphs, based on the\ncharacterization that a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection\ngraph of subtrees of a tree. Upon generating a random host tree, we give and\ntest various methods that generate subtrees of the host tree. We compare our\nmethods to one another and to existing ones for generating chordal graphs. Our\nexperiments show that one of our methods is able to generate the largest\nvariety of chordal graphs in terms of maximal clique sizes.
