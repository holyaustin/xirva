The minimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a word of length $n$ is\n$1$ and the minimum total number is $n$, with both bounds being achieved by\n$x^n$ where $x$ is a letter. A more interesting question to ask is what is the\nminimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$?

In this\npaper we introduce a homological theory of functions that can be used to\nestablish complexity separations, while also providing other interesting\nconsequences. We propose to associate a topological space $S_A$ to each class\nof functions $A$, such that, to separate complexity classes $A \\subseteq B'$,\nit suffices to observe a change in \"the number of holes\", i.e. homology, in\n$S_A$ as a subclass $B$ of $B'$ is added to $A$. In other words, if the\nhomologies of $S_A$ and $S_{A \\cup B}$ are different, then $A \\not= B'$. We\ndevelop the underlying theory of functions based on combinatorial and\nhomological commutative algebra and Stanley-Reisner theory, and recover Minsky\nand Papert's 1969 result that parity cannot be computed by nonmaximal degree\npolynomial threshold functions. In the process, we derive a \"maximal principle\"\nfor polynomial threshold functions that is used to extend this result further\nto arbitrary symmetric functions. A surprising coincidence is demonstrated,\nwhere the maximal dimension of \"holes\" in $S_A$ upper bounds the VC dimension\nof $A$, with equality for common computational cases such as the class of\npolynomial threshold functions or the class of linear functionals in $\\mathbb\nF_2$, or common algebraic cases such as when the Stanley-Reisner ring of $S_A$\nis Cohen-Macaulay. As another interesting application of our theory, we prove a\nresult that a priori has nothing to do with complexity separation: it\ncharacterizes when a vector subspace intersects the positive cone, in terms of\nhomological conditions.

Considerable progress has been made in the\ndevelopment of a physical quantum annealer, motivating the study of methods to\nenhance the efficiency of such a solver. In this work, we present a quantum\nannealing approach to measure similarity among molecular structures.\nImplementing real-world problems on a quantum annealer is challenging due to\nhardware limitations such as sparse connectivity, intrinsic control error, and\nlimited precision. In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques. Using a real data set,\nwe investigate the performance of a quantum annealer in solving the molecular\nsimilarity problem. We provide experimental evidence that common practices for\nembedding can be replaced by new alternatives which mitigate some of the\nhardware limitations and enhance its performance. Common practices for\nembedding include minimizing either the number of qubits or the chain length,\nand determining the strength of ferromagnetic couplers empirically. We show\nthat current criteria for selecting an embedding do not improve the hardware's\nperformance for the molecular similarity problem. Furthermore, we use a\ntheoretical approach to determine the strength of ferromagnetic couplers. Such\nan approach removes the computational burden of the current empirical\napproaches, and also results in hardware solutions that can benefit from simple\nlocal classical improvement.

The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees\nare \\emph{biologically feasible}, that is, if there is a possible true history\nthat would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down\nto finding a reconciliation map - also known as DTL-scenario - between the\nevent-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree.\n  In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid\nreconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees $T$ that contain\nspeciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown\nspecies tree $S$ in terms of \"informative\" triples that are displayed in $T$\nand provide information of the topology of $S$. These informative triples are\nused to infer the unknown species tree $S$ for $T$. We obtain a similar result\nfor non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs\nto be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide\nwhether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the\npositive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted)\nreconciliation map.\n  However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have its limitations\nwhen they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While\nreconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is\nnot true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples do neither\nprovide enough information to characterize \"relaxed\" DTL-scenarios nor\nnon-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene\ntrees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:28:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 07:25:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 12:57:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:19:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hellmuth", "Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08500", "submitter": "Boris Brimkov", "authors": "Boris Brimkov, Caleb C.

This, however, is not the case with respect to clique-width, as the\nclique-width of a graph can be (much) smaller than the clique-width of its\nminor.
