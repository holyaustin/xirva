The size and life\nspan of a fragment depend on the illumination level of the medium. When two or\nmore wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new wave-fragment.\nIn computer simulations based on the Oregonator model we demonstrate that the\noutcomes of inter-fragment collisions can be controlled by varying the\nillumination level applied to the medium. We interpret these wave-fragments as\nvalues of Boolean variables and design collision-based polymorphic logical\ngates. The gate implements operation XNOR for low illumination, and it acts as\nNOR gate for high illumination.
