A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where T\npoints are sampled uniformly in [0,1], and the goal is to immediately color\nthem $\\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As random\ncoloring incurs $\\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds are\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n \\log (T/n)})$ for vector balancing and $1$ for interval\nbalancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline\nbounds in the online setting for these problems.

The LTM\nis modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a\nlane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design\nand the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex\nmixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) formulation. We propose a Benders'\ndecomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our\napproach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders' master\nproblem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic\ntraffic assignment (SODTA) problems which is shown to converge to fixed-points\nrepresentative of logit-compatible demand splits. Further, we prove that the\nproposed solution method converges to a local optima of the nonconvex problem\nand identify under which conditions this local optima is a global solution. The\nproposed approach is implemented on three hypothetical freeway networks with\nsingle and multiple origins and destinations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2019 23:03:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2020 02:25:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 03:39:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Shantanu", ""], ["Rey", "David", ""], ["Levin", "Michael W.", ""], ["Waller", "S.

This is sharp up to\na factor $2$. This result and its short proof have implications for the related\nnotion of chromatic discrepancy.\n  Drawing inspiration from both structural and extremal graph theory, we\nconjecture that every triangle-free graph of chromatic number $\\chi$ contains\nan induced cycle of length $\\Omega(\\chi\\log\\chi)$ as $\\chi\\to\\infty$. Even if\none only demands an induced path of length $\\Omega(\\chi\\log\\chi)$, the\nconclusion would be sharp up to a constant multiple. We prove it for regular\ngirth $5$ graphs and for girth $21$ graphs.\n  As a common strengthening of the induced paths form of this conjecture and of\nJohansson's theorem (1996), we posit the existence of some $c >0$ such that for\nevery forest $H$ on $D$ vertices, every triangle-free and induced $H$-free\ngraph has chromatic number at most $c D/\\log D$. We prove this assertion with\n`triangle-free' replaced by `regular girth $5$'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:47:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Mar 2020 07:47:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Aravind", "N.
