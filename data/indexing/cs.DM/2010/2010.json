As indicated in the recent article posted\non the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a\nlot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing\ntechnique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into\ngroups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to\nreconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family\nof pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite\nprojective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices\nproposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using\nthe two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting\nextensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical\nresults show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in\nthe whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one\nshould choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The\nfamily of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according\nto the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed\npooling matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 19:05:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:51:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yi-Jheng", ""], ["Yu", "Che-Hao", ""], ["Liu", "Tzu-Hsuan", ""], ["Chang", "Cheng-Shang", ""], ["Chen", "Wen-Tsuen", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00138", "submitter": "Sophie Toulouse", "authors": "Laurent Alfandari, Sophie Toulouse", "title": "Approximation of the Double Travelling Salesman Problem with Multiple\n  Stacks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "\"On the Complexity of the Multiple Stack TSP, kSTSP\" (TAMC 2009),\n  \"Approximability of the Multiple Stack TSP\" (ISCO 2010), \"Differential\n  Approximation of the Multiple Stacks TSP\" in (ISCO 2012)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Double Travelling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks, DTSPMS, deals\nwith the collect and delivery of n commodities in two distinct cities, where\nthe pickup and the delivery tours are related by LIFO constraints.

In many applications,\ndue to user's privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to\ntarget any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of\nusers is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly\nimpair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree\nusers, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law\nstructure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM\nin real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion\nuncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and\nassume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is\ndepicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation,\nwe prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have\nhigher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP\nembedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we\nformulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard.\nIn the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show\nthe monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a\ntwo-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In\nthe adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of\nexisting seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and\nsubmodularity of the influence spread function in two stages.

To this end, considering the \"width\" of a\nconnection, referred to as the $s$-overlap of neighbors, provides more\nmeaningful insights into how closely the communities or entities interact with\neach other. In addition, $s$-overlap computation is the fundamental kernel to\nconstruct the line graph of a hypergraph, a low-order approximation of the\nhypergraph which can carry significant information about the original\nhypergraph. Subsequent stages of a data analytics pipeline then can apply\nhighly-tuned graph algorithms on the line graph to reveal important features.\nGiven a hypergraph, computing the $s$-overlaps by exhaustively considering all\npairwise entities can be computationally prohibitive. To tackle this challenge,\nwe develop efficient algorithms to compute $s$-overlaps and the corresponding\nline graph of a hypergraph. We propose several heuristics to avoid execution of\nredundant work and improve performance of the $s$-overlap computation.
