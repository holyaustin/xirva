This information allows researchers to perform association\nstudies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual\nresponses to therapeutic agents.\n  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem\n(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve\nit using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods\napplied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact\nmethods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)\nthat, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.\n  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better\nscalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem\nspecific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search\ntechniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a\ngood trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.\n  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss\nsome relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers\nthat combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies\nand learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference\nproblem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study\nbecause the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and\nhybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2007 12:49:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Di Gaspero", "Luca", ""], ["Roli", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0580", "submitter": "David Pritchard", "authors": "David Pritchard", "title": "Efficient Divide-and-Conquer Implementations Of Symmetric FSAs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Cellular Automata 5(6) (special issue for Automata\n  2007, H.
