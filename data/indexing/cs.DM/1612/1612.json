A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse.\nBut the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is\nedge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes\nin the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully\nconnected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations,\nprimarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its\ndefinition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity\nof a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it\nsparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling,\nRising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are\ncommonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison\nbetween edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate\nexamples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been\nshown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing\ngraph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index\ndecreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between\nthe sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a\ndistribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide\nvariety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed\nindex together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network\ngraph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:24:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Goswami", "Swati", ""], ["Murthy", "C.

We make this notion precise by\nintroducing the concept of information equivalence between graphs, a more\nquantitative version of homomorphic equivalence. We then describe a natural\npartial ordering over the space of information equivalence classes, and endow\nit with a suitable metric structure that is contractive under the strong\nproduct. Various examples and open problems are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 23:13:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Sep 2017 15:11:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Lele", ""], ["Shayevitz", "Ofer", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09436", "submitter": "Abhiruk Lahiri", "authors": "Arpitha P.

The circular separation dimension of a graph $G$, denoted by\n$\\pi^\\circ(G)$, is the minimum number of circular orderings of the vertices of\n$G$ such that every pair of non-adjacent edges is separated in at least one of\nthe circular orderings. This notion is introduced by Loeb and West in their\nrecent paper. In this article, we consider two subclasses of planar graphs,\nnamely $2$-outerplanar graphs and series-parallel graphs. A $2$-outerplanar\ngraph has a planar embedding such that the subgraph obtained by removal of the\nvertices of the exterior face is outerplanar. We prove that if $G$ is\n$2$-outerplanar then $\\pi^\\circ(G) = 2$. We also prove that if $G$ is a\nseries-parallel graph then $\\pi^\\circ(G) \\leq 2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 09:48:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 10:48:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bharathi", "Arpitha P.", ""], ["De", "Minati", ""], ["Lahiri", "Abhiruk", ""]]}]
