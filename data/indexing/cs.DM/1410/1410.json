Kawarabayashi, Thomas and Wollan recently showed a self-contained proof of\nthis theorem with the following two sets of parameters: (1)\n$f(w,t)=\\Theta(t^{24}(t^2+w))$ with $|A|=O(t^{24})$, and (2)\n$f(w,t)=w^{2^{\\Theta(t^{24})}}$ with $|A|\\leq t-5$. The latter result gives the\nbest possible bound on $|A|$. In this paper we improve their bounds to\n$f(w,t)=\\Theta(t(t+w))$ with $|A|\\leq t-5$. For the special case where the\nmaximum vertex degree in $G$ is bounded by $D$, we show that, if $G$ contains a\nwall of size $\\Omega(Dt(t+w))$, then either $G$ contains a $K_t$-minor, or\nthere is a flat wall of size $w$ in $G$. This setting naturally arises in\nalgorithms for the Edge-Disjoint Paths problem, with $D\\leq 4$. Like the proof\nof Kawarabayashi et al., our proof is self-contained, except for using a\nwell-known theorem on routing pairs of disjoint paths. We also provide\nefficient algorithms that return either a model of the $K_t$-minor, or a vertex\nset $A$ and a flat wall of size $w$ in $G\\setminus A$.\n  We complement our result for the low-degree scenario by proving an almost\nmatching lower bound: namely, for all integers $w,t>1$, there is a graph $G$,\ncontaining a wall of size $\\Omega(wt)$, such that the maximum vertex degree in\n$G$ is 5, and $G$ contains no flat wall of size $w$, and no $K_t$-minor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 16:29:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chuzhoy", "Julia", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0770", "submitter": "Arne Leitert", "authors": "Andreas Brandst\\\"adt, Pavel Fi\\v{c}ur, Arne Leitert, Martin\n  Milani\\v{c}", "title": "Polynomial-time Algorithms for Weighted Efficient Domination Problems in\n  AT-free Graphs and Dually Chordal Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Information Processing Letters 115 (2015) 256-262", "doi": "10.1016/j.ipl.2014.09.024", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An efficient dominating set (or perfect code) in a graph is a set of vertices\nthe closed neighborhoods of which partition the vertex set of the graph.

As observed in [2], by combining these two results\none can relate the linear index coding problem of undirected graphs to the\ngraph homomorphism problem. In [4], a direct connection between linear index\ncoding problem and graph homomorphism problem is introduced. In contrast to the\nformer approach, the direct connection holds for digraphs as well and applies\nto any field size. More precisely, in [4], a graph family $\\{H_k^q\\}$ is\nintroduced and shown that whether or not the scalar linear index of a digraph\n$G$ is less than or equal to $k$ is equivalent to the existence of a graph\nhomomorphism from the complement of $G$ to the complement of $H_k^q$.\n  Here, we first study the structure of the digraphs $H_k^q$.

Although theoretical results exist that give\noptimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither\nresults in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result.\nIn addition to this lack of theoretical knowledge, only a few methods have been\nproposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new\nheuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem,\nby following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm:\nthe first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which\nfollow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the\nJaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the\nmerging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a\npartial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the\ncyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in\nterms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs\nwhose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where\nthe consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to\nweighted graphs is also proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 17:07:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 10:06:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hamon", "Ronan", ""], ["Borgnat", "Pierre", ""], ["Flandrin", "Patrick", ""], ["Robardet", "C\u00e9line", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6397", "submitter": "Abbas Mehrabian", "authors": "Abbas Mehrabian", "title": "Justifying the small-world phenomenon via random recursive trees", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.SI math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new technique for proving logarithmic upper bounds for diameters\nof evolving random graph models, which is based on defining a coupling between\nrandom graphs and variants of random recursive trees.

We study this\ngeneralization of monotonicity from the vantage point of learning theory,\ngiving near-matching upper and lower bounds on the uniform-distribution\nlearnability of circuits in terms of the number of negations they contain. Our\nupper bounds are based on a new structural characterization of negation-limited\ncircuits that extends a classical result of A. A. Markov. Our lower bounds,\nwhich employ Fourier-analytic tools from hardness amplification, give new\nresults even for circuits with no negations (i.e. monotone functions).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 16:10:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Blais", "Eric", ""], ["Canonne", "Cl\u00e9ment L.", ""], ["Oliveira", "Igor C.", ""], ["Servedio", "Rocco A.", ""], ["Tan", "Li-Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8584", "submitter": "Matthias K\\\"oppe", "authors": "Amitabh Basu, Robert Hildebrand, Matthias K\\\"oppe", "title": "Light on the Infinite Group Relaxation", "comments": "45 pages", "journal-ref": "4OR 14 (2016), 1-40, 107-131", "doi": "10.1007/s10288-015-0292-9 10.1007/s10288-015-0293-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is a survey on the infinite group problem, an infinite-dimensional\nrelaxation of integer linear optimization problems introduced by Ralph Gomory\nand Ellis Johnson in their groundbreaking papers titled \"Some continuous\nfunctions related to corner polyhedra I, II\" [Math.
