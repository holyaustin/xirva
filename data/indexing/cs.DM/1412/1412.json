A matching is a set of disjoint pairs of mutually accepted agents. If\nany two agents mutually prefer each other to their partner, then they block the\nmatching, otherwise, the matching is said to be stable. In this paper we\ninvestigate the complexity of finding a solution satisfying additional\nconstraints on restricted pairs of agents. Restricted pairs can be either\nforced or forbidden. A stable solution must contain all of the forced pairs,\nwhile it must contain none of the forbidden pairs.\n  Dias et al. gave a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether such a\nsolution exists in the presence of restricted edges. If the answer is no, one\nmight look for a solution close to optimal. Since optimality in this context\nmeans that the matching is stable and satisfies all constraints on restricted\npairs, there are two ways of relaxing the constraints by permitting a solution\nto: (1) be blocked by some pairs (as few as possible), or (2) violate some\nconstraints on restricted pairs (again as few as possible).\n  Our main theorems prove that for the (bipartite) stable marriage problem,\ncase (1) leads to NP-hardness and inapproximability results, whilst case (2)\ncan be solved in polynomial time. For the non-bipartite stable roommates\ninstances, case (2) yields an NP-hard problem.

If G the boundary of a three dimensional graph H for example, we can\nrefine the interior until it is colourable with 4 colours. The later goal is\nachieved if all interior edge degrees are even. Using a refinement process\nwhich cuts the interior along surfaces we can adapt the degrees along the\nboundary of that surface. More efficient is a self-cobordism of G with itself\nwith a host graph discretizing the product of G with an interval. It follows\nfrom the fact that Euler curvature is zero everywhere for three dimensional\ngeometric graphs, that the odd degree edge set O is a cycle and so a boundary\nif H is simply connected. A reduction to minimal colouring would imply the four\ncolour theorem. The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it. This explains the\nappearance of the chromatic number 5 for higher degree or non-orientable\nsituations, a number we believe to be the upper limit. For every surface type,\nwe construct examples with chromatic number 3,4 or 5, where the construction of\nsurfaces with chromatic number 5 is based on a method of Fisk.
