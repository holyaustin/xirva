For instance, the nodes could correspond to neurons along the\ncortical surface and the vector field could correspond to the gradient of\nneurotrophic factors, or the nodes could represent towns while the vector\nfields would be given by economical and/or geographical gradients. Therefore\ntrajectory networks are natural models of a large number of geographical\nstructures. The geographical infiltrations correspond to the addition of new\nlocal connections between nearby existing nodes. As such, these infiltrations\ncould be related to several real-world processes such as contaminations,\ndiseases, attacks, parasites, etc. The way in which progressive geographical\ninfiltrations affect trajectory networks is investigated in terms of the\ndegree, clustering coefficient, size of the largest component and the lengths\nof the existing chains measured along the infiltrations. It is shown that the\nmaximum infiltration distance plays a critical role in the intensity of the\ninduced topological changes. For large enough values of this parameter, the\nchains intrinsic to the trajectory networks undergo a collapse which is shown\nnot to be related to the percolation of the network also implied by the\ninfiltrations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2008 13:52:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 19:24:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Costa", "Luciano da Fontoura", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.2495", "submitter": "Gabriel Istrate", "authors": "Gabriel Istrate, Madhav V.
