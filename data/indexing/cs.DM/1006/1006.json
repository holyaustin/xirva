We address the\nrandom generation of such structures with respect to a size $n$ and a targeted\ndistribution in $k$ of its \\emph{distinguished} atoms. We consider two\nvariations on this problem.

We address this problem by weighting the\natoms with a $k$-tuple $\\Weights$ of real-valued weights, inducing a weighted\ndistribution over the set of structures of size $n$. We first adapt the\nclassical recursive random generation scheme into an algorithm taking\n$\\bigO{n^{1+o(1)}+mn\\log{n}}$ arithmetic operations to draw $m$ structures from\nthe $\\Weights$-weighted distribution. Secondly, we address the analytical\ncomputation of weights such that the targeted frequencies are achieved\nasymptotically, i. e. for large values of $n$.

The Lopsided Local Lemma shows that this is\nasymptotically best possible. The determination of this extremal function is\nparticularly important as it represents the value where the corresponding k-SAT\nproblem exhibits a complexity hardness jump: from having every instance being a\nYES-instance it becomes NP-hard just by allowing each variable to occur in one\nmore clause.\n  The construction of our unsatisfiable CNF-formulas is based on the binary\ntree approach of [16] and thus the constructed formulas are in the class MU(1)\nof minimal unsatisfiable formulas having one more clauses than variables. The\nmain novelty of our approach here comes in setting up an appropriate continuous\napproximation of the problem. This leads us to a differential equation, the\nsolution of which we are able to estimate. The asymptotically optimal binary\ntrees are then obtained through a discretization of this solution.\n  The importance of the binary trees constructed is also underlined by their\nappearance in many other scenarios.

From the paper \\cite{FST1}, it is known that\nsuch graphs can not have nodes of degrees above 8. Neighborhood of nodes of\ndegrees 8,7,6,5, and 4 are consecutively simplified. Then, a criterion is\nprovided to identify median graphs with nodes of degrees at most 3. As a\nbyproduct, we produce an algorithm that is more effective than previous known\nto determine quivers of finite mutation type of size greater than 10.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2010 17:13:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Jul 2010 17:54:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Weiwen", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4339", "submitter": "MohammadHossein Bateni", "authors": "MohammadHossein Bateni and MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi and D\\'aniel Marx", "title": "Prize-collecting Network Design on Planar Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we reduce Prize-Collecting Steiner TSP (PCTSP),\nPrize-Collecting Stroll (PCS), Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST),\nPrize-Collecting Steiner Forest (PCSF) and more generally Submodular\nPrize-Collecting Steiner Forest (SPCSF) on planar graphs (and more generally\nbounded-genus graphs) to the same problems on graphs of bounded treewidth. More\nprecisely, we show any $\\alpha$-approximation algorithm for these problems on\ngraphs of bounded treewidth gives an $(\\alpha + \\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm for these problems on planar graphs (and more generally bounded-genus\ngraphs), for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$. Since PCS, PCTSP, and PCST can be\nsolved exactly on graphs of bounded treewidth using dynamic programming, we\nobtain PTASs for these problems on planar graphs and bounded-genus graphs. In\ncontrast, we show PCSF is APX-hard to approximate on series-parallel graphs,\nwhich are planar graphs of treewidth at most 2. This result is interesting on\nits own because it gives the first provable hardness separation between\nprize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (regular) versions of the problems:\nregular Steiner Forest is known to be polynomially solvable on series-parallel\ngraphs and admits a PTAS on graphs of bounded treewidth. An analogous hardness\nresult can be shown for Euclidian PCSF.
