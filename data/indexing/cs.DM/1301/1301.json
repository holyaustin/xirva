In order to give a new\nanalytical approach for the distributions, we consider a simple model which\nconstructs a fractal-like hierarchical network based on random divisions of\nrectangles. The stochastic process makes a Markov chain and corresponds to\ndirectional random walks with splitting into four particles. We derive a\ncombinatorial analytical form and its continuous approximation for the\ndistribution of rectangle areas, and numerically show a good fitting with the\nactual distribution in the averaging behavior of the divisions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2013 01:17:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 06:21:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hayashi", "Yukio", ""], ["Komaki", "Takayuki", ""], ["Ide", "Yusuke", ""], ["Machida", "Takuya", ""], ["Konno", "Norio", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.2474", "submitter": "Aur\\'elie Lagoutte", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet, Aur\\'elie Lagoutte and St\\'ephan Thomass\\'e", "title": "Clique versus Independent Set", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "European Journal of Combinatorics, 40:73-92, 2014", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejc.2014.02.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Yannakakis' Clique versus Independent Set problem (CL-IS) in communication\ncomplexity asks for the minimum number of cuts separating cliques from stable\nsets in a graph, called CS-separator. Yannakakis provides a quasi-polynomial\nCS-separator, i.e. of size $O(n^{\\log n})$, and addresses the problem of\nfinding a polynomial CS-separator. This question is still open even for perfect\ngraphs. We show that a polynomial CS-separator almost surely exists for random\ngraphs. Besides, if H is a split graph (i.e. has a vertex-partition into a\nclique and a stable set) then there exists a constant $c_H$ for which we find a\n$O(n^{c_H})$ CS-separator on the class of H-free graphs. This generalizes a\nresult of Yannakakis on comparability graphs. We also provide a $O(n^{c_k})$\nCS-separator on the class of graphs without induced path of length k and its\ncomplement. Observe that on one side, $c_H$ is of order $O(|H| \\log |H|)$\nresulting from Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and on the other side, $c_k$ is\nexponential.\n  One of the main reason why Yannakakis' CL-IS problem is fascinating is that\nit admits equivalent formulations. Our main result in this respect is to show\nthat a polynomial CS-separator is equivalent to the polynomial\nAlon-Saks-Seymour Conjecture, asserting that if a graph has an edge-partition\ninto k complete bipartite graphs, then its chromatic number is polynomially\nbounded in terms of k. We also show that the classical approach to the stubborn\nproblem (arising in CSP) which consists in covering the set of all solutions by\n$O(n^{\\log n})$ instances of 2-SAT is again equivalent to the existence of a\npolynomial CS-separator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2013 12:22:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 12:48:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 08:04:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bousquet", "Nicolas", ""], ["Lagoutte", "Aur\u00e9lie", ""], ["Thomass\u00e9", "St\u00e9phan", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.2497", "submitter": "Yunghsiang Han", "authors": "Yunghsiang S.

This way, our approach provides a\nmethod to link micro- to macro-level dynamics -- a crux of complexity. Several\nnew results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity\n(modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks),\nidentification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the\nconvergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete\ninformation about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization\nand robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known\nmodel of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation\nin Drosophila melanogaster. We use this model to show that our analysis does\nnot contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about\nits behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor\nbasin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal\nconditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the\nresilience of these to stochastic interventions.

As a byproduct, we obtain a new algorithm\nfor Feedback Arc Set in tournaments (FAST) with running time 2^{c\\sqrt{k}} *\nn^{O(1)}, where c = 2\\pi / \\sqrt(3)*\\ln(2) <= 5.24, that is simpler than the\nalgorithms of Feige [9] and of Karpinski and Schudy[16], both also working in\n2^{O(\\sqrt{k})} * n^{O(1)} time. Our techniques can be applied also to other\nlayout problems on semi-complete digraphs. We show that the Optimal Linear\nArrangement problem, a close relative of Feedback Arc Set, can be solved in\n2^{O(k^{1/3} \\sqrt{\\log k})} * n^{O(1)} time, where k is the target cost of the\nordering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 18:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Fomin", "Fedor V.", ""], ["Pilipczuk", "Micha\u0142", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7320", "submitter": "Nathan Lemons", "authors": "Milan Bradonji\\'c, Aric Hagberg, Nicolas W.

An edge dominating set of a graph G = (V,E) is a subset of edges E' of E\nwhich dominates all edges of G. In particular, if every edge of G is dominated\nby exactly one edge of E' then E' is a dominating induced matching. It is known\nthat not every graph admits a dominating induced matching, while the problem to\ndecide if it does admit is NP-complete. In this paper we consider the problem\nof finding a minimum weighted dominating induced matching, if any, of a graph\nwith weighted edges. We describe two exact algorithms for general graphs.
