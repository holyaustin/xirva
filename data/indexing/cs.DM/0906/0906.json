This description is achieved by considering new\nparameters on digital segments: instead of their arithmetic description, we\nexamine the parameters related to their combinatoric description. As a result\nwe have a better understanding of their evolution during recognition and\nanalytical formulas to compute them. We also show how this evolution can be\nprojected onto the Stern-Brocot tree. These new relations have interesting\nconsequences on the geometry of digital curves.
