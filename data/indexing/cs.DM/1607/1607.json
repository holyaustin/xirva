We focus on graphs that can be represented by a single\nobstacle. Given a (topologically open) polygon $C$ and a finite set $P$ of\npoints in general position in the complement of $C$, the visibility graph\n$G_C(P)$ has a vertex for each point in $P$ and an edge $pq$ for any two points\n$p$ and $q$ in $P$ that can see each other, that is, $\\overline{pq} \\cap\nC=\\emptyset$. We draw $G_C(P)$ straight-line. Given a graph $G$, we want to\ncompute an obstacle representation of $G$, that is, an obstacle $C$ and a set\nof points $P$ such that $G=G_C(P)$. The complexity of this problem is open,\neven for the case that the points are exactly the vertices of a simple polygon\nand the obstacle is the complement of the polygon-the simple-polygon visibility\ngraph problem. There are two types of obstacles; an inside obstacle lies in a\nbounded component of the complement of the visibility drawing, whereas an\noutside obstacle lies in the unbounded component.\n  We show that the class of graphs with an inside-obstacle representation is\nincomparable with the class of graphs that have an outside-obstacle\nrepresentation. We further show that any graph with at most seven vertices or\ncircumference at most 6 has an outside-obstacle representation, which does not\nhold for a specific graph with 8 vertices and circumference 8. Finally, we\nconsider the outside-obstacle graph sandwich problem: given graphs $G$ and $H$\non the same vertex set, is there a graph $K$ such that $G \\subseteq K \\subseteq\nH$ and $K$ has an outside-obstacle representation? We show that this problem is\nNP-hard even for co-bipartite graphs. With slight modifications, our proof also\nshows that the inside-obstacle graph sandwich problem, the single-obstacle\ngraph sandwich problem, and the simple-polygon visibility graph sandwich\nproblem are all NP-hard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 15:07:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 19:58:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chaplick", "Steven", ""], ["Lipp", "Fabian", ""], ["Park", "Ji-won", ""], ["Wolff", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00476", "submitter": "Mordechai Shalom", "authors": "Saieed Akbari, Hadi Alizadeh, T{\\i}naz Ekim, Didem G\\\"oz\\\"upek,\n  Mordechai Shalom", "title": "Equimatchable Claw-Free Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Discrete Mathematics, Volume 341, Issue 10, October 2018, Pages\n  2859-2871", "doi": "10.1016/j.disc.2018.06.043", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A graph is equimatchable if all of its maximal matchings have the same size.\nA graph is claw-free if it does not have a claw as an induced subgraph.

In the\nstandard property testing model, an algorithm accesses the input function via\nan oracle that returns function values at all queried domain points. In many\nrealistic situations, the oracle may be unable to reveal the function values at\nsome domain points due to privacy concerns, or when some of the values get\nerased by mistake or by an adversary.\n  We initiate a study of property testers that are resilient to the presence of\nadversarially erased function values. An alpha-erasure-resilient epsilon-tester\nfor a property P is given parameters alpha, epsilon in (0,1), along with oracle\naccess to a function f such that at most an alpha fraction of the function\nvalues have been erased. The tester does not know whether a point is erased\nunless it queries that point. The tester has to accept with high probability if\nthere is a way to assign values to the erased points such that the resulting\nfunction satisfies P. It has to reject with high probability if, for all\nassignments of values to the erased points, the resulting function has to be\nchanged in at least an epsilon-fraction of the nonerased domain points to\nsatisfy P.\n  We design erasure-resilient property testers for a large class of properties.\nFor some properties, it is possible to obtain erasure-resilient testers by\nusing standard testers as a black box. But there are more challenging\nproperties for which all known testers rely on querying a specific point. If\nthis point is erased, all these testers break. We give efficient\nerasure-resilient testers for several classes of such properties including\nmonotonicity, the Lipschitz property, and convexity. Finally, we describe a\nproperty that can be epsilon-tested with O(1/epsilon) queries in the standard\nmodel, whereas testing it in the erasure-resilient model requires number of\nqueries polynomial in the input size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2016 00:32:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dixit", "Kashyap", ""], ["Raskhodnikova", "Sofya", ""], ["Thakurta", "Abhradeep", ""], ["Varma", "Nithin", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05817", "submitter": "P Renjith", "authors": "P.
