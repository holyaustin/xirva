We also\nintroduce a new parallel algorithm for the combination of these two trees into\nthe output global contour tree. Overall, this results in superior time\nperformance in practice, both in sequential and in parallel thanks to the\nOpenMP task runtime. We report performance numbers that compare our approach to\nreference sequential and multi-threaded implementations for the computation of\naugmented merge and contour trees. These experiments demonstrate the run-time\nefficiency of our approach and its scalability on common workstations. We\ndemonstrate the utility of our approach in data segmentation applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2019 09:31:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gueunet", "Charles", "", "LIP6"], ["Fortin", "P.", "", "LLR"], ["Jomier", "J", ""], ["Tierny", "J", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.05540", "submitter": "Stefan G\\\"oller", "authors": "Arnaud Carayol and Stefan G\\\"oller", "title": "On long words avoiding Zimin patterns", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A pattern is encountered in a word if some infix of the word is the image of\nthe pattern under some non-erasing morphism.

Skeletons of\nassociahedra, for instance, are the graphs induced by quadrilateral flips in\ntriangulations of a convex polygon. For some definition of a flip graph, a\nnatural computational problem to consider is the flip distance: Given two\nobjects, what is the minimum number of flips needed to transform one into the\nother?\n  We consider flip graphs on orientations of simple graphs, where flips consist\nof reversing the direction of some edges. More precisely, we consider so-called\n$\\alpha$-orientations of a graph $G$, in which every vertex $v$ has a specified\noutdegree $\\alpha(v)$, and a flip consists of reversing all edges of a directed\ncycle. We prove that deciding whether the flip distance between two\n$\\alpha$-orientations of a planar graph $G$ is at most two is \\NP-complete.\nThis also holds in the special case of perfect matchings, where flips involve\nalternating cycles. This problem amounts to finding geodesics on the common\nbase polytope of two partition matroids, or, alternatively, on an alcoved\npolytope. It therefore provides an interesting example of a flip distance\nquestion that is computationally intractable despite having a natural\ninterpretation as a geodesic on a nicely structured combinatorial polytope.\n  We also consider the dual question of the flip distance betwe en graph\norientations in which every cycle has a specified number of forward edges, and\na flip is the reversal of all edges in a minimal directed cut. In general, the\nproblem remains hard. However, if we restrict to flips that only change sinks\ninto sources, or vice-versa, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time.\nHere we exploit the fact that the flip graph is the cover graph of a\ndistributive lattice.

The task is to decide whether T can be spanned by\na subset of E\\setminus T of size at most k.\n  We prove that on graphic matroid perturbations, for every fixed r, Space\nCover is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k. On the other hand, the\nproblem becomes W[1]-hard when parameterized by r+k+|T| and it is NP-complete\nfor r\\leq 2 and |T|\\leq 2.\n  On cographic matroids, that are the duals of graphic matroids, Space Cover\ngeneralizes another fundamental and well-studied problem, namely Multiway Cut.\nWe show that on the duals of perturbed graphic matroids the Space Cover problem\nis fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by r+k.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2019 09:15:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fomin", "Fedor V.", ""], ["Golovach", "Petr A.", ""], ["Lokshtanov", "Daniel", ""], ["Saurabh", "Saket", ""], ["Zehavi", "Meirav", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.07004", "submitter": "Oscar Defrain", "authors": "Oscar Defrain, Lhouari Nourine and Takeaki Uno", "title": "On the dualization in distributive lattices and related problems", "comments": "18 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the dualization in distributive lattices, a\ngeneralization of the well-known hypergraph dualization problem.

A key property of all these models, which is also an important\nreason for their popularity, is that they are presumed to be very robust, since\nthey are simple, randomized, and, crucially, do not utilize explicitly the\nglobal structure of the underlying graph. While sporadic results exist, there\nhas been no systematic theoretical treatment quantifying the robustness of\nthese models. Here we investigate this question with respect to two orthogonal\naspects: (adversarial) modifications of the underlying graph and message\ntransmission failures.\n  We explore in particular the following notion of Local Resilience: beginning\nwith a graph, we investigate up to which fraction of the edges an adversary has\nto be allowed to delete at each vertex, so that the protocols need\nsignificantly more rounds to broadcast the information. Our main findings\nestablish a separation among the three models. It turns out that Pull is robust\nwith respect to all parameters that we consider. On the other hand, Push may\nslow down significantly, even if the adversary is allowed to modify the degrees\nof the vertices by an arbitrarily small positive fraction only. Finally,\nPush&Pull is robust when no message transmission failures are considered,\notherwise it may be slowed down.\n  On the technical side, we develop two novel methods for the analysis of\nrandomized rumour spreading protocols.

That is, generate a smaller graph that\npreserves the global structure at the expense of discarding local details?\nThere has been extensive work on both graph sparsification (removing edges) and\ngraph coarsening (merging nodes, often by edge contraction); however, these\noperations are currently treated separately. Interestingly, for a planar graph,\nedge deletion corresponds to edge contraction in its planar dual (and more\ngenerally, for a graphical matroid and its dual). Moreover, with respect to the\ndynamics induced by the graph Laplacian (e.g., diffusion), deletion and\ncontraction are physical manifestations of two reciprocal limits: edge weights\nof $0$ and $\\infty$, respectively. In this work, we provide a unifying\nframework that captures both of these operations, allowing one to\nsimultaneously sparsify and coarsen a graph while preserving its large-scale\nstructure. The limit of infinite edge weight is rarely considered, as many\nclassical notions of graph similarity diverge. However, its algebraic,\ngeometric, and physical interpretations are reflected in the Laplacian\npseudoinverse $\\mathbf{\\mathit{L}}^{\\dagger}$, which remains finite in this\nlimit. Motivated by this insight, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that\nreduces graphs while preserving $\\mathbf{\\mathit{L}}^{\\dagger}$, using an\nunbiased procedure that minimizes its variance.

We\nanswer two open questions of Bulteau et al. mentioned in [30th Annual Symposium\non Combinatorial Pattern Matching, 2019]. The first open question asked about\nthe complexity of the problems on trees with maximum degree at most $5$. We\nprove that both problems remain NP-complete on binary $4$-caterpillars, ternary\n$3$-caterpillars and quaternary $2$-caterpillars, and thus almost settles the\ncomplexity dichotomy on $k$-caterpillars with bounded maximum degree. On the\npositive side, we give a linear time algorithm for $1$-caterpillars even if the\nbackbone is a cycle and generalise this result to a larger class of graphs.\nFinally, we answer the second open question regarding the complexity of\nColourful Components on graphs with maximum degree at most $5$ if the number of\ncolours is bounded by a constant. We show that the problem is NP-complete on\n$5$-coloured planar graphs with maximum degree $4$, and on $12$-coloured planar\ngraphs with maximum degree $3$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 16:19:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 10:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2019 16:05:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 2 Jun 2019 13:42:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 19:29:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2020 08:42:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 09:07:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chleb\u00edkov\u00e1", "Janka", ""], ["Dallard", "Cl\u00e9ment", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.11214", "submitter": "Hyobin Kim", "authors": "Hyobin Kim, Omar K.

One foundational instantiation is Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\nwhich minimizes the average reconstruction error. In this paper, we introduce\nthe \"multi-criteria dimensionality reduction\" problem where we are given\nmultiple objectives that need to be optimized simultaneously. As an\napplication, our model captures several fairness criteria for dimensionality\nreduction such as our novel Fair-PCA problem and the Nash Social Welfare (NSW)\nproblem. In Fair-PCA, the input data is divided into $k$ groups, and the goal\nis to find a single $d$-dimensional representation for all groups for which the\nminimum variance of any one group is maximized. In NSW, the goal is to maximize\nthe product of the individual variances of the groups achieved by the common\nlow-dimensional space.\n  Our main result is an exact polynomial-time algorithm for the two-criterion\ndimensionality reduction problem when the two criteria are increasing concave\nfunctions. As an application of this result, we obtain a polynomial time\nalgorithm for Fair-PCA for $k=2$ groups and a polynomial time algorithm for NSW\nobjective for $k=2$ groups. We also give approximation algorithms for $k>2$.\nOur technical contribution in the above results is to prove new low-rank\nproperties of extreme point solutions to semi-definite programs. We conclude\nwith experiments indicating the effectiveness of algorithms based on extreme\npoint solutions of semi-definite programs on several real-world data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:37:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Jun 2019 17:36:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:40:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tantipongpipat", "Uthaipon", ""], ["Samadi", "Samira", ""], ["Singh", "Mohit", ""], ["Morgenstern", "Jamie", ""], ["Vempala", "Santosh", ""]]}]
