A rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of\neach region is equal to a pre-specified weight of the corresponding vertex. The\ncomplexity of a cartogram is determined by the maximum number of corners (or\nsides) required for any polygon. In a series of papers the polygonal complexity\nof such representations for maximal planar graphs has been reduced from the\ninitial 40 to 34, then to 12 and very recently to the currently best known 10.\nHere we describe a construction with 8-sided polygons, which is optimal in\nterms of polygonal complexity as 8-sided polygons are sometimes necessary.\nSpecifically, we show how to compute the combinatorial structure and how to\nrefine the representation into an area-universal rectangular layout in linear\ntime. The exact cartogram can be computed from the area-universal rectangular\nlayout with numerical iteration, or can be approximated with a hill-climbing\nheuristic.\n  We also describe an alternative construction for Hamiltonian maximal planar\ngraphs, which allows us to directly compute the cartograms in linear time.\nMoreover, we prove that even for Hamiltonian graphs 8-sided rectilinear\npolygons are necessary, by constructing a non-trivial lower bound example. The\ncomplexity of the cartograms can be reduced to 6 if the Hamiltonian path has\nthe extra property that it is one-legged, as in outer-planar graphs.

We call these payoffs\nas localized payoffs. In this game, the payoff of each individual captures (1)\nthe gain from immediate neighbors, (2) the bridging benefits, and (3) the cost\nto form links. This implies that the payoff of each individual can be computed\nusing only its single-hop neighbourhood information. Based on this simple model\nof network formation, our study explores the structure of networks that form,\nsatisfying one or both of the properties, namely, pairwise stability and\nefficiency. We analytically prove the pairwise stability of several interesting\nnetwork structures, notably, the complete bi-partite network, complete\nequi-k-partite network, complete network and cycle network, under various\nconfigurations of the model. We validate and extend these results through\nextensive simulations. We characterize topologies of efficient networks by\ndrawing upon classical results from extremal graph theory and discover that the\nTuran graph (or the complete equi-bi-partite network) is the unique efficient\nnetwork under many configurations of parameters. We examine the tradeoffs\nbetween topologies of pairwise stable networks and efficient networks using the\nnotion of price of stability, which is the ratio of the sum of payoffs of the\nplayers in an optimal pairwise stable network to that of an efficient network.\nInterestingly, we find that price of stability is equal to 1 for almost all\nconfigurations of parameters in the proposed model; and for the rest of the\nconfigurations of the parameters, we obtain a lower bound of 0.5 on the price\nof stability.
