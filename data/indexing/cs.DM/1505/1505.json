However, most papers consider submodular set\nfunctions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case\nof submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a\ndeterministic $\\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function\non a bounded integer lattice $\\{0, \\ldots, C\\}^n$ using a Double Greedy\nframework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas\nused for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to\nset functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the\nso-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown\nthat many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer\nlattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the\ninteger lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and\nassume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that\nsome approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular,\nwe can obtain a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality\nconstraint and a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint.
