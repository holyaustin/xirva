It is closely\nrelated to the problem of fast computing the algebraic degree of Boolean\nfunctions. It is an important cryptographic parameter used in the design of\nS-boxes in modern block ciphers, PRNGs in stream ciphers, at Reed-Muller codes,\netc. To find effective solutions to this problem we explore the orders of the\nvectors of the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube $\\{0,1\\}^n$ in accordance with\ntheir weights. The notion of \"$k$-th layer\" of $\\{0,1\\}^n$ is involved in the\ndefinition and examination of the \"weight order\" relation. It is compared with\nthe known relation \"precedes\". Several enumeration problems concerning these\nrelations are solved and the corresponding comments were added to 3 sequences\nin the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). One special order\n(among the numerous weight orders) is defined and examined in detail. The\nlexicographic order is a second criterion for an ordinance of the vectors of\nequal weights. So a total order called Weight-Lexicographic Order (WLO) is\nobtained. Two algorithms for generating the WLO sequence and two algorithms for\ngenerating the characteristic vectors of the layers are proposed.

So far coloring problems are mostly studied\non static graphs, which often stand in stark contrast to practice where data is\ninherently dynamic and subject to discrete changes over time. A temporal graph\nis a graph whose edges are assigned a set of integer time labels, indicating at\nwhich discrete time steps the edge is active. In this paper we present a\nnatural temporal extension of the classical graph coloring problem. Given a\ntemporal graph and a natural number $\\Delta$, we ask for a coloring sequence\nfor each vertex such that (i) in every sliding time window of $\\Delta$\nconsecutive time steps, in which an edge is active, this edge is properly\ncolored (i.e. its endpoints are assigned two different colors) at least once\nduring that time window, and (ii) the total number of different colors is\nminimized. This sliding window temporal coloring problem abstractly captures\nmany realistic graph coloring scenarios in which the underlying network changes\nover time, such as dynamically assigning communication channels to moving\nagents. We present a thorough investigation of the computational complexity of\nthis temporal coloring problem. More specifically, we prove strong\ncomputational hardness results, complemented by efficient exact and\napproximation algorithms.

In the last few years, therefore,\ntree-based phylogenetic networks, which are defined by a spanning tree called a\nsubdivision tree, have attracted attention of theoretical biologists. However,\nthe application of such networks is still not easy, due to many problems whose\ntime complexities are not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a\ngeneral framework for solving those various old or new problems from a coherent\nperspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual problem or\ndeveloping an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure\ntheorem that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary\nphylogenetic network N into maximal zig-zag trails that are uniquely\ndetermined, and use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees of N in the\nform of a direct product, in a way reminiscent of the structure theorem for\nfinitely generated Abelian groups. From the main results, we derive a series of\nlinear time and linear time delay algorithms for the following problems: given\na rooted binary phylogenetic network N, 1) determine whether or not N has a\nsubdivision tree and find one if there exists any; 2) measure the deviation of\nN from being tree-based; 3) compute the number of subdivision trees of N; 4)\nlist all subdivision trees of N; and 5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or\nminimize a prescribed objective function.

The \\emph{Grundy (total) domination number} of a\ngraph is the size of the largest (total) legal dominating sequence. In this\nwork, we address the problems of determining these two parameters by\nintroducing a generalized version of them. We explicitly calculate the\ncorresponding (general) parameter for paths and web graphs. We propose integer\nprogramming formulations for the new problem and we study the polytope\nassociated to one of them. We find families of valid inequalities and derive\nconditions under which they are facet-defining. Finally, we perform\ncomputational experiments to compare the formulations as well as to test valid\ninequalities as cuts in a B\\&C framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 18:11:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Camp\u00ealo", "Manoel", ""], ["Sever\u00edn", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12471", "submitter": "D\\\"om\\\"ot\\\"or P\\'alv\\\"olgyi", "authors": "D\\\"om\\\"ot\\\"or P\\'alv\\\"olgyi and G\\'abor Tardos", "title": "Unlabeled Compression Schemes Exceeding the VC-dimension", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this note we disprove a conjecture of Kuzmin and Warmuth claiming that\nevery family whose VC-dimension is at most d admits an unlabeled compression\nscheme to a sample of size at most d.
