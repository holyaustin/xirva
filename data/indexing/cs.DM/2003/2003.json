This reopens the\nquestion whether triconnected planar graphs admit planar greedy drawings on a\npolynomial-size grid. Further, we provide evidence for a positive answer to the\nabove question by proving that every $n$-vertex Halin graph admits a planar\ngreedy drawing on an $O(n)\\times O(n)$ grid.

In this paper, we are specifically interested in the\nnumber of non-isomorphic trees that appear in the collection of all fringe\nsubtrees of a binary tree. This number is analysed under two different random\nmodels: uniformly random binary trees and random binary search trees.\n  In the case of uniformly random binary trees, we show that the number of\nnon-isomorphic fringe subtrees lies between $c_1n/\\sqrt{\\ln n}(1+o(1))$ and\n$c_2n/\\sqrt{\\ln n}(1+o(1))$ for two constants $c_1 \\approx 1.0591261434$ and\n$c_2 \\approx 1.0761505454$, both in expectation and with high probability,\nwhere $n$ denotes the size (number of leaves) of the uniformly random binary\ntree. A similar result is proven for random binary search trees, but the order\nof magnitude is $n/\\ln n$ in this case.\n  Our proof technique can also be used to strengthen known results on the\nnumber of distinct fringe subtrees (distinct in the sense of ordered trees).\nThis quantity is of the same order of magnitude in both cases, but with\nslightly different constants in the upper and lower bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 17:45:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Benkner", "Louisa Seelbach", ""], ["Wagner", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.03353", "submitter": "Llu\\'is Alemany-Puig", "authors": "Llu\\'is Alemany-Puig, Merc\\`e Mora and Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho", "title": "Reappraising the distribution of the number of edge crossings of graphs\n  on a sphere", "comments": "Corrected mistakes in equation 31.

Through the above-mentioned link to the robust\nsetting, both of these algorithms improve on the current state-of-the-art for\nrobust submodular maximization, showing that approximation factors beyond $1/2$\nare possible. Moreover, exploiting the link of our model to streaming, we\nsettle the approximability for streaming algorithms by presenting a tight\n$1/2+\\varepsilon$ hardness result, based on the construction of a new family of\ncoverage functions. This improves on a prior $1-1/e+\\varepsilon$ hardness and\nmatches, up to an arbitrarily small margin, the best known approximation\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 13:17:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "Moran", ""], ["Norouzi-Fard", "Ashkan", ""], ["Svensson", "Ola", ""], ["Zenklusen", "Rico", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13548", "submitter": "Lars Kastner", "authors": "Lars Kastner, Marta Panizzut", "title": "Hyperplane arrangements in polymake", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hyperplane arrangements form the latest addition to the zoo of combinatorial\nobjects dealt with by polymake.

One of several\nhierarchies towards the stability number of $G$ is the exact subgraph hierarchy\n(ESH). On the first level it computes the Lov\\'{a}sz theta function\n$\\vartheta(G)$ as semidefinite program (SDP) with a matrix variable of order\n$n+1$ and $n+m+1$ constraints. On the $k$-th level it adds all exact subgraph\nconstraints (ESC) for subgraphs of order $k$ to the SDP. An ESC ensures that\nthe submatrix of the matrix variable corresponding to the subgraph is in the\ncorrect polytope. By including only some ESCs into the SDP the ESH can be\nexploited computationally.\n  In this paper we introduce a variant of the ESH that computes $\\vartheta(G)$\nthrough an SDP with a matrix variable of order $n$ and $m+1$ constraints. We\nshow that it makes sense to include the ESCs into this SDP and introduce the\ncompressed ESH (CESH) analogously to the ESH. Computationally the CESH seems\nfavorable as the SDP is smaller. However, we prove that the bounds based on the\nESH are always at least as good as those of the CESH. In computations sometimes\nthey are significantly better.\n  We also introduce scaled ESCs (SESCs), which are a more natural way to\ninclude exactness constraints into the smaller SDP and we prove that including\nan SESC is equivalent to including an ESC for every subgraph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 16:37:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2020 20:14:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Gaar", "Elisabeth", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13641", "submitter": "Hendrik Molter", "authors": "Roman Haag, Hendrik Molter, Rolf Niedermeier, Malte Renken", "title": "Feedback Edge Sets in Temporal Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-60440-0_16", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The classical, linear-time solvable Feedback Edge Set problem is concerned\nwith finding a minimum number of edges intersecting all cycles in a (static,\nunweighted) graph.
