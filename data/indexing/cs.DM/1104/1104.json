Indeed, constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), a wide\nclass of algorithmic problems that occur in many different areas of computer\nscience such as artificial intelligence or database theory, may be viewed as\nasking for homomorphisms between two relational structures [FedVar98]. In a\nlogical setting, homomorphisms may be viewed as witnesses for positive\nprimitive formulas in a relational language. As we shall see, homomorphisms, or\nmore precisely the numbers of homomorphisms between two structures, are also\nrelated to a fundamental computational problem of statistical physics.\n  In this article, we are concerned with the complexity of counting\nhomomorphisms from a given structure A to a fixed structure B. Actually, we are\nmainly interested in a generalization of this problem to weighted homomorphisms\n(or partition functions). We almost exclusively focus on graphs. The first part\nof the article is a short survey of what is known about the problem. In the\nsecond part, we give a proof of a theorem due to Bulatov and the first author\nof this paper [BulGro05], which classifies the complexity of partition\nfunctions described by matrices with non-negative entries. The proof we give\nhere is essentially the same as the original one, with a few shortcuts due to\n[Thu09], but it is phrased in a different, more graph theoretical language that\nmay make it more accessible to most readers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 14:35:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2011 14:41:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 May 2011 14:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Grohe", "Martin", ""], ["Thurley", "Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0291", "submitter": "Hoang-Thach Nguyen", "authors": "Serge Haddad (LSV), Jean Mairesse (LIAFA), Hoang-Thach Nguyen (LIAFA)", "title": "Synthesis and Analysis of Product-form Petri Nets", "comments": "This is a version including proofs of the conference paper: Haddad,\n  Mairesse and Nguyen.

The most\nrelevant measures for a distance-oracle construction are: space, query time,\nand preprocessing time. There are strong distance-oracle constructions known\nfor planar graphs (Thorup, JACM'04) and, subsequently, minor-excluded graphs\n(Abraham and Gavoille, PODC'06). However, these require Omega(eps^{-1} n lg n)\nspace for n-node graphs. We argue that a very low space requirement is\nessential. Since modern computer architectures involve hierarchical memory\n(caches, primary memory, secondary memory), a high memory requirement in effect\nmay greatly increase the actual running time. Moreover, we would like data\nstructures that can be deployed on small mobile devices, such as handhelds,\nwhich have relatively small primary memory. In this paper, for planar graphs,\nbounded-genus graphs, and minor-excluded graphs we give distance-oracle\nconstructions that require only O(n) space. The big O hides only a fixed\nconstant, independent of \\epsilon and independent of genus or size of an\nexcluded minor. The preprocessing times for our distance oracle are also faster\nthan those for the previously known constructions. For planar graphs, the\npreprocessing time is O(n lg^2 n). However, our constructions have slower query\ntimes. For planar graphs, the query time is O(eps^{-2} lg^2 n).
