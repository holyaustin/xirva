For fairness reasons,\nmost mechanisms use randomness, and therefore result in a probabilistic\nassignment. We study the problem of decomposing these probabilistic assignments\ninto a weighted sum of ex-post (Pareto-)efficient matchings, while maximizing\nthe worst-case number of assigned agents. This decomposition preserves all the\nassignments' desirable properties, most notably strategy-proofness. For a\nspecific class of probabilistic assignments, including the assignment by the\nProbabilistic Serial mechanism, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for this\nproblem that obtains a decomposition in which all matchings assign at least the\nexpected number of assigned agents by the probabilistic assignment, rounded\ndown, thus achieving the theoretically best possible guarantee. For general\nprobabilistic assignments, the problem becomes NP-hard. For the Random Serial\nDictatorship (RSD) mechanism, we show that the worst-case number of assigned\nagents by RSD is at least half of the optimal, and that this bound is\nasymptotically tight. Lastly, we propose a column generation framework for the\nintroduced problem, which we evaluate both on randomly generated data, and on\nreal-world school choice data from the Belgian cities Antwerp and Ghent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jan 2021 08:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Demeulemeester", "Tom", ""], ["Goossens", "Dries", ""], ["Hermans", "Ben", ""], ["Leus", "Roel", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00642", "submitter": "Kevin Byrnes", "authors": "Kevin M.

Coalescent theory is a popular class of evolutionary models that\nimplements the molecular clock hypothesis to facilitate computational inference\nof dated phylogenies. Cancer and virus evolution are two areas where these\nmethods are particularly important.\n  Methodologically, phylogenetic inference methods require a tree space over\nwhich the inference is performed, and geometry of this space plays an important\nrole in statistical and computational aspects of tree inference algorithms. It\nhas recently been shown that molecular clock, and hence coalescent, trees\npossess a unique geometry, different from that of classical phylogenetic tree\nspaces which do not model mutation rates.\n  Here we introduce and study a space of discrete coalescent trees, that is, we\nassume that time is discrete, which is inevitable in many computational\nformalisations. We establish several geometrical properties of the space and\nshow how these properties impact various algorithms used in phylogenetic\nanalyses. Our tree space is a discretisation of a known time tree space, called\nt-space, and hence our results can be used to approximate solutions to various\nopen problems in t-space. Our tree space is also a generalisation of another\nknown trees space, called the ranked nearest neighbour interchange space, hence\nour advances in this paper imply new and generalise existing results about\nranked trees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 20:23:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Collienne", "Lena", ""], ["Elmes", "Kieran", ""], ["Fischer", "Mareike", ""], ["Bryant", "David", ""], ["Gavryushkin", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03033", "submitter": "Christopher Thraves Caro", "authors": "Julio Aracena and Christopher Thraves Caro", "title": "On the Recognition of Strong-Robinsonian Incomplete Matrices", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  A matrix is incomplete when some of its entries are missing.

We\nconsider a generalization of this classical problem in which the position of\neach vertex in the graph is a continuous decision variable, constrained to lie\nin a corresponding convex set. The length of an edge is then defined as a\nconvex function of the positions of the vertices it connects. Problems of this\nform arise naturally in road networks, robot navigation, and even optimal\ncontrol of hybrid dynamical systems. The price for such a wide applicability is\nthe complexity of this problem, which is easily seen to be NP-hard. Our main\ncontribution is a strong mixed-integer convex formulation based on perspective\nfunctions. This formulation has a very tight convex relaxation and allows to\nefficiently find globally-optimal paths in large graphs and in high-dimensional\nspaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2021 17:40:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Marcucci", "Tobia", ""], ["Umenberger", "Jack", ""], ["Parrilo", "Pablo A.", ""], ["Tedrake", "Russ", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.11699", "submitter": "Urban Larsson Dr", "authors": "Urban Larsson, Richard J.

However, many phenomena are comprised of polyadic\ninteractions between more than two vertices. Such complex hypergraphs range\nfrom emails among groups of individuals, scholarly collaboration, or joint\ninteractions of proteins in living cells.\n  A key generative principle within social and other complex networks is\ntransitivity, where friends of friends are more likely friends. The previously\nproposed Iterated Local Transitivity (ILT) model incorporated transitivity as\nan evolutionary mechanism. The ILT model provably satisfies many observed\nproperties of social networks, such as densification, low average distances,\nand high clustering coefficients.\n  We propose a new, generative model for complex hypergraphs based on\ntransitivity, called the Iterated Local Transitivity Hypergraph (or ILTH)\nmodel. In ILTH, we iteratively apply the principle of transitivity to form new\nhypergraphs. The resulting model generates hypergraphs simulating properties\nobserved in real-world complex hypergraphs, such as densification and low\naverage distances. We consider properties unique to hypergraphs not captured by\ntheir 2-section. We show that certain motifs, which are specified\nsubhypergraphs of small order, have faster growth rates in ILTH hypergraphs\nthan in random hypergraphs with the same order and expected average degree. We\nshow that the graphs admitting a homomorphism into the 2-section of the initial\nhypergraph appear as induced subgraphs in the 2-section of ILTH hypergraphs. We\nconsider new and existing hypergraph clustering coefficients, and show that\nthese coefficients have larger values in ILTH hypergraphs than in comparable\nrandom hypergraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 13:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Behague", "Natalie C.", ""], ["Bonato", "Anthony", ""], ["Huggan", "Melissa A.", ""], ["Malik", "Rehan", ""], ["Marbach", "Trent G.", ""]]}]
