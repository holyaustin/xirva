This\ntutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner's introduction to topological\nmethods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular,\ninstead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this\ntutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for\nconcrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or\ntracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK.\nFirst, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in\ndata analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely\nParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be\ngiven. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access\nTTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions\nwill concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative\ndata analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers,\nin particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis\nprojects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the\nusage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given.\nPresenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core\nauthors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or\nindustry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises\nand a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines,\ncode, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants.\nThis tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are\nnot experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in\ntheir daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological\nmethods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2018 09:18:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Favelier", "Guillaume", "", "PEQUAN"], ["Gueunet", "Charles", "", "PEQUAN"], ["Gyulassy", "Attila", "", "SCI Institute"], ["Kitware", "Julien", "", "TU\n  Kaiserslautern"], ["Levine", "Joshua", "", "TU\n  Kaiserslautern"], ["Lukasczyk", "Jonas", "", "TU\n  Kaiserslautern"], ["Sakurai", "Daisuke", "", "ZIB"], ["Soler", "Maxime", "", "PEQUAN"], ["Tierny", "Julien", "", "PEQUAN"], ["Usher", "Will", "", "SCI Institute"], ["Wu", "Qi", "", "SCI Institute, UC Davis"]]}, {"id": "1806.08136", "submitter": "Nicolas Gastineau", "authors": "Nicolas Gastineau (Le2i), Olivier Togni (Le2i)", "title": "Coloring of the dth power of the face-centered cubic grid", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The face-centered cubic grid is a three dimensional 12-regular infinite grid.\nThis graph represents an optimal way to pack spheres in the three-dimensional\nspace.

In\nthis paper, we study a partition of a graph into two proportionally dense\nsubgraphs, namely a \\emph{$2$-PDS partition}. The question whether all graphs\n(except stars) have $2$-PDS partition was left open in [Bazgan et al.,\nAlgorithmica 80(6) (2018), 1890--1908]. We give a negative answer on that\nquestion and present a class of graphs without a $2$-PDS partition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:40:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 13:05:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2019 10:47:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 14:26:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bazgan", "Cristina", "", "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine"], ["Chleb\u00edkov\u00e1", "Janka", "", "University of Portsmouth"], ["Dallard", "Cl\u00e9ment", "", "University of Portsmouth"]]}, {"id": "1806.11492", "submitter": "Giacomo Micheli", "authors": "Giacomo Micheli", "title": "Constructions of Locally Recoverable Codes which are Optimal", "comments": "Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2019.2939464", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.CO math.IT math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $q$ be a prime power and $\\mathbb F_q$ be the finite field of size $q$.\nIn this paper we provide a Galois theoretical framework that allows to produce\ngood polynomials for the Tamo and Barg construction of optimal locally\nrecoverable codes (LRC).
