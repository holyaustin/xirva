In this work, we present a Branch-and-Price algorithm for the\nweighted version of the List Coloring Problem, based on the one developed by\nMehrotra and Trick (1996) for the Graph Coloring Problem. This version\nconsiders non-negative weights associated to each color and it is required to\nassign a color to each vertex from predetermined lists in such a way the sum of\nweights of the assigned colors is minimum. Computational experiments show the\ngood performance of our approach, being able to comfortably solve instances\nwhose graphs have up to seventy vertices. These experiences also bring out that\nthe hardness of the instances of the List Coloring Problem does not seem to\ndepend only on quantitative parameters such as the size of the graph, its\ndensity, and the size of list of colors, but also on the distribution of colors\npresent in the lists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:18:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Lucci", "Mauro", ""], ["Nasini", "Graciela", ""], ["Sever\u00edn", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.00617", "submitter": "Jou-Ming Chang", "authors": "Mei-Mei Gu, Rong-Xia Hao, Jou-Ming Chang", "title": "The Component Connectivity of Alternating Group Graphs and Split-Stars", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Access, Vol. 7, (2019) pp. 97745-97759", "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929238", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For an integer $\\ell\\geqslant 2$, the $\\ell$-component connectivity of a\ngraph $G$, denoted by $\\kappa_{\\ell}(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices\nwhose removal from $G$ results in a disconnected graph with at least $\\ell$\ncomponents or a graph with fewer than $\\ell$ vertices.

Many hierarchical clustering algorithms used in practice are\ndeveloped in a procedure manner. Dasgupta proposed to study the hierarchical\nclustering problem from an optimization point of view, and introduced an\nintuitive cost function for similarity-based hierarchical clustering with nice\nproperties as well as natural approximation algorithms.\n  We observe that while Dasgupta's cost function is effective at\ndifferentiating a good HC-tree from a bad one for a fixed graph, the value of\nthis cost function does not reflect how well an input similarity graph is\nconsistent to a hierarchical structure. In this paper, we present a new cost\nfunction, which is developed based on Dasgupta's cost function, to address this\nissue. The optimal tree under the new cost function remains the same as the one\nunder Dasgupta's cost function. However, the value of our cost function is more\nmeaningful. The new way of formulating the cost function also leads to a\npolynomial time algorithm to compute the optimal cluster tree when the input\ngraph has a perfect HC-structure, or an approximation algorithm when the input\ngraph 'almost' has a perfect HC-structure. Finally, we provide further\nunderstanding of the new cost function by studying its behavior for random\ngraphs sampled from an edge probability matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 18:50:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:08:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Dingkang", ""], ["Wang", "Yusu", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02841", "submitter": "Alex Wang", "authors": "Gary L.

We show that determining whether a given graph has hereditary\nindependence gap at most $k$ is polynomial-time solvable if $k$ is fixed and\nco-NP-complete if $k$ is part of input. We also investigate the complexity of\nthe independent set problem in graph classes related to independence gap,\nshowing that the problem is NP-complete in the class of graphs of independence\ngap at most one and polynomial-time solvable in any class of graphs with\nbounded hereditary independence gap. Combined with some known results on\nclaw-free graphs, our results imply that the independent domination problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time in the class of $\\{$claw, 2$P_3\\}$-free graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:55:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ekim", "T\u0131naz", ""], ["G\u00f6z\u00fcpek", "Didem", ""], ["Hujdurovi\u0107", "Ademir", ""], ["Milani\u010d", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.05419", "submitter": "Moritz M\\\"uhlenthaler", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet and Tatsuhiko Hatanaka and Takehiro Ito and Moritz\n  M\\\"uhlenthaler", "title": "Shortest Reconfiguration of Matchings", "comments": "31 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Imagine that unlabelled tokens are placed on the edges of a graph, such that\nno two tokens are placed on incident edges.

We generalize\nthis result to d dimensions (for a fixed d $\\in$ N), and obtain a tight lower\nbound of $\\Omega$(log d--1 n) for the maximum number of points in convex\nposition in a d-dimensional grid. Second, we present polynomial-time algorithms\nfor computing the largest convex chain in a grid that contains no two points of\nthe same x-or y-coordinate. We show how to efficiently approximate the maximum\nsize of a supported convex polygon up to a factor of 2. Finally, we present\nexponential bounds on the maximum number of convex polygons in these grids, and\nfor some restricted variants. These bounds are tight up to polynomial factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 10:45:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["De Carufel", "Jean-Lou", "", "CS"], ["Dumitrescu", "Adrian", "", "CS"], ["Meulemans", "Wouter", "", "ALGCO"], ["Ophelders", "Tim", "", "ALGCO"], ["Pennarun", "Claire", "", "ALGCO"], ["Toth", "Csaba", "", "CPSC"], ["Verdonschot", "Sander", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11476", "submitter": "Cl\\'ement Canonne", "authors": "Jayadev Acharya, Cl\\'ement L.

The referee uses\nthe messages from players to solve an inference problem for the unknown\ndistribution that generated the samples. We derive lower bounds for sample\ncomplexity of learning and testing discrete distributions in this\ninformation-constrained setting.\n  Underlying our bounds is a characterization of the contraction in chi-square\ndistances between the observed distributions of the samples when information\nconstraints are placed. This contraction is captured in a local neighborhood in\nterms of chi-square and decoupled chi-square fluctuations of a given channel,\ntwo quantities we introduce. The former captures the average distance between\ndistributions of channel output for two product distributions on the input, and\nthe latter for a product distribution and a mixture of product distribution on\nthe input. Our bounds are tight for both public- and private-coin protocols.\nInterestingly, the sample complexity of testing is order-wise higher when\nrestricted to private-coin protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 06:29:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Feb 2019 18:04:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Mar 2019 01:55:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 04:30:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Acharya", "Jayadev", ""], ["Canonne", "Cl\u00e9ment L.", ""], ["Tyagi", "Himanshu", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11685", "submitter": "Simone Ingrid Monteiro Gama", "authors": "Simone Gama, Rosiane de Freitas, M\\'ario Salvatierra", "title": "Choosability in bounded sequential list coloring", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The list coloring problem is a variation of the classical vertex coloring\nproblem, extensively studied in recent years, where each vertex has a\nrestricted list of allowed colors, and having some variations as the\n$(\\gamma,\\mu)$-coloring, where the color lists have sequential values with\nknown lower and upper bounds.
