The utility\nreceived by each customer is the sum of the values of the resources allocated\nto her. The goal is to find a feasible allocation of the resources to the\ninterested customers such that for the Max-Min allocation problem (Min-Max\nallocation problem) the minimum of the utilities (maximum of the utilities)\nreceived by the customers is maximized (minimized). The Max-Min allocation\nproblem is also known as the \\textit{Fair Allocation problem}, or the\n\\textit{Santa Claus problem}.

The drawback of such general\nresults is that it is usually not clear how to derive from them constructive\nkernels with reasonably low explicit constants. To fill this gap, we recently\npresented [STACS 2014] a framework to obtain explicit linear kernels for some\nfamilies of problems whose solutions can be certified by a subset of vertices.\nIn this article we enhance our framework to deal with packing problems, that\nis, problems whose solutions can be certified by collections of subgraphs of\nthe input graph satisfying certain properties. ${\\mathcal F}$-Packing is a\ntypical example: for a family ${\\mathcal F}$ of connected graphs that we assume\nto contain at least one planar graph, the task is to decide whether a graph $G$\ncontains $k$ vertex-disjoint subgraphs such that each of them contains a graph\nin ${\\mathcal F}$ as a minor. We provide explicit linear kernels on sparse\ngraphs for the following two orthogonal generalizations of ${\\mathcal\nF}$-Packing: for an integer $\\ell \\geq 1$, one aims at finding either\nminor-models that are pairwise at distance at least $\\ell$ in $G$\n($\\ell$-${\\mathcal F}$-Packing), or such that each vertex in $G$ belongs to at\nmost $\\ell$ minors-models (${\\mathcal F}$-Packing with $\\ell$-Membership).\nFinally, we also provide linear kernels for the versions of these problems\nwhere one wants to pack subgraphs instead of minors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 18:05:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Garnero", "Valentin", ""], ["Paul", "Christophe", ""], ["Sau", "Ignasi", ""], ["Thilikos", "Dimitrios M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.06237", "submitter": "Christopher Duffy", "authors": "Christopher Duffy and Jeannette Janssen", "title": "The Spread of Cooperative Strategies on Grids with Random Asynchronous\n  Updating", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.PR physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Prisoner's Dilemma Process on a graph $G$ is an iterative process where\neach vertex, with a fixed strategy (cooperate or defect), plays the game with\neach of its neighbours.

A drawing is IC-planar if, in addition, each vertex is incident to at\nmost one crossing edge and NIC-planar if two pairs of crossing edges share at\nmost one vertex. In a triangulated drawing each face is a triangle. In\nconsequence, planar-maximal and maximal IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs can be\nrecognized in O(n^5) time and maximum and optimal ones in O(n^3) time. In\ncontrast, recognizing 3-connected IC-planar and NIC-planar graphs is\nNP-complete, even if the graphs are given with a rotation system which\ndescribes the cyclic ordering of the edges at each vertex.

The \"LLL-distribution\" can be used to show that the resulting\nstructures have good global properties in expectation.\n  The simplest, variable-based setting of the LLL was covered by the seminal\nalgorithm of Moser & Tardos (2010). This has since been extended to other\nprobability spaces including random permutations. One can similarly define an\n\"MT-distribution\" for these algorithms, that is, the distribution of the\nconfiguration they produce. Haeupler et al. (2011) showed bounds on the\nMT-distribution which essentially match the LLL-distribution for the\nvariable-assignment setting; Harris & Srinivasan showed similar results for the\npermutation setting.\n  In this work, we show new bounds on the MT-distribution which are\nsignificantly stronger than those known to hold for the LLL-distribution. In\nthe variable-assignment setting, we show a tighter bound on the probability of\na disjunctive event or singleton event. As a consequence, in $k$-SAT instances\nwith bounded variable occurrence, the MT-distribution satisfies an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate independence condition asymptotically stronger than the\nLLL-distribution. We use this to show a nearly tight bound on the minimum\nimplicate size of a CNF boolean formula. Another noteworthy application is\nconstructing independent transversals which avoid a given subset of vertices;\nthis provides a constructive analogue to a result of Rabern (2014).\n  In the permutation LLL setting, we show a new type of bound which is similar\nto the cluster-expansion LLL criterion of Bissacot et al. (2011), but is\nstronger and takes advantage of the extra structure in permutations.
