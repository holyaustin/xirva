This gives a\npolynomial time algorithm for determining the DAG-width of a graph for any\nfixed $k$. However, if the DAG-width of the graphs from a class is not bounded,\nsuch algorithms become exponential. This raises the question whether we can\nalways find a DAG decomposition of size polynomial in $n$ as it is the case for\ntree width and all generalisations of tree width similar to DAG-width.\n  We show that there is an infinite class of graphs such that every DAG\ndecomposition of optimal width has size super-polynomial in $n$ and, moreover,\nthere is no polynomial size DAG decomposition which would approximate an\noptimal decomposition up to an additive constant.\n  In the second part we use our construction to prove that deciding whether the\nDAG-width of a given graph is at most a given constant is PSPACE-complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 14:27:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Dec 2014 10:57:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Dec 2014 10:32:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 20:47:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Amiri", "Saeed Akhoondian", ""], ["Kreutzer", "Stephan", ""], ["Rabinovich", "Roman", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2547", "submitter": "Yong Kong", "authors": "Yong Kong", "title": "Statistical distributions of sequencing by synthesis with probabilistic\n  nucleotide incorporation", "comments": "25 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computational Biology.

This is the first o(mn) time deterministic\nalgorithm for the problem. In near-linear time we can also construct the\nclassic cactus representation of all minimum cuts.\n  The previous fastest deterministic algorithm by Gabow from STOC'91 took\n~O(m+k^2 n), where k is the edge connectivity, but k could be Omega(n).\n  At STOC'96 Karger presented a randomized near linear time Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for the minimum cut problem. As he points out, there is no better way\nof certifying the minimality of the returned cut than to use Gabow's slower\ndeterministic algorithm and compare sizes.\n  Our main technical contribution is a near-linear time algorithm that contract\nvertex sets of a simple input graph G with minimum degree d, producing a\nmultigraph with ~O(m/d) edges which preserves all minimum cuts of G with at\nleast 2 vertices on each side.\n  In our deterministic near-linear time algorithm, we will decompose the\nproblem via low-conductance cuts found using PageRank a la Brin and Page\n(1998), as analyzed by Andersson, Chung, and Lang at FOCS'06. Normally such\nalgorithms for low-conductance cuts are randomized Monte Carlo algorithms,\nbecause they rely on guessing a good start vertex.

For the two problems, we construct schedules that are 4/3\ntimes (for Interval Patrolling) and 21/20 times (for Circle Patrolling) as\ngood, respectively, as the simple strategies. We also propose a new variant, in\nwhich we want to patrol a single point under the constraint that each agent can\nonly visit the point some predefined time after its previous visit. We obtain\nsome similar ratio bounds and NP-hardness results related to this problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2014 13:17:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 05:38:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 03:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kawamura", "Akitoshi", ""], ["Soejima", "Makoto", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.6997", "submitter": "Guillem Perarnau", "authors": "Nicolas Bousquet and Guillem Perarnau", "title": "Fast Recoloring of Sparse Graphs", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show that for every graph of maximum average degree bounded\naway from $d$, any $(d+1)$-coloring can be transformed into any other one\nwithin a polynomial number of vertex recolorings so that, at each step, the\ncurrent coloring is proper.

Every proper $k$-coloring of $G$ may be viewed as a homomorphism\n(an edge-preserving vertex mapping) of $G$ to the complete graph of order $k$.\nBy considering homomorphisms of oriented graphs (digraphs without cycles of\nlength at most 2), we get a natural notion of (oriented) colorings and oriented\nchromatic number of oriented graphs. An oriented clique is then an oriented\ngraph whose number of vertices and oriented chromatic number coincide. However,\nthe structure of oriented cliques is much less understood than in the\nundirected case.\n  In this paper, we study the structure of outerplanar and planar oriented\ncliques. We first provide a list of 11 graphs and prove that an outerplanar\ngraph can be oriented as an oriented clique if and only if it contains one of\nthese graphs as a spanning subgraph.

Of course, such a smallest graph must be a complete graph as\nthey are the only graphs with chromatic number equal to their order.\n  The concept of vertex coloring can be generalize for other types of graphs.\nNaturally, the chromatic number is defined to be the order of the smallest\ngraph (of the same type) to which a graph admits homomorphism to. The analogous\nnotion of clique turns out to be the graphs with order equal to their (so\ndefined) \"chromatic number\". These \"cliques\" turns out to be much more\ncomplicated than their undirected counterpart and are interesting objects of\nstudy.
