Recently, using this max-plus algebra approach, it\nhas been shown that the Maximum Empower Principle can be formalized as a new\ncombinatorial optimization problem (called the Maximum Empower Problem).\n  In this paper we show that the Maximum Empower Problem can be solved by\nfinding a maximum weighted clique in a cograph, which leads to an\nexponential-time algorithm in the worst-case. We also provide a polynomial-time\nalgorithm when there is no cycle in the graph modeling the system. Finally, we\nprove that the Maximum Empower Problem is #P-hard in the general case, i.e. it\nis as hard as computing the permanent of a matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:20:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lahlou", "Chams", ""], ["Truffet", "Laurent", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.06021", "submitter": "Torsten M\\\"utze", "authors": "Petr Gregor, Sven J\\\"ager, Torsten M\\\"utze, Joe Sawada, Kaja Wille", "title": "Gray codes and symmetric chains", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of constructing a cyclic listing of all bitstrings of\nlength $2n+1$ with Hamming weights in the interval $[n+1-\\ell,n+\\ell]$, where\n$1\\leq \\ell\\leq n+1$, by flipping a single bit in each step.

With one bit of\ninstructions and one bit of memory for each vertex, we can construct a family\nof perfect graphs that strictly includes threshold graphs. We consider the case\nin which memory lasts for a single time step, and show that as well as the\nstandard threshold graphs, linear forests are also producible. We show further\nthat the number of random bits (with no memory or instructions) needed to\nconstruct any graph is asymptotically the same as required for the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph. We also briefly consider constructing trees in\nthis scheme. The problem of defining a hierarchy of graphs in the proposed\nframework is fully open.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 12:11:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dervovic", "Danial", ""], ["Mocherla", "Avinash", ""], ["Severini", "Simone", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.09969", "submitter": "Bartosz Walczak", "authors": "Torsten M\\\"utze, Bartosz Walczak, Veit Wiechert", "title": "Realization of shift graphs as disjointness graphs of 1-intersecting\n  curves in the plane", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is shown that shift graphs can be realized as disjointness graphs of\n1-intersecting curves in the plane.

Each resource has a fixed cost that has to be shared by\nthe players, and each agent has a nonshareable player-specific delay for each\nresource. A prominent example is uncapacitated facility location (UFL), where\nfacilities need to be opened (at a shareable cost) and clients want to connect\nto opened facilities. Each client pays a cost share and his non-shareable\nphysical connection cost. Given any profile of subsets allocated by the agents,\na separable cost sharing protocol determines cost shares that satisfy budget\nbalance on every resource and separability over the resources. Moreover, a\nseparable protocol guarantees existence of pure Nash equilibria in the induced\nstrategic game for the agents. In this paper, we study separable cost sharing\nprotocols in several general combinatorial domains. We provide black-box\nreductions to reduce the design of a separable cost-sharing protocol to the\ndesign of an approximation algorithm for the underlying cost minimization\nproblem. In this way, we obtain new separable cost-sharing protocols in games\nbased on arbitrary player-specific matroids, single-source connection games\nwithout delays, and connection games on $n$-series-parallel graphs with delays.\nAll these reductions are efficiently computable - given an initial allocation\nprofile, we obtain a cheaper profile and separable cost shares turning the\nprofile into a pure Nash equilibrium. Hence, in these domains any approximation\nalgorithm can be used to obtain a separable cost sharing protocol with a price\nof stability bounded by the approximation factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Harks", "Tobias", ""], ["Hoefer", "Martin", ""], ["Huber", "Anja", ""], ["Surek", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10386", "submitter": "Petr Golovach", "authors": "Petr A.

This is a generalization of Strong Triadic Closure, whereas\nit is a relaxation of F-free Edge Deletion. In Strong F-closure, we want to\nselect a maximum number of edges of the input graph G, and mark them as strong\nedges, in the following way: whenever a subset of the strong edges forms a\nsubgraph isomorphic to F, then the corresponding induced subgraph of G is not\nisomorphic to F. Hence the subgraph of G defined by the strong edges is not\nnecessarily F-free, but whenever it contains a copy of F, there are additional\nedges in G to destroy that strong copy of F in G.\n  We study Strong F-closure from a parameterized perspective with various\nnatural parameterizations. Our main focus is on the number k of strong edges as\nthe parameter. We show that the problem is FPT with this parameterization for\nevery fixed graph F, whereas it does not admit a polynomial kernel even when F\n=P_3. In fact, this latter case is equivalent to the Strong Triadic Closure\nproblem, which motivates us to study this problem on input graphs belonging to\nwell known graph classes. We show that Strong Triadic Closure does not admit a\npolynomial kernel even when the input graph is a split graph, whereas it admits\na polynomial kernel when the input graph is planar, and even d-degenerate.\nFurthermore, on graphs of maximum degree at most 4, we show that Strong Triadic\nClosure is FPT with the above guarantee parameterization k - \\mu(G), where\n\\mu(G) is the maximum matching size of G. We conclude with some results on the\nparameterization of Strong F-closure by the number of edges of G that are not\nselected as strong.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 12:46:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Golovach", "Petr A.", ""], ["Heggernes", "Pinar", ""], ["Konstantinidis", "Athanasios L.", ""], ["Lima", "Paloma T.", ""], ["Papadopoulos", "Charis", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10400", "submitter": "Pac\\^ome Perrotin", "authors": "K\\'evin Perrot, Pac\\^ome Perrotin and Sylvain Sen\\'e", "title": "A framework for (de)composing with Boolean automata networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.LO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Boolean automata networks (BANs) are a generalisation of Boolean cellular\nautomata.

The goal is to\nfind a min-cost subgraph $H$ that connects the root to every group. We consider\na fault-tolerant variant of GST, which we call Restricted (Rooted) Group SNDP.\nIn this setting, each group $S_i$ has a demand $k_i\\in[k],k\\in\\mathbb N$, and\nwe wish to find a min-cost $H\\subseteq G$ such that, for each group $S_i$,\nthere is a vertex in $S_i$ connected to the root via $k_i$ (vertex or edge)\ndisjoint paths.\n  While GST admits $O(\\log^2 n\\log h)$ approximation, its high connectivity\nvariants are Label-Cover hard, and for the vertex-weighted version, the\nhardness holds even when $k=2$. Previously, positive results were known only\nfor the edge-weighted version when $k=2$ [Gupta et al., SODA 2010; Khandekar et\nal., Theor. Comput. Sci., 2012] and for a relaxed variant where the disjoint\npaths may end at different vertices in a group [Chalermsook et al., SODA 2015].\n  Our main result is an $O(\\log n\\log h)$ approximation for Restricted Group\nSNDP that runs in time $n^{f(k, w)}$, where $w$ is the treewidth of $G$. This\nnearly matches the lower bound when $k$ and $w$ are constant. The key to\nachieving this result is a non-trivial extension of the framework in\n[Chalermsook et al., SODA 2017], which embeds all feasible solutions to the\nproblem into a dynamic program (DP) table. However, finding the optimal\nsolution in the DP table remains intractable. We formulate a linear program\nrelaxation for the DP and obtain an approximate solution via randomized\nrounding. This framework also allows us to systematically construct DP tables\nfor high-connectivity problems. As a result, we present new exact algorithms\nfor several variants of survivable network design problems in low-treewidth\ngraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 13:38:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chalermsook", "Parinya", ""], ["Das", "Syamantak", ""], ["Even", "Guy", ""], ["Laekhanukit", "Bundit", ""], ["Vaz", "Daniel", ""]]}]
