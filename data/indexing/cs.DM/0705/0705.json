This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash\nequilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still\nbe defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are\nequivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential\ngame has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect\nequilibrium.
