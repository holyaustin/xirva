The\nbest known approximation algorithm for this problem guarantees an approximation\nfactor of 2. It is known to be NP-hard to approximate with a better ratio than\n3/2. Closing this gap has been open for over 20 years. The best known\napproximation factors are achieved by LP-based algorithms.

The dimension of a poset G is the\nsmallest d such that G can be embedded into a d-dimensional directed hypergrid\nvia an order-preserving embedding.\n  We present a nearly tight lower bound on the size of Steiner 2-TC-spanners of\nd-dimensional directed hypergrids. It implies better lower bounds on the\ncomplexity of local reconstructors of monotone functions and functions with low\nLipschitz constant. The proof of the lower bound constructs a dual solution to\na linear programming relaxation of the Steiner 2-TC-spanner problem. We also\nshow that one can efficiently construct a Steiner 2-TC-spanner, of size\nmatching the lower bound, for any low-dimensional poset. Finally, we present a\nlower bound on the size of Steiner k-TC-spanners of d-dimensional posets that\nshows that the best-known construction, due to De Santis et al., cannot be\nimproved significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Nov 2010 22:40:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Berman", "Piotr", ""], ["Bhattacharyya", "Arnab", ""], ["Grigorescu", "Elena", ""], ["Raskhodnikova", "Sofya", ""], ["Woodruff", "David", ""], ["Yaroslavtsev", "Grigory", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6187", "submitter": "Jens M.
