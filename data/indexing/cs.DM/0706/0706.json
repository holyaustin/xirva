As for other classic dynamical\nsystems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional\nsystems is a long lasting challenging problem.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D\nasynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,\nupdates to the minority state of its neighborhood.
