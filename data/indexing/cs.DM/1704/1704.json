Formally, for a class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ of graphs, the Bounded $\\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion\nproblem asks, given a graph~$G$ on $n$ vertices and positive integers~$k$\nand~$d$, whether $G$ contains a set~$S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that each\nblock of $G-S$ has at most $d$ vertices and is in $\\mathcal{P}$. Assuming that\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is recognizable in polynomial time and satisfies a certain\nnatural hereditary condition, we give a sharp characterization of when\nsingle-exponential parameterized algorithms are possible for fixed values of\n$d$: if $\\mathcal{P}$ consists only of chordal graphs, then the problem can be\nsolved in time $2^{\\mathcal{O}(wd^2)} n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and if $\\mathcal{P}$\ncontains a graph with an induced cycle of length $\\ell\\ge 4$, then the problem\nis not solvable in time $2^{o(w\\log w)} n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ even for fixed\n$d=\\ell$, unless the ETH fails. We also study a similar problem, called Bounded\n$\\mathcal{P}$-Component Vertex Deletion, where the target graphs have connected\ncomponents of small size rather than blocks of small size, and we present\nanalogous results. For this problem, we also show that if $d$ is part of the\ninput and $\\mathcal{P}$ contains all chordal graphs, then it cannot be solved\nin time $f(w)n^{o(w)}$ for some function $f$, unless the ETH fails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 06:29:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:52:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bonnet", "\u00c9douard", ""], ["Brettell", "Nick", ""], ["Kwon", "O-joung", ""], ["Marx", "D\u00e1niel", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07067", "submitter": "Jannik Matuschke", "authors": "Jannik Matuschke, S.

In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this\nrobustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it\nfrom existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the\nnetwork.\n  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable\nflows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for\nrerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an\ns-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.\nIt turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found\nusing a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum\nreroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}. However,\nthe tightening can be used to get a 2-approximation for reroutable flows. This\nratio is tight in general networks, but we show that in the case of unit\ncapacities, every reroutable flow can be transformed into a strictly reroutable\nflow of same value.

They and their dual\ncounterpart, network flow interdiction, have received steady attention within\nthe operations research community over the past years. One of the most basic\nmodels is the Maximum Robust Flow Problem: Given a network and an integer k,\nthe task is to find a path flow of maximum robust value, i.e., the guaranteed\nvalue of surviving flow after removal of any k arcs in the network. The\ncomplexity of this problem appeared to have been settled almost a decade ago:\nAneja et al.

For the case that k is not bounded by a\nconstant, we present a new hardness proof, establishing that the problem is\nstrongly NP-hard, even when only two different capacity values occur and the\nnumber of paths is polynomial in the size of the input.
