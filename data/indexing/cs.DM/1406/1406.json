The\nsolution of the equation is formulated as a least squares (LS) problem with\nlinear constraints. The LS approach makes the method suitable for the explicit\nsolution of inverse problems where the forcing function is perturbed by noise.\nThe algebraic computation is partitioned into a initial preparatory step, which\nprecomputes the matrices required for the run-time computation; and the cyclic\nrun-time computation, which is repeated with each acquisition of sensor data.\nThe cyclic computation consists of a single matrix-vector multiplication, in\nthis manner computation complexity is known a-priori, fulfilling the definition\nof a real-time computation.

In this work, we consider the\ncolouring model. A basic question here is whether the root's assignment affects\nthe distribution of the colourings at the vertices at distance h from the root.\nThis is the so-called \"reconstruction problem\". For a d-ary tree it is well\nknown that d/ln (d) is the reconstruction threshold.

This model arises naturally in many\ncontexts, e.g. the theory of spin-glasses and its applications on random\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (rCSP). The aforementioned study focuses on\nGalton-Watson trees with offspring distribution B(n,d/n), i.e. the binomial\nwith parameters n and d/n, where d is fixed. Here we consider a broader version\nof the problem, as we assume general offspring distribution, which includes\nB(n,d/n) as a special case.\n  Our approach relates the corresponding bounds for (non)reconstruction to\ncertain concentration properties of the offspring distribution. This allows to\nderive reconstruction thresholds for a very wide family of offspring\ndistributions, which includes B(n,d/n). A very interesting corollary is that\nfor distributions with expected offspring d, we get reconstruction threshold\nd/ln(d) under weaker concentration conditions than what we have in B(n,d/n).\n  Furthermore, our reconstruction threshold for the random colorings of\nGalton-Watson with offspring B(n,d/n), implies the reconstruction threshold for\nthe random colourings of G(n,d/n).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 19:49:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:02:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Efthymiou", "Charilaos", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.3672", "submitter": "Aurko Roy", "authors": "Aurko Roy", "title": "Deterministic polynomial factoring under the assumption of the Extended\n  Riemann Hypothesis (ERH)", "comments": "Master's Thesis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of deterministically factoring a univariate\npolynomial over a finite field under the assumption of the Extended Riemann\nHypothesis (ERH).
