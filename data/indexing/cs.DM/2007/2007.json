This is a fundamental graph\nmining primitive, with applications in social network analysis and\nbioinformatics. In this work, we give the following results. (1) A near-tight\nbound for the classic $k$-graphlet random walk, as a function of the mixing\ntime of $G$. In particular, ignoring $k^{O(k)}$ factors, we show that the\nrandom walk mixes in time $\\tilde{\\Theta}(t(G) \\cdot \\rho(G)^{k-1})$, where\n$t(G)$ is the mixing time of $G$ and $\\rho(G)$ is the ratio between its maximum\nand minimum degree. (2) The first efficient algorithm for uniform graphlet\nsampling. The algorithm has a preprocessing phase that uses time ${O}(n k^2 \\ln\nk + m)$ and space $O(n)$, and a sampling phase that uses $k^{O(k)} O(\\log\n\\Delta)$ time per sample. (3) A near-optimal algorithm for $\\epsilon$-uniform\ngraphlet sampling. The preprocessing takes time $O\\big(\\frac{k^6}{\\epsilon}\\, n\n\\log n \\big)$ and space $O(n)$, and the sampling takes\n$k^{O(k)}O\\big((\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{10}\\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\big)$ expected\ntime per sample.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2020 16:08:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2020 13:08:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2021 18:07:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 18:49:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 07:55:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bressan", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.12282", "submitter": "George Kenison", "authors": "George Kenison, Oleksiy Klurman, Engel Lefaucheux, Florian Luca,\n  Pieter Moree, Jo\\\"el Ouaknine, Markus A.

A $k$-queue layout is defined similarly, except that\nno two edges in a single set may be nested.\n  It was recently proved that graphs of various non-minor-closed classes are\nsubgraphs of the strong product of a path and a graph with bounded treewidth.\nMotivated by this decomposition result, we explore stack layouts of graph\nproducts. We show that the stack number is bounded for the strong product of a\npath and (i) a graph of bounded pathwidth or (ii) a bipartite graph of bounded\ntreewidth and bounded degree.

Attempts to quantify the\ndegree of optimality of languages by means of an optimality score have been\nscarce and focused mostly on English. Here we recast the problem of the\noptimality of the word order of a sentence as an optimization problem on a\nspatial network where the vertices are words, arcs indicate syntactic\ndependencies and the space is defined by the linear order of the words in the\nsentence. We introduce a new score to quantify the cognitive pressure to reduce\nthe distance between linked words in a sentence. The analysis of sentences from\n93 languages representing 19 linguistic families reveals that half of languages\nare optimized to a 70% or more. The score indicates that distances are not\nsignificantly reduced in a few languages and confirms two theoretical\npredictions, i.e. that longer sentences are more optimized and that distances\nare more likely to be longer than expected by chance in short sentences. We\npresent a new hierarchical ranking of languages by their degree of\noptimization. The statistical advantages of the new score call for a\nreevaluation of the evolution of dependency distance over time in languages as\nwell as the relationship between dependency distance and linguistic competence.\nFinally, the principles behind the design of the score can be extended to\ndevelop more powerful normalizations of topological distances or physical\ndistances in more dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 09:40:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2020 22:15:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2021 13:25:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrer-i-Cancho", "Ramon", ""], ["G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez", "Carlos", ""], ["Esteban", "Juan Luis", ""], ["Alemany-Puig", "Llu\u00eds", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15362", "submitter": "Simon D.
