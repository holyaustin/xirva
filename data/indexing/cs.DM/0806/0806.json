The \\emph{untangling problem} is to eliminate all edge crossings by\nmoving as few vertices as possible to new positions. Let $fix(G)$ denote the\nmaximum number of vertices that can be left fixed in the worst case. In the\n\\emph{allocation problem}, we are given a planar graph $G$ on $n$ vertices\ntogether with an $n$-point set $X$ in the plane and have to draw $G$ without\nedge crossings so that as many vertices as possible are located in $X$. Let\n$fit(G)$ denote the maximum number of points fitting this purpose in the worst\ncase. As $fix(G)\\le fit(G)$, we are interested in upper bounds for the latter\nand lower bounds for the former parameter.\n  For each $\\epsilon>0$, we construct an infinite sequence of graphs with\n$fit(G)=O(n^{\\sigma+\\epsilon})$, where $\\sigma<0.99$ is a known graph-theoretic\nconstant, namely the shortness exponent for the class of cubic polyhedral\ngraphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of graphs with\n$fit(G)=o(n)$. On the other hand, we prove that $fix(G)\\ge\\sqrt{n/30}$ for all\n$G$ with tree-width at most 2. This extends the lower bound obtained by Goaoc\net al. [Discrete and Computational Geometry 42:542-569 (2009)] for outerplanar\ngraphs.\n  Our upper bound for $fit(G)$ is based on the fact that the constructed graphs\ncan have only few collinear vertices in any crossing-free drawing. To prove the\nlower bound for $fix(G)$, we show that graphs of tree-width 2 admit drawings\nthat have large sets of collinear vertices with some additional special\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 18:01:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Jul 2008 12:17:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 09:43:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 15:18:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 11 Nov 2011 12:09:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ravsky", "Alexander", ""], ["Verbitsky", "Oleg", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0311", "submitter": "Dieter Mitsche", "authors": "J.

The kPC problem is to find a $k$-fixed-endpoint path cover of\n$G$ of minimum cardinality; note that, if $\\mathcal{T}$ is empty the stated\nproblem coincides with the classical path cover problem. In this paper, we\nstudy the 1-fixed-endpoint path cover problem on interval graphs, or 1PC for\nshort, generalizing the 1HP problem which has been proved to be NP-complete\neven for small classes of graphs. Motivated by a work of Damaschke, where he\nleft both 1HP and 2HP problems open for the class of interval graphs, we show\nthat the 1PC problem can be solved in polynomial time on the class of interval\ngraphs. The proposed algorithm is simple, runs in $O(n^2)$ time, requires\nlinear space, and also enables us to solve the 1HP problem on interval graphs\nwithin the same time and space complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2008 18:13:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Asdre", "Katerina", ""], ["Nikolopoulos", "Stavros D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4735", "submitter": "Shai  Gutner", "authors": "Noga Alon and Shai Gutner", "title": "Linear Time Algorithms for Finding a Dominating Set of Fixed Size in\n  Degenerated Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc. of 13th COCOON (2007), 394-405", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is substantial literature dealing with fixed parameter algorithms for\nthe dominating set problem on various families of graphs. In this paper, we\ngive a $k^{O(dk)} n$ time algorithm for finding a dominating set of size at\nmost $k$ in a $d$-degenerated graph with $n$ vertices. This proves that the\ndominating set problem is fixed-parameter tractable for degenerated graphs. For\ngraphs that do not contain $K_h$ as a topological minor, we give an improved\nalgorithm for the problem with running time $(O(h))^{hk} n$. For graphs which\nare $K_h$-minor-free, the running time is further reduced to $(O(\\log\nh))^{hk/2} n$. Fixed-parameter tractable algorithms that are linear in the\nnumber of vertices of the graph were previously known only for planar graphs.\n  For the families of graphs discussed above, the problem of finding an induced\ncycle of a given length is also addressed. For every fixed $H$ and $k$, we show\nthat if an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ with $n$ vertices contains an induced cycle\nof size $k$, then such a cycle can be found in O(n) expected time as well as in\n$O(n \\log n)$ worst-case time. Some results are stated concerning the\n(im)possibility of establishing linear time algorithms for the more general\nfamily of degenerated graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jun 2008 06:09:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alon", "Noga", ""], ["Gutner", "Shai", ""]]}]
