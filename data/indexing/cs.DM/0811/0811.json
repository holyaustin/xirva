Our dichotomy\ntheorem extends to the case in which the relation $H$ is weighted, and the goal\nis to compute the \\emph{partition function}, which is the sum of weights of the\nhomomorphisms. This problem is motivated by statistical physics, where it\narises as computing the partition function for particle models in which certain\ncombinations of $r$ sites interact symmetrically. In the weighted case, our\ndichotomy theorem generalises a result of Bulatov and Grohe (2005) for graphs,\nwhere $r=2$. When $r=2$, the polynomial time cases of the dichotomy correspond\nsimply to rank-1 weights. Surprisingly, for all $r>2$ the polynomial time cases\nof the dichotomy have rather more structure. It turns out that the weights must\nbe superimposed on a combinatorial structure defined by solutions of an\nequation over an Abelian group.

The first non-trivial algorithm,\nwith running time $O(mn)$, dates back to K\\\"{o}nig's work in 1916 (here $m=nd$\nis the number of edges in the graph, $2n$ is the number of vertices, and $d$ is\nthe degree of each node). The currently most efficient algorithm takes time\n$O(m)$, and is due to Cole, Ost, and Schirra. We improve this running time to\n$O(\\min\\{m, \\frac{n^{2.5}\\ln n}{d}\\})$; this minimum can never be larger than\n$O(n^{1.75}\\sqrt{\\ln n})$. We obtain this improvement by proving a uniform\nsampling theorem: if we sample each edge in a $d$-regular bipartite graph\nindependently with a probability $p = O(\\frac{n\\ln n}{d^2})$ then the resulting\ngraph has a perfect matching with high probability. The proof involves a\ndecomposition of the graph into pieces which are guaranteed to have many\nperfect matchings but do not have any small cuts.
