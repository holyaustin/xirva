A set of primes whose sum equals f is\ncalled a basis for f, so a solution to the problem is a minimum-cost basis.\n  The algorithms construct the following canonical partition of the complete\nset of primes and identify the members of sets 1, 2, and 3:\n  (1) Essential Primes, which must be part of any basis for f,\n  (2) Unnecessary Primes that cannot be part of a minimum-cost basis for f for\nany positive additive cost function,\n  (3) Unique disjoint sets of primes, PS1,...,PSN with associated \"covering\"\ntables TS1,..., TSN such that any minimum-cost basis consists of the union of\nthe sets\n  Essential Primes, QS1(C), ..., QSN(C) where QSi(C) is contained in PSi and\nQSi(C) is a minimum-cost \"cover\" for PSi. Covering is defined by operation\nCascade(QS, TS), which has the property that QS covers PS if and only if\nCascade(QS, TS) is empty.\n  The key to the results is the study of objects called Ancestor Sets. The\nAncestor Theorem proves that if A is an Ancestor Set for f, every minimum-cost\nbasis includes a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes PS in Ancestor Set A\nand a minimum-cost cover for the set of primes that are not in A (and are not\ncovered by the the union of the Essentials with PS). The PSi in the partition\nare the sets of primes in canonical disjoint Independent Ancestor Sets Ai,\nwhich are easy to generate when the calculation of the primes (and their\nconsensus combinations) is within computational scope. The paper also presents\na condition under which QSi(C) can be easily determined, and another condition\nsuch that PSi can be broken into disjoint pieces that can be minimized\nseparately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 21:14:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 11:49:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Oct 2013 20:44:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 16:48:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 14:45:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 9 Apr 2014 20:49:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2014 13:48:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 19:54:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Wed, 23 Jul 2014 21:32:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 14:15:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Feit", "Sidnie", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0038", "submitter": "Stanis{\\l} aw Radziszowski", "authors": "Jan Goedgebeur, Stanis{\\l}aw P.

The objective is to determine whether there exists a set S of at\nmost k vertices such that G-S is a tree. The problem is NP-complete and even\nNP-hard to approximate within any factor of OPT^c for any constant c. In this\npaper we give a O(k^4) size kernel for the Tree Deletion Set problem. To the\nbest of our knowledge our result is the first counterexample to the\n\"conventional wisdom\" that kernelization algorithms automatically provide\napproximation algorithms with approximation ratio close to the size of the\nkernel. An appealing feature of our kernelization algorithm is a new algebraic\nreduction rule that we use to handle the instances on which Tree Deletion Set\nis hard to approximate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 15:46:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Giannopoulou", "Archontia C.", ""], ["Lokshtanov", "Daniel", ""], ["Saurabh", "Saket", ""], ["Suchy", "Ondrej", ""]]}]
