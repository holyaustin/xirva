The algebraic\nstructures the most encountered here are magmas, posets, associative algebras,\ndendriform algebras, Hopf bialgebras, operads, and pros. This work explores the\naforementioned research direction and provides many constructions having the\nparticularity to build algebraic structures on combinatorial objects. We\ndevelop for instance a functor from nonsymmetric colored operads to\nnonsymmetric operads, from monoids to operads, from unitary magmas to\nnonsymmetric operads, from finite posets to nonsymmetric operads, from stiff\npros to Hopf bialgebras, and from precompositions to nonsymmetric operads.\nThese constructions bring alternative ways to describe already known structures\nand provide new ones, as for instance, some of the deformations of the\nnoncommutative Fa\\`a di Bruno Hopf bialgebra of Foissy and a generalization of\nthe dendriform operad of Loday.
