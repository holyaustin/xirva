We\npresent several MPI+GPU coloring approaches based on the distributed coloring\nalgorithms of Gebremedhin et al. and the shared-memory algorithms of Deveci et\nal. . The on-node parallel coloring uses implementations in KokkosKernels,\n  which provide parallelization for both multicore CPUs and GPUs.

In our setting, each ball also samples two random bins but can only\nestimate a bin's load by sending $\\textit{binary queries}$ of the form \"Is the\nload at least the median?\" or \"Is the load at least $100$?\".\n  For the lightly loaded case $m=O(n)$, one can achieve an $O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log\n\\log n})$ maximum load with one query per chosen bin using an oblivious\nstrategy, as shown by Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich (2018). For the case\n$m=\\Omega(n)$, the authors conjectured that the same strategy achieves a\nmaximum load of $m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n/\\log \\log n})$. In this work, we disprove\nthis conjecture by showing a lower bound of $m/n+\\Omega( \\sqrt{\\log n})$ for a\nfixed $m=\\Theta(n \\sqrt{\\log n})$, and a lower bound of $m/n+\\Omega(\\log\nn/\\log\\log n)$ for some $m$ depending on the used strategy. Surprisingly, these\nlower bounds hold even for any $\\textit{adaptive strategy}$ with one query,\ni.e., queries may depend on the full history of the process.\n  We complement this negative result by proving a positive result for multiple\nqueries. In particular, we show that with only two binary queries per chosen\nbin, there is an oblivious strategy which ensures a maximum load of\n$m/n+O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ whp for any $m \\geq 1$. For any $k=O(\\log \\log n)$\nbinary queries, the upper bound on the maximum load improves to $m/n+O(k(\\log\nn)^{1/k})$ whp for any $m \\geq 1$. Hence for $k=\\Theta(\\log\\log n)$, we recover\nthe two-choice result up to a constant multiplicative factor, including the\nheavily loaded case where $m=\\Omega(n)$. One novel aspect of our proof\ntechniques is the use of multiple super-exponential potential functions, which\nmight be of use in future work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2021 15:49:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Los", "Dimitrios", ""], ["Sauerwald", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.03932", "submitter": "Kewen Wu", "authors": "Kun He, Xiaoming Sun, Kewen Wu", "title": "Perfect Sampling for (Atomic) Lov\\'asz Local Lemma", "comments": "56 pages, 1 table, 5 figures, 9 algorithms", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a Markov chain based perfect sampler for uniform sampling solutions\nof constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).

Our goal in\nthis paper is to fill in this gap and obtain strong inapproximability results\nby studying the prototypical problem in this class of CSPs, hypergraph\ncolourings.\n  More precisely, we focus on the problem of approximately counting\n$q$-colourings on $K$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree $\\Delta$. An\nefficient algorithm exists if $\\Delta\\lesssim \\frac{q^{K/3-1}}{4^KK^2}$ (Jain,\nPham, and Voung, 2021; He, Sun, and Wu, 2021). Somewhat surprisingly however, a\nhardness bound is not known even for the easier problem of finding colourings.\nFor the counting problem, the situation is even less clear and there is no\nevidence of the right constant controlling the growth of the exponent in terms\nof $K$.\n  To this end, we first establish that for general $q$ computational hardness\nfor finding a colouring on simple/linear hypergraphs occurs at $\\Delta\\gtrsim\nKq^K$, almost matching the algorithm from the Lovasz Local Lemma. Our second\nand main contribution is to obtain a far more refined bound for the counting\nproblem that goes well beyond the hardness of finding a colouring and which we\nconjecture that is asymptotically tight (up to constant factors). We show in\nparticular that for all even $q\\geq 4$ it is NP-hard to approximate the number\nof colourings when $\\Delta\\gtrsim q^{K/2}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:02:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Galanis", "Andreas", ""], ["Guo", "Heng", ""], ["Wang", "Jiaheng", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.05567", "submitter": "Dmitriy Kunisky", "authors": "Dmitriy Kunisky and Jonathan Niles-Weed", "title": "Strong recovery of geometric planted matchings", "comments": "47 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of efficiently recovering the matching between an\nunlabelled collection of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a small random\nperturbation of those points.

While this parallels the standard (non-promise) CSP theory, the\nmethod of proof is quite different and applies even to the regime of sublinear\nwidth. We also show that, in contrast with the CSP world, the presence of weak\nnear unanimity polymorphisms of all large arities does not guarantee\nsolvability in bounded width. The separating example is even solvable in the\nsecond level of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy of linear programming\nrelaxations. This shows that, unlike for CSPs, linear programming can be\nstronger than bounded width.

In fact, our\nmulti-pass streaming algorithm is tight in that any algorithm with a better\nguarantee than 1/2 must make several passes through the stream and any\nalgorithm that beats our guarantee $1-1/e$ must make linearly many passes.\n  For the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a\nbipartite matching constraint (which is a special case of matroid\nintersection), we show that it is not possible to obtain better than\n0.3715-approximation in a single pass, which improves over a recent\ninapproximability of 0.522 for this problem. Furthermore, given a plausible\nassumption, our inapproximability result improves to $1/3 \\approx 0.333$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jul 2021 08:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "Moran", ""], ["Norouzi-Fard", "Ashkan", ""], ["Svensson", "Ola", ""], ["Zenklusen", "Rico", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.07359", "submitter": "Maxime Chaveroche", "authors": "Maxime Chaveroche, Franck Davoine, V\\'eronique Cherfaoui", "title": "Efficient M\\\"obius Transformations and their applications to\n  Dempster-Shafer Theory: Clarification and implementation", "comments": "Extension of an article published in the proceedings of the\n  international conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management (SUM) in 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM stat.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) generalizes Bayesian probability theory,\noffering useful additional information, but suffers from a high computational\nburden.

The $k$-star caterpillar on $X$ is\nimaginary and if the imaginary structure is a path ($0$-star caterpillar), then\nit is the class of convex bipartite graphs. The minimum Steiner tree problem\n(STREE) is defined as follows: given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset\nof vertices $R \\subseteq V(G)$, the objective is to find a minimum cardinality\nset $S \\subseteq V(G)$ such that the set $R \\cup S$ induces a connected\nsubgraph. STREE is known to be NP-complete on general graphs as well as for\nspecial graph classes such as chordal graphs, bipartite graphs, and chordal\nbipartite graphs.

We also study the fractional oriented chromatic number of\ndirected cycles and provide its exact value. Interestingly, the result depends\non the prime divisors of the length of the directed cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 15:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Sandip", ""], ["Das", "Soham", ""], ["Prabhu", "Swathy", ""], ["Sen", "Sagnik", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13658", "submitter": "Sergey Pupyrev", "authors": "Martin N\\\"ollenburg and Sergey Pupyrev", "title": "On Families of Planar DAGs with Constant Stack Number", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A $k$-stack layout (or $k$-page book embedding) of a graph consists of a\ntotal order of the vertices, and a partition of the edges into $k$ sets of\nnon-crossing edges with respect to the vertex order.
