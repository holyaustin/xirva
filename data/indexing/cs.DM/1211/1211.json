In this tutorial overview, we outline the main\nchallenges of the area, discuss different ways to define graph spectral\ndomains, which are the analogues to the classical frequency domain, and\nhighlight the importance of incorporating the irregular structures of graph\ndata domains when processing signals on graphs. We then review methods to\ngeneralize fundamental operations such as filtering, translation, modulation,\ndilation, and downsampling to the graph setting, and survey the localized,\nmultiscale transforms that have been proposed to efficiently extract\ninformation from high-dimensional data on graphs.
