This class of objectives gives rise to an interesting trade-off between\nfull and partial information. As in full observation, the strategy in the MDP\ncan depend on the state of the system, but similar to partial information, the\nstrategy needs to account for all the states at the same time. In this paper,\nwe focus on two safety problems that arise naturally in this context, namely,\nexistential and universal safety. Given an MDP A and a closed and convex\npolytope H of probability distributions over the states of A, the existential\nsafety problem asks whether there exists some distribution d in H and a\nstrategy of A, such that starting from d and repeatedly applying this strategy\nkeeps the distribution forever in H. The universal safety problem asks whether\nfor all distributions in H, there exists such a strategy of A which keeps the\ndistribution forever in H. We prove that both problems are decidable, with\ntight complexity bounds: we show that existential safety is PTIME-complete,\nwhile universal safety is co-NP-complete. Further, we compare these results\nwith existential and universal safety problems for Rabin's probabilistic\nfinite-state automata (PFA), the subclass of Partially Observable MDPs which\nhave zero observation. Compared to MDPs, strategies of PFAs are not\nstate-dependent. In sharp contrast to the PTIME result, we show that\nexistential safety for PFAs is undecidable, with H having closed and open\nboundaries. On the other hand, it turns out that the universal safety for PFAs\nis decidable in EXPTIME, with a co-NP lower bound.

Finally, we propose a novel and purely\ncombinatorial dynamic programming approach that can be applied to several\nspecial cases of the problem yielding not only {\\em deterministic} but also\nconsiderably faster algorithms. For example, for the well studied special case\nof only packing constraints (Kulik {\\em et. al.} [Math. Oper. Res. `13] and\nChekuri {\\em et. al.} [FOCS `10]), we are able to present the first\ndeterministic non-trivial approximation algorithm.

However, one peculiar aspect of this diffusion\nprocess is that each hyperedge directs flow only from vertices with the maximum\ndensity to those with the minimum density, while ignoring vertices having\nstrict in-beween densities. In this work, we consider a generalized diffusion\nprocess, in which vertices in a hyperedge can act as mediators to receive flow\nfrom vertices with maximum density and deliver flow to those with minimum\ndensity. We show that the resulting Laplacian operator still has a second\neigenvalue satsifying the Cheeger's inequality. Our generalized diffusion model\nshows that there is a family of operators whose spectral properties are related\nto hypergraph conductance, and provides a powerful tool to enhance the\ndevelopment of spectral hypergraph theory. Moreover, since every vertex can\nparticipate in the new diffusion model at every instant, this can potentially\nhave wider practical applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 11:29:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "T-H.

Modulo reasonable\nsparsity assumptions, we are then able to show that a strong form of\nidemetricity is actually equivalent to a very weak expander condition (PUMP).\nThis provides a direct way of providing short proofs that small-world network\nmodels such as the Watts-Strogatz model are strongly idemetric (for a wide\nrange of parameters), and also provides further evidence that being idemetric\nis a common property.\n  We then consider how satisfaction of the idemetric property is relevant to\nalgorithm design. For idemetric graphs we observe, for example, that a single\nbreadth-first search provides a solution to the all-pairs shortest paths\nproblem, so long as one is prepared to accept paths which are of stretch close\nto 2 with high probability. Since we are able to show that Kleinberg's model is\nidemetric, these results contrast nicely with the well known negative results\nof Kleinberg concerning efficient decentralised algorithms for finding short\npaths: for precisely the same model as Kleinberg's negative results hold, we\nare able to show that very efficient (and decentralised) algorithms exist if\none allows for reasonable preprocessing. For deterministic distributed routing\nalgorithms we are also able to obtain results proving that less routing\ninformation is required for idemetric graphs than the worst case in order to\nachieve stretch less than 3 with high probability: while $\\Omega(n^2)$ routing\ninformation is required in the worst case for stretch strictly less than 3 on\nalmost all pairs, for idemetric graphs the total routing information required\nis $O(nlog(n))$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 13:42:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2019 13:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Barmpalias", "George", ""], ["Huang", "Neng", ""], ["Lewis-Pye", "Andrew", ""], ["Li", "Angsheng", ""], ["Li", "Xuechen", ""], ["Pan", "Yicheng", ""], ["Roughgarden", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.11217", "submitter": "Viktor Zamaraev", "authors": "Bogdan Alecu, Vadim Lozin, Dominique de Werra, Viktor Zamaraev", "title": "Letter graphs and geometric grid classes of permutations:\n  characterization and recognition", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1108.6319 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we reveal an intriguing relationship between two seemingly\nunrelated notions: letter graphs and geometric grid classes of permutations.
