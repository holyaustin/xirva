A pebbling move removes two pebbles from a vertex and places\none pebble on one of its neighbors (losing the other as a toll). For t >= 1 the\nt-pebbling number of a graph is the minimum number of pebbles necessary so that\nfrom any initial distribution of them it is possible to move t pebbles to any\nvertex. We provide the best possible upper bound on the t-pebbling number of a\ndiameter two graph, proving a conjecture of Curtis, et al., in the process. We\nalso give a linear time (in the number of edges) algorithm to t-pebble such\ngraphs, as well as a quartic time (in the number of vertices) algorithm to\ncompute the pebbling number of such graphs, improving the best known result of\nBekmetjev and Cusack. Furthermore, we show that, for complete graphs, cycles,\ntrees, and cubes, we can allow the target to be any distribution of t pebbles\nwithout increasing the corresponding t-pebbling numbers; we conjecture that\nthis behavior holds for all graphs. Finally, we explore fractional and optimal\nfractional versions of pebbling, proving the fractional pebbling number\nconjecture of Hurlbert and using linear optimization to reveal results on the\noptimal fractional pebbling number of vertex-transitive graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2009 06:12:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Mar 2011 22:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Herscovici", "David S.", ""], ["Hester", "Benjamin D.", ""], ["Hurlbert", "Glenn H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4713", "submitter": "Leonard Kwuida", "authors": "Leonard Kwuida, Rokia Missaoui, Lahcen Boumedjout, Jean Vaillancourt", "title": "Mining Generalized Patterns from Large Databases using Ontologies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical theory based on the\nformalization of the notions of concept and concept hierarchies.
