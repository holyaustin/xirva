By translating this sequence to a set of points in the plane, a\nrollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal\nsub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.\nGiven a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for a\nmaximum-length subsequence that is a rollercoaster. It was conjectured that\nevery sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of length\nat least $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ for $n>7$, while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n/\\log n)$. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof is\nconstructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for computing a rollercoaster\nof this length. Extending the $O(n\\log n)$-time algorithm for computing a\nlongest increasing subsequence, we show how to compute a maximum-length\nrollercoaster within the same time bound. A maximum-length rollercoaster in a\npermutation of $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ can be computed in $O(n \\log \\log n)$ time.\n  The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set\nembedding of caterpillars.

A top-view caterpillar is one of degree\n4 such that the two leaves adjacent to each vertex lie on opposite sides of the\nspine.
