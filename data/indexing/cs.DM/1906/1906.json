Those algorithms, however, are\nnot yet capable of scaling well to very large graphs with billions of edges. In\nthis paper we develop novel tools for the `motif counting via color coding'\nframework. As a result, our new algorithm, Motivo, is able to scale well to\nlarger graphs while at the same time provide more accurate graphlet counts than\never before. This is achieved thanks to two types of improvements. First, we\ndesign new succinct data structures that support fast common color coding\noperations, and a biased coloring trick that trades accuracy versus running\ntime and memory usage. These adaptations drastically reduce the time and memory\nrequirements of color coding. Second, we develop an adaptive graphlet sampling\nstrategy, based on a fractional set cover problem, that breaks the additive\napproximation barrier of standard sampling. This strategy gives multiplicative\napproximations for all graphlets at once, allowing us to count not only the\nmost frequent graphlets but also extremely rare ones.\n  To give an idea of the improvements, in $40$ minutes Motivo counts $7$-nodes\nmotifs on a graph with $65$M nodes and $1.8$B edges; this is $30$ and $500$\ntimes larger than the state of the art, respectively in terms of nodes and\nedges.

Up to now, the conjecture has been proven for almost\nall words, including all words avoiding some power $p$. However, even in that\nsimple case the existing upper bound for the minimal number $n$ such that\n$PPL_u(n)>K$ is greater than any constant to the power $K$. Precise values of\n$PPL_u(n)$ are not known even for simplest examples like the Fibonacci word.\n  In this paper, we give the first example of such a precise computation and\ncompute the function of the prefix palindromic length of the Thue-Morse word, a\nfamous test object for all functions on infinite words.

We show that the problem is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard when restricted to\n$\\{P_6,P_4+P_2\\}$-free graphs and that it is $\\mathsf{coNP}$-hard when\nrestricted to subcubic claw-free graphs and $2P_3$-free graphs. As a\nconsequence, we are able to establish a complexity dichotomy for the problem on\n$H$-free graphs when $H$ is connected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 16:40:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 Aug 2019 12:17:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Galby", "Esther", ""], ["Lima", "Paloma T.", ""], ["Ries", "Bernard", ""]]}]
