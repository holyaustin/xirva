This technique relies on properties of the\nsensing matrix such as the restricted isometry property. Sensing matrices that\nsatisfy the restricted isometry property with optimal parameters are mainly\nobtained via probabilistic arguments. Given any matrix, deciding whether it\nsatisfies the restricted isometry property is a non-trivial computational\nproblem. In this paper, we give reductions from dense subgraph problems to the\ncertification of the restricted isometry property. This gives evidence that\ncertifying the restricted isometry property is unlikely to be feasible in\npolynomial-time. Moreover, on the positive side we propose an improvement on\nthe brute-force enumeration algorithm for checking the restricted isometry\nproperty.\n  Another contribution of independent interest is a spectral algorithm for\ncertifying that a random graph does not contain any dense k-subgraph. This\n\"skewed spectral algorithm\" performs better than the basic spectral algorithm\nin a certain range of parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Mar 2011 14:46:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 14:19:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2011 15:20:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 16:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Koiran", "Pascal", ""], ["Zouzias", "Anastasios", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5119", "submitter": "Maurice Margenstern", "authors": "Maurice Margenstern", "title": "A protocol for a message system for the tiles of the heptagrid, in the\n  hyperbolic plane", "comments": "30 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a communication system for the tiles of the heptagrid,\na tiling of the hyperbolic plane.
