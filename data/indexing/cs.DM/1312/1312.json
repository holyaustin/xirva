A cut (B,W) of G (a bipartition of V(G)) separates\na clique K and a stable set S if $K\\subseteq B$ and $S\\subseteq W$. A\nClique-Stable Set Separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K,\nand for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family\nthat separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know\nwhether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set Separator\ncontaining only polynomially many cuts. It is open for the class of all graphs,\nand also for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we\ninvestigate on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced\nskew-partition was introduced in the proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem.\nRecently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vuskovic proved that forbidding\nthis unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs\nusing 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a basic graph, and they found\nan efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their\ndecomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced\nskew-partition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set Separator, by taking\nadvantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then\ngeneralize this result and prove that the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in\nthis class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or\ncomplement biclique. This property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox\n2006), and moreover when the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary\nclass of graphs, then both the Erdos-Hajnal property and the polynomial\nClique-Stable Set Separation hold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 09:52:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 10:41:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:55:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lagoutte", "Aur\u00e9lie", ""], ["Trunck", "Th\u00e9ophile", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2816", "submitter": "Jan van den Heuvel", "authors": "Jan van den Heuvel", "title": "The Complexity of Change", "comments": "28 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "In: S.R.

We prove\nthat Bisection is FPT for the distance to constant cliquewidth if we are given\nthe deletion set. This implies FPT algorithms for some well-studied parameters\nsuch as cluster vertex deletion number and feedback vertex set. However, we\nshow that Bisection does not admit polynomial-size kernels for these\nparameters.\n  For the Vertex Bisection problem, vertices need to be removed in order to\nobtain two equal-sized parts. We show that this problem is FPT for the number\nof removed vertices k if the solution cuts the graph into a constant number c\nof connected components. The latter condition is unavoidable, since we also\nprove that Vertex Bisection is W[1]-hard w.r.t. (k,c).\n  Our algorithms for finding bisections can easily be adapted to finding\npartitions into d equal-sized parts, which entails additional running time\nfactors of n^{O(d)}. We show that a substantial speed-up is unlikely since the\ncorresponding task is W[1]-hard w.r.t. d, even on forests of maximum degree\ntwo. We can, however, show that it is FPT for the vertex cover number.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 20:10:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2014 08:48:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["van Bevern", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Feldmann", "Andreas Emil", ""], ["Sorge", "Manuel", ""], ["Such\u00fd", "Ond\u0159ej", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7253", "submitter": "Van Bang Le", "authors": "Van Bang Le and Florian Pfender", "title": "Complexity Results for Rainbow Matchings", "comments": "To appear in Theoretical Computer Science", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.tcs.2013.12.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  A rainbow matching in an edge-colored graph is a matching whose edges have\ndistinct colors.

As a continuation of our previous (CSR\n2012) paper, we focus on the complexity of undirected graph templates. As our\nmain contribution, we settle the two principal open questions proposed in (CSR\n2012). Firstly, we complete the classification of clique templates by proving a\nfull trichotomy for all possible combinations of counting quantifiers and\nclique sizes, placing each case either in P, NP-complete or Pspace-complete.\nThis involves resolution of the cases in which we have the single quantifier\n$\\exists^{\\geq j}$ on the clique $K_{2j}$. Secondly, we confirm a conjecture\nfrom (CSR 2012), which proposes a full dichotomy for $\\exists$ and\n$\\exists^{\\geq 2}$ on all finite undirected graphs. The main thrust of this\nsecond result is the solution of the complexity for the infinite path which we\nprove is a polynomial-time solvable problem. By adapting the algorithm for the\ninfinite path we are then able to solve the problem for finite paths, and then\ntrees and forests. Thus as a corollary to this work, combining with the other\ncases from (CSR 2012), we obtain a full dichotomy for $\\exists$ and\n$\\exists^{\\geq 2}$ quantifiers on finite graphs, each such problem being either\nin P or NP-hard. Finally, we persevere with the work of (CSR 2012) in exploring\ncases in which there is dichotomy between P and Pspace-complete, in contrast\nwith situations in which the intermediate NP-completeness may appear.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 00:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Barnaby", ""], ["Stacho", "Juraj", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7820", "submitter": "Timo Jolivet", "authors": "Val\\'erie Berth\\'e, Damien Jamet, Timo Jolivet, Xavier Proven\\c{c}al", "title": "Critical connectedness of thin arithmetical discrete planes", "comments": "18 pages, v2 includes several corrections and is a long version of\n  the DGCI extended abstract", "journal-ref": "DGCI 2013, conference proceedings LNCS 7749, 107-118", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An arithmetical discrete plane is said to have critical connecting thickness\nif its thickness is equal to the infimum of the set of values that preserve its\n$2$-connectedness.
