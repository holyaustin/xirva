The convex-concave programming formulation is obtained\nby rewriting the weighted graph matching problem as a least-square problem on\nthe set of permutation matrices and relaxing it to two different optimization\nproblems: a quadratic convex and a quadratic concave optimization problem on\nthe set of doubly stochastic matrices. The concave relaxation has the same\nglobal minimum as the initial graph matching problem, but the search for its\nglobal minimum is also a hard combinatorial problem. We therefore construct an\napproximation of the concave problem solution by following a solution path of a\nconvex-concave problem obtained by linear interpolation of the convex and\nconcave formulations, starting from the convex relaxation. This method allows\nto easily integrate the information on graph label similarities into the\noptimization problem, and therefore to perform labeled weighted graph matching.\nThe algorithm is compared with some of the best performing graph matching\nmethods on four datasets: simulated graphs, QAPLib, retina vessel images and\nhandwritten chinese characters.
