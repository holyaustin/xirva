This result specializes to the two application scenarios,\nyielding new results in both contexts. In contrast with previous results, the\nkey novelty is the ability to handle edge capacities with arbitrary integer\nvalues. An analysis of belief propagation algorithms (BP) with multivariate\nbelief vectors underlies the proof. In particular, we show convergence of the\ncorresponding BP by exploiting monotonicity of the belief vectors with respect\nto the so-called upshifted likelihood ratio stochastic order. This auxiliary\nresult can be of independent interest, providing a new set of structural\nconditions which ensure convergence of BP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 15:23:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Leconte", "Mathieu", ""], ["Lelarge", "Marc", ""], ["Massouli\u00e9", "Laurent", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1788", "submitter": "Leah Epstein", "authors": "Leah Epstein, Asaf Levin, Danny Segev, and Oren Weimann", "title": "Improved Bounds for Online Preemptive Matching", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When designing a preemptive online algorithm for the maximum matching\nproblem, we wish to maintain a valid matching M while edges of the underlying\ngraph are presented one after the other.
