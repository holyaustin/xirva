[Math.\nProgramming, 2009]. Specifically, we are interested in proving upper bounds on\nthe integrality gap of this LP, and studying its relation to other linear\nrelaxations. Our results are the following. Structural results: We extend the\ntechnique of uncrossing, usually applied to families of sets, to families of\npartitions. As a consequence we show that any basic feasible solution to the\npartition LP formulation has sparse support. Although the number of variables\ncould be exponential, the number of positive variables is at most the number of\nterminals. Relations with other relaxations: We show the equivalence of the\npartition LP relaxation with other known hypergraphic relaxations. We also show\nthat these hypergraphic relaxations are equivalent to the well studied\nbidirected cut relaxation, if the instance is quasibipartite. Integrality gap\nupper bounds: We show an upper bound of sqrt(3) ~ 1.729 on the integrality gap\nof these hypergraph relaxations in general graphs. In the special case of\nuniformly quasibipartite instances, we show an improved upper bound of 73/60 ~\n1.216. By our equivalence theorem, the latter result implies an improved upper\nbound for the bidirected cut relaxation as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 21:57:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Mar 2010 01:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Chakrabarty", "Deeparnab", ""], ["Koenemann", "Jochen", ""], ["Pritchard", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0286", "submitter": "Justin Smith", "authors": "George B.

We\nconcentrate on deterministic algorithms for weighted combinatorial optimization\nproblems. A problem instance of this kind is defined by its structure and a\nvector of weights. The concept of a null case is introduced as set of problem\ninstances whose weight vectors constitute a nowhere open set (or null set) in\nthe space of all possible weight configurations. An algorithm is called robust\nif any null case can be disregarded in the analysis of both its solution\nquality and resource requirements.\n  We show that achieving robustness is only a matter of breaking ties the right\nway. More specifically, we show that the concept of symbolic perturbation known\nfrom the area of geometric algorithms guarantees that no surprises will happen\nin null cases. We argue that for a huge class of combinatorial optimization\nalgorithms it is easy to verify that they implicitly use symbolic perturbation\nfor breaking ties and thus can be analyzed under the assumption that some\narbitrary null case never occurs.

Since direct adjacency has only six types of digital\nsurface points in local configurations, it is easy to determine and classify\nthe discrete curvatures for every point on the boundary of a 3D object. Unlike\nthe boundary simplicial decomposition (triangulation), the curvature can take\nany real value. It sometimes makes difficulties to find a right value for\nthreshold. This paper focuses on the global properties of categorizing\ncurvatures for small regions. We use both digital Gaussian curvatures and\ndigital mean curvatures to 3D shapes. This paper proposes a multi-scale method\nfor 3D object analysis and a vector method for 3D similarity classification. We\nuse these methods for face recognition and shape classification. We have found\nthat the Gaussian curvatures mainly describe the global features and average\ncharacteristics such as the five regions of a human face.

Each item to be\ninserted chooses randomly k>1 locations and has to be placed in any one of\nthem. How much load can cuckoo hashing handle before collisions prevent the\nsuccessful assignment of the available items to the chosen locations?
