It was introduced by Demaine et al. as a tool to\nobtain sub-exponential time parameterized algorithms for problems on H-minor\nfree graphs. Demaine and Hajiaghayi extended the theory to obtain PTASs for\nbidimensional problems, and subsequently improved these results to EPTASs.\nFomin et. al related the theory to the existence of linear kernels for\nparameterized problems. In this paper we revisit bidimensionality theory from\nthe perspective of approximation algorithms and redesign the framework for\nobtaining EPTASs to be more powerful, easier to apply and easier to understand.\n  Two of the most widely used approaches to obtain PTASs on planar graphs are\nthe Lipton-Tarjan separator based approach, and Baker's approach. Demaine and\nHajiaghayi strengthened both approaches using bidimensionality and obtained\nEPTASs for a multitude of problems. We unify the two strenghtened approaches to\ncombine the best of both worlds. At the heart of our framework is a\ndecomposition lemma which states that for \"most\" bidimensional problems, there\nis a polynomial time algorithm which given an H-minor-free graph G as input and\nan e > 0 outputs a vertex set X of size e * OPT such that the treewidth of G n\nX is f(e). Here, OPT is the objective function value of the problem in question\nand f is a function depending only on e. This allows us to obtain EPTASs on\n(apex)-minor-free graphs for all problems covered by the previous framework, as\nwell as for a wide range of packing problems, partial covering problems and\nproblems that are neither closed under taking minors, nor contractions. To the\nbest of our knowledge for many of these problems including cycle packing,\nvertex-h-packing, maximum leaf spanning tree, and partial r-dominating set no\nEPTASs on planar graphs were previously known.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 May 2010 12:29:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2011 22:56:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fomin", "Fedor V.", ""], ["Lokshtanov", "Daniel", ""], ["Raman", "Venkatesh", ""], ["Saurabh", "Saket", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5475", "submitter": "Milan Bradonjic", "authors": "Milan Bradonjic, Aric Hagberg, Nicolas W.
