In the typical\nformulation of network interdiction, the task of the interdictor is to find a\nset of edges in a weighted network such that the removal of those edges would\nmaximally increase the cost to an evader of traveling on a path through the\nnetwork.\n  Our work is motivated by cases in which the evader has incomplete information\nabout the network or lacks planning time or computational power, e.g. when\nauthorities set up roadblocks to catch bank robbers, the criminals do not know\nall the roadblock locations or the best path to use for their escape.\n  We introduce a model of network interdiction in which the motion of one or\nmore evaders is described by Markov processes and the evaders are assumed not\nto react to interdiction decisions. The interdiction objective is to find an\nedge set of size B, that maximizes the probability of capturing the evaders.\n  We prove that similar to the standard least-cost formulation for\ndeterministic motion this interdiction problem is also NP-hard. But unlike that\nproblem our interdiction problem is submodular and the optimal solution can be\napproximated within 1-1/e using a greedy algorithm. Additionally, we exploit\nsubmodularity through a priority evaluation strategy that eliminates the linear\ncomplexity scaling in the number of network edges and speeds up the solution by\norders of magnitude. Taken together the results bring closer the goal of\nfinding realistic solutions to the interdiction problem on global-scale\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2009 20:10:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gutfraind", "Alexander", ""], ["Hagberg", "Aric", ""], ["Pan", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0520", "submitter": "Francesco Pasquale", "authors": "Andrea E.F.
