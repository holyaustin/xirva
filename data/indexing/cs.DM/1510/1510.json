For applications such as predicting users' political preference,\nit is particularly important to be able to analyze the dynamics of competing\nopinions. While observing the evolution of polar opinions of a social network's\nusers over time, can we tell when the network \"behaved\" abnormally?\nFurthermore, can we predict how the opinions of the users will change in the\nfuture? Do opinions evolve according to existing network opinion dynamics\nmodels? To answer such questions, it is not sufficient to study individual user\nbehavior, since opinions can spread far beyond users' egonets.

This means that one uses worst-case\nanalysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop\na new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We\ntake the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and\namortise against certain \"bad\" instances that are created as the recursion\nproceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even\nwhen SSM fails.\n  We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent\nsets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on\nthe arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k>=2 and Delta<=5 (lack\nof SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to\nDelta=6). Our technique gives a tight result for Delta=6, showing that there is\nan FPTAS for k>=3 and Delta<=6. The best previously-known approximation scheme\nfor Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and\nKarpinski, which only works for k>=8.\n  Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for\nk>=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised\nresults in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic\napproximation scheme in this regime. Moreover, unlike existing results, it\nleads to an FPTAS for counting dominating sets in regular graphs with\nsufficiently large degree.\n  We further demonstrate that approximately counting independent sets in\nhypergraphs is NP-hard even within the uniqueness regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 18:38:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 14:45:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 20:52:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 13:02:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 14:47:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bezakova", "Ivona", ""], ["Galanis", "Andreas", ""], ["Goldberg", "Leslie Ann", ""], ["Guo", "Heng", ""], ["Stefankovic", "Daniel", ""]]}]
