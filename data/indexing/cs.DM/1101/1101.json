The spread of the rumor is governed by a\ndynamic communication graph process ${G_t(r) | t \\geq 0}$, where two agents are\nconnected by an edge in $G_t(r)$ iff their distance at time $t$ is within their\ntransmission radius $r$.

From N stacked grains, iterating evolution rules\nleads to some critical configuration where a small disturbance has deep\nconsequences on the system, involving numerous steps of grain fall. Physicists\nL. Kadanoff et al. inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior,\nextending the well known Sand Pile Model. In KSPM with parameter D we start\nfrom a pile of N stacked grains and apply the rule: D-1 grains can fall from\ncolumn i onto the D-1 adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height\nbetween columns i and i+1 is greater or equal to D. We propose an iterative\nstudy of KSPM evolution where one single grain addition is repeated on a heap\nof sand. The sequence of grain falls following a single grain addition is\ncalled an avalanche. From a certain column precisely studied for D=3, we\nprovide a plain process describing avalanches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jan 2011 12:47:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Perrot", "Kevin", ""], ["R\u00e9mila", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.6006", "submitter": "Xavier Goaoc", "authors": "\\'Eric Colin de Verdi\\`ere, Gr\\'egory Ginot and Xavier Goaoc", "title": "Helly numbers of acyclic families", "comments": "Minor changes", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.DM math.AT math.MG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Helly number of a family of sets with empty intersection is the size of\nits largest inclusion-wise minimal sub-family with empty intersection.
