It was previously known that the treewidth\nwas bounded above by the sum of the size of the separator plus the treewidth of\ndisjoint components, and this was obtained by the heuristic of filling in all\nedges of the separator making it into a clique.\n  In this paper, we present a new, tighter upper bound on the treewidth of a\ngraph obtained by only partially filling in the edges of a separator. In\nparticular, the method completes just those pairs of separator vertices that\nare adjacent to a common component, and indicates a more effective heuristic\nthan filling in the entire separator. We discuss the relevance of this result\nfor combinatorial algorithms and give an example of how the tighter bound can\nbe exploited in the domain of constraint satisfaction problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2019 09:23:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Faltings", "Boi", ""], ["Golumbic", "Martin Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.02843", "submitter": "Christophe Picouleau", "authors": "Valentin Bouquet, Fran\\c{c}ois Delbot, Christophe Picouleau", "title": "On the vertices belonging to all, some, none minimum dominating set", "comments": "11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We characterize the vertices belonging to all minimum dominating sets, to\nsome minimum dominating sets but not all, and to no minimum dominating set.

In recent years, the study of paths in\ntemporal graphs, that is, graphs where the vertex set is fixed but the edge set\nchanges over time, gained more and more attention. A path is time-respecting,\nor temporal, if it uses edges with non-decreasing time stamps. We investigate a\nbasic constraint for temporal paths, where the time spent at each vertex must\nnot exceed a given duration $\\Delta$, referred to as $\\Delta$-restless temporal\npaths. This constraint arises naturally in the modeling of real-world processes\nlike packet routing in communication networks and infection transmission routes\nof diseases where recovery confers lasting resistance. While finding temporal\npaths without waiting time restrictions is known to be doable in polynomial\ntime, we show that the \"restless variant\" of this problem becomes\ncomputationally hard even in very restrictive settings. For example, it is\nW[1]-hard when parameterized by the distance to disjoint path of the underlying\ngraph, which implies W[1]-hardness for many other parameters like feedback\nvertex number and pathwidth. A natural question is thus whether the problem\nbecomes tractable in some natural settings.

To design a search procedure for an\naugmenting walk, we introduce blossoms analogously to the matching algorithm of\nEdmonds (1965), while it is neither a special case nor a generalization of the\npresent problem. When the search procedure terminates without finding an\naugmenting walk, the algorithm provides a certificate for the optimality of the\ncurrent edge-disjoint $T$-paths. Thus the correctness argument of the algorithm\nserves as an alternative direct proof of Mader's theorem on edge-disjoint\n$T$-paths.

We show that in\nthe circuit-augmentation framework the greatest-improvement and Dantzig pivot\nrules are NP-hard, already for 0/1-LPs. Differently, the steepest-descent pivot\nrule can be carried out in polynomial time in the 0/1 setting, and the number\nof circuit augmentations required to reach an optimal solution according to\nthis rule is strongly-polynomial for 0/1-LPs.\n  The number of circuit augmentations has been of interest as a proxy for the\nnumber of steps in the Simplex method, and the circuit-diameter of polyhedra\nhas been studied as a lower bound to the combinatorial diameter of polyhedra.\nExtending prior results, we show that for any polyhedron $P$ the\ncircuit-diameter is bounded by a polynomial in the input bit-size of $P$. This\nis in contrast with the best bounds for the combinatorial diameter of\npolyhedra.\n  Interestingly, we show that the circuit-augmentation framework can be\nexploited to make novel conclusions about the classical Simplex method itself:\nIn particular, as a byproduct of our circuit results, we prove that (i)\ncomputing the shortest (monotone) path to an optimal solution on the 1-skeleton\nof a polytope is NP-hard, and hard to approximate within a factor better than\n2, and (ii) for $0/1$ polytopes, a monotone path of strongly-polynomial length\ncan be constructed using steepest improving edges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2019 18:28:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2020 12:56:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["De Loera", "Jes\u00fas A.", ""], ["Kafer", "Sean", ""], ["Sanit\u00e0", "Laura", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13029", "submitter": "Guozhen Rong", "authors": "Guozhen Rong, Yixin Cao, Jianxin Wang", "title": "Characterization and Linear-time Recognition of Paired Threshold Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a paired threshold graph, each vertex has a weight, and two vertices are\nadjacent if their weight sum is large enough and their weight difference is\nsmall enough.

Locating arrays are\nmathematical objects that are useful for this testing strategy, as they can be\nused as a test suite that enables fault localization as well as fault\ndetection. In this application, each row of an array is used as an individual\ntest.\n  Objective: This paper proposes an algorithm for constructing locating arrays\nwith a small number of rows. Testing cost increases as the number of tests\nincreases; thus the problem of finding locating arrays of small sizes is of\npractical importance.\n  Method: The proposed algorithm uses simulation annealing, a meta-heuristic\nalgorithm, to find locating array of a given size. The whole algorithm\nrepeatedly executes the simulated annealing algorithm by dynamically varying\nthe input array size.\n  Results: Experimental results show 1) that the proposed algorithm is able to\nconstruct locating arrays for problem instances of large sizes and 2) that, for\nproblem instances for which nontrivial locating arrays are known, the algorithm\nis often able to generate locating arrays that are smaller than or at least\nequal to the known arrays.\n  Conclusion: Based on the results, it is concluded that the proposed algorithm\ncan produce small locating arrays and scale to practical problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Sep 2019 13:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Konishi", "Tatsuya", ""], ["Kojima", "Hideharu", ""], ["Nakagawa", "Hiroyuki", ""], ["Tsuchiya", "Tatsuhiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13217", "submitter": "Tapas Kumar Mishra", "authors": "Tapas Kumar Mishra", "title": "$r$-wise fractional $L$-intersecting family", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $L = \\{\\frac{a_1}{b_1}, \\ldots , \\frac{a_s}{b_s}\\}$, where for every $i\n\\in [s]$, $\\frac{a_i}{b_i} \\in [0,1)$ is an irreducible fraction.
