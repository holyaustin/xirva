As multidimensional networks, such as\ntime-varying, multilayer, or dynamic multilayer networks, gain more relevancy\nin network science, it becomes crucial to investigate in which situations\nuniversal algorithmic methods based on algorithmic information theory applied\nto graphs cannot be straightforwardly imported into the multidimensional case.\nIn this direction, as a worst-case scenario of lossless compressibility\ndistortion that increases linearly with the number of distinct dimensions, this\narticle presents a counter-intuitive phenomenon that occurs when dealing with\nnetworks within non-uniform and sufficiently large multidimensional spaces. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the algorithmic information necessary to encode\nmultidimensional networks that are isomorphic to logarithmically compressible\nmonoplex networks may display exponentially larger distortions in the general\ncase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Sep 2020 23:20:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2020 17:53:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Abrah\u00e3o", "Felipe S.", ""], ["Wehmuth", "Klaus", ""], ["Zenil", "Hector", ""], ["Ziviani", "Artur", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.05953", "submitter": "Shmuel Onn", "authors": "Shmuel Onn", "title": "Optimization over Young Diagrams", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.DM cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of finding a Young diagram minimizing the sum of\nevaluations of a given pair of functions on the parts of the associated pair of\nconjugate partitions.
