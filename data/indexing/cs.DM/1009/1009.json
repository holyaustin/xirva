Here we study approximate representations\nof finite groups: functions f:G -> U_d such that Pr[f(xy) = f(x) f(y)] is\nlarge, or more generally Exp_{x,y} ||f(xy) - f(x)f(y)||^2$ is small, where x\nand y are uniformly random elements of the group G and U_d denotes the unitary\ngroup of degree d. We bound these quantities in terms of the ratio d / d_min\nwhere d_min is the dimension of the smallest nontrivial representation of G. As\nan application, we bound the extent to which a function f : G -> H can be an\napproximate homomorphism where H is another finite group. We show that if H's\nrepresentations are significantly smaller than G's, no such f can be much more\nhomomorphic than a random function.\n  We interpret these results as showing that if G is quasirandom, that is, if\nd_min is large, then G cannot be embedded in a small number of dimensions, or\nin a less-quasirandom group, without significant distortion of G's\nmultiplicative structure. We also prove that our bounds are tight by showing\nthat minors of genuine representations and their polar decompositions are\nessentially optimal approximate representations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 19:49:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "Cristopher", ""], ["Russell", "Alexander", ""]]}]
