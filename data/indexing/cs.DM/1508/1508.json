In this paper, we consider a general random intersection graph\n$\\mathbb{G}(n,\\overrightarrow{a}, \\overrightarrow{K_n},P_n)$ defined on a set\n$\\mathcal{V}_n$ comprising $n$ vertices, where $\\overrightarrow{a}$ is a\nprobability vector $(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_m)$ and $\\overrightarrow{K_n}$ is\n$(K_{1,n},K_{2,n},\\ldots,K_{m,n})$. This graph has been studied in the\nliterature including a most recent work by Ya\\u{g}an [arXiv:1508.02407].\nSuppose there is a pool $\\mathcal{P}_n$ consisting of $P_n$ distinct objects.\nThe $n$ vertices in $\\mathcal{V}_n$ are divided into $m$ groups $\\mathcal{A}_1,\n\\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{A}_m$. Each vertex $v$ is independently\nassigned to exactly a group according to the probability distribution with\n$\\mathbb{P}[v \\in \\mathcal{A}_i]= a_i$, where $i=1,2,\\ldots,m$. Afterwards,\neach vertex in group $\\mathcal{A}_i$ independently chooses $K_{i,n}$ objects\nuniformly at random from the object pool $\\mathcal{P}_n$. Finally, an\nundirected edge is drawn between two vertices in $\\mathcal{V}_n$ that share at\nleast one object. This graph model $\\mathbb{G}(n,\\overrightarrow{a},\n\\overrightarrow{K_n},P_n)$ has applications in secure sensor networks and\nsocial networks. We investigate connectivity in this general random\nintersection graph $\\mathbb{G}(n,\\overrightarrow{a}, \\overrightarrow{K_n},P_n)$\nand present a sharp zero-one law. Our result is also compared with the zero-one\nlaw established by Ya\\u{g}an.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 00:56:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.04053", "submitter": "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi", "authors": "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi", "title": "The odd Hadwiger's conjecture is \"almost'' decidable", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The odd Hadwiger's conjecture, made by Gerads and Seymour in early 1990s, is\nan analogue of the famous Hadwiger's conjecture.

Continuing an earlier work [STACS 2015], we study Subset\nSum parameterized by the maximum bin size $\\beta$, defined as the largest\nnumber of subsets of the $n$ input integers that yield the same sum. For every\n$\\epsilon > 0$ we give a truly faster algorithm for instances with $\\beta \\leq\n2^{(0.5-\\epsilon)n}$, as well as instances with $\\beta \\geq 2^{0.661n}$.\nConsequently, we also obtain a characterization in terms of the popular density\nparameter $n/\\log_2 t$: if all instances of density at least $1.003$ admit a\ntruly faster algorithm, then so does every instance. This goes against the\ncurrent intuition that instances of density 1 are the hardest, and therefore is\na step toward answering the open question in the affirmative. Our results stem\nfrom novel combinations of earlier algorithms for Subset Sum and a study of an\nextremal question in additive combinatorics connected to the problem of\nUniquely Decodable Code Pairs in information theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 03:14:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Austrin", "Per", ""], ["Koivisto", "Mikko", ""], ["Kaski", "Petteri", ""], ["Nederlof", "Jesper", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06754", "submitter": "Gabriele Fici", "authors": "Gabriele Fici", "title": "Factorizations of the Fibonacci Infinite Word", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Published on Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol. 18 (2015), Article\n  15.9.3", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this note is to survey the factorizations of the Fibonacci\ninfinite word that make use of the Fibonacci words and other related words, and\nto show that all these factorizations can be easily derived in sequence\nstarting from elementary properties of the Fibonacci numbers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 08:45:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Fici", "Gabriele", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06889", "submitter": "Attila Bern\\'ath", "authors": "Erika R.
