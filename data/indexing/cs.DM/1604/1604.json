Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$\nvertices, and define (for $s > 0$) $\\mu_s = \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{v \\in V}\nd^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of\n$(1+\\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\\epsilon>0$) in sublinear\ntime. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random\nvertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of\nany vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\\epsilon$ (Feige,\nSICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended\nthis result to all integral $s > 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.\n  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the\nworst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much\nsimpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is\nconnected to the degeneracy of $G$. This is (essentially) the maximum density\nof an induced subgraph. For the family of graphs with degeneracy at most\n$\\alpha$, it has a query complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{1-1/s}}{\\mu^{1/s}_s} \\Big(\\alpha^{1/s} +\n\\min\\{\\alpha,\\mu^{1/s}_s\\}\\Big)\\right) =\n\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/s}\\alpha/\\mu^{1/s}_s)$. Thus, for the class of bounded\ndegeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential\nattachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\\widetilde{O}(1)$\nqueries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. This is a major improvement over the\nprevious worst-case bounds. Our key insight is in designing an estimator for\n$\\mu_s$ that has low variance when $G$ does not have large dense subgraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 05:36:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 13:57:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Eden", "Talya", ""], ["Ron", "Dana", ""], ["Seshadhri", "C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.04139", "submitter": "Yassine Hachaichi", "authors": "Yassine Hacha\\\"ichi (LAMSIN)", "title": "Logic for Unambiguous Context-Free Languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science Theory and Application,\n  ORB Academic Publisher, 2016, 5 (1), pp.12-19", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CC cs.DM cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give in this paper a logical characterization for unambiguous Context Free\nLanguages, in the vein of descriptive complexity.

In this way, we obtain\nfixed-parameter tractability and polynomial kernelizability results, with the\ncentral parameter being the maximum vertex in- or outdegree of the output\ndigraph. Although there are certain similarities with the much better studied\nundirected case, the flow computation used in the directed case seems not to\nwork for the undirected case while $f$-factor computations as used in the\nundirected case seem not to work for the directed case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 13:40:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 12:06:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 13:40:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bredereck", "Robert", ""], ["Froese", "Vincent", ""], ["Koseler", "Marcel", ""], ["Millani", "Marcelo Garlet", ""], ["Nichterlein", "Andr\u00e9", ""], ["Niedermeier", "Rolf", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06379", "submitter": "Daniel Merkle", "authors": "Christoph Flamm and Daniel Merkle and Peter F.

Initially each vertex holds one\nof two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions\ninteract pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The\nquantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of\ninteractions needed for all vertices have the same colour.\n  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and\nthe other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is\nincident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are\nbased on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are\nseveral ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a\nrandom discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour.\nPull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random\ndiscordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant\nedge and push the colour to the other end point.\n  We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on\nthe underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices,\nand an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious\nvoting, E(T) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph\nK_n, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has\nE(T)= Theta(2^n).

We\nprove that potential examples of reversible automata generating infinite groups\nwithout singular points are necessarily bireversible. Then we provide some\nnecessary conditions for such examples to exist, and study some dynamical\nproperties of their Schreier graphs in the boundary. Finally we relate some of\nthose automata with aperiodic tilings of the discrete plane via Wang tilings.\nThis has a series of consequences from the algorithmic and dynamical points of\nview, and is related to a problem of Gromov regarding the searching for\nexamples of CAT(0) complexes whose fundamental groups are not hyperbolic and\ncontain no subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 16:16:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angeli", "D.", ""], ["Godin", "Th.", ""], ["Klimann", "I.", ""], ["Picantin", "M.", ""], ["Rodaro", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07970", "submitter": "Pierre-Yves Louis", "authors": "Paolo Dai Pra, Pierre-Yves Louis (UFR de Math\\'ematiques Universit\\'e\n  de Lille), Sylvie Roelly (WIAS, CMAP)", "title": "Stationary measures and phase transition for a class of probabilistic\n  cellular automata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ESAIM: Probability and Statistics, EDP Sciences, 2002, 6,\n  pp.89-104", "doi": "10.1051/ps:2002004", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.DM nlin.AO nlin.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss various properties of Probabilistic Cellular Automata, such as the\nstructure of the set of stationary measures and multiplicity of stationary\nmeasures (or phase transition) for reversible models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 08:21:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pra", "Paolo Dai", "", "UFR de Math\u00e9matiques Universit\u00e9\n  de Lille"], ["Louis", "Pierre-Yves", "", "UFR de Math\u00e9matiques Universit\u00e9\n  de Lille"], ["Roelly", "Sylvie", "", "WIAS, CMAP"]]}, {"id": "1604.07976", "submitter": "Gwena\\\"el Joret", "authors": "Samuel Fiorini, Tony Huynh, Gwena\\\"el Joret, and Kanstantsin\n  Pashkovich", "title": "Smaller Extended Formulations for the Spanning Tree Polytope of\n  Bounded-genus Graphs", "comments": "v3: fixed some typos", "journal-ref": "Discrete & Computational Geometry, 57(3), 757-761 (2017)", "doi": "10.1007/s00454-016-9852-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give an $O(g^{1/2} n^{3/2} + g^{3/2} n^{1/2})$-size extended formulation\nfor the spanning tree polytope of an $n$-vertex graph embedded on a surface of\ngenus $g$, improving on the known $O(n^2 + g n)$-size extended formulations\nfollowing from Wong and Martin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 08:45:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:46:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 14:22:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fiorini", "Samuel", ""], ["Huynh", "Tony", ""], ["Joret", "Gwena\u00ebl", ""], ["Pashkovich", "Kanstantsin", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.08326", "submitter": "Roee David", "authors": "Roee David and Uriel Feige", "title": "Random walks with the minimum degree local rule have $O(n^2)$ cover time", "comments": "19 pages. 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For a simple (unbiased) random walk on a connected graph with $n$ vertices,\nthe cover time (the expected number of steps it takes to visit all vertices) is\nat most $O(n^3)$.
