For a finite and maximal code $X$\nover $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words,\ncalled $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a\nstandard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and\nupper bounds to its factor complexity.\n  For any code $X$ we say that $\\psi_X$ is conservative when\n$\\psi_X(X^{*})\\subseteq X^{*}$. We study conservative maps $\\psi_X$ and\nconditions on $X$ assuring that $\\psi_X$ is conservative. We also investigate\nthe special case of morphic-conservative maps $\\psi_{X}$, i.e., maps such that\n$\\phi\\circ \\psi = \\psi_X\\circ \\phi$ for an injective morphism $\\phi$. Finally,\nwe generalize $\\psi_X$ by replacing palindromic closure with\n$\\theta$-palindromic closure, where $\\theta$ is any involutory antimorphism of\n$A^*$. This yields an extension of the class of $\\theta$-standard words\nintroduced by the authors in 2006.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 08:26:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 07:00:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 00:58:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 15:29:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["de Luca", "Aldo", ""], ["De Luca", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.2077", "submitter": "Mathilde Noual", "authors": "Mathilde Noual and Sylvain Sen\\'e", "title": "Towards a theory of modelling with Boolean automata networks - I.\n  Theorisation and observations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although models are built on the basis of some observations of reality, the\nconcepts that derive theoretically from their definitions as well as from their\ncharacteristics and properties are not necessarily direct consequences of these\ninitial observations.

Under a factorization assumption,\nwe call traffic independence the asymptotic rule that plays the role of\nindependence with respect to traffic distributions. Wigner matrices, Haar\nunitary matrices and uniform permutation matrices converge in traffic\ndistributions, a fact which yields new results on the limiting *-distributions\nof several matrices we can construct from them. Then we define the abstract\ntraffic spaces as non commutative probability spaces with more structure. We\nprove that at an algebraic level, traffic independence in some sense unifies\nthe three canonical notions of tensor, free and Boolean independence. A central\nlimiting theorem is stated in this context, interpolating between the tensor,\nfree and Boolean central limit theorems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Nov 2011 18:37:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 15:49:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Jun 2012 11:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 14:59:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 11 May 2015 12:36:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 16:54:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 09:14:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2018 14:58:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Male", "Camille", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4729", "submitter": "Yanhua Li", "authors": "Yanhua Li and Wei Chen and Yajun Wang and Zhi-Li Zhang", "title": "Influence Diffusion Dynamics and Influence Maximization in Social\n  Networks with Friend and Foe Relationships", "comments": "27 pages, 23 figures, A short version appears in proceedings of the\n  6th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.DM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Influence diffusion and influence maximization in large-scale online social\nnetworks (OSNs) have been extensively studied, because of their impacts on\nenabling effective online viral marketing.

We introduce a new concept, LAYER NUMBER for NCF. Based on this, we\nobtain explicit formulas for the the following important parameters: 1) Number\nof all the nested canalyzing functions, 2) Number of all the NCFs with given\nLAYER NUMBER, 3) Hamming weight of any NCF, 4) The activity number of any\nvariable of any NCF, 5) The average sensitivity of any NCF. Based on these\nformulas, we show the activity number is greater for those variables in out\nlayer and equal in the same layer. We show the average sensitivity attains\nminimal value when the NCF has only one layer. We also prove the average\nsensitivity for any NCF (No matter how many variables it has) is between 0 and\n2. Hence, theoretically, we show why NCF is stable since a random Boolean\nfunction has average sensitivity $\\frac{n}{2}$. Finally we conjecture that the\nNCF attain the maximal average sensitivity if it has the maximal LAYER NUMBER\n$n-1$. Hence, we guess the uniform upper bound for the average sensitivity of\nany NCF can be reduced to 4/3 which is tight.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 15:48:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Yuan", ""], ["Adeyeye", "John O.", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7280", "submitter": "Rico Zenklusen", "authors": "Michel X.

In 2010, Byrka et al.\npresented a ln(4)+epsilon approximation based on a hypergraphic LP relaxation,\nbut surprisingly, their analysis does not provide a matching bound on the\nintegrality gap.\n  We take a fresh look at hypergraphic LP relaxations for the Steiner tree\nproblem - one that heavily exploits methods and results from the theory of\nmatroids and submodular functions - which leads to stronger integrality gaps,\nfaster algorithms, and a variety of structural insights of independent\ninterest. More precisely, we present a deterministic ln(4)+epsilon\napproximation that compares against the LP value and therefore proves a\nmatching ln(4) upper bound on the integrality gap.\n  Similarly to Byrka et al., we iteratively fix one component and update the LP\nsolution. However, whereas they solve an LP at every iteration after\ncontracting a component, we show how feasibility can be maintained by a greedy\nprocedure on a well-chosen matroid. Apart from avoiding the expensive step of\nsolving a hypergraphic LP at each iteration, our algorithm can be analyzed\nusing a simple potential function. This gives an easy means to determine\nstronger approximation guarantees and integrality gaps when considering\nrestricted graph topologies. In particular, this readily leads to a 73/60 bound\non the integrality gap for quasi-bipartite graphs.\n  For the case of quasi-bipartite graphs, we present a simple algorithm to\ntransform an optimal solution to the bidirected cut relaxation to an optimal\nsolution of the hypergraphic relaxation, leading to a fast 73/60 approximation\nfor quasi-bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show how the separation problem of\nthe hypergraphic relaxation can be solved by computing maximum flows, providing\na fast independence oracle for our matroids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 19:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 20:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Goemans", "Michel X.", ""], ["Olver", "Neil", ""], ["Rothvoss", "Thomas", ""], ["Zenklusen", "Rico", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7284", "submitter": "Yoshio Sano Ph.D.", "authors": "Akihiro Munemasa, Yoshio Sano, Tetsuji Taniguchi", "title": "Fat Hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-1-\\tau$", "comments": "19 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Ars Mathematica Contemporanea 7 (2014) 247-262", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show that all fat Hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue\nat least -1-\\tau, where \\tau is the golden ratio, can be described by a finite\nset of fat (-1-\\tau)-irreducible Hoffman graphs.
