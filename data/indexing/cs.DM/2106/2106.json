We engage in a\nsystematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the Existential Theory\nof the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we first consider the\nproblem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an\ninstance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form $\\exists x_1,\n\\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\Phi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$, where $\\Phi$ is a\nwell-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\\{0, 1, +,\n\\cdot, \\geq, >, \\wedge, \\vee, \\neg\\}$, the goal is to check whether this\nsentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a\npolynomial-time reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\\subseteq$ ER\n$\\subseteq$ PSPACE.\n  We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)\nand some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that\nmultiplication constraints ($x \\cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),\nor inversion constraints ($x\\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish\nER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality\nconstraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some\nother mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality\nconstraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to\ninequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any\nwell-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \\geq 0$ and\n$g(x,y) \\geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.\n  We apply our findings to geometric packing and answer an open question by\nAbrahamsen et al.

However, while every\nnon-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little is known about structural\nproperties of graphs with a bounded number of moplexes. The study of these\ngraphs is motivated by the parallel between moplexes in general graphs and\nsimplicial modules in chordal graphs: Unlike in the moplex setting, properties\nof chordal graphs with a bounded number of simplicial modules are well\nunderstood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two simplicial modules\nare interval. In this work we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex graphs,\nwhich are defined as graphs containing at most $k$ moplexes. Of particular\ninterest is the smallest nontrivial case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to\nthe class of interval graphs. As our main structural result, we show that the\nclass of connected $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the classes of\nproper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs; moreover, both inclusions\nare tight for hereditary classes. From a complexity theoretic viewpoint, this\nleads to the natural question of whether the presence of at most two moplexes\nguarantees a sufficient amount of structure to efficiently solve problems that\nare known to be intractable on cocomparability graphs, but not on proper\ninterval graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this question negatively\nfor two prominent problems fitting this profile, namely Graph Isomorphism and\nMax-Cut. On the other hand, we prove that every connected $2$-moplex graph\ncontains a Hamiltonian path, generalising the same property of connected proper\ninterval graphs. Furthermore, for graphs with a higher number of moplexes, we\nlift the previously known result that graphs without asteroidal triples have at\nmost two moplexes to the more general setting of larger asteroidal sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 10:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dallard", "Cl\u00e9ment", ""], ["Ganian", "Robert", ""], ["Hatzel", "Meike", ""], ["Krnc", "Matja\u017e", ""], ["Milani\u010d", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.10093", "submitter": "Oliver Knill", "authors": "Oliver Knill", "title": "Remarks about the Arithmetic of Graphs", "comments": "16 pages, some typos fixed in revision", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The arithmetic of N, Z, Q, R can be extended to a graph arithmetic where N is\nthe semiring of finite simple graphs and where Z and Q are integral domains,\nculminating in a Banach algebra R.

In this work, we present\nHetEng, a Cluster Head (CH) selection process that extended an existing\nclustering algorithm, named Smart-BEEM. To this end, we proposed a statistical\napproach that distributes energy consumption among highly energetic nodes in\nthe network topology by constantly changing the CH role between the nodes based\non their real energy levels (in joules). Experimental results showed that\nHetEng resulted in a 6.6% increase of alive nodes and 3% improvement in\nresidual energy among the nodes in comparison with SmartBEEM. Moreover, our\nmethod reduced the total number of iterations by 1% on average.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 20:47:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Moasses", "Hamed", ""], ["Ghaderzadeh", "Abdulbaghi", ""], ["Khamforoosh", "Keyhan", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15992", "submitter": "Konrad Anand", "authors": "Konrad Anand and Mark Jerrum", "title": "Perfect Sampling in Infinite Spin Systems via Strong Spatial Mixing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a simple algorithm that perfectly samples configurations from the\nunique Gibbs measure of a spin system on a potentially infinite graph $G$.

Elimination trees appear in\nmany guises in computer science and discrete mathematics, and they encode many\ninteresting combinatorial objects, such as bitstrings, permutations and binary\ntrees. We apply the recent Hartung-Hoang-M\\\"utze-Williams combinatorial\ngeneration framework to elimination trees, and prove that all elimination trees\nfor a chordal graph $G$ can be generated by tree rotations using a simple\ngreedy algorithm. This yields a short proof for the existence of Hamilton paths\non graph associahedra of chordal graphs. Graph associahedra are a general class\nof high-dimensional polytopes introduced by Carr, Devadoss, and Postnikov,\nwhose vertices correspond to elimination trees and whose edges correspond to\ntree rotations. As special cases of our results, we recover several classical\nGray codes for bitstrings, permutations and binary trees, and we obtain a new\nGray code for partial permutations. Our algorithm for generating all\nelimination trees for a chordal graph $G$ can be implemented in time\n$\\mathcal{O}(m+n)$ per generated elimination tree, where $m$ and $n$ are the\nnumber of edges and vertices of $G$, respectively. If $G$ is a tree, we improve\nthis to a loopless algorithm running in time $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per generated\nelimination tree. We also prove that our algorithm produces a Hamilton cycle on\nthe graph associahedron of $G$, rather than just Hamilton path, if the graph\n$G$ is chordal and 2-connected. Moreover, our algorithm characterizes\nchordality, i.e., it computes a Hamilton path on the graph associahedron of $G$\nif and only if $G$ is chordal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:56:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 15:00:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cardinal", "Jean", ""], ["Merino", "Arturo", ""], ["M\u00fctze", "Torsten", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.16218", "submitter": "Sandra Kiefer", "authors": "Martin Grohe, Sandra Kiefer", "title": "Logarithmic Weisfeiler-Leman Identifies All Planar Graphs", "comments": "21 pages, 2 figures, accepted at ICALP 2021", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC cs.LO math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm is a well-known combinatorial procedure\nfor detecting symmetries in graphs and it is widely used in graph-isomorphism\ntests.
