Since the publication of the classic\nErd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa theorem in 1965, this problem received significant scientific\nattention in the fields of Graph Theory and Algorithm Design. In particular,\nthis problem is one of the first problems studied in the framework of\nParameterized Complexity. The non-uniform fixed-parameter tractability of Cycle\nPacking follows from the Robertson-Seymour theorem, a fact already observed by\nFellows and Langston in the 1980s. In 1994, Bodlaender showed that Cycle\nPacking can be solved in time $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^2)}\\cdot |V|$ using exponential\nspace.

Our\nalgorithm \"guesses\" (by dynamic programming) lonely cuts and edges. Then we\npartition the instance into smaller instances and strengthen the LP, requiring\nvalue at least three for busy cuts. By setting up a $k$-stage recursive dynamic\nprogram, we can compute a spanning tree $(V,S)$ and an LP solution $y$ such\nthat $(\\frac{1}{2}+O(2^{-k}))y$ is in the $T$-join polyhedron, where $T$ is the\nset of vertices whose degree in $S$ has the wrong parity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Jul 2017 07:01:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jan 2018 17:45:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2018 12:35:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 12:59:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Traub", "Vera", ""], ["Vygen", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.04062", "submitter": "Maria Bras-Amor\\'os", "authors": "Maria Bras-Amor\\'os", "title": "A Note on the Inheritance of the Isometry-Dual Property under Puncturing\n  AG Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a sequence of AG codes evaluating at a set of evaluation points\n$P_1,\\dots,P_n$ the functions having only poles at a defining point $Q$, with\nthe sequence of codes satisfying the isometry-dual condition (i.e. containing\nat the same time primal and their dual codes).

Amending\nthis issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing\nsubmodular functions, has been the focus of recent works.\n  One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of\nattention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the\napproximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization\nsubject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from\nsubmodularity.

More recently, hardness results for problems in P were achieved\nusing reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions such as: Strong Exponential\nTime Hypothesis (SETH), 3SUM and All-Pairs Shortest-Paths (APSP). According to\nthese assumptions, many graph theoretic problems do not admit truly\nsubquadratic algorithms, nor even truly subcubic algorithms (Williams and\nWilliams, FOCS 2010 and Abboud, Grandoni, Williams, SODA 2015). A central\ntechnique used to tackle the difficulty of the above mentioned problems is\nfixed-parameter algorithms for polynomial-time problems with polynomial\ndependency in the fixed parameter (P-FPT). This technique was introduced by\nAbboud, Williams and Wang in SODA 2016 and continued by Husfeldt (IPEC 2016)\nand Fomin et al. (SODA 2017), using the treewidth as a parameter. Applying this\ntechnique to clique-width, another important graph parameter, remained to be\ndone. In this paper we study several graph theoretic problems for which\nhardness results exist such as cycle problems (triangle detection, triangle\ncounting, girth, diameter), distance problems (diameter, eccentricities, Gromov\nhyperbolicity, betweenness centrality) and maximum matching. We provide\nhardness results and fully polynomial FPT algorithms, using clique-width and\nsome of its upper-bounds as parameters (split-width, modular-width and\n$P\\_4$-sparseness).

Unfortunately, results based on them are\nnon-constructive, as their proofs inherently use an induction on overlapping\nsubgraphs and these overlaps hinder to bound the running time to a polynomial.\nFor special cases however, computational results of Tutte paths are known: For\n4-connected planar graphs, Tutte paths are in fact Hamiltonian paths and Chiba\nand Nishizeki showed how to compute such paths in linear time. For 3-connected\nplanar graphs, Tutte paths have a more complicated structure, and it has only\nrecently been shown that they can be computed in polynomial time. However,\nTutte paths are defined for general 2-connected planar graphs and this is what\nmost applications need. Unfortunately, no computational results are known. We\ngive the first efficient algorithm that computes a Tutte path (for the general\ncase of 2-connected planar graphs). One of the strongest existence results\nabout such Tutte paths is due to Sanders, which allows to prescribe the end\nvertices and an intermediate edge of the desired path. Encompassing and\nstrengthening all previous computational results on Tutte paths, we show how to\ncompute this special Tutte path efficiently. Our method refines both, the\nresults of Thomassen and Sanders, and avoids overlapping subgraphs by using a\nnovel iterative decomposition along 2-separators.
