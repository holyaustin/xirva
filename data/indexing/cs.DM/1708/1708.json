First of all,\nthey have a large number of heterogeneous components. Secondly, their\nconnectivity is extremely dynamic. Nodes can come and go, links can be removed\nand added over time. Traditional modeling and simulation techniques amalgamate\nor ignore such dynamics and therefore, are unable to represent them. Complex\ncommunication networks are therefore better modeled as mathematical structures\ncalled graphs. Modeling as graphs allows for the application of complex\ntechniques such as various network based analysis techniques. While this is a\nvery important and much needed skill for communication networks researchers and\nengineers, to the best of our knowledge, currently there is no resource\ndescribing these details. In this paper, we give a concise but comprehensive\nreview of modeling complex communication networks as graphs. We also show how\nto apply complex social network analysis on these models besides a\ndemonstration of formal modeling network dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 07:17:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Bisma S.", ""], ["Niazi", "Muaz A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.00188", "submitter": "Mohammad Reza Hooshmandasl", "authors": "M.

It is defined as the ratio of the Euclidean distance to the\ngraph distance between these vertices. It is often used as an average, for\ninstance to describe the accessibility of a single vertex relatively to all the\nother vertices in the graph, or even to summarize the graph as a whole. In some\ncases, one needs to process the Straightness between not only vertices, but\nalso any other points constituting the graph of interest. Suppose for instance\nthat our graph represents a road network and we do not want to limit ourselves\nto crossroad-to-crossroad itineraries, but allow any street number to be a\nstarting point or destination. In this situation, the standard approach\nconsists in: 1) discretizing the graph edges, 2) processing the\nvertex-to-vertex Straightness considering the additional vertices resulting\nfrom this discretization, and 3) performing the appropriate average on the\nobtained values. However, this discrete approximation can be computationally\nexpensive on large graphs, and its precision has not been clearly assessed. In\nthis article, we adopt a continuous approach to average the Straightness over\nthe edges of spatial graphs. This allows us to derive 5 distinct measures able\nto characterize precisely the accessibility of the whole graph, as well as\nindividual vertices and edges. Our method is generic and could be applied to\nother measures designed for spatial graphs. We perform an experimental\nevaluation of our continuous average Straightness measures, and show how they\nbehave differently from the traditional vertex-to-vertex ones. Moreover, we\nalso study their discrete approximations, and show that our approach is\nglobally less demanding in terms of both processing time and memory usage.

In this paper, we\nconsider packetized power in networks for a finite duration, giving symbols and\ntheir energies to the networks. A network structure is defined using a graph\nwhose nodes represent routers, sources, and destinations. First, we introduce\nsymbol propagation matrix (SPM) in which symbols are transferred at links\nduring unit times. Packetized power is described as a network flow in a\nspatio-temporal structure. Then, we study the problem of selecting an SPM in\nterms of transferability, that is, the possibility to represent given energies\nat sources and destinations during the finite duration. To select an SPM, we\nconsider a network flow problem of packetized power. The problem is formulated\nas an M-convex submodular flow problem which is known as generalization of the\nminimum cost flow problem and solvable. Finally, through examples, we verify\nthat this formulation provides reasonable packetized power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 23:33:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nawata", "Shinya", ""], ["Maki", "Atsuto", ""], ["Hikihara", "Takashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.03077", "submitter": "Xin Zhang", "authors": "Weichan Liu, Chen Gong, Lifang Wu, Xin Zhang", "title": "A note on the vertex arboricity of signed graphs", "comments": "8 pages, 1 figure, will be published in Utilitas Mathematica", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A signed tree-coloring of a signed graph $(G,\\sigma)$ is a vertex coloring\n$c$ so that $G^{c}(i,\\pm)$ is a forest for every $i\\in c(u)$ and $u\\in V(G)$,\nwhere $G^{c}(i,\\pm)$ is the subgraph of $(G,\\sigma)$ whose vertex set is the\nset of vertices colored by $i$ or $-i$ and edge set is the set of positive\nedges with two end-vertices colored both by $i$ or both by $-i$, along with the\nset of negative edges with one end-vertex colored by $i$ and the other colored\nby $-i$.

We consider two families\nof graph classes with nice convex drawings: outer $k$-planar graphs, where each\nedge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges; and, outer $k$-quasi-planar graphs\nwhere no $k$ edges can mutually cross. We show that the outer $k$-planar graphs\nare $(\\lfloor\\sqrt{4k+1}\\rfloor+1)$-degenerate, and consequently that every\nouter $k$-planar graph can be $(\\lfloor\\sqrt{4k+1}\\rfloor+2)$-colored, and this\nbound is tight. We further show that every outer $k$-planar graph has a\nbalanced separator of size $O(k)$. This implies that every outer $k$-planar\ngraph has treewidth $O(k)$. For fixed $k$, these small balanced separators\nallow us to obtain a simple quasi-polynomial time algorithm to test whether a\ngiven graph is outer $k$-planar, i.e., none of these recognition problems are\nNP-complete unless ETH fails. For the outer $k$-quasi-planar graphs we prove\nthat, unlike other beyond-planar graph classes, every edge-maximal $n$-vertex\nouter $k$-quasi planar graph has the same number of edges, namely $2(k-1)n -\n\\binom{2k-1}{2}$. We also construct planar 3-trees that are not outer\n$3$-quasi-planar. Finally, we restrict outer $k$-planar and outer\n$k$-quasi-planar drawings to \\emph{closed} drawings, where the vertex sequence\non the boundary is a cycle in the graph. For each $k$, we express closed outer\n$k$-planarity and \\emph{closed outer $k$-quasi-planarity} in extended monadic\nsecond-order logic. Thus, closed outer $k$-planarity is linear-time testable by\nCourcelle's Theorem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 12:26:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:44:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chaplick", "Steven", ""], ["Kryven", "Myroslav", ""], ["Liotta", "Giuseppe", ""], ["L\u00f6ffler", "Andre", ""], ["Wolff", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08748", "submitter": "Martin Skutella", "authors": "Martin Gro{\\ss} and Marc E.
