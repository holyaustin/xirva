In this paper we develop a general\nframework that allows us to derive a number of new results, in particular when\n$f$ may be a non-monotone function.

Although this approach has been used quite successfully, it has been\nlimited in some important ways. We overcome these limitations as follows.\n  First, we give constant factor approximation algorithms to maximize $F$ over\na down-closed polytope $P$ described by an efficient separation oracle.\nPreviously this was known only for monotone functions. For non-monotone\nfunctions, a constant factor was known only when the polytope was either the\nintersection of a fixed number of knapsack constraints or a matroid polytope.\nSecond, we show that contention resolution schemes are an effective way to\nround a fractional solution, even when $f$ is non-monotone. In particular,\ncontention resolution schemes for different polytopes can be combined to handle\nthe intersection of different constraints. Via LP duality we show that a\ncontention resolution scheme for a constraint is related to the correlation gap\nof weighted rank functions of the constraint. This leads to an optimal\ncontention resolution scheme for the matroid polytope.\n  Our results provide a broadly applicable framework for maximizing linear and\nsubmodular functions subject to independence constraints.

The algorithm uses a new graph parameter\ncalled strong degree defined based on the quality of neighbours of a node. The\nparameters are so chosen to ensure high connectivity, cluster stability and\nenergy efficient communication among nodes of high dynamic nature. This paper\nalso includes the experimental results of the algorithm implemented using the\nnetwork simulator NS2. The experimental results show that the algorithm is\nsuitable for high speed networks and generate stable clusters with less\nmaintenance overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2011 10:49:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Janakiraman", "T.
