In this paper we present upper bounds\non the minimum Hamming distance of QC LDPC codes and study how these upper\nbounds depend on graph structure parameters (like variable degrees, check node\ndegrees, girth) of the Tanner graph and of the underlying proto-graph.\nMoreover, for several classes of proto-graphs we present explicit QC LDPC code\nconstructions that achieve (or come close to) the respective minimum Hamming\ndistance upper bounds. Because of the tight algebraic connection between QC\ncodes and convolutional codes, we can state similar results for the free\nHamming distance of convolutional codes. In fact, some QC code statements are\nestablished by first proving the corresponding convolutional code statements\nand then using a result by Tanner that says that the minimum Hamming distance\nof a QC code is upper bounded by the free Hamming distance of the convolutional\ncode that is obtained by \"unwrapping\" the QC code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 22:22:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Aug 2011 12:36:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Smarandache", "Roxana", ""], ["Vontobel", "Pascal O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4417", "submitter": "Marcel Wild", "authors": "Marcel Wild", "title": "ALLSAT compressed with wildcards: All, or all maximum independent sets", "comments": "The best way to efficiently generate all maximum anticliques of a\n  bipartite graph, a problem left open in v3, is settled in the present version\n  v4", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An odd cycle cover is a vertex set whose removal makes a graph bipartite.
