The\ninformation-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons needed in the\nworst case is log e(P), the binary logarithm of the number of linear extensions\nof P. In a breakthrough paper, Jeff Kahn and Jeong Han Kim (J. Comput. System\nSci. 51 (3), 390-399, 1995) showed that there exists a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for the problem achieving this bound up to a constant factor. Their\nalgorithm invokes the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration for determining the\nnext comparison, making it impractical.\n  We develop efficient algorithms for sorting under partial information. Like\nKahn and Kim, our approach relies on graph entropy. However, our algorithms\ndiffer in essential ways from theirs. Rather than resorting to convex\nprogramming for computing the entropy, we approximate the entropy, or make sure\nit is computed only once, in a restricted class of graphs, permitting the use\nof a simpler algorithm. Specifically, we present:\n  - an O(n^2) algorithm performing O(log n log e(P)) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing at most (1+ epsilon) log e(P) + O_epsilon\n(n) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing O(log e(P)) comparisons.\n  All our algorithms can be implemented in such a way that their computational\nbottleneck is confined in a preprocessing phase, while the sorting phase is\ncompleted in O(q) + O(n) time, where q denotes the number of comparisons\nperformed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2009 14:36:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Sep 2010 12:58:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 13:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Cardinal", "Jean", ""], ["Fiorini", "Samuel", ""], ["Joret", "Gwena\u00ebl", ""], ["Jungers", "Rapha\u00ebl", ""], ["Munro", "J.

For binary CSP\ninstances (i.e., where each constraint involves only two variables), the\nsituation is well understood: the complexity of the problem essentially depends\non the treewidth of the graph of the constraints. However, this is not the\ncorrect answer if constraints with unbounded number of variables are allowed,\nand in particular, for CSP instances arising from query evaluation problems in\ndatabase theory. Formally, if H is a class of hypergraphs, then let CSP(H) be\nCSP restricted to instances whose hypergraph is in H. Our goal is to\ncharacterize those classes of hypergraphs for which CSP(H) is polynomial-time\nsolvable or fixed-parameter tractable, parameterized by the number of\nvariables. Note that in the applications related to database query evaluation,\nwe usually assume that the number of variables is much smaller than the size of\nthe instance, thus parameterization by the number of variables is a meaningful\nquestion. The most general known property of H that makes CSP(H)\npolynomial-time solvable is bounded fractional hypertree width. Here we\nintroduce a new hypergraph measure called submodular width, and show that\nbounded submodular width of H implies that CSP(H) is fixed-parameter tractable.\nIn a matching hardness result, we show that if H has unbounded submodular\nwidth, then CSP(H) is not fixed-parameter tractable, unless the Exponential\nTime Hypothesis fails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 14:07:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 09:35:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2011 15:12:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Marx", "D\u00e1niel", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0900", "submitter": "Heidi Gebauer", "authors": "Heidi Gebauer", "title": "Construction of a Non-2-colorable k-uniform Hypergraph with Few Edges", "comments": "3 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how to construct a non-2-colorable k-uniform hypergraph with (2^(1 +\no(1)))^k edges.
