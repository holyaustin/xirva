The symbols of these patterns are treated as\nvariables and the rank of the pattern is its number of variables. Zimin type of\na word $x$ is introduced here as the maximum rank of a Zimin pattern matching\n$x$. We show how to compute Zimin type of a word on-line in linear time.\nConsequently we get a quadratic time, linear-space algorithm for searching\nZimin patterns in words. Then we how the Zimin type of the length $n$ prefix of\nthe infinite Fibonacci word is related to the representation of $n$ in the\nFibonacci numeration system. Using this relation, we prove that Zimin types of\nsuch prefixes and Zimin patterns inside them can be found in logarithmic time.\nFinally, we give some bounds on the function $f(n,k)$ such that every $k$-ary\nword of length at least $f(n,k)$ has a factor that matches the rank $n$ Zimin\npattern.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 19:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rytter", "Wojciech", ""], ["Shur", "Arseny M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8524", "submitter": "Manuel Sorge", "authors": "Yann Disser, Stefan Kratsch, Manuel Sorge", "title": "The Minimum Feasible Tileset problem", "comments": "23 pages, 2 figures.
