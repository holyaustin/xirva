Specifically, we\nconsider a setting in which k identical (probabilistic) agents, initially\nplaced at some central location, collectively search for a treasure in the\ntwo-dimensional plane. The treasure is placed at a target location by an\nadversary and the goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both\nk and D, where D is the distance between the central location and the target.\nThis is biologically motivated by cooperative, central place foraging such as\nperformed by ants around their nest. In this type of search there is a strong\npreference to locate nearby food sources before those that are further away.\nOur focus is on trying to find what can be achieved if communication is limited\nor altogether absent. Indeed, to avoid overlaps agents must be highly dispersed\nmaking communication difficult. Furthermore, if agents do not commence the\nsearch in synchrony then even initial communication is problematic. This holds,\nin particular, with respect to the question of whether the agents can\ncommunicate and conclude their total number, k. It turns out that the knowledge\nof k by the individual agents is crucial for performance. Indeed, it is a\nstraightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is\n$\\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched\nif the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. We present\nan almost tight bound for the competitive penalty that must be paid, in the\nrunning time, if agents have no information about k.

Hopcroft and D. Sheldon originally introduced network reputation games to\ninvestigate the self-interested behavior of web authors who want to maximize\ntheir PageRank on a directed web graph by choosing their outlinks in a game\ntheoretic manner. They give best response strategies for each player and\ncharacterize properties of web graphs which are Nash equilibria. In this paper\nwe consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such\nas certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at\nwill, but typically cannot add links without the other player's permission. In\nthe deletion-model players are free to delete any of their bidirectional links\nbut may not add links. We study the problem of determining whether the given\ngraph represents a Nash equilibrium or not in this model. We give an $O(n^{2})$\ntime algorithm for a tree, and a parametric $O(2^{k}n^{4})$ time algorithm for\ngeneral graphs, where $k$ is the maximum vertex degree in any biconnected\ncomponent of the graph. In the request- delete-model players are free to delete\nany bidirectional links and add any directed links, since these additions can\nbe done unilaterally and can be viewed as requests for bidirected links. For\nthis model we give an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in\ntrees. Finally, in the add-delete- model we allow a node to make arbitrary\ndeletions and the addition of a single bidirectional link if it would increase\nthe page rank of the other player also. In this model we give a parametric\nalgorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in general graphs and characterize so\ncalled $\\alpha$-insensitive Nash Equilibria. We also give a result showing a\nlarge class of graphs where there is an edge addition that causes the PageRank\nof both of its endpoints to increase, suggesting convergence towards complete\nsubgraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2012 14:17:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 13:54:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Avis", "David", ""], ["Iwama", "Kazuo", ""], ["Paku", "Daichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.6785", "submitter": "Francesca Fiorenzi", "authors": "Tullio Ceccherini-Silberstein, Michel Coornaert, Francesca Fiorenzi\n  and Zoran Sunic", "title": "Cellular automata on regular rooted trees", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "CIAA 2012, Lect.

For\nexample, one may wish to select a subset of high-quality sequences that\nrepresent the diversity of a larger collection of sequences. One may also wish\nto specialize a large database of characterized \"reference sequences\" to a\nsmaller subset that is as close as possible on average to a collection of\n\"query sequences\" of interest. Such a representative subset can be useful\nwhenever one wishes to find a set of reference sequences that is appropriate to\nuse for comparative analysis of environmentally-derived sequences, such as for\nselecting \"reference tree\" sequences for phylogenetic placement of metagenomic\nreads. In this paper we formalize these problems in terms of the minimization\nof the Average Distance to the Closest Leaf (ADCL) and investigate algorithms\nto perform the relevant minimization. We show that the greedy algorithm is not\neffective, show that a variant of the Partitioning Among Medoids (PAM)\nheuristic gets stuck in local minima, and develop an exact dynamic programming\napproach. Using this exact program we note that the performance of PAM appears\nto be good for simulated trees, and is faster than the exact algorithm for\nsmall trees. On the other hand, the exact program gives solutions for all\nnumbers of leaves less than or equal to the given desired number of leaves,\nwhile PAM only gives a solution for the pre-specified number of leaves. Via\napplication to real data, we show that the ADCL criterion chooses chimeric\nsequences less often than random subsets, while the maximization of\nphylogenetic diversity chooses them more often than random. These algorithms\nhave been implemented in publicly available software.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2012 01:41:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 18:05:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Matsen", "Frederick A.", ""], ["Gallagher", "Aaron", ""], ["McCoy", "Connor", ""]]}]
