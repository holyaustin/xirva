Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items. Next, a\nspecific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it\nis shown that $m=O(d^3\\log^3n)$ non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify\n$d$ defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing\nproblem are considered, for which parallel results are developed.

This subclass\nof perfect graphs has been extensively studied, due to both its interesting\nstructure and its numerous applications. Several efficient algorithms for\noptimization problems that are NP-hard on general graphs have been designed for\ntolerance graphs. In spite of this, the recognition of tolerance graphs -\nnamely, the problem of deciding whether a given graph is a tolerance graph - as\nwell as the recognition of their main subclass of bounded tolerance graphs,\nhave been the most fundamental open problems on this class of graphs (cf. the\nbook on tolerance graphs \\cite{GolTol04}) since their introduction in 1982\n\\cite{GoMo82}. In this article we prove that both recognition problems are\nNP-complete, even in the case where the input graph is a trapezoid graph. The\npresented results are surprising because, on the one hand, most subclasses of\nperfect graphs admit polynomial recognition algorithms and, on the other hand,\nbounded tolerance graphs were believed to be efficiently recognizable as they\nare a natural special case of trapezoid graphs (which can be recognized in\npolynomial time) and share a very similar structure with them. For our\nreduction we extend the notion of an \\emph{acyclic orientation} of permutation\nand trapezoid graphs. Our main tool is a new algorithm that uses \\emph{vertex\nsplitting} to transform a given trapezoid graph into a permutation graph, while\npreserving this new acyclic orientation property. This method of vertex\nsplitting is of independent interest; very recently, it has been proved a\npowerful tool also in the design of efficient recognition algorithms for other\nclasses of graphs \\cite{MC-Trapezoid}.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2010 10:24:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 13:36:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mertzios", "George B.", ""], ["Sau", "Ignasi", ""], ["Zaks", "Shmuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3661", "submitter": "Amit Daniely", "authors": "Amit Daniely, Nathan Linial", "title": "Tight products and Expansion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.
