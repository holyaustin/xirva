The minimum number of cops needed to guarantee capture of\na robber on $G$ is the cop number of $G$, denoted $c(G)$, and the minimum\nnumber of rounds needed for them to do so is the capture time.

The model\nemploys an utility function as in the the MNL, and a dominance relation between\nproducts. When consumers are offered an assortmentS , they first discard all\ndominated products in S and then select one of the remaining products using the\nstandard MNL. This model may violate the regularity condition, which states\nthat the probability of choosing a product cannot increase if the offer set is\nenlarged. Therefore, the 2SLM falls outside the large family of discrete choice\nmodels based on random utility which contains almost all choice models studied\nin revenue management. We prove that the assortment problem under the 2SLM is\npolynomial-time solvable. Moreover, we show that the capacitated assortment\noptimization problem is NP-hard and but it admits polynomial-time algorithms\nfor the relevant special cases cases where (1) the dominance relation is\nattractiveness-correlated and (2) its transitive reduction is a forest. The\nproofs exploit a strong connection between assortments under the 2SLM and\nindependent sets in comparability graphs. Finally, we study the associated\njoint pricing and assortment problem under this model. First, we show that well\nknown optimal pricing policy for the MNL can be arbitrarily bad. Our main\nresult in this section is the development of an efficient algorithm for this\npricing problem. The resulting optimal pricing strategy is simple to describe:\nit assigns the same price for all products, except for the one with the highest\nattractiveness and as well as for the one with the lowest attractiveness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 21:11:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:58:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 04:23:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Flores", "Alvaro", ""], ["Berbeglia", "Gerardo", ""], ["Van Hentenryck", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.08680", "submitter": "Darko Dimitrov", "authors": "Darko Dimitrov, Zhibin Du, Carlos M. da Fonseca", "title": "Forbidden branches in trees with minimal atom-bond connectivity index", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematics and Computation, Volume 313, 15 November 2017,\n  Pages 418 - 430", "doi": "10.1016/j.amc.2017.06.014", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index has been, in recent years, one of the\nmost actively studied vertex-degree-based graph invariants in chemical graph\ntheory.

As forbidden configurations we consider all 8 ways in which a\npair of triangles in such a point set can interact. This leads to 256 extremal\nTur\\'an-type questions. We give nearly tight (within a $\\log n$ factor) bounds\nfor 248 of these questions and show that the remaining 8 questions are all\nasymptotically equivalent to Stein's longstanding tripod packing problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 13:40:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 13:52:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2018 14:37:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Aronov", "Boris", ""], ["Dujmovi\u0107", "Vida", ""], ["Morin", "Pat", ""], ["Ooms", "Aur\u00e9lien", ""], ["da Silveira", "Lu\u00eds Fernando Schultz Xavier", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10200", "submitter": "Pascal Lenzner", "authors": "Ankit Chauhan, Pascal Lenzner, Anna Melnichenko, Louise Molitor", "title": "Selfish Network Creation with Non-Uniform Edge Cost", "comments": "To appear at SAGT'17", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.DM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Network creation games investigate complex networks from a game-theoretic\npoint of view. Based on the original model by Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03] many\nvariants have been introduced. However, almost all versions have the drawback\nthat edges are treated uniformly, i.e. every edge has the same cost and that\nthis common parameter heavily influences the outcomes and the analysis of these\ngames.\n  We propose and analyze simple and natural parameter-free network creation\ngames with non-uniform edge cost. Our models are inspired by social networks\nwhere the cost of forming a link is proportional to the popularity of the\ntargeted node. Besides results on the complexity of computing a best response\nand on various properties of the sequential versions, we show that the most\ngeneral version of our model has constant Price of Anarchy. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first proof of a constant Price of Anarchy for any\nnetwork creation game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 13:56:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chauhan", "Ankit", ""], ["Lenzner", "Pascal", ""], ["Melnichenko", "Anna", ""], ["Molitor", "Louise", ""]]}]
