We show that several natural\nfunctions belong to this class and relate our class to some other recent\nsubmodular function extensions.\n  We consider the optimization problem of maximizing a weakly submodular\nfunction subject to uniform and general matroid constraints. For a uniform\nmatroid constraint, the \"standard greedy algorithm\" achieves a constant\napproximation ratio where the constant (experimentally) converges to 5.95 as\nthe cardinality constraint increases. For a general matroid constraint, a\nsimple local search algorithm achieves a constant approximation ratio where the\nconstant (analytically) converges to 10.22 as the rank of the matroid\nincreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jan 2014 21:48:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 03:11:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2014 03:22:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:26:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 16 Nov 2014 23:46:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Borodin", "Allan", ""], ["Le", "Dai Tri Man", ""], ["Ye", "Yuli", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6963", "submitter": "Fern Hunt Dr", "authors": "Fern Y.
