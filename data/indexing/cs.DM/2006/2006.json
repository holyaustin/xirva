The biclique\ngraph of a graph $G$, $KB(G)$, defined as the intersection graph of the\nbicliques of $G$, was introduced and characterized in 2010.

There are some works\non this problem when restricted to some classes. In this work we give a\ncharacterization of the biclique graph of a $K_3$-free graph $G$. We prove that\n$KB(G)$ is the square graph of a particular graph which we call Mutually\nIncluded Biclique Graph of $G$ ($KB_m(G)$). Although it does not lead to a\npolynomial time recognition algorithm, it gives a new tool to prove properties\nof biclique graphs (restricted to $K_3$-free graphs) using known properties of\nsquare graphs. For instance we generalize a property about induced ${P_3}'$s in\nbiclique graphs to a property about stars and proved a conjecture posted by\nGroshaus and Montero, when restricted to $K_3$-free graphs. Also we\ncharacterize the class of biclique graphs of bipartite graphs. We prove that\n$KB($bipartite$) = ($IIC-comparability$)^2$, where IIC-comparability is a\nsubclass of comparability graphs that we call Interval Intersection Closed\nComparability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 19:11:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Groshaus", "Marina", ""], ["Guedes", "Andr\u00e9 Luiz Pires", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.00099", "submitter": "Nina Pardal", "authors": "Nina Pardal", "title": "Structural characterization of some problems on circle and interval\n  graphs", "comments": "PhD Thesis, joint supervision Universidad de Buenos\n  Aires-Universit\\'e Paris-Nord.

We consider two\ntypes of repetitions in 2D-strings: 2D-runs and quartics (quartics are a\n2D-version of squares in standard strings). Amir et al. introduced 2D-runs,\nshowed that there are $O(n^3)$ of them in an $n \\times n$ 2D-string and\npresented a simple construction giving a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^2)$ for their\nnumber (TCS 2020). We make a significant step towards closing the gap between\nthese bounds by showing that the number of 2D-runs in an $n \\times n$ 2D-string\nis $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. In particular, our bound implies that the $O(n^2\\log n +\n\\textsf{output})$ run-time of the algorithm of Amir et al. for computing\n2D-runs is also $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. We expect this result to allow for\nexploiting 2D-runs algorithmically in the area of 2D pattern matching.\n  A quartic is a 2D-string composed of $2 \\times 2$ identical blocks\n(2D-strings) that was introduced by Apostolico and Brimkov (TCS 2000), where by\nquartics they meant only primitively rooted quartics, i.e. built of a primitive\nblock. Here our notion of quartics is more general and analogous to that of\nsquares in 1D-strings. Apostolico and Brimkov showed that there are $O(n^2\n\\log^2 n)$ occurrences of primitively rooted quartics in an $n \\times n$\n2D-string and that this bound is attainable. Consequently the number of\ndistinct primitively rooted quartics is $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. Here, we prove that\nthe number of distinct general quartics is also $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. This extends\nthe rich combinatorial study of the number of distinct squares in a 1D-string,\nthat was initiated by Fraenkel and Simpson (J. Comb. Theory A 1998), to two\ndimensions.\n  Finally, we show some algorithmic applications of 2D-runs.
