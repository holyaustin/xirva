Depending on the spatial coordinate, one of the two\nsets of rules applies, namely one for altitude 0 and one for altitude bigger\nthan 0. The abscissa y=0 thus acts as a border which either absorbs or reflects\nsteps. The absorption model corresponds to the model analyzed by Banderier and\nFlajolet (\"Analytic combinatorics of directed lattice paths\"), while the\nreflecting model leads to a more complicated situation.

In 1992, Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau showed\neven more, that the number of edges that occur in a triangle is at least\n$2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor+1$, and this bound is tight. They also showed that the\nminimum number of edges that occur in a $C_{2k+1}$ for $k\\ge2$ is at least\n$11n^2/144-O(n)$, and conjectured that for any $k\\ge2$, the correct lower bound\nshould be $2n^2/9-O(n)$. Very recently, F\\\"uredi and Maleki constructed a\ncounterexample for $k=2$ and proved asymptotically matching lower bound, namely\nthat for any $\\varepsilon>0$ graphs with $(1+\\varepsilon)n^2/4$ edges contain\nat least $(2+\\sqrt{2})n^2/16 \\approx 0.2134n^2$ edges that occur in $C_5$.\n  In this paper, we use a different approach to tackle this problem and obtain\nthe following stronger result: Any $n$-vertex graph with at least $\\lfloor\nn^2/4\\rfloor+1$ edges has at least $(2+\\sqrt{2})n^2/16-O(n^{15/8})$ edges that\noccur in $C_5$. Next, for all $k\\ge 3$ and $n$ sufficiently large, we determine\nthe exact minimum number of edges that occur in $C_{2k+1}$ for $n$-vertex\ngraphs with more than $n^2/4$ edges, and show it is indeed equal to\n$\\lfloor\\frac{n^2}4\\rfloor+1-\\lfloor\\frac{n+4}6\\rfloor\\lfloor\\frac{n+1}6\\rfloor=2n^2/9-O(n)$.\nFor both results, we give a structural description of the extremal\nconfigurations as well as obtain the corresponding stability results, which\nanswer a conjecture of F\\\"uredi and Maleki.\n  The main ingredient is a novel approach that combines the flag algebras\ntogether with ideas from finite forcibility of graph limits. This approach\nallowed us to keep track of the extra edge needed to guarantee an existence of\na $C_{2k+1}$. Also, we establish the first application of semidefinite method\nin a setting, where the set of tight examples has exponential size, and arises\nfrom different constructions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 May 2016 20:11:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 01:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 12 Aug 2018 15:58:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Grzesik", "Andrzej", ""], ["Hu", "Ping", ""], ["Volec", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09190", "submitter": "Fahad Mortuza", "authors": "Fahad Bin Mortuza", "title": "A Polynomial Time Graph Isomorphism Algorithm For Graphs That Are Not\n  Locally Triangle-Free", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.CO math.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show the existence of a polynomial time graph isomorphism\nalgorithm for all graphs excluding graphs that are locally trianglefree.
