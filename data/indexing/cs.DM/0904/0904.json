For any k >=\n2 and eps>0, if P != NP this ratio cannot be improved to k-1-eps, and under the\nunique games conjecture this ratio cannot be improved to k-eps. One key idea is\nto replace individual constraints by others that have better rounding\nproperties but the same nonnegative integral solutions; another critical\ningredient is knapsack-cover inequalities. Second, for packing integer programs\n{max cx: Ax <= b, 0 <= x <= d} where A has at most k nonzeroes per column, we\ngive a (2k^2+2)-approximation algorithm. Our approach builds on the iterated LP\nrelaxation framework.

As the\nnumber of the sequences becomes larger, single sequence set model is not\nappropriate for the rapidly increasing problem sizes. For example, more and\nmore text processing applications separate a single big text file into multiple\nfiles before processing. For these applications, the underline mathematical\nmodel is multiple sequences sets (MSS). Though there is increasing use of MSS,\nthere is little research on how to process MSS efficiently. To process multiple\nsequences sets, sequences are first distributed to different sets, and then\nsequences for each set are processed. Deriving effective algorithm for MSS\nprocessing is both interesting and challenging. In this paper, we have defined\nthe cost functions and performance ratio for analysis of the quality of\nsynthesis sequences. Based on these, the problem of Process of Multiple\nSequences Sets (PMSS) is formulated. We have first proposed two greedy\nalgorithms for the PMSS problem, which are based on generalization of\nalgorithms for single sequences set. Then based on the analysis of the\ncharacteristics of multiple sequences sets, we have proposed the Distribution\nand Deposition (DDA) algorithm and DDA* algorithm for PMSS problem. In DDA\nalgorithm, the sequences are first distributed to multiple sets according to\ntheir alphabet contents; then sequences in each set are deposited by the\ndeposition algorithm. The DDA* algorithm differs from the DDA algorithm in that\nthe DDA* algorithm distributes sequences by clustering based on sequence\nprofiles. Experiments show that DDA and DDA* always output results with smaller\ncosts than other algorithms, and DDA* outperforms DDA in most instances.
