We give a new structure theorem for such identities. A direct\napplication of our theorem improves the known deterministic d^{k^k}-time\nblack-box identity test over rationals (Kayal-Saraf, FOCS 2009) to one that\ntakes d^{k^2}-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of\nindependent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem\nsettles affirmatively the stronger rank conjectures posed by Dvir-Shpilka (STOC\n2005) and Kayal-Saraf (FOCS 2009). Our techniques provide a unified framework\nthat actually beats all known rank bounds and hence gives the best running time\n(for every field) for black-box identity tests.\n  Our main theorem (almost optimally) pins down the relation between higher\ndimensional Sylvester-Gallai theorems and the rank of depth-3 identities in a\nvery transparent manner. The existence of this was hinted at by Dvir-Shpilka\n(STOC 2005), but first proven, for reals, by Kayal-Saraf (FOCS 2009). We\nintroduce the concept of Sylvester-Gallai rank bounds for any field, and show\nthe intimate connection between this and depth-3 identity rank bounds. We also\nprove the first ever theorem about high dimensional Sylvester-Gallai\nconfigurations over any field. Our proofs and techniques are very different\nfrom previous results and devise a very interesting ensemble of combinatorics\nand algebra. The latter concepts are ideal theoretic and involve a new Chinese\nremainder theorem. Our proof methods explain the structure of any depth-3\nidentity C: there is a nucleus of C that forms a low rank identity, while the\nremainder is a high dimensional Sylvester-Gallai configuration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2010 18:27:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2010 00:35:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Saxena", "Nitin", ""], ["Seshadhri", "C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.0169", "submitter": "Victor M.

In this paper we give the first polynomial time\nalgorithms for discrepancy minimization that achieve bounds similar to those\nknown existentially using the so-called Entropy Method. We also give a first\napproximation-like result for discrepancy. The main idea in our algorithms is\nto produce a coloring over time by letting the color of the elements perform a\nrandom walk (with tiny increments) starting from 0 until they reach $-1$ or\n$+1$. At each time step the random hops for various elements are correlated\nusing the solution to a semidefinite program, where this program is determined\nby the current state and the entropy method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2010 02:48:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2010 20:35:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2010 21:35:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 9 Aug 2010 01:32:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bansal", "Nikhil", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2625", "submitter": "Zolt\\'an K\\'asa", "authors": "Zoltan Kasa", "title": "Generating and ranking of Dyck words", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Informatica, 1, 1 (2009) 109-118", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new algorithm to generate all Dyck words is presented, which is used in\nranking and unranking Dyck words.

We believe that the stationary distribution of\nthese Markov chains gives a meaningful description of the long-term behavior\nfor systems whose agents are not completely rational.\n  Our aim is twofold: On the one hand, we are interested in evaluating the\nperformance of the game at equilibrium, i.e. the expected social welfare when\nthe strategy profiles are random according to the stationary distribution. On\nthe other hand, we want to estimate how long it takes, for a system starting at\nan arbitrary profile and running the logit dynamics, to get close to its\nstationary distribution; i.e., the \"mixing time\" of the chain.\n  In this paper we study the stationary expected social welfare for the\n3-player CK game, for 2-player coordination games, and for two simple\n$n$-player games. For all these games, we also give almost tight upper and\nlower bounds on the mixing time of logit dynamics.
