But the proposed system\nfocuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point\nof view, by predicting the areas or regions that may become hotspots for the\nvirus in the near future. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by\nbeing in close proximity to an already infected person, suggests that, the\nregions that can easily be reached from an existing hotspot, have a higher\nchance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover, in smaller regions, even after\nstrict provisions, positive cases have been found. To consider this fact, the\ngeographic distance between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of\nlikelihood of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted\ngraph of regions with the regions themselves as weighted nodes with weight of\nthe nodes as the number of active cases and the distance as edge weights. The\ngraph can be completely connected or connected based on a distance threshold.\nThe nodes are the administrative, and the distance measure tells the possible\ntransmission between separate communities.

Such a graph is temporally connected if\neach ordered pair of vertices is connected by a path which traverses edges in\nchronological order (i.e., a temporal path). In this paper, we consider a\nsimple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\nrandom graph $G~G_{n,p}$ by considering a random permutation $\\pi$ of the edges\nand interpreting the ranks in $\\pi$ as presence times.

Furthermore,\nthe graph admits a temporal spanner of size $2n+o(n)$ as soon as it becomes\ntemporally connected, which is nearly optimal as $2n-4$ is a lower bound. This\nresult is significant because temporal graphs do not admit spanners of size\n$O(n)$ in general (Kempe et al, STOC 2000).

Thus, our result implies\nthat the obstructions found in these works, and more generally, all\nnon-negligible obstructions, must be statistically insignificant: nearly\noptimal spanners always exist in random temporal graphs. All the above\nthresholds are sharp. Carrying the study of temporal spanners further, we show\nthat pivotal spanners -- i.e., spanners of size $2n-2$ made of two spanning\ntrees glued at a single vertex (one descending in time, the other ascending\nsubsequently) -- exist a.a.s. at $4\\log n/n$, this threshold being also sharp.\nFinally, we show that optimal spanners (of size $2n-4$) also exist a.a.s. at $p\n= 4\\log n/n$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Nov 2020 09:55:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2021 21:21:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Casteigts", "Arnaud", ""], ["Raskin", "Michael", ""], ["Renken", "Malte", ""], ["Zamaraev", "Viktor", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.03865", "submitter": "Rad Niazadeh", "authors": "Rad Niazadeh, Renato Paes Leme, Jon Schneider", "title": "Combinatorial Bernoulli Factories: Matchings, Flows and Other Polytopes", "comments": "41 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM cs.GT math.CO math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Bernoulli factory is an algorithmic procedure for exact sampling of certain\nrandom variables having only Bernoulli access to their parameters.

The color-dominating colorings are also known and\ncommonly referred as {\\rm b}-colorings. But these two topics have been studied\nseparately in graph theory. We introduce a new coloring procedure which\ncombines the strategies of these two techniques and satisfies an additional\nproperty. We first prove that the vertices of every graph $G$ can be\neffectively colored using color classes say $C_1, \\ldots, C_k$ such that $(i)$\nfor any two colors $i$ and $j$ with $1\\leq i< j \\leq k$, any vertex of color\n$j$ is adjacent to a vertex of color $i$, $(ii)$ there exists a set $\\{u_1,\n\\ldots, u_k\\}$ of vertices of $G$ such that $u_j\\in C_j$ for any $j\\in \\{1,\n\\ldots, k\\}$ and $u_k$ is adjacent to $u_j$ for each $1\\leq j \\leq k$ with\n$j\\not= k$, and $(iii)$ for each $i$ and $j$ with $i\\not= j$, the vertex $u_j$\nhas a neighbor in $C_i$.

A notion of genome assembly solution\nis that of an arc-covering walk of the graph. Since assembly graphs admit many\nsolutions, the goal is to find what is definitely present in all solutions, or\nwhat is safe. Most practical assemblers are based on heuristics having at their\ncore unitigs, namely paths whose internal nodes have unit in-degree and\nout-degree, and which are clearly safe. The long-standing open problem of\nfinding all the safe parts of the solutions was recently solved by a major\ntheoretical result [RECOMB'16]. This safe and complete genome assembly\nalgorithm was followed by other works improving the time bounds, as well as\nextending the results for different notions of assembly solution. But it\nremained open whether one can be complete also for models of genome assembly of\npractical applicability.\n  In this paper we present a universal framework for obtaining safe and\ncomplete algorithms which unify the previous results, while also allowing for\neasy generalisations to assembly problems including many practical aspects.\nThis is based on a novel graph structure, called the hydrostructure of a walk,\nwhich highlights the reachability properties of the graph from the perspective\nof the walk. The hydrostructure allows for simple characterisations of the\nexisting safe walks, and of their new practical versions.
