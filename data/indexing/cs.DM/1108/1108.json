Thus the interesting cases\nare when H admits a planar cover, but Cover(H) is NP-complete. This also\nrelates the problem to the long-standing Negami Conjecture which aims to\ndescribe all graphs having a planar cover.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of\nlinear time inference of strings from cover arrays using the least sized\nalphabet possible. We present an algorithm that can reconstruct a string $x$\nover a two-letter alphabet whenever a valid cover array $C$ is given as an\ninput. This algorithm uses several interesting combinatorial properties of\ncover arrays and an interesting relation between border array and cover array\nto achieve this. Our algorithm runs in linear time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Aug 2011 05:15:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Moosa", "Tanaeem M.", ""], ["Nazeen", "Sumaiya", ""], ["Rahman", "M.

We assume that nothing is known to\nthe nodes about the topology or even the size of the network, $n$, except that\n$n > 1$. Protocols for vanilla model, when $n$ is known, may be run for\nincreasingly larger estimates $2^i$ on the size of the network, but one cannot\ndetermine when such a protocol should terminate. Thus, to carry this design\nparadigm, successful completion or in-completion of the process should be\ndetected, and this knowledge circulated in the network.

(b) A deterministic protocol for\nacknowledged gossiping, which takes $O(n^2 \\lg n)$ rounds when collision\ndetection mechanism is available. The structure of the transmissions of nodes\nin the network, to enable them to infer collisions, and discover existence of\nunknown in-neighborhood as a result, is abstracted as a family of integral sets\ncalled Selecting-Colliding family. We prove the existence of\nSelecting-Colliding families using the probabilistic method and employ them to\ndesign protocol for acknowledged gossiping when no collision detection\nmechanism is available.\n  Finally, we present a deterministic protocol for acknowledged broadcasting\nfor bidirectional networks, with a round complexity of $O(n \\lg n)$ rounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 10:16:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Vaya", "Shailesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5964", "submitter": "Clemens Heuberger", "authors": "Christian Elsholtz and Clemens Heuberger and Helmut Prodinger", "title": "The number of Huffman codes, compact trees, and sums of unit fractions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Trans.
