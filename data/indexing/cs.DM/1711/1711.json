We propose new\nvariants of \\emph{directed graph minors} and \\emph{directed graph embeddings},\nby modifying familiar definitions. For the class of 2-terminal directed acyclic\ngraphs (TDAGs) our two definitions coincide, and the class is closed under both\noperations. The usefulness of our directed minor operations is demonstrated by\ncharacterizing all TDAGs with serial-parallel width at most $k$; a class of\nnetworks known to guarantee bounded negative externality in nonatomic routing\ngames. Our characterization implies that a TDAG has serial-parallel width of\n$1$ if and only if it is a directed series-parallel graph. We also study the\ncomputational complexity of finding a directed minor and computing the\nserial-parallel width.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Nov 2017 09:45:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2019 08:38:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Deligkas", "Argyrios", ""], ["Meir", "Reshef", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.01811", "submitter": "Vincent Froese", "authors": "Anne-Sophie Himmel, Clemens Hoffmann, Pascal Kunz, Vincent Froese,\n  Manuel Sorge", "title": "Computational Complexity Aspects of Point Visibility Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A point visibility graph is a graph induced by a set of points in the plane\nwhere the vertices of the graph represent the points in the point set and two\nvertices are adjacent if and only if no other point from the point set lies on\nthe line segment between the two corresponding points.

One way to approach this problem, known as the supertree method,\ninvolves inferring a phylogenetic tree with leaves consisting of a set $X$ of\nspecies from a collection of trees, each having leaf-set some subset of $X$. In\nthe 1980's characterizations, certain inference rules were given for when a\ncollection of 4-leaved trees, one for each 4-element subset of $X$, can all be\nsimultaneously displayed by a single supertree with leaf-set $X$. Recently, it\nhas become of interest to extend such results to phylogenetic networks. These\nare a generalization of phylogenetic trees which can be used to represent\nreticulate evolution (where species can come together to form a new species).\nIt has been shown that a certain type of phylogenetic network, called a level-1\nnetwork, can essentially be constructed from 4-leaved trees. However, the\nproblem of providing appropriate inference rules for such networks remains\nunresolved. Here we show that by considering 4-leaved networks, called\nquarnets, as opposed to 4-leaved trees, it is possible to provide such rules.\nIn particular, we show that these rules can be used to characterize when a\ncollection of quarnets, one for each 4-element subset of $X$, can all be\nsimultaneously displayed by a level-1 network with leaf-set $X$. The rules are\nan intriguing mixture of tree inference rules, and an inference rule for\nbuilding up a cyclic ordering of $X$ from orderings on subsets of $X$ of size\n4.
