We show that the problem admits a\npolynomial-time algorithm for two unrelated classes of graphs: proper interval\ngraphs and trivially-perfect graphs. To complement our result, we show that the\nproblem remains NP-complete on split graphs, and consequently also on chordal\ngraphs. Thus we contribute to define the first border between graph classes on\nwhich the problem is polynomially solvable and on which it remains NP-complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 17:25:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 11:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Konstantinidis", "Athanasios", ""], ["Papadopoulos", "Charis", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09447", "submitter": "Torsten Ueckerdt", "authors": "Thomas Bl\\\"asius and Peter Stumpf and Torsten Ueckerdt", "title": "Local and Union Boxicity", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The boxicity $\\operatorname{box}(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the smallest integer\n$d$ such that $H$ is the intersection of $d$ interval graphs, or equivalently,\nthat $H$ is the intersection graph of axis-aligned boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nThese intersection representations can be interpreted as covering\nrepresentations of the complement $H^c$ of $H$ with co-interval graphs, that\nis, complements of interval graphs. We follow the recent framework of global,\nlocal and folded covering numbers (Knauer and Ueckerdt, Discrete Mathematics\n339 (2016)) to define two new parameters: the local boxicity\n$\\operatorname{box}_\\ell(H)$ and the union boxicity\n$\\overline{\\operatorname{box}}(H)$ of $H$. The union boxicity of $H$ is the\nsmallest $d$ such that $H^c$ can be covered with $d$ vertex-disjoint unions of\nco-interval graphs, while the local boxicity of $H$ is the smallest $d$ such\nthat $H^c$ can be covered with co-interval graphs, at most $d$ at every vertex.\n  We show that for every graph $H$ we have $\\operatorname{box}_\\ell(H) \\leq\n\\overline{\\operatorname{box}}(H) \\leq \\operatorname{box}(H)$ and that each of\nthese inequalities can be arbitrarily far apart. Moreover, we show that local\nand union boxicity are also characterized by intersection representations of\nappropriate axis-aligned boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.
