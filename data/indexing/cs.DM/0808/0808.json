More precisely,\nthe freeness problem over a semigroup S is defined as: given a finite subset X\nof S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over X. To\ndate, the decidabilities of two freeness problems have been closely examined.\nIn 1953, Sardinas and Patterson proposed a now famous algorithm for the\nfreeness problem over the free monoid. In 1991, Klarner, Birget and Satterfield\nproved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer\nmatrices. Both results led to the publication of many subsequent papers. The\naim of the present paper is three-fold: (i) to present general results\nconcerning freeness problems, (ii) to study the decidability of freeness\nproblems over various particular semigroups (special attention is devoted to\nmultiplicative matrix semigroups), and (iii) to propose precise, challenging\nopen questions in order to promote the study of the topic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2008 16:37:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Sep 2008 14:47:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 04:28:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2012 01:30:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cassaigne", "Julien", ""], ["Nicolas", "Francois", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3214", "submitter": "Shamgar Gurevich", "authors": "Shamgar Gurevich, Ronny Hadani, Nir Sochen", "title": "The discrete Fourier transform: A canonical basis of eigenfunctions", "comments": "To appear in the proceeding of the 2008 European Signal Processing\n  Conference (EUSIPCO-2008), Lausanne, Switzerland; MSC classifications:\n  Fourier transform, Weil representation, symmetries, eigenfunctions,\n  oscillator transform, fast oscillator transform", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.IT math.RT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is an important operator which acts on\nthe Hilbert space of complex valued functions on the ring Z/NZ.
