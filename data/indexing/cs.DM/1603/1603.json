There is a class ${\\cal H}$ of\nhost graphs. One selects a graph $H\\in{\\cal H}$ and plants in it a balanced\n$k$-coloring (by partitioning the vertex set into $k$ roughly equal parts, and\nremoving all edges within each part). The resulting graph $G$ is given as input\nto a polynomial time algorithm that needs to $k$-color $G$ (any legal\n$k$-coloring would do -- the algorithm is not required to recover the planted\n$k$-coloring). Earlier planted models correspond to the case that ${\\cal H}$ is\nthe class of all $n$-vertex $d$-regular graphs, a member $H\\in{\\cal H}$ is\nchosen at random, and then a balanced $k$-coloring is planted at random. Blum\nand Spencer [1995] designed algorithms for this model when $d=n^{\\delta}$ (for\n$0<\\delta\\le1$), and Alon and Kahale [1997] managed to do so even when $d$ is a\nsufficiently large constant.\n  The new aspect in our framework is that it need not involve randomness. In\none model within the framework (with $k=3$) $H$ is a $d$ regular spectral\nexpander (meaning that except for the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency\nmatrix, every other eigenvalue has absolute value much smaller than $d$) chosen\nby an adversary, and the planted 3-coloring is random. We show that the\n3-coloring algorithm of Alon and Kahale [1997] can be modified to apply to this\ncase. In another model $H$ is a random $d$-regular graph but the planted\nbalanced $3$-coloring is chosen by an adversary, after seeing $H$. We show that\nfor a certain range of average degrees somewhat below $\\sqrt{n}$, finding a\n3-coloring is NP-hard. Together these results (and other results that we have)\nhelp clarify which aspects of randomness in the planted coloring model are the\nkey to successful 3-coloring algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2016 17:20:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["David", "Roee", ""], ["Feige", "Uriel", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.05464", "submitter": "Charalampos Zinoviadis", "authors": "Charalampos Zinoviadis", "title": "Hierarchy and Expansiveness in Two-Dimensional Subshifts of Finite Type", "comments": "72 pages, main body of the author's PhD Thesis, most of the results\n  obtained in collaboration with Pierre Guillon", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "TUCS Dissertations No 209", "categories": "math.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using a deterministic version of the self-similar (or hierarchical, or\nfixed-point ) method for constructing 2-dimensional subshifts of finite type\n(SFTs), we construct aperiodic 2D SFTs with a unique direction of\nnon-expansiveness and prove that the emptiness problem of SFTs is undecidable\neven in this restricted case.
