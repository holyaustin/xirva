This study is motivated by recent\nresults Corneil,Dalton, Habib (2013) and Dusart, Habib (2016) and that show\nthat for some problems, the algorithm used on interval graphs can also be used\nwith small modifications on cocomparability graphs. Many of these algorithms\nare based on graph searches that preserve cocomparability orderings.\n  First we propose a characterization of cocomparability graphs via a lattice\nstructure on the set of their maximal cliques. Using this characterization we\ncan prove that every maximal interval subgraph of a cocomparability graph $G$\nis also a maximal chordal subgraph of $G$. Although the size of this lattice of\nmaximal cliques can be exponential in the size of the graph, it can be used as\na framework to design and prove algorithms on cocomparability graphs. In\nparticular we show that a new graph search, namely Local Maximal Neighborhood\nSearch (LocalMNS) leads to an $O(n+mlogn)$ time algorithm to find a maximal\ninterval subgraph of a cocomparability graph. Similarly we propose a linear\ntime algorithm to compute all simplicial vertices in a cocomparability graph.\nIn both cases we improve on the current state of knowledge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 11:54:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Dusart", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie", ""], ["Habib", "Michel", ""], ["Corneil", "Derek G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02063", "submitter": "Vera Weil", "authors": "Vera Weil", "title": "A note on Reed's Conjecture about $\\omega$, $\\Delta$ and $\\chi$ with\n  respect to vertices of high degree", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reed conjectured that for every graph, $\\chi \\leq \\left \\lceil \\frac{\\Delta +\n\\omega + 1}{2} \\right \\rceil$ holds, where $\\chi$, $\\omega$ and $\\Delta$ denote\nthe chromatic number, clique number and maximum degree of the graph,\nrespectively.

Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a\ntournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\\em tournament\nsolution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the\ninput tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best\nset of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given\nonly implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such\nscenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some\ntournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible.

We first show that the set of\nCondorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\\lfloor \\log\nn \\rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm\nfor finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\\lfloor\n\\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices\nin the input tournament.

This allows us to design\na practically fast polynomial-time allocation algorithm to compute an optimal\nsolution for this problem, which can also handle practically motivated\nconstraints, such as a limit on the number of docks moved in the system.\n  We apply our algorithm to data sets from Boston, New York City, and Chicago\nto investigate how different dock allocations can yield better service in these\nsystems. Recommendations based on our analysis have led to changes in the\nsystem design in Chicago and New York City. Beyond optimizing for improved\nquality of service through better allocations, our results also provide a\nmetric to compare the impact of strategically reallocating docks and the\nrebalancing of bikes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 19:43:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 14:22:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2018 19:58:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 21 Nov 2020 04:29:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Freund", "Daniel", ""], ["Henderson", "Shane G.", ""], ["Shmoys", "David B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09663", "submitter": "Lucas Pastor", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Maffray, Lucas Pastor", "title": "Maximum Weight Stable Set in ($P_7$, bull)-free graphs and ($S_{1,2,3}$,\n  bull)-free graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a polynomial time algorithm that finds the maximum weight stable set\nin a graph that does not contain an induced path on seven vertices or a bull\n(the graph with vertices $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$ and edges $ab$, $bc$, $cd$,\n$be$, $ce$).

In particular, we\nintroduce \"bitransitive\" graphs. Several characterizations of bitransitive\nbitournaments are obtained. We show that bitransitive bitounaments are\nequivalent to acyclic bitournaments. As applications, we characterize acyclic\nbitournaments with Hamiltonian paths, determine number of non-isomorphic\nacyclic bitournaments of a given order, and solve the graph-isomorphism problem\nin linear time for acyclic bitournaments. Next, we prove the well-known\nCaccetta-H$\\ddot{\\textrm{a}}$ggkvist Conjecture for oriented bipartite graphs\nfor some cases for which it is unsolved in general oriented graphs. We also\nintroduce the concept of undirected as well as oriented \"odd-even\" graphs. We\ncharacterize bipartite graphs and acyclic oriented bipartite graphs in terms of\nthem. In fact, we show that any bipartite graph (acyclic oriented bipartite\ngraph) can be represented by some odd-even graph (oriented odd-even graph). We\nobtain some conditions for connectedness of odd-even graphs. This study of\nodd-even graphs and their connectedness is motivated by a special family of\nodd-even graphs which we call \"Goldbach graphs\". We show that the famous\nGoldbach's conjecture is equivalent to the connectedness of Goldbach graphs.\nSeveral other number theoretic conjectures (e.g., the twin prime conjecture)\nare related to various parameters of Goldbach graphs, motivating us to study\nthe nature of vertex-degrees and independent sets of these graphs. Finally, we\nobserve Hamiltonian properties of some odd-even graphs related to Goldbach\ngraphs for small number of vertices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 16:44:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 09:44:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2019 19:05:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:54:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:25:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2020 16:15:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sun, 14 Mar 2021 11:30:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Sandip", ""], ["Ghosh", "Prantar", ""], ["Ghosh", "Shamik", ""], ["Sen", "Sagnik", ""]]}]
