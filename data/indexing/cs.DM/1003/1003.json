That is - the\nnumber of moves of disk number k is 2^(k-1), and the total number of moves\nrequired to solve the puzzle with N disks is 2^N - 1. In the MToH puzzle, each\ndisk has two distinct-color sides, and disks must be flipped and placed so that\nno sides of the same color meet. I show here that the MToH puzzle spans \"base\n3\" - the number of moves required to solve an N+1 disk puzzle is essentially\nthree times larger than he number of moves required to solve an N disk puzzle.\nThe MToH comes in 3 flavors which differ in the rules for placing a disk on a\nfree post and therefore differ in the possible evolutions of the Tower states\ntowards a puzzle solution. I analyze here algorithms for minimizing the number\nof steps required to solve the MToH puzzle in its different versions. Thus,\nwhile the colorful Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is rather challenging, its\ninherent freedom nurtures mathematics with remarkable elegance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2010 23:56:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2010 21:01:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Levy", "Uri", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.0511", "submitter": "Anastasios Zouzias", "authors": "Anastasios Zouzias", "title": "Low Dimensional Euclidean Volume Preserving Embeddings", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be an $n$-point subset of Euclidean space and $d\\geq 3$ be\nan integer.

Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying\nresolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different\nsubsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space\ntrade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a\ngraph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit\n(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.\nUnfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution\nproofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling\nis needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate\ndeterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to\nfind specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties\nfor black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit\nsimulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to\nboth these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white\npebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph\nfamilies for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than\nblack pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution\ncan strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower\nbounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.\nSecond, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the\nsame properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp\nsimultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various\nparameter settings.

The power\nloss is due to the inherent energy dissipation when SCC operate between or\noutside their output target voltages. This drawback was alleviated in this work\nby developing two new classes of SCC providing binary and arbitrary resolution\nof closely spaced target voltages. Special attention is paid to SCC topologies\nof binary resolution. Namely, SCC systems that can be configured to have a\nno-load output to input voltage ratio that is equal to any binary fraction for\na given number of bits. To this end, we define a new number system and develop\nrules to translate these numbers into SCC hardware that follows the algebraic\nbehavior. According to this approach, the flying capacitors are automatically\nkept charged to binary weighted voltages and consequently the resolution of the\ntarget voltages follows a binary number representation and can be made higher\nby increasing the number of capacitors (bits). The ability to increase the\nnumber of target voltages reduces the spacing between them and, consequently,\nincreases the efficiency when the input varies over a large voltage range. The\nthesis presents the underlining theory of the binary SCC and its extension to\nthe general radix case. Although the major application is in step-down SCC, a\nsimple method to utilize these SCC for step-up conversion is also described, as\nwell as a method to reduce the output voltage ripple. In addition, the generic\nand unified model is strictly applied to derive the SCC equivalent resistor,\nwhich is a measure of the power loss.
