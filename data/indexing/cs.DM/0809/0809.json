Here largest is in the set theoretic sense and n is greater than or\nequal to 2. We call P(n) a maximal set obeying this property. For small n say 2\nor 3, it is possible to develop P(n) intuitively but we strongly felt the\nnecessity of an algorithm for any n greater than or equal to 2. Now P(n) shall\ninvariably be a infinite set so we define another set Q(n) such that\nQ(n)=N-P(n), prove that Q(n) is finite and, since P(n) is automatically known\nif Q(n) is known, design an algorithm of worst case O(1) complexity which\ngenerates Q(n).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Sep 2008 09:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Bidu Prakash", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Soubhik", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.2957", "submitter": "Sergi Elizalde", "authors": "Sergi Elizalde, Peter Winkler", "title": "Sorting by Placement and Shift", "comments": "13 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of SODA 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In sorting situations where the final destination of each item is known, it\nis natural to repeatedly choose items and place them where they belong,\nallowing the intervening items to shift by one to make room.

A local algorithm\nis one that finds a solution containing or near a given vertex without looking\nat the whole graph. We present a local clustering algorithm. Our algorithm\nfinds a good cluster--a subset of vertices whose internal connections are\nsignificantly richer than its external connections--near a given vertex. The\nrunning time of our algorithm, when it finds a non-empty local cluster, is\nnearly linear in the size of the cluster it outputs.\n  Our clustering algorithm could be a useful primitive for handling massive\ngraphs, such as social networks and web-graphs. As an application of this\nclustering algorithm, we present a partitioning algorithm that finds an\napproximate sparsest cut with nearly optimal balance. Our algorithm takes time\nnearly linear in the number edges of the graph.\n  Using the partitioning algorithm of this paper, we have designed a\nnearly-linear time algorithm for constructing spectral sparsifiers of graphs,\nwhich we in turn use in a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear\nsystems in symmetric, diagonally-dominant matrices. The linear system solver\nalso leads to a nearly linear-time algorithm for approximating the\nsecond-smallest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the Laplacian\nmatrix of a graph.
