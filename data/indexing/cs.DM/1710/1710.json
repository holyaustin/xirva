In this paper we introduce the concept of\nalgebraic distance on hypergraphs and demonstrate its use as an algorithmic\ncomponent in the coarsening stage of multilevel hypergraph partitioning\nsolvers. The algebraic distance is a vertex distance measure that extends\nhyperedge weights for capturing the local connectivity of vertices which is\ncritical for hypergraph coarsening schemes. The practical effectiveness of the\nproposed measure and corresponding coarsening scheme is demonstrated through\nextensive computational experiments on a diverse set of problems. Finally, we\npropose a benchmark of hypergraph partitioning problems to compare the quality\nof other solvers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 01:45:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Oct 2017 20:50:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 11 Jan 2019 20:12:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2019 14:41:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shaydulin", "Ruslan", ""], ["Chen", "Jie", ""], ["Safro", "Ilya", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.06559", "submitter": "Asahi Takaoka", "authors": "Asahi Takaoka", "title": "A recognition algorithm for simple-triangle graphs", "comments": "revised, results unchanged, reference changed. 12 pages 12pt, 1\n  figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple-triangle graph is the intersection graph of triangles that are\ndefined by a point on a horizontal line and an interval on another horizontal\nline.

Nature 433, pp. 312-316 (2005)], is a\nstochastic process modeling the spread of genetic mutations in populations. In\nthis process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are\nassociated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen\nuniformly at random is a mutant, with fitness $r > 0$, while all other\nindividuals are residents, with fitness $1$. In every step, an individual is\nchosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or\nresident) is passed on to a neighbor which is chosen uniformly at random. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a generalization of the model of Lieberman\net al. by assuming that different types of individuals perceive the population\nthrough different graphs, namely $G_R(V,E_R)$ for residents and $G_M(V,E_M)$\nfor mutants. In this model, we study the fixation probability, i.e. the\nprobability that eventually only mutants remain in the population, for various\npairs of graphs. First, we transfer known results from the original\nsingle-graph model of Lieberman et al. to our 2-graph model. Among them, we\nprovide a generalization of the Isothermal Theorem of Lieberman et al., that\ngives sufficient conditions for a pair of graphs to have the same fixation\nprobability as a pair of cliques. Next, we give a 2-player strategic game view\nof the process where player payoffs correspond to fixation and/or extinction\nprobabilities. In this setting, we attempt to identify best responses for each\nplayer and give evidence that the clique is the most beneficial graph for both\nplayers. Finally, we examine the possibility of efficient approximation of the\nfixation probability and provide a FPRAS for the special case where the mutant\ngraph is complete.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 22:48:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2018 11:38:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2021 15:12:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Melissourgos", "Themistoklis", ""], ["Nikoletseas", "Sotiris", ""], ["Raptopoulos", "Christoforos", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.07421", "submitter": "Aneta Neumann", "authors": "Aneta Neumann, Frank Neumann, Tobias Friedrich", "title": "Quasi-random Agents for Image Transition and Animation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quasi-random walks show similar features as standard random walks, but with\nmuch less randomness.

Here, a caterpillar is a tree whose vertices of\ndegree at least three lie on a single path (i.e., our caterpillars may have\narbitrarily long legs). In fact, we prove a stronger property of such graph\nclasses, called in the literature the strong Erd\\H{o}s-Hajnal property: for\nevery such graph class $\\mathcal{G}$, there exists a constant $\\delta =\n\\delta(\\mathcal{G}) > 0$ such that every graph $G \\in \\mathcal{G}$ contains two\ndisjoint sets $A,B \\subseteq V(G)$ of size at least $\\delta|V(G)|$ each so that\neither all edges between $A$ and $B$ are present in $G$, or none of them. This\nresult significantly extends the family of graph classes for which we know that\nthe strong Erd\\H{o}s-Hajnal property holds; for graph classes excluding a graph\n$H$ and its complement it was previously known only for paths [Bousquet,\nLagoutte, Thomass\\'{e}, JCTB 2015] and hooks (i.e., paths with an additional\npendant vertex at third vertex of the path) [Choromanski, Falik, Liebenau,\nPatel, Pilipczuk, arXiv:1508.00634].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 10:59:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Liebenau", "Anita", ""], ["Pilipczuk", "Marcin", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.08758", "submitter": "Kitty Meeks", "authors": "Jessica Enright, Kitty Meeks and Jessica Ryan", "title": "Two dichotomies for model-checking in multi-layer structures", "comments": "One incorrect reference fixed", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multi-layer graphs can capture qualitatively different types of connection\nbetween entities, and networks of this kind are prevalent in biological and\nsocial systems: for example, a social contact network typically involves both\nvirtual and face-to-face interactions between individuals.
