This problem is the most natural\noptimization version of the well known and well studied Hamiltonian path\nproblem, and thus it is NP-hard on general graphs. However, in contrast to the\nHamiltonian path problem, there are only few restricted graph families such as\ntrees and some small graph classes where polynomial algorithms for the longest\npath problem have been found. Recently it has been shown that this problem can\nbe solved in polynomial time on interval graphs by applying dynamic programming\nto a characterizing ordering of the vertices of the given graph\n\\cite{longest-int-algo}, thus answering an open question. In the present paper,\nwe provide the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on a\nmuch greater class, namely on cocomparability graphs. Our algorithm uses a\nsimilar - but essentially simpler - dynamic programming approach, which is\napplied to a Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) characterizing ordering of\nthe vertices of a cocomparability graph. Therefore, our results provide\nevidence that this general dynamic programming approach can be used in a more\ngeneral setting, leading to efficient algorithms for the longest path problem\non greater classes of graphs. LDFS has recently been introduced in\n\\cite{Corneil-LDFS08}. Since then, a similar phenomenon of extending an\nexisting interval graph algorithm to cocomparability graphs by using an LDFS\npreprocessing step has also been observed for the minimum path cover problem\n\\cite{Corneil-MPC}. Therefore, more interestingly, our results also provide\nevidence that cocomparability graphs present an interval graph structure when\nthey are considered using an LDFS ordering of their vertices, which may lead to\nother new and more efficient combinatorial algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 15:53:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mertzios", "George B.", ""], ["Corneil", "Derek G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4713", "submitter": "Kenneth Shum", "authors": "Kenneth W.

The factorization structures are represented by\nhypergraphs called factor graphs. Such distributions appear in various fields,\nincluding statistics, artificial intelligence, statistical physics, error\ncorrecting codes, etc. Given such a distribution, computations of marginal\ndistributions and the normalization constant are often required. However, they\nare computationally intractable because of their computational costs. One\nsuccessful approximation method is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm.\nThe focus of this thesis is an analysis of the LBP algorithm. If the factor\ngraph is a tree, i.e. having no cycle, the algorithm gives the exact\nquantities. If the factor graph has cycles, however, the LBP algorithm does not\ngive exact results and possibly exhibits oscillatory and non-convergent\nbehaviors. The thematic question of this thesis is \"How the behaviors of the\nLBP algorithm are affected by the discrete geometry of the factor graph?\" The\nprimary contribution of this thesis is the discovery of a formula that\nestablishes the relation between the LBP, the Bethe free energy and the graph\nzeta function. This formula provides new techniques for analysis of the LBP\nalgorithm, connecting properties of the graph and of the LBP and the Bethe free\nenergy. We demonstrate applications of the techniques to several problems\nincluding (non) convexity of the Bethe free energy, the uniqueness and\nstability of the LBP fixed point. We also discuss the loop series initiated by\nChertkov and Chernyak. The loop series is a subgraph expansion of the\nnormalization constant, or partition function, and reflects the graph geometry.\nWe investigate theoretical natures of the series. Moreover, we show a partial\nconnection between the loop series and the graph zeta function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 02:10:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2011 06:50:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Watanabe", "Yusuke", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5094", "submitter": "Saber Jafarizadeh", "authors": "Saber Jafarizadeh, Abbas Jamalipour", "title": "Fastest Distributed Consensus Problem on Branches of an Arbitrary\n  Connected Sensor Network", "comments": "11 pages, 13 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DC cs.DM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the fastest distributed consensus averaging problem on\nbranches of an arbitrary connected sensor network.
