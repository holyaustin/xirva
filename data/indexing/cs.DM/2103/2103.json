In the context of the Danish road\nnetwork (DRN) dataset used in this paper, the data coverage is sparse and\nskewed towards arterial roads, with a coverage of 23.88% across 850,980 road\nsegments, which makes travel time estimation difficult. Existing solutions for\ngraph-based data processing often neglect the size of the graph, which is an\napparent problem for road networks with a large amount of connected road\nsegments. To this end, we propose a framework for predicting road segment\ntravel speed histograms for dataless edges, based on a latent representation\ngenerated by an adversarially regularized convolutional network. We apply a\npartitioning algorithm to divide the graph into dense subgraphs, and then train\na model for each subgraph to predict speed histograms for the nodes. The\nframework achieves an accuracy of 71.5% intersection and 78.5% correlation on\npredicting travel speed histograms using the DRN dataset. Furthermore,\nexperiments show that partitioning the dataset into clusters increases the\nperformance of the framework. Specifically, partitioning the road network\ndataset into 100 clusters, with approximately 500 road segments in each\ncluster, achieves a better performance than when using 10 and 20 clusters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:16:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kj\u00e6r", "Jakob Meldgaard", ""], ["Kristensen", "Lasse", ""], ["Christensen", "Mads Alberg", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.00078", "submitter": "Couvreur Alain", "authors": "Anne Canteaut, Alain Couvreur, L\\'eo Perrin", "title": "Recovering or Testing Extended-Affine Equivalence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.DM cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Extended Affine (EA) equivalence is the equivalence relation between two\nvectorial Boolean functions $F$ and $G$ such that there exist two affine\npermutations $A$, $B$, and an affine function $C$ satisfying $G = A \\circ F\n\\circ B + C$.

The\nnotion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or\ntopological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical\ntopology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for\nconstructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of\nlocal computations. In 1991, Abello et al. asked for a classification of the\ncomputational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target\ngraph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many\ngeneral results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of\nthat, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of\nnormal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges.\nSemi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph\ntheory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the\nlocal computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering\ngraph. We show that the presence of semi-edges makes the covering problem\nconsiderably harder; e.g., it is no longer sufficient to specify the vertex\nmapping induced by the covering, but one necessarily has to deal with the edge\nmapping as well. We show some solvable cases, and completely characterize the\ncomplexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and\ntwo-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven\nfor simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs,\neven for bipartite ones. This provides a strengthening of previously known\nresults for covering graphs without semi-edges, and may contribute to better\nunderstanding of this notion and its complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Mar 2021 20:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bok", "Jan", ""], ["Fiala", "Ji\u0159\u00ed", ""], ["Hlin\u011bn\u00fd", "Petr", ""], ["Jedli\u010dkov\u00e1", "Nikola", ""], ["Kratochv\u00edl", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.15712", "submitter": "Benjamin Doerr", "authors": "Benjamin Doerr", "title": "A Sharp Discrepancy Bound for Jittered Sampling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.CG cs.DM cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For $m, d \\in {\\mathbb N}$, a jittered sampling point set $P$ having $N =\nm^d$ points in $[0,1)^d$ is constructed by partitioning the unit cube $[0,1)^d$\ninto $m^d$ axis-aligned cubes of equal size and then placing one point\nindependently and uniformly at random in each cube.
