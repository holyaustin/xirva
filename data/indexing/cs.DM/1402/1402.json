We show that on-line graph coloring\nproblems give rise to classes of game graphs with a natural geometric\ninterpretation. We use this concept to estimate the chromatic number of graphs\nwith geometric representations by finding, for appropriate simpler graphs,\non-line coloring algorithms using few colors or proving that no such algorithms\nexist.\n  We derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum chromatic number that\nrectangle overlap graphs, subtree overlap graphs, and interval filament graphs\n(all of which generalize interval overlap graphs) can have when their clique\nnumber is bounded. The bounds are absolute for interval filament graphs and\nasymptotic of the form $(\\log\\log n)^{f(\\omega)}$ for rectangle and subtree\noverlap graphs, where $f(\\omega)$ is a polynomial function of the clique number\nand $n$ is the number of vertices. In particular, we provide the first\nconstruction of geometric intersection graphs with bounded clique number and\nwith chromatic number asymptotically greater than $\\log\\log n$.\n  We also introduce a concept of $K_k$-free colorings and show that for some\ngeometric representations, $K_3$-free chromatic number can be bounded in terms\nof clique number although the ordinary ($K_2$-free) chromatic number cannot.\nSuch a result for segment intersection graphs would imply a well-known\nconjecture that $k$-quasi-planar geometric graphs have linearly many edges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 10:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:58:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 19:08:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 16:18:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Krawczyk", "Tomasz", ""], ["Walczak", "Bartosz", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2543", "submitter": "Jukka Suomela", "authors": "Juho Hirvonen, Joel Rybicki, Stefan Schmid, Jukka Suomela", "title": "Large Cuts with Local Algorithms on Triangle-Free Graphs", "comments": "1+17 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.DM cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of finding large cuts in $d$-regular triangle-free\ngraphs.

In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able\nto intrinsically model cyclic (i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks.\nThese representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed\nunifying model for TVGs.

Regular covers have many applications in constructions and studies of\nbig objects all over mathematics and computer science.\n  We study computational aspects of regular covers that have not been addressed\nbefore. The decision problem RegularCover asks for two given graphs $G$ and $H$\nwhether $G$ regularly covers $H$.

Another special\ncase arises for $|G| = |H|$ when it becomes the graph isomorphism problem.\nTherefore, we restrict ourselves to graph classes with polynomially solvable\ngraph isomorphism.\n  Inspired by Negami, we apply the structural results used by Babai in the\n1970's to study automorphism groups of graphs. Our main result is the following\nFPT meta-algorithm: Let $\\cal C$ be a class of graphs such that the structure\nof automorphism groups of 3-connected graphs in $\\cal C$ is simple.
