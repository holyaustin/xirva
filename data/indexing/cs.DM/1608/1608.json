(1992) introduced $H$-graphs, intersection graphs of\nconnected subgraphs of a subdivision of a graph $H$. They are related to many\nclasses of geometric intersection graphs, e.g., interval graphs, circular-arc\ngraphs, split graphs, and chordal graphs.\n  We negatively answer the 25-year-old question of Bir\\'{o} et al. which asks\nif $H$-graphs can be recognized in polynomial time, for a fixed graph $H$. We\nprove that it is NP-complete if $H$ contains the diamond graph as a minor. We\nprovide a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $T$-graphs, for each fixed tree\n$T$. When $T$ is a star $S_d$ of degree $d$, we have an $O(n^{3.5})$-time\nalgorithm.\n  We give FPT- and XP-time algorithms solving the minimum dominating set\nproblem on $S_d$-graphs and $H$-graphs parametrized by $d$ and the size of $H$,\nrespectively. The algorithm for $H$-graphs adapts to an XP-time algorithm for\nthe independent set and the independent dominating set problems on $H$-graphs.\n  If $H$ contains the double-triangle as a minor, we prove that $H$-graphs are\nGI-complete and that the clique problem is APX-hard. The clique problem can be\nsolved in polynomial time if $H$ is a cactus graph. When a graph $G$ has a\nHelly $H$-representation, the clique problem can be solved in polynomial time.\n  We show that both the $k$-clique and the list $k$-coloring problems are\nsolvable in FPT-time on $H$-graphs (parameterized by $k$ and the treewidth of\n$H$). In fact, these results apply to classes of graphs with treewidth bounded\nby a function of the clique number.\n  We observe that $H$-graphs have at most $n^{O(\\|H\\|)}$ minimal separators\nwhich allows us to apply the meta-algorithmic framework of Fomin et al. (2015)\nto show that for each fixed $t$, finding a maximum induced subgraph of\ntreewidth $t$ can be done in polynomial time. When $H$ is a cactus, we improve\nthe bound to $O(\\|H\\|n^2)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 11:34:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 15:26:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:07:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:20:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 14:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chaplick", "Steven", ""], ["T\u00f6pfer", "Martin", ""], ["Voborn\u00edk", "Jan", ""], ["Zeman", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02883", "submitter": "Christine Klymko", "authors": "Jeff Alstott, Christine Klymko, Pamela B.

A\nparticular application of this approach leads to new converses which recover\nand improve on the converses of Kostina and Verdu for finite blocklength lossy\njoint source-channel coding and lossy source coding. For finite blocklength\nchannel coding, the LP relaxation recovers the converse of Polyanskiy, Poor and\nVerdu and leads to a new improvement on the converse of Wolfowitz, showing\nthereby that our LP relaxation is asymptotically tight with increasing\nblocklengths for channel coding, lossless source coding and joint\nsource-channel coding with the excess distortion probability as the loss\ncriterion. Using a duality based argument, a new converse is derived for finite\nblocklength joint source-channel coding for a class of source-channel pairs.\nEmploying this converse, the LP relaxation is also shown to be tight for all\nblocklengths for the minimization of the expected average symbol-wise Hamming\ndistortion of a $q$-ary uniform source over a $q$-ary symmetric memoryless\nchannel for any $q \\in N$.

From an algorithmic\nperspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform\nquasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be\nparticularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on\nnowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the\nequivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a\nnon-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,\nmaking them infeasible in practice.\n  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular\nfrom a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish\npolynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform\nquasi-wideness.\n  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem\nkernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in\npolynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only\n(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for\nevery fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating\nset problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs.

The extension to the discrete case makes use of\nthe strong relation HPF-based planning has to connectionist artificial\nintelligence (AI). Connectionist AI systems are networks of simple,\ninterconnected processors running in parallel within the confines of the\nenvironment in which the planning action is to be synthesized. It is not hard\nto see that such a paradigm naturally lends itself to planning on weighted\ngraphs where the processors may be seen as the vertices of the graph and the\nrelations among them as its edges. Electrical networks are an effective\nrealization of connectionist AI. The utility of the discrete HPF (DHPF)\napproach is demonstrated in three ways. First, the capability of the DHPF\napproach to generate new, abstract, planning techniques is demonstrated by\nconstructing a novel, efficient, optimal, discrete planning method called the\nM* algorithm. Also, its ability to augment the capabilities of existing\nplanners is demonstrated by suggesting a generic solution to the lower bound\nproblem faced by the A* algorithm. The DHPF approach is shown to be useful in\nsolving specific planning problems in communication. It is demonstrated that\nthe discrete HPF paradigm can support routing on-the-fly while the network is\nstill in a transient state.

The latter will provide our affirmative\nanswer to the question raised in the title. More concretely, we start with\nForman's notion of the Ricci curvature of a graph, or more generally, a\npolyhedral complex. This will allow us to pass from a graph as representing a\nnetwork to a polyhedral complex for instance by filling in triangles into\nconnected triples of edges and to investigate the resulting effect on the\ncurvature. This is insightful for two reasons: First, we can define a curvature\nflow in order to asymptotically simplify a network and reduce it to its\nessentials. Second, using a construction of Bloch, which yields a discrete\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, we have the Euler characteristic of a network as a global\ncharacteristic. These two aspects beautifully merge in the sense that the\nasymptotic properties of the curvature flow are indicated by that Euler\ncharacteristic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 17:55:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 18:28:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Melanie", ""], ["Saucan", "Emil", ""], ["Jost", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08324", "submitter": "Jean Cardinal", "authors": "Jean Cardinal and Stefan Felsner", "title": "Topological Drawings of Complete Bipartite Graphs", "comments": "A preliminary version appeared in the Proceedings of the 24th\n  International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2016)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Topological drawings are natural representations of graphs in the plane,\nwhere vertices are represented by points, and edges by curves connecting the\npoints.
