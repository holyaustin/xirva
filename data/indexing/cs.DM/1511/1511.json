These problems become intractable when the dimensionality of the data\nis large, as is often the case for modern datasets. A popular idea is to\nconstruct convex relaxations of these combinatorial problems, which can be\nsolved efficiently for large scale datasets.\n  Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are among the most powerful\nmethods in this family, and are surprisingly well-suited for a broad range of\nproblems where data take the form of matrices or graphs. It has been observed\nseveral times that, when the `statistical noise' is small enough, SDP\nrelaxations correctly detect the underlying combinatorial structures.\n  In this paper we develop asymptotic predictions for several `detection\nthresholds,' as well as for the estimation error above these thresholds. We\nstudy some classical SDP relaxations for statistical problems motivated by\ngraph synchronization and community detection in networks. We map these\noptimization problems to statistical mechanics models with vector spins, and\nuse non-rigorous techniques from statistical mechanics to characterize the\ncorresponding phase transitions. Our results clarify the effectiveness of SDP\nrelaxations in solving high-dimensional statistical problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 19:16:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Javanmard", "Adel", ""], ["Montanari", "Andrea", ""], ["Ricci-Tersenghi", "Federico", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09289", "submitter": "Lijun Ji", "authors": "Jingyuan Chen, Yun Li and Lijun Ji", "title": "Combinatorial Constructions of Optimal $(m, n,4,2)$ Optical Orthogonal\n  Signature Pattern Codes", "comments": "24 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1312.7589 by\n  other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) play an important role in\na novel type of optical code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network for\n2-dimensional image transmission.

Since all\nadditional twins can be safely removed, we obtain a linear-time algorithm for\ncomputing $r$-outerplanar supports for hypergraphs with $m$ hyperedges if $m$\nand $r$ are constant; in other words, the problem is fixed-parameter\nlinear-time solvable with respect to the parameters $m$ and $r$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 22:59:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 20:03:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 14:34:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 16:57:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2020 02:43:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["van Bevern", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Kanj", "Iyad A.", ""], ["Komusiewicz", "Christian", ""], ["Niedermeier", "Rolf", ""], ["Sorge", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09405", "submitter": "Florian Deloup L", "authors": "Guillaume Bonfante, Florian Deloup", "title": "Decidability of regular language genus computation", "comments": "22 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "Math.

Generalizing a previous result, we produce\na new family of regular languages on a two-letter alphabet having arbitrary\nhigh genus. Let $L$ be a regular language. In order to understand the genus\n$g(L)$ of $L$, we introduce the topological size of $|L|_{\\rm{top}}$ to be the\nminimal size of all finite deterministic automata of genus $g(L)$ computing\n$L$. We show that the minimal finite deterministic automaton of a regular\nlanguage can be arbitrary far away from a finite deterministic automaton\nrealizing the minimal genus and computing the same language, both in terms of\nthe difference of genera and in terms of the difference in size. In particular,\nwe show that the topological size $|L|_{\\rm{top}}$ can grow at least\nexponentially in size $|L|$. We conjecture however the genus of every regular\nlanguage to be computable. This conjecture implies in particular that the\nplanarity of a regular language is decidable, a question asked in 1976 by R.V.\nBook and A.K. Chandra. We prove here the conjecture for a fairly generic class\nof regular languages having no short cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 17:42:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 14:32:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bonfante", "Guillaume", ""], ["Deloup", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09423", "submitter": "Zoltan Esik", "authors": "Arnaud Carayol, Zoltan Esik", "title": "An analysis of the equational properties of the well-founded fixed point", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Well-founded fixed points have been used in several areas of knowledge\nrepresentation and reasoning and to give semantics to logic programs involving\nnegation.
