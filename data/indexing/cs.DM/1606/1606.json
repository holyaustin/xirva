In this paper we are interested in defining\ntranslations on graphs using a few simple properties. Namely we propose to\ndefine translations as functions from vertices to adjacent ones, that preserve\nneighborhood properties of the graph. We show that our definitions, contrary to\nother works on the subject, match usual translations on grid graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 09:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Grelier", "Nicolas", ""], ["Pasdeloup", "Bastien", ""], ["Vialatte", "Jean-Charles", ""], ["Gripon", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.02577", "submitter": "Stanislav Zivny", "authors": "Johan Thapper, Stanislav Zivny", "title": "The power of Sherali-Adams relaxations for general-valued CSPs", "comments": "Full version of an ICALP'15 paper (arXiv:1502.05301)", "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Computing 46(4) (2017) 1241-1279", "doi": "10.1137/16M1079245", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a precise algebraic characterisation of the power of Sherali-Adams\nrelaxations for solvability of valued constraint satisfaction problems to\noptimality.

Group of individuals who are cyclically\nconnected are said to be balanced if the number of negative edges in the cycle\nis even and unbalanced otherwise. In its earliest and most natural formulation,\nthe balance of a social network was thus defined from its simple cycles, cycles\nwhich do not visit any vertex more than once. Because of the inherent\ndifficulty associated with finding such cycles on very large networks, social\nbalance has since then been studied via other means. In this article we present\nthe balance as measured from the simple cycles and primitive orbits of social\nnetworks. We specifically provide two measures of balance: the proportion\n$R_\\ell$ of negative simple cycles of length $\\ell$ for each $\\ell\\leq 20$\nwhich generalises the triangle index, and a ratio $K_\\ell$ which extends the\nrelative signed clustering coefficient introduced by Kunegis. To do so, we use\na Monte Carlo implementation of a novel exact formula for counting the simple\ncycles on any weighted directed graph. Our method is free from the\ndouble-counting problem affecting previous cycle-based approaches, does not\nrequire edge-reciprocity of the underlying network, provides a gray-scale\nmeasure of balance for each cycle length separately and is sufficiently\ntractable that it can be implemented on a standard desktop computer. We observe\nthat social networks exhibit strong inter-edge correlations favouring balanced\nsituations and we determine the corresponding correlation length $\\xi$. For\nlonger simple cycles, $R_\\ell$ undergoes a sharp transition to values expected\nfrom an uncorrelated model.
