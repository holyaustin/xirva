The following extension of the Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa Theorem\nholds: for every $h$-vertex planar graph $H$, there exists a function $f_{H}$\nsuch that every graph $G$, either contains $k$ disjoint copies of graphs in\n${\\cal M}(H)$, or contains a set of $f_{H}(k)$ vertices meeting every subgraph\nof $G$ that belongs in ${\\cal M}(H)$. In this paper we prove that this is the\ncase for every graph $H$ of pathwidth at most 2 and, in particular, that\n$f_{H}(k) = 2^{O(h^2)}\\cdot k^{2}\\cdot \\log k$. As a main ingredient of the\nproof of our result, we show that for every graph $H$ on $h$ vertices and\npathwidth at most 2, either $G$ contains $k$ disjoint copies of $H$ as a minor\nor the treewidth of $G$ is upper-bounded by $2^{O(h^2)}\\cdot k^{2}\\cdot \\log\nk$. We finally prove that the exponential dependence on $h$ in these bounds can\nbe avoided if $H=K_{2,r}$. In particular, we show that $f_{K_{2,r}}=O(r^2\\cdot\nk^2)$\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 12:29:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2013 16:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Raymond", "Jean-Florent", ""], ["Thilikos", "Dimitrios M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7413", "submitter": "Marie-Pierre B\\'eal", "authors": "Marie-Pierre B\\'eal, Michel Blockelet, C\\v{a}t\\v{a}lin Dima", "title": "Sofic-Dyck shifts", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We define the class of sofic-Dyck shifts which extends the class of\nMarkov-Dyck shifts introduced by Inoue, Krieger and Matsumoto.
