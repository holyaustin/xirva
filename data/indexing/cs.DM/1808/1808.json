Although there were many\nalgorithms to find the number of cycles, they preferred to investigate in a\ncomputational way. Dehghan and Banihashemi counted the number of cycles of\nlength $g+2$ and $g+4,$ where $G$ is a bi-regular bipartite graph and $g$ is\nthe length of the girth $G.$ But they just proposed a descriptive technique to\ncompute the multiplicity of cycles of length less than $2g$ for bi-regular\nbipartite graphs.
