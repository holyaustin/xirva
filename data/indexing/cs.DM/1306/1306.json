We start\nwith the min-cost flow problem and apply two transformations, one is based on\ngeometric duality of planar graphs and the other on linear programming duality.\nThe result is a min-cost flow problem in a related planar network whose balance\nconstraints are defined by the costs of the original problem and whose costs\nare defined by the capacities of the original problem. We use this\ntransformation to show an O(n log^2 n) time algorithm for the min-cost flow\nproblem in an n-vertex outerplanar network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 06:36:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kaplan", "Haim", ""], ["Nussbaum", "Yahav", ""]]}]
