This phenomenon may have considerable adverse impact on the quality of\nselected seeds and as a result all existing techniques that use this classical\ndefinition as their building block generate seeds with suboptimal influence\nspread. In this paper, we revisit the classical IM problem and propose a more\nrealistic version called PROTEUS-IM (Propagation Time conscious Influence\nMaximization) to replace it by addressing the aforementioned limitation.\nSpecifically, as influence propagation may take time, we assume that the\nunderlying social network may evolve during influence propagation.\nConsequently, PROTEUSIM aims to select seeds in the current network to maximize\ninfluence spread in the future instance of the network at the end of influence\npropagation process without assuming complete topological knowledge of the\nfuture network. We propose a greedy and a Reverse Reachable (RR) set-based\nalgorithms called PROTEUS-GENIE and PROTEUS-SEER, respectively, to address this\nproblem.
