A vertex set $D$ is an {\\em efficient dominating set}\n(\\emph{e.d.}\\ for short) of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ is dominated by exactly\none vertex of $D$. The \\emph{Efficient Domination} (ED) problem, which asks for\nthe existence of an e.d.\\ in $G$, is known to be \\NP-complete even for very\nrestricted graph classes such as $P_7$-free chordal graphs. The ED problem on a\ngraph $G$ can be reduced to the Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem\non the square of $G$. The complexity of the ED problem is an open question for\n$P_6$-free graphs and was open even for the subclass of $P_6$-free chordal\ngraphs. In this paper, we show that squares of $P_6$-free chordal graphs that\nhave an e.d. are chordal; this even holds for the larger class of ($P_6$,\nhouse, hole, domino)-free graphs. This implies that ED/WeightedED is solvable\nin polynomial time for ($P_6$, house, hole, domino)-free graphs; in particular,\nfor $P_6$-free chordal graphs.
