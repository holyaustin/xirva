Conversely, the heat kernel constructed from its\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions determines the Riemannian metric. This work\nproves the analogy on Euclidean polyhedral surfaces (triangle meshes), that the\ndiscrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and the discrete Riemannian metric (unique\nup to a scaling) are mutually determined by each other. Given an Euclidean\npolyhedral surface, its Riemannian metric is represented as edge lengths,\nsatisfying triangle inequalities on all faces. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is\nformulated using the cotangent formula, where the edge weight is defined as the\nsum of the cotangent of angles against the edge. We prove that the edge lengths\ncan be determined by the edge weights unique up to a scaling using the\nvariational approach. First, we show that the space of all possible metrics of\na polyhedral surface is convex. Then, we construct a special energy defined on\nthe metric space, such that the gradient of the energy equals to the edge\nweights. Third, we show the Hessian matrix of the energy is positive definite,\nrestricted on the tangent space of the metric space, therefore the energy is\nconvex. Finally, by the fact that the parameter on a convex domain and the\ngradient of a convex function defined on the domain have one-to-one\ncorrespondence, we show the edge weights determines the polyhedral metric\nunique up to a scaling.

The concept\nof identifying codes was introduced by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin in\n1998. For a given identifiable graph $G$, let $\\M(G)$ be the minimum\ncardinality of an identifying code in $G$. In this paper, we show that for any\nconnected identifiable triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices having maximum\ndegree $\\Delta\\geq 3$, $\\M(G)\\le n-\\tfrac{n}{\\Delta+o(\\Delta)}$. This bound is\nasymptotically tight up to constants due to various classes of graphs including\n$(\\Delta-1)$-ary trees, which are known to have their minimum identifying code\nof size $n-\\tfrac{n}{\\Delta-1+o(1)}$. We also provide improved bounds for\nrestricted subfamilies of triangle-free graphs, and conjecture that there\nexists some constant $c$ such that the bound $\\M(G)\\le n-\\tfrac{n}{\\Delta}+c$\nholds for any nontrivial connected identifiable graph $G$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 14:06:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jun 2011 11:21:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 18:57:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Foucaud", "Florent", "", "LaBRI"], ["Klasing", "Ralf", "", "LaBRI, INRIA Bordeaux -\n  Sud-Ouest"], ["Kosowski", "Adrian", "", "LaBRI, INRIA Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest"], ["Raspaud", "Andr\u00e9", "", "LaBRI"]]}]
