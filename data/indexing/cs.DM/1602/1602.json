For any finite set of\npositive integers D = {d 1 ,. .. , d k }, the integer distance graph G = G(D)\nis the infinite graph defined by V (G) = Z and uv $\\in$ E(G) if and only if |v\n-- u| $\\in$ D. We study the 2-distance chromatic number of integer distance\ngraphs for several types of sets D. In each case, we provide exact values or\nupper bounds on this parameter and characterize those graphs G(D) with $\\chi$ 2\n(G(D)) = {\\Delta}(G(D)) + 1.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 19:32:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Benmedjdoub", "Brahim", "", "L'IFORCE"], ["Sopena", "Eric", "", "LaBRI"], ["Bouchemakh", "Isma", "", "L'IFORCE"]]}, {"id": "1602.09124", "submitter": "Victor Zamaraev", "authors": "Vadim Lozin, Dmitriy Malyshev, Raffaele Mosca, Viktor Zamaraev", "title": "More results on weighted independent domination", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Weighted independent domination is an NP-hard graph problem, which remains\ncomputationally intractable in many restricted graph classes.

We\nstrengthen these results by showing that the problem is NP-hard in a proper\nsubclass of the intersection of sat-graphs and chordal graphs.

After noticing that edge-stable equimatchable graphs are\neither 2-connected factor-critical or bipartite, we characterize edge-stable\nequimatchable graphs. This characterization yields an $O(\\min(n^{3.376},\nn^{1.5}m))$ time recognition algorithm.
