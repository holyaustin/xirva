With one exception,\nall of them obtain as minimum-weight paths in the undirected graph\ncorresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. Firstly, by\nfocusing on the atoms of the lattice, one well-known partition distance is\nrecognized to be in fact the analog of the Hamming distance between subsets,\nwith weights on edges of the Hasse diagram determined through the number of\natoms in the unique maximal join-decomposition of partitions.

The idea of measuring the\ndistance between partitions by means of minimum-weight paths in the Hasse\ndiagram is further explored by considering alternative symmetric and\norder-preserving/inverting partition functions (such as the the rank, in the\nsimplest case) for assigning weights to edges.

An important\ntype of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where\nidentical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence\n$AGTC\\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from\n$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate\nthe possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \\textit{seed},\ni.e.\\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We\nstudy the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's\ngenerating power. Our results include \\textit{exact capacity} values for\ncertain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role\nof DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define\nthe notion of the \\textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the\ncapability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \\textit{completely}\ncharacterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general\nalphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated\nresult by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary\nsquare-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded\ntandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication\nlength, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as\nsubstrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular\ninterest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we\nalso show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results\nillustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed\nin generating a large number of sequences for these systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 17:33:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Siddharth", ""], ["Farnoud", "Farzad", ""], ["Bruck", "Jehoshua", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.06048", "submitter": "Abdolahad Noori Zehmakan", "authors": "Abdolahad Noori Zehmakan and Mojtaba Eslahi", "title": "A linear approximation algorithm for the BPP with the best possible\n  absolute approximation ratio", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Bin Packing Problem is one of the most important Combinatorial\nOptimization problems in optimization and has a lot of real-world applications.\nMany approximation algorithms have been presented for this problem because of\nits NP-hard nature.

In the second phase we work through the sequence in\nreverse, repeatedly constructing a solution for a graph from the solution for\nits successor. In an iterative compaction algorithm, we insist that the graphs\ndecrease by a constant fraction of the entire graph.\n  Another approach to solving optimization problems is to exploit the\nstructural properties implied by the connectivity of the input graph. This\napproach can be used on graphs which are not highly connected by decomposing an\ninput graph into its highly connected pieces, solving subproblems on these\nspecially structured pieces and then combining their solutions.\n  We combine these two techniques by developing compaction algorithms which\nwhen applied to the highly connected pieces preserve their connectivity\nproperties. The structural properties this connectivity implies can be helpful\nboth in finding further compactions in later iterations and when we are\nmanipulating solutions in the second phase of an iterative compaction\nalgorithm.\n  To illustrate how this compaction algorithm can be used as a subroutine, we\npresent a linear time algorithm that given four vertices $\\{s_1,s_2,t_1,t_2\\}$\nof a graph $G$, either finds a pair of disjoint paths $P_1$ and $P_2$ of $G$\nsuch that $P_i$ has endpoints $s_i$ and $t_i$, or returns a planar embedding of\nan auxiliary graph which shows that no such pair exists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 11:13:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kawarabayashi", "Ken-ichi", ""], ["Li", "Zhentao", ""], ["Reed", "Bruce", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07687", "submitter": "Chiel Ten Brinke", "authors": "Chiel B.
