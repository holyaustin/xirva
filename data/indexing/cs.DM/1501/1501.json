These effects can be modelled on a\nmultidimensional integer lattice by using a dynamical system obtained by\ncomposing the transition operator of the original system with a quantizer. Such\nmodels manifest pseudorandomness which can be studied using a rigorous\nprobability theoretic approach. To this end, the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is\nendowed with a class of frequency measurable subsets and a spatial frequency\nfunctional as a finitely additive probability measure on them. Using a\nmultivariate version of Weyl's equidistribution criterion, we introduce an\nalgebra of frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice.

For almost every $L$, the events associated with\nthe deviation of trajectories of the quantized and original systems are\nfrequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice whose frequencies\ninvolve geometric probabilities on finite-dimensional tori. Using the skew\nproducts of measure preserving toral automorphisms, we prove mutual\nindependence and uniform distribution of the quantization errors and\ninvestigate statistical properties of invertibility loss for the quantized\nlinear system, extending V.V.Voevodin's results.

This observation asks for a bound on\nhow many such elements there are. Such bounds can be derived using the theory\nof amenable graphs:\n  In this work we examine Schreier graphs of amalgamated products and HNN\nextensions. For an amalgamated product $G = H *_A K $ with $[H:A] \\geq [K:A]\n\\geq 2$, the Schreier graph with respect to $H$ or $K$ turns out to be\nnon-amenable if and only if $[H:A] \\geq 3$.

Furthermore, the conjugacy problem in groups with more\nthan one end can be solved with a strongly generic algorithm which has\nessentially the same time complexity as the word problem. These are rather\nstriking results as the word problem might be easy, but the conjugacy problem\nmight be even undecidable.

We show that the on-line choice number of G(n,p) is asymptotically\nalmost surely asymptotic to the chromatic number of G(n,p), provided that the\naverage degree d=p(n-1) tends to infinity faster than (log log n)^1/3(log\nn)^2n^(2/3). For sparser graphs, we are slightly less successful; we show that\nif d>(log n)^(2+epsilon) for some epsilon>0, then the on-line choice number is\nlarger than the chromatic number by at most a multiplicative factor of C, where\nC in [2,4], depending on the range of d. Also, for d=O(1), the on-line choice\nnumber is by at most a multiplicative constant factor larger than the chromatic\nnumber.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 14:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2015 15:38:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Frieze", "Alan", ""], ["Mitsche", "Dieter", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Gim\u00e9nez", "Xavier", ""], ["Pra\u0142at", "Pawe\u0142", ""]]}]
