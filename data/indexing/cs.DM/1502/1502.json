We present\na new method for creating data-driven scoring systems called a Supersparse\nLinear Integer Model (SLIM). SLIM scoring systems are built by solving an\ninteger program that directly encodes measures of accuracy (the 0-1 loss) and\nsparsity (the $\\ell_0$-seminorm) while restricting coefficients to coprime\nintegers. SLIM can seamlessly incorporate a wide range of operational\nconstraints related to accuracy and sparsity, and can produce highly tailored\nmodels without parameter tuning.

So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been\nderived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these\nstructural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive\nscheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with\nrelease dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on\ntwo processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of\nscheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant\ngeneralization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant\nsimplification leads to tractable problem.\n  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for\noptimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be\nless than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of\noptimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for\nlinear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The\nbounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called\n`normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing\nfunctions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start\nand its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple\nof 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$.\nWe expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally\nsettling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:22:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Bo", ""], ["Coffman", "Ed", ""], ["Dereniowski", "Dariusz", ""], ["Kubiak", "Wieslaw", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04644", "submitter": "\\v{S}t\\v{e}p\\'an Holub", "authors": "Johannes Fischer and \\v{S}t\\v{e}p\\'an Holub and Tomohiro I and Moshe\n  Lewenstein", "title": "Beyond the Runs Theorem", "comments": "New version with substantially improved bound and coauthors who\n  carried out a similar research independently", "journal-ref": "SPIRE 2015, LNCS 9309, 277-286", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-23826-5_27", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, a short and elegant proof was presented showing that a binary word\nof length $n$ contains at most $n-3$ runs.

Each function can take\nfinite values specifying costs of assignments of labels to its variables or the\ninfinite value, which indicates infeasible assignments. The goal is to find an\nassignment of labels to the variables that minimizes the sum.\n  We study (assuming that P $\\ne$ NP) how the complexity of this very general\nproblem depends on the set of functions allowed in the instances, the so-called\nconstraint language. The case when all allowed functions take values in\n$\\{0,\\infty\\}$ corresponds to ordinary CSPs, where one deals only with the\nfeasibility issue and there is no optimization. This case is the subject of the\nAlgebraic CSP Dichotomy Conjecture predicting for which constraint languages\nCSPs are tractable and for which NP-hard. The case when all allowed functions\ntake only finite values corresponds to finite-valued CSP, where the feasibility\naspect is trivial and one deals only with the optimization issue. The\ncomplexity of finite-valued CSPs was fully classified by Thapper and\n\\v{Z}ivn\\'y.\n  An algebraic necessary condition for tractability of a general-valued CSP\nwith a fixed constraint language was recently given by Kozik and Ochremiak. As\nour main result, we prove that if a constraint language satisfies this\nalgebraic necessary condition, and the feasibility CSP corresponding to the\nVCSP with this language is tractable, then the VCSP is tractable. The algorithm\nis a simple combination of the assumed algorithm for the feasibility CSP and\nthe standard LP relaxation. As a corollary, we obtain that a dichotomy for\nordinary CSPs would imply a dichotomy for general-valued CSPs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 20:26:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 15:37:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 08:32:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 15:48:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 09:50:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kolmogorov", "Vladimir", ""], ["Krokhin", "Andrei", ""], ["Rolinek", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07484", "submitter": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Maffray", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Maffray", "title": "Graphs with no induced wheel or antiwheel", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A wheel is a graph that consists of a chordless cycle of length at least 4\nplus a vertex with at least three neighbors on the cycle.
