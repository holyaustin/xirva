Very recently, the $O(m)$ bound was\nimproved to $O(\\min\\{m, \\frac{n^{2.5}\\ln n}{d}\\})$ expected time, an expression\nthat is bounded by $\\tilde{O}(n^{1.75})$.

We also outline\nan application of our extremal combinatorial approach to the problem of packing\nstars with a bounded number of leaves.

The communication protocol is defined such that readings\ntravel in packets. The packets have a capacity of $k$ bytes. We define a {\\em\npacket hop} to be the communication of a packet from a vertex to its neighbor.\nEach packet hop drains one unit of energy and therefore, we need to communicate\nthe readings to the $\\mathbf{sink}$ with the fewest number of hops.\n  We show this problem to be NP-hard and counter it with a simple distributed\n$(2-\\frac{3}{2k})$-approximation algorithm called {\\tt SPT} that uses the\nshortest path tree rooted at the $\\mathbf{sink}$.

Firstly, the readings\nalways travel along a shortest path toward the $\\mathbf{sink}$, which makes it\nan appealing solution to the convergecast problem as it fits the natural\nintuition. Secondly, each node employs a very elementary packing strategy.\nGiven all the readings that enter into the node, it sends out as many fully\npacked packets as possible followed by at most 1 partial packet.
