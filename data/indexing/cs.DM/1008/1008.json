Submodular functions come up in a variety of applications in\ncombinatorial optimization. For a vast range of algorithms, the existence of an\noracle to a submodular function is assumed. But how does one check if this\noracle indeed represents a submodular function?\n  Consider a function f:{0,1}^n \\rightarrow R. The distance to submodularity is\nthe minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be modified to make f\nsubmodular. If this distance is more than epsilon > 0, then we say that f is\nepsilon-far from being submodular. The aim is to have an efficient procedure\nthat, given input f that is epsilon-far from being submodular, certifies that f\nis not submodular. We analyze a very natural tester for this problem, and prove\nthat it runs in subexponential time. This gives the first non-trivial tester\nfor submodularity. On the other hand, we prove an interesting lower bound (that\nis, unfortunately, quite far from the upper bound) suggesting that this tester\ncannot be very efficient in terms of epsilon. This involves non-trivial\nexamples of functions which are far from submodular and yet do not exhibit too\nmany local violations.\n  We also provide some constructions indicating the difficulty in designing a\ntester for submodularity.

We can constrain one or two of these and try to optimize\nthe third. In their seminal paper, Kempe et al. constrained the budget, left\ntime unconstrained, and maximized the coverage: this problem is known as\nInfluence Maximization.\n  In this paper, we study alternative optimization problems which are naturally\nmotivated by resource and time constraints on viral marketing campaigns. In the\nfirst problem, termed Minimum Target Set Selection (or MINTSS for short), a\ncoverage threshold n is given and the task is to find the minimum size seed set\nsuch that by activating it, at least n nodes are eventually activated in the\nexpected sense. In the second problem, termed MINTIME, a coverage threshold n\nand a budget threshold k are given, and the task is to find a seed set of size\nat most k such that by activating it, at least n nodes are activated, in the\nminimum possible time. Both these problems are NP-hard, which motivates our\ninterest in their approximation.\n  For MINTSS, we develop a simple greedy algorithm and show that it provides a\nbicriteria approximation. We also establish a generic hardness result\nsuggesting that improving it is likely to be hard. For MINTIME, we show that\neven bicriteria and tricriteria approximations are hard under several\nconditions.

The flow-cut gap can be greater than 1 even when\nG is the (series-parallel) graph K_{2,3}. In this paper we are primarily\ninterested in the \"integer\" flow-cut gap.

A demand is\ncompliant if its endpoints are joined by a directed path in the resulting\noriented graph.

We can\ncontrol the running time to get an approximation factor-running time tradeoff.\nWe show that for any constant b > 1.5, there is an O(n^{b}) algorithm that\noutputs a (0.5+delta)-approximation for Maxcut, where delta = delta(b) is some\npositive constant.\n  One of the components of our algorithm is a weak local graph partitioning\nprocedure that may be of independent interest. Given a starting vertex $i$ and\na conductance parameter phi, unless a random walk of length ell = O(log n)\nstarting from i mixes rapidly (in terms of phi and ell), we can find a cut of\nconductance at most phi close to the vertex.

We study this game on interval graphs, chordal\ngraphs, planar graphs, and hypercube graphs. Let c_{\\infty}(G) denote the\nnumber of cops needed to capture the robber in graph G in this variant.
