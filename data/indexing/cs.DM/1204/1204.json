We are given query access to $f:[k]^n \\mapsto \\R$ (for some ordered\nrange $\\R$). The hypergrid/cube has a natural partial order given by\ncoordinate-wise ordering, denoted by $\\prec$. A function is \\emph{monotone} if\nfor all pairs $x \\prec y$, $f(x) \\leq f(y)$. The distance to monotonicity,\n$\\eps_f$, is the minimum fraction of values of $f$ that need to be changed to\nmake $f$ monotone.\n  For $k=2$ (the boolean hypercube), the usual tester is the \\emph{edge\ntester}, which checks monotonicity on adjacent pairs of domain points.

This reduces the watershed zone,\nwhere catchment basins overlap. A last pruning operator called scissor\nassociates to each node outside the regional minima one and only one edge. The\ncatchment basins of this new graph do not overlap and form a watershed\npartition. Again, with an increasing steepness, the number of distinct\nwatershed partitions contained in a graph becomes smaller and smaller.\nUltimately, for natural image, an infinite steepness leads to a unique\nsolution, as it is not likely that two absolutely identical non ascending paths\nof infinite steepness connect a node with two distinct minima. It happens that\nnon ascending paths of a given steepness are the geodesics of lexicographic\ndistance functions of a given depth. This permits to extract the watershed\npartitions as skeletons by zone of influence of the minima for such\nlexicographic distances. The waterfall hierarchy is obtained by a sequence of\noperations.

In particular, we consider the maximum clique\nproblem for graphs with small intersection number and random intersection\ngraphs (a model in which each one of $m$ labels is chosen independently with\nprobability $p$ by each one of $n$ vertices, and there are edges between any\nvertices with overlaps in the labels chosen).\n  We first present a simple algorithm which, on input $G$ finds a maximum\nclique in $O(2^{2^m + O(m)} + n^2 \\min\\{2^m, n\\})$ time steps, where $m$ is an\nupper bound on the intersection number and $n$ is the number of vertices.\nConsequently, when $m \\leq \\ln{\\ln{n}}$ the running time of this algorithm is\npolynomial.\n  We then consider random instances of the random intersection graphs model as\ninput graphs. As our main contribution, we prove that, when the number of\nlabels is not too large ($m=n^{\\alpha}, 0< \\alpha <1$), we can use the label\nchoices of the vertices to find a maximum clique in polynomial time whp. The\nproof of correctness for this algorithm relies on our Single Label Clique\nTheorem, which roughly states that whp a \"large enough\" clique cannot be formed\nby more than one label. This theorem generalizes and strengthens other related\nresults in the state of the art, but also broadens the range of values\nconsidered.\n  As an important consequence of our Single Label Clique Theorem, we prove that\nthe problem of inferring the complete information of label choices for each\nvertex from the resulting random intersection graph (i.e. the \\emph{label\nrepresentation of the graph}) is \\emph{solvable} whp. Finding efficient\nalgorithms for constructing such a label representation is left as an\ninteresting open problem for future research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 11:45:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Nikoletseas", "S.", ""], ["Raptopoulos", "C.", ""], ["Spirakis", "P.

For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden\nstructure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor\nsets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph\nthat is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering\nclauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent\nwith all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of\na CNF formula is a set of variables such that each possible partial assignment\nto this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved\nin polynomial time.\n  In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study\nthe algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class\nW_t of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main\nresults are positive:\n  (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two\nconstants k,t\\ge 0, either finds a strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most 2^k,\nor concludes that F has no strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most k.\n  (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the\nnumber of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sb_t(F)>k, for any pair\nof constants k,t\\ge 0. Here, sb_t(F) denotes the size of a smallest strong\nW_t-backdoor set of F.\n  The significance of our results lies in the fact that they allow us to\nexploit algorithmically a hidden structure in formulas that is not accessible\nby any one of the two approaches (decomposability, backdoors) alone.
