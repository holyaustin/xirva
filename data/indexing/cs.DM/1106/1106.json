It uses local rules to depict grain\nmoves and iterate it until reaching a fixed configuration from which no rule\ncan be applied. The main interest of sand piles relies in their {\\em Self\nOrganized Criticality} (SOC), the property that a small perturbation | adding\nsome sand grains | on a fixed configuration has uncontrolled consequences on\nthe system, involving an arbitrary number of grain fall. Physicists L. Kadanoff\n{\\em et al} inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior, extending\nthe well known {\\em Sand Pile Model}. In KSPM($D$), we start from a pile of $N$\nstacked grains and apply the rule: $D-1$ grains can fall from column $i$ onto\nthe $D-1$ adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height between\ncolumns $i$ and $i+1$ is greater or equal to $D$. This paper develops a formal\nbackground for the study of KSPM fixed points. This background, resumed in a\nfinite state word transducer, is used to provide a plain formula for fixed\npoints of KSPM(3).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 10:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Perrot", "K\u00e9vin", ""], ["R\u00e9mila", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2772", "submitter": "Andreas Brandstadt", "authors": "Andreas Brandstadt and Raffaele Mosca", "title": "Dominating Induced Matchings for P7-Free Graphs in Linear Time", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $G$ be a finite undirected graph with edge set $E$.

The complement-closed class of {\\it generalized split graphs} are\nthose graphs $G$ such that either $G$ {\\it or} the complement of $G$ is\nunipolar. Generalized split graphs are a large subclass of perfect graphs. In\nfact, it has been shown that almost all $C_5$-free (and hence, almost all\nperfect graphs) are generalized split graphs. In this paper we present a\nrecognition algorithm for unipolar graphs that utilizes a minimal triangulation\nof the given graph, and produces a partition when one exists. Our algorithm has\nrunning time O($nm^\\prime$), where $m^\\prime$ is the number of edges in a\nminimal triangulation of the given graph. Generalized split graphs can\nrecognized via this algorithm in O($nm' + n\\OL{m}'$) = O($n^3$) time. We give\nalgorithms on unipolar graphs for finding a maximum independent set and a\nminimum clique cover in O($n+m$) time and for finding a maximum clique and a\nminimum proper coloring in O($n^{2.5}/\\log n$), when a unipolar partition is\ngiven. These algorithms yield algorithms for the four optimization problems on\ngeneralized split graphs that have the same worst-case time bound. We also\nprove that the perfect code problem is NP-Complete for unipolar graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 20:37:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2013 21:04:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Eschen", "Elaine M.", ""], ["Wang", "Xiaoqiang", ""]]}]
