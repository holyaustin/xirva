In many of the physical processes one may modelize thus (such\nas bootstrap percolation, forest fire or epidemic propagation models, life\nwithout death, etc), each local change is irreversible. The class of freezing\nCellular Automata (FCA) captures this feature. In a freezing cellular automaton\nthe states are ordered and the cells can only decrease their state according to\nthis \"freezing-order\". We investigate the dynamics of such systems through the\nquestions of simulation and universality in this class: is there a Freezing\nCellular Automaton (FCA) that is able to simulate any Freezing Cellular\nAutomata, i.e. an intrinsically universal FCA? We show that the answer to that\nquestion is sensitive to both the number of changes cells are allowed to make,\nand geometric features of the space. In dimension 1, there is no universal FCA.\nIn dimension 2, if either the number of changes is at least 2, or the\nneighborhood is Moore, then there are universal FCA. On the other hand, there\nis no universal FCA with one change and Von Neumann neighborhood. We also show\nthat monotonicity of the local rule with respect to the freezing-order (a\ncommon feature of bootstrap percolation) is also an obstacle to universality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 11:49:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Becker", "Florent", "", "LIFO"], ["Maldonado", "Diego", "", "LIFO"], ["Ollinger", "Nicolas", "", "LIFO"], ["Theyssier", "Guillaume", "", "I2M"]]}, {"id": "1805.00147", "submitter": "WeiGuo Zhang", "authors": "XiaoFang Wang, YuJuan Sun, WeiGuo Zhang", "title": "State Diagrams of a Class of Singular LFSR and Their Applications to the\n  Construction of de Bruijn Cycles", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CR cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The state diagrams of a class of singular linear feedback shift registers\n(LFSR) are discussed.
