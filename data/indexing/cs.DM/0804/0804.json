The graph represents a wireless network and includes\nonly edges over which secure communication in the presence of eavesdroppers is\npossible. The underlying point process models considered are lattices and\nPoisson point processes. In the lattice case, analogies to standard bond and\nsite percolation can be exploited to determine percolation thresholds. In the\nPoisson case, the node degrees are determined and percolation is studied using\nanalytical bounds and simulations. It turns out that a small density of\neavesdroppers already has a drastic impact on the connectivity of the secrecy\ngraph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2008 19:40:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Haenggi", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.2343", "submitter": "Charilaos Efthymiou", "authors": "Charilaos Efthymiou (1,2) and Paul G.

In\nfact other tools, like the wavelets, admit specially built nonorthogonal bases\nbut require different bases for analysis and reconstruction (biorthogonal and\ndual bases) and vectorial coordinates; this renders those systems unintuitive\nand computing intensive. As an example of the advantages of the new\ngeneralization of the Fourier Theorem, this paper introduces a novel method for\nthe synthesis that is based on frequency-phase series of square waves (the\nequivalent of the polar Fourier Theorem but for nonorthogonal bases).
