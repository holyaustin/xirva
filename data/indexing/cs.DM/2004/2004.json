SAL programs are translated\ninto C++ code that is run in parallel on a cluster. We call this implementation\nof SAL the Streaming Analytics Machine (SAM). SAL programs are succinct,\nrequiring about 20 times fewer lines of code than using the SAM library\ndirectly, or writing an implementation using Apache Flink. To benchmark SAM we\ncalculate finding temporal triangles within streaming netflow data. Also, we\ncompare SAM to an implementation written for Flink. We find that SAM is able to\nscale to 128 nodes or 2560 cores, while Apache Flink has max throughput with 32\nnodes and degrades thereafter. Apache Flink has an advantage when triangles are\nrare, with max aggregate throughput for Flink at 32 nodes greater than the max\nachievable rate of SAM. In our experiments, when triangle occurrence was faster\nthan five per second per node, SAM performed better. Both frameworks may miss\nresults due to latencies in network communication. SAM consistently reported an\naverage of 93.7% of expected results while Flink decreases from 83.7% to 52.1%\nas we increase to the maximum size of the cluster. Overall, SAM can obtain\nrates of 91.8 billion netflows per day.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 03:42:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Goodman", "Eric L.", ""], ["Grunwald", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00518", "submitter": "Mehrnoosh Shafiee", "authors": "Mehrnoosh Shafiee and Javad Ghaderi", "title": "Scheduling Parallel-Task Jobs Subject to Packing and Placement\n  Constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.DM cs.DS cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by modern parallel computing applications, we consider the problem\nof scheduling parallel-task jobs with heterogeneous resource requirements in a\ncluster of machines.

Once a task is scheduled on a machine, it\nrequires a certain amount of resource from that machine for the duration of its\nprocessing. A machine can process (\"pack\") multiple tasks at the same time,\nhowever the cumulative resource requirement of the tasks should not exceed the\nmachine's capacity.\n  Our objective is to minimize the weighted average of the jobs' completion\ntimes.

In this paper, we study a seeded graph matching problem, which assumes\nthat a set of seeds, i.e., pre-mapped vertex-pairs, is given in advance. While\nmost previous work requires all seeds to be correct, we focus on the setting\nwhere the seeds are partially correct. Specifically, consider two correlated\ngraphs whose edges are sampled independently from a parent \\ER graph\n$\\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. A mapping between the vertices of the two graphs is\nprovided as seeds, of which an unknown $\\beta$ fraction is correct. We first\nanalyze a simple algorithm that matches vertices based on the number of common\nseeds in the $1$-hop neighborhoods, and then further propose a new algorithm\nthat uses seeds in the $2$-hop neighborhoods. We establish non-asymptotic\nperformance guarantees of perfect matching for both $1$-hop and $2$-hop\nalgorithms, showing that our new $2$-hop algorithm requires substantially fewer\ncorrect seeds than the $1$-hop algorithm when graphs are sparse. Moreover, by\ncombining our new performance guarantees for the $1$-hop and $2$-hop\nalgorithms, we attain the best-known results (in terms of the required fraction\nof correct seeds) across the entire range of graph sparsity and significantly\nimprove the previous results in\n\\cite{10.14778/2794367.2794371,lubars2018correcting} when $p\\ge n^{-5/6}$.

We\nanalyse which protocols are optimal for these games covering both the worst\ncase and average case scenarios, i,e., optimizing the guaranteed and expected\ncoordination times. We begin by analysing Choice Matching Games (CM-games)\nwhich are a simple yet fundamental type of WLC-games, where the goal of the\nplayers is to pick the same choice from a finite set of initially\nindistinguishable choices. We give a complete classification of optimal\nexpected and guaranteed coordination times in two-player CM-games and show that\nthe corresponding optimal protocols are unique in every case - except in the\nCM-game with four choices, which we analyse separately.\n  Our results on CM-games are also essential for proving a more general result\non the difficulty of all WLC-games: we provide a complete analysis of least\nupper bounds for optimal expected coordination times in all two-player\nWLC-games as a function of game size. We also show that CM-games can be seen as\nthe most difficult games among all two-player WLC-games, as they turn out to\nhave the greatest optimal expected coordination times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 22:53:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kuusisto", "Antti", ""], ["R\u00f6nnholm", "Raine", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.07492", "submitter": "Daniel Paulusma", "authors": "Hans Bodlaender, Nick Brettell, Matthew Johnson, Giacomo Paesani,\n  Daniel Paulusma, and Erik Jan van Leeuwen", "title": "Steiner Trees for Hereditary Graph Classes: a Treewidth Perspective", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the classical problems (Edge) Steiner Tree and Vertex Steiner\nTree after restricting the input to some class of graphs characterized by a\nsmall set of forbidden induced subgraphs.
