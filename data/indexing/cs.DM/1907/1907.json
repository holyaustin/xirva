A signed graph is an\nundirected graph where each edge is given a sign, positive or negative. An\nimportant concept for signed graphs is the operation of switching at a vertex,\nwhich is to change the sign of each incident edge. A homomorphism of a graph is\na vertex-mapping that preserves the adjacencies; in the case of signed graphs,\nwe also preserve the edge-signs. Special homomorphisms of signed graphs, called\ns-homomorphisms, have been studied. In an s-homomorphism, we allow, before the\nmapping, to perform any number of switchings on the source signed graph. This\nconcept has been extensively studied, and a full complexity classification\n(polynomial or NP-complete) for s-homomorphism to a fixed target signed graph\nhas recently been obtained. Such a dichotomy is not known when we restrict the\ninput graph to be planar (not even for non-signed graph homomorphisms).\n  We show that deciding whether a (non-signed) planar graph admits a\nhomomorphism to the square $C_t^2$ of a cycle with $t\\ge 6$, or to the circular\nclique $K_{4t/(2t-1)}$ with $t\\ge2$, are NP-complete problems. We use these\nresults to show that deciding whether a planar signed graph admits an\ns-homomorphism to an unbalanced even cycle is NP-complete. (A cycle is\nunbalanced if it has an odd number of negative edges). We deduce a complete\ncomplexity dichotomy for the planar s-homomorphism problem with any signed\ncycle as a target.\n  We also study further restrictions involving the maximum degree and the girth\nof the input signed graph. We prove that planar s-homomorphism problems to\nsigned cycles remain NP-complete even for inputs of maximum degree~$3$ (except\nfor the case of unbalanced $4$-cycles, for which we show this for maximum\ndegree~$4$).

While many of its statistical properties under different probabilistic\nmodels for phylogenetic trees have already been established, little is known\nabout its minimum value and the trees that achieve it. In this manuscript, we\nfill this gap in the literature. To begin with, we derive both recursive and\nclosed expressions for the minimum Colless index of a tree with $n$ leaves.\nSurprisingly, these expressions show a connection between the minimum Colless\nindex and the so-called Blancmange curve, a fractal curve. We then fully\ncharacterize the tree shapes that achieve this minimum value and we introduce\nboth an algorithm to generate them and a recurrence to count them. After\nfocusing on two extremal classes of trees with minimum Colless index (the\nmaximally balanced trees and the greedy from the bottom trees), we conclude by\nshowing that all trees with minimum Colless index also have minimum Sackin\nindex, another popular balance index.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 09:07:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Coronado", "Tom\u00e1s M.", ""], ["Fischer", "Mareike", ""], ["Herbst", "Lina", ""], ["Rossell\u00f3", "Francesc", ""], ["Wicke", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.05168", "submitter": "David Wood", "authors": "Vida Dujmovi\\'c and Pat Morin and David R.

The goal of the agent is to find her way home, which is located\nin a grid cell chosen by an adversary. Initially, the agent is provided with an\ninfinite sequence of instructions, that dictate the movements performed by the\nagent. Each instruction corresponds to a movement to an adjacent grid cell and\nthe set of instructions can be a function of the initial locations of the agent\nand home. The challenge of our problem stems from faults in the movements made\nby the agent. In every step, with some constant probability $0 \\leq p \\leq 1$,\nthe agent performs a random movement instead of following the current\ninstruction.\n  This paper provides two results on this problem. First, we show that for some\nvalues of $p$, there does not exist any set of instructions that guide the\nagent home in finite expected time. Second, we complement this impossibility\nresult with an algorithm that, for sufficiently small values of $p$, yields a\nfinite expected hitting time for home. In particular, we show that for any $p <\n1$, our approach gives a hitting rate that decays polynomially as a function of\ntime. In that sense, our approach is far superior to a standard random walk in\nterms of hitting time.

A node begins the process by sending a message to all its\nneighbours and the neighbours, in the next round forward the message to all the\nneighbours they did not receive the message from and so on. We assume that the\nnodes do not keep a record of the flooding event. We call this amnesiac\nflooding (AF). Since the node forgets, if the message is received again in\nsubsequent rounds, it will be forwarded again raising the possibility that the\nmessage may be circulated infinitely even on a finite graph. As far as we know,\nthe question of termination for such a flooding process has not been settled -\nrather, non-termination is implicitly assumed.\n  In this paper, we show that synchronous AF always terminates on any arbitrary\nfinite graph and derive exact termination times which differ sharply in\nbipartite and non-bipartite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite connected graph. We\nshow that synchronous AF from a single source node terminates on $G$ in $e$\nrounds, where $e$ is the eccentricity of the source node, if and only if $G$ is\nbipartite. For non-bipartite $G$, synchronous AF from a single source\nterminates in $j$ rounds where $e < j \\leq e+d+1$ and $d$ is the diameter of\n$G$. This limits termination time to at most $d$ and at most $2d + 1$ for\nbipartite and non-bipartite graphs respectively. If communication/broadcast to\nall nodes is the motivation, our results show that AF is asymptotically time\noptimal and obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning\nstructures like spanning trees. The clear separation in the termination times\nof bipartite and non-bipartite graphs also suggests mechanisms for distributed\ndiscovery of the topology/distances in arbitrary graphs.\n  For comparison, we show that, in asynchronous networks, an adaptive adversary\ncan force AF to be non-terminating.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:45:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hussak", "Walter", ""], ["Trehan", "Amitabh", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.07141", "submitter": "Tao Wang", "authors": "Rui Li and Tao Wang", "title": "Variable degeneracy on toroidal graphs", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1803.01197, arXiv:1907.06630", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $f$ be a nonnegative integer valued function on the vertex-set of a\ngraph.

Previous studies have\nexplored these processes on complete graphs and expander graphs, but we\nunderstand significantly less about their properties on graphs with more\ncomplicated structures.\n  In this paper, we study the Best-of-two and the Best-of-three on the\nstochastic block model $G(2n,p,q)$, which is a random graph consisting of two\ndistinct Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs $G(n,p)$ joined by random edges with density\n$q\\leq p$.
