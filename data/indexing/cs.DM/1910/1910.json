Measuring and\neliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of\ndemocratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs\ninvolving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that\nmathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to\ninvestigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so\nfar from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical\nanalysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness,\napproximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as\ndescriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)\njournals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of\ncoverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in\nwriting this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further\ninteractions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect,\nour main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several\nmodels, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS\nframeworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing\nnon-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational\ncomplexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions\nfor future research.\n  The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on\ngerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to\nthe TCS community and to show that science of gerrymandering involves an\nintriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and combinatorial\noptimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2019 16:11:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Tanima", ""], ["DasGupta", "Bhaskar", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.01683", "submitter": "Therese Biedl", "authors": "Therese Biedl", "title": "A note on 1-planar graphs with minimum degree 7", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is well-known that 1-planar graphs have minimum degree at most 7, and not\nhard to see that some 1-planar graphs have minimum degree exactly 7.

In a nutshell, FGC asks to design a connected network, while\nallowing to specify different reliability levels for individual edges. While\nthis non-uniform nature of the problem makes it appealing from the modeling\nperspective, it also renders most existing algorithmic tools for dealing with\nnetwork design problems unfit for approximating FGC.\n  In this paper we develop a general algorithmic approach for approximating FGC\nthat yields approximation algorithms with ratios that are very close to the\nbest known bounds for many special cases, such as 2-ECSS and TAP. Our algorithm\nand analysis combine various techniques including a weight-scaling algorithm, a\ncharging argument that uses a variant of exchange bijections between spanning\ntrees and a factor revealing min-max-min optimization problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:38:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 12:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Adjiashvili", "David", ""], ["Hommelsheim", "Felix", ""], ["M\u00fchlenthaler", "Moritz", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.13367", "submitter": "Caleb Ju", "authors": "Caleb Ju and Edgar Solomonik", "title": "Derivation and Analysis of Fast Bilinear Algorithms for Convolution", "comments": "34 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.DM cs.DS cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The prevalence of convolution in applications within signal processing, deep\nneural networks, and numerical solvers has motivated the development of\nnumerous fast convolution algorithms.
