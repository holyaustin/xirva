In this paper, we study a natural\nnon-local Markov chain known as the Chayes-Machta dynamics for the mean-field\ncase of the random-cluster model, where the underlying graph is the complete\ngraph on $n$ vertices. The random-cluster model is parametrized by an it edge\nprobability $p$ and a cluster weight $q$. Our focus is on the critical regime:\n$p = p_c(q)$ and $q \\in (1,2)$, where $p_c(q)$ is the threshold corresponding\nto the order-disorder phase transition of the model. We show that the mixing\ntime of the Chayes-Machta dynamics is $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log \\log n)$ in this\nparameter regime, which reveals that the dynamics does not undergo an\nexponential slowdown at criticality, a surprising fact that had been predicted\n(but not proved) by statistical physicists. This also provides a nearly optimal\nbound (up to the $\\log\\log n$ factor) for the mixing time of the mean-field\nChayes-Machta dynamics in the only regime of parameters where no non-trivial\nbound was previously known.

Our main result is to nearly close this gap with an improved upper\nbound, thus separating the cases of edge and vertex faults. For odd $k$, our\nnew upper bound is $O_k(f^{\\frac12 - \\frac{1}{2k}} n^{1+1/k} + fn)$, which is\ntight up to hidden $poly(k)$ factors. For even $k$, our new upper bound is\n$O_k(f^{1/2} n^{1+1/k} +fn)$, which leaves a gap of $poly(k) f^{1/(2k)}$. Our\nproof is an analysis of the fault-tolerant greedy algorithm, which requires\nexponential time, but we also show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm\nwhich creates edge fault tolerant spanners that are larger only by factors of\n$k$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 21:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bodwin", "Greg", ""], ["Dinitz", "Michael", ""], ["Robelle", "Caleb", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11674", "submitter": "Jakub Kozik", "authors": "Jakub Kozik", "title": "Improving Gebauer's construction of 3-chromatic hypergraphs with few\n  edges", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In 1964 Erd\\H{o}s proved, by randomized construction, that the minimum number\nof edges in a $k$-graph that is not two colorable is $O(k^2\\; 2^k)$.
