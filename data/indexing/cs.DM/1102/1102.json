Recently, this\napproach has been generalized in \\cite{LHN} by arranging individuals on the\nnodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than\ndirected ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers\nof selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs\nwhich act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that\nis at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices\nincreases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the\nfixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we\nintroduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in \\cite{LHN}, where\nall individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between\naggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the\nindividuals in our new model and in the model of \\cite{LHN} can be interpreted\nas an \"aggregation\" vs. an \"all-or-nothing\" strategy, respectively. We prove\nthat our new model of mutual influences admits a \\emph{potential function},\nwhich guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any\ninitial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast\nconvergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as\nwe provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart\nfrom being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be\nuseful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading\npopulations in networks.
