In that sense, any proof of non-reachability in DRNs directly applies\nto any concrete stochastic models, independently of kinetics laws and\nconstants. Moreover, if stochastic kinetic rates never vanish, reachability\nproperties are equivalent in the two settings. The analysis of two global\ndynamical properties of DRNs is addressed: irreducibility, i.e., the ability to\nreach any discrete state from any other state; and recurrence, i.e., the\nability to return to any initial state. Our results consider both the\nverification of such properties when species are present in a large copy\nnumber, and in the general case. The obtained necessary and sufficient\nconditions involve algebraic conditions on the network reactions which in most\ncases can be verified using linear programming.

This method is appreciated for its simplicity,\nrobustness, and efficiency. In the \"push\" protocol, every informed node\nselects, at every time step (a.k.a. round), one of its neighboring node\nuniformly at random and forwards the information to this node. This protocol is\nknown to complete information spreading in $O(\\log n)$ time steps with high\nprobability (w.h.p.) in several families of $n$-node \"static\" networks. The\nPush protocol has also been empirically shown to perform well in practice, and,\nspecifically, to be robust against dynamic topological changes.\n  In this paper, we aim at analyzing the Push protocol in \"dynamic\" networks.\nWe consider the \"edge-Markovian\" evolving graph model which captures natural\ntemporal dependencies between the structure of the network at time $t$, and the\none at time $t+1$. Precisely, a non-edge appears with probability $p$, while an\nexisting edge dies with probability $q$. In order to fit with real-world\ntraces, we mostly concentrate our study on the case where $p=\\Omega(1/n)$ and\n$q$ is constant. We prove that, in this realistic scenario, the Push protocol\ndoes perform well, completing information spreading in $O(\\log n)$ time steps\nw.h.p. Note that this performance holds even when the network is, w.h.p.,\ndisconnected at every time step (e.g., when $p << (\\log n) / n$). Our result\nprovides the first formal argument demonstrating the robustness of the Push\nprotocol against network changes. We also address other ranges of parameters\n$p$ and $q$ (e.g., $p+q=1$ with arbitrary $p$ and $q$, and $p=1/n$ with\narbitrary $q$). Although they do not precisely fit with the measures performed\non real-world traces, they can be of independent interest for other settings.\nThe results in these cases confirm the positive impact of dynamism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 18:13:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Clementi", "Andrea", ""], ["Crescenzi", "Pierluigi", ""], ["Doerr", "Carola", ""], ["Fraigniaud", "Pierre", ""], ["Isopi", "Marco", ""], ["Panconesi", "Alessandro", ""], ["Pasquale", "Francesco", ""], ["Silvestri", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.3844", "submitter": "Svetlana Puzynina", "authors": "\\'Emilie Charlier, Teturo Kamae, Svetlana Puzynina, Luca Q.

In other words, there exists a\nshuffle of $k$-copies of $x$ which produces $x$. We are particularly interested\nin the case $k=2$, in which case we say $x$ is self-shuffling. This property of\ninfinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its\nlanguage (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non\nself-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being\nself-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising\nin the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They\ninclude for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept\n$0<\\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling). Our\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words can be interpreted\narithmetically in terms of a dynamical embedding and defines an arithmetic\nprocess we call the {\\it stepping stone model}. One important feature of\nself-shuffling words stems from its morphic invariance, which provides a useful\ntool for showing that one word is not the morphic image of another. The notion\nof self-shuffling has other unexpected applications particularly in the area of\nsubstitutive dynamical systems. For example, as a consequence of our\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words, we recover a number\ntheoretic result, originally due to Yasutomi, on a classification of pure\nmorphic Sturmian words in the orbit of the characteristic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 18:42:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2013 18:34:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 13:38:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Charlier", "\u00c9milie", ""], ["Kamae", "Teturo", ""], ["Puzynina", "Svetlana", ""], ["Zamboni", "Luca Q.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4062", "submitter": "Vasiliy Usatyk", "authors": "Vasiliy Usatyuk", "title": "Upper and lower bound on the cardinality containing shortest vectors in\n  a lattice reduced by block Korkin-Zolotarev method (Russian)", "comments": "in Russian, 14 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article present a concise estimate of upper and lower bound on the\ncardinality containing shortest vector in a lattice reduced by block\nKorkin-Zolotarev method (BKZ) for different value of the block size.

In addition, we parallelize the exploration of the search\ntree. During the search, processes immediately communicate changes to upper and\nlower bounds on the size of maximum clique, which occasionally results in a\nsuper-linear speedup because vertices with large search spaces can be pruned by\nother processes.
