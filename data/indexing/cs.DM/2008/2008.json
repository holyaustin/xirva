The\nobjective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets\nof vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge\ncontains one of these subsets.\n  Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph\nversions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and\nmatchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a\n\"tent\" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We\ngive a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free\nhypergraphs, and indeed $\\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include\nalmost all the vertices.\n  The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as\ninstances of vertex cover on simple hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise\nshare at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation\nfor vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs.\nHowever, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm\nachieves a factor $(\\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\\ln n$ factor for\ngeneral hypergraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:12:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2020 03:38:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Guruswami", "Venkatesan", ""], ["Sandeep", "Sai", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.07369", "submitter": "Thomas Lidbetter Dr", "authors": "Steve Alpern, Thomas Lidbetter and Katerina Papadaki", "title": "Continuous Patrolling Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The continuous patrolling game studied here was first proposed in Alpern et\nal.

The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes\nwhich have to be given information so that the network is covered in least\nnumber of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation\nalgorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this\nwork, we propose three heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic\n(BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic (ICCH) and Component Based Recursive\nHeuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure.\nBBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily\nfrom the vertices of the backbone.

For\nexample, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on\ndisjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and\nmoreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the\ngraph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs,\nordering of the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected\ngraphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been\nimplemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks\nof size more than $50$K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to\nthe approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they\nare much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the\nheuristics proposed in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2020 07:32:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Gautam", "Rahul Kumar", ""], ["Kare", "Anjeneya Swami", ""], ["Bhavani", "S.

In this paper, we\nshow that the decision version of the \\textsc{Minimum Semipaired Domination}\nproblem remains NP-complete for split graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. On\nthe positive side, we propose a linear-time algorithm to compute a minimum\ncardinality semipaired dominating set of block graphs. In addition, we prove\nthat the \\textsc{Minimum Semipaired Domination} problem is APX-complete for\ngraphs with maximum degree $3$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:07:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Mar 2021 09:15:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2021 11:21:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Henning", "Michael A.", ""], ["Pandey", "Arti", ""], ["Tripathi", "Vikash", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13741", "submitter": "Claus Kadelka", "authors": "Claus Kadelka and Benjamin Keilty and Reinhard Laubenbacher", "title": "Collectively canalizing Boolean functions", "comments": "15 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the mathematical properties of collectively canalizing\nBoolean functions, a class of functions that has arisen from applications in\nsystems biology. Boolean networks are an increasingly popular modeling\nframework for regulatory networks, and the class of functions studied here\ncaptures a key feature of biological network dynamics, namely that a subset of\none or more variables, under certain conditions, can dominate the value of a\nBoolean function, to the exclusion of all others. These functions have rich\nmathematical properties to be explored. The paper shows how the number and type\nof such sets influence a function's behavior and define a new measure for the\ncanalizing strength of any Boolean function. We further connect the concept of\ncollective canalization with the well-studied concept of the average\nsensitivity of a Boolean function. The relationship between Boolean functions\nand the dynamics of the networks they form is important in a wide range of\napplications beyond biology, such as computer science, and has been studied\nwith statistical and simulation-based methods. But the rich relationship\nbetween structure and dynamics remains largely unexplored, and this paper is\nintended as a contribution to its mathematical foundation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:03:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2020 20:50:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kadelka", "Claus", ""], ["Keilty", "Benjamin", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""]]}]
