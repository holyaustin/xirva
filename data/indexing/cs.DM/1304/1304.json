They give an O(log n)-approximation algorithm for the\nprize-collecting node-weighted Steiner tree problem (PCST). They use the\nalgorithm for PCST to obtain a bicriteria (2, O(log n))-approximation algorithm\nfor the Budgeted node-weighted Steiner tree problem. Their solution may cost up\nto twice the budget, but collects a factor Omega(1/log n) of the optimal prize.\nWe improve these results from at least two aspects.\n  Our first main result is a primal-dual O(log h)-approximation algorithm for a\nmore general problem, prize-collecting node-weighted Steiner forest, where we\nhave (h) demands each requesting the connectivity of a pair of vertices. Our\nalgorithm can be seen as a greedy algorithm which reduces the number of demands\nby choosing a structure with minimum cost-to-reduction ratio. This natural\nstyle of argument (also used by Klein and Ravi[10] and Guha et al.[8]) leads to\na much simpler algorithm than that of Moss and Rabani[12] for PCST.\n  Our second main contribution is for the Budgeted node-weighted Steiner tree\nproblem, which is also an improvement to [12] and [8]. In the unrooted case, we\nimprove upon an O(log^2(n))-approximation of [8], and present an O(log\nn)-approximation algorithm without any budget violation. For the rooted case,\nwhere a specified vertex has to appear in the solution tree, we improve the\nbicriteria result of [12] to a bicriteria approximation ratio of (1+eps, O(log\nn)/(eps^2)) for any positive (possibly subconstant) (eps). That is, for any\npermissible budget violation (1+eps), we present an algorithm achieving a\ntradeoff in the guarantee for prize. Indeed, we show that this is almost tight\nfor the natural linear-programming relaxation used by us as well as in [12].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Apr 2013 22:34:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bateni", "MohammadHossein", ""], ["Hajiaghayi", "MohammadTaghi", ""], ["Liaghat", "Vahid", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7993", "submitter": "Romain Absil", "authors": "Romain Absil and Hadrien M\\'elot", "title": "Digenes: genetic algorithms to discover conjectures about directed and\n  undirected graphs", "comments": "17 Pages, 2 Figures, 2 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present Digenes, a new discovery system that aims to help researchers in\ngraph theory.
