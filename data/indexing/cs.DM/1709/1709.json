More\nspecifically, we want to mark at most $d$ vertices and to transform each layer\ninto a cluster graph using at most $k$ edge additions or deletions per layer so\nthat, if we remove the marked vertices, we obtain the same cluster graph in all\nlayers. In Temporal Cluster Editing we receive a sequence of layers and we want\nto transform each layer into a cluster graph so that consecutive layers differ\nonly slightly. That is, we want to transform each layer into a cluster graph\nwith at most $k$ edge additions or deletions and to mark a distinct set of $d$\nvertices in each layer so that each two consecutive layers are the same after\nremoving the vertices marked in the first of the two layers. We study the\ncombinatorial structure of the two problems via their parameterized complexity\nwith respect to the parameters $d$ and $k$, among others. Despite the similar\ndefinition, the two problems behave quite differently: In particular,\nMulti-Layer Cluster Editing is fixed-parameter tractable with running time\n$k^{O(k+d)}\\cdot s^{O(1)}$ for inputs of size $s$, whereas Temporal Cluster\nEditing is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ even if $d = 3$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 15:53:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2018 19:26:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jiehua", ""], ["Molter", "Hendrik", ""], ["Sorge", "Manuel", ""], ["Suchy", "Ondrej", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.09152", "submitter": "Jan Dreier", "authors": "Jan Dreier, Philipp Kuinke, Ba Le Xuan, Peter Rossmanith", "title": "Local Structure Theorems for Erdos Renyi Graphs and their Algorithmic\n  Application", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze some local properties of sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs, where $d(n)/n$\nis the edge probability.

An embedding $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$ of a\ngraph $G$ into a 2-manifold $M$ maps the vertices in $V(G)$ to distinct points\nand the edges in $E(G)$ to interior-disjoint Jordan arcs between the\ncorresponding vertices. In applications in clustering, cartography, and\nvisualization, nearby vertices and edges are often bundled to the same point or\noverlapping arcs, due to data compression or low resolution. This raises the\ncomputational problem of deciding whether a given map $\\varphi:G\\rightarrow M$\ncomes from an embedding.

The length of such route\nequals, in an edge-weighted tree, twice the total weight of all edges of the\ntree and this is asymptotically optimal over all exploration strategies. This\npaper considers a variant of such search strategies where the length of each\nroute is bounded by a positive integer $B$ (e.g. due to limited energy\nresources of the searcher). The objective is to cover all the edges of a tree\n$T$ using the minimum number of routes, each starting and ending at the root\nand each being of length at most $B$. To this end, we analyze the following\nnatural greedy tree traversal process that is based on decomposing a depth\nfirst search traversal into a sequence of limited length routes. Given any\narbitrary depth first search traversal $R$ of the tree $T$, we cover $R$ with\nroutes $R_1,\\ldots,R_l$, each of length at most $B$ such that: $R_i$ starts at\nthe root, reaches directly the farthest point of $R$ visited by $R_{i-1}$, then\n$R_i$ continues along the path $R$ as far as possible, and finally $R_i$\nreturns to the root. We call the above algorithm \\emph{piecemeal-DFS} and we\nprove that it achieves the asymptotically minimal number of routes $l$,\nregardless of the choice of $R$. Our analysis also shows that the total length\nof the traversal (and thus the traversal time) of piecemeal-DFS is\nasymptotically minimum over all energy-constrained exploration strategies. The\nfact that $R$ can be chosen arbitrarily means that the exploration strategy can\nbe constructed in an online fashion when the input tree $T$ is not known in\nadvance.
