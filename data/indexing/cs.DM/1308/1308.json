We augment this result by showing that for digraph\ntemplates H, every conservative CSP, denoted LHOM(H), is solvable in logspace\nor is hard for NL. More precisely, we introduce a digraph structure we call a\ncircular N, and prove the following dichotomy: if H contains no circular N then\nLHOM(H) admits a logspace algorithm, and otherwise LHOM(H) is hard for NL. Our\nalgorithm operates by reducing the lists in a complex manner based on a novel\ndecomposition of an auxiliary digraph, combined with repeated applications of\nReingold's algorithm for undirected reachability (2005). We also prove an\nalgebraic version of this dichotomy: the digraphs without a circular N are\nprecisely those that admit a finite chain of polymorphisms satisfying the\nHagemann-Mitschke identities. This confirms a conjecture of Larose and Tesson\n(2007) for LHOM(H).

It\ndisplays the vertices of a graph as horizontal vertex-segments, and each edge\nis represented by a vertical edge-segment touching the segments of its end\nvertices; beyond that segments do not intersect. We generalize visibility to\n1-visibility, where each edge- (vertex-) segment crosses at most one vertex-\n(edge-) segment. In other words, a vertex is crossed by at most one edge, and\nvice-versa. We show that 1-visibility properly extends 1-planarity and develop\na linear time algorithm to compute a 1-visibility representation of an embedded\n1-planar graph on O(n^2) area. A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the\nplane such that each edge is crossed at most once. Concerning density, both\n1-visible and 1-planar graphs of size $n$ have at most 4n-8 edges.

For that we study compression of solutions with\nstraight-line programs (SLPs) as suggested originally by Plandowski and Rytter\nin the context of a single word equation. We review some basic results on SLPs\nand give full proofs in order to keep this fundamental part of the program\nself-contained. Next we study systems of equations with constraints in free\ngroups and more generally in free products of abelian groups. We show how to\ncompress minimal solutions with extended Parikh-constraints. This type of\nconstraints allows to express semi linear conditions as e.g. alphabetic\ninformation. The result relies on some combinatorial analysis and has not been\nshown elsewhere. We show similar compression results for Boolean formula of\nequations over a torsion-free $\\delta$-hyperbolic group. The situation is much\nmore delicate than in free groups. As byproduct we improve the estimation of\nthe \"capacity\" constant used by Rips and Sela in their paper \"Canonical\nrepresentatives and equations in hyperbolic groups\" from a double-exponential\nbound in $\\delta$ to some single-exponential bound. The final section shows\ncompression results for toral relatively hyperbolic group using the work of\nDahmani: We show that given a system of equations over a fixed toral relatively\nhyperbolic group, for every solution of length $N$ there is an SLP for another\nsolution such that the size of the SLP is bounded by some polynomial $p(s+ \\log\nN)$ where $s$ is the size of the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Aug 2013 13:47:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Diekert", "Volker", ""], ["Kharlampovich", "Olga", ""], ["Moghaddam", "Atefeh Mohajeri", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6166", "submitter": "Dimitrios Thilikos", "authors": "Alexander Grigoriev and Athanassios Koutsonas and Dimitrios M.\n  Thilikos", "title": "Bidimensionality of Geometric Intersection Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let B be a finite collection of geometric (not necessarily convex) bodies in\nthe plane.
