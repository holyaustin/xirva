In practice, Fitch graphs represent xenology relations, i.e.,\npairs of genes $x$ and $y$ for which a horizontal gene transfer happened along\nthe path from $\\mathrm{lca}(x,y)$ to $y$.\n  In this contribution, we generalize the concept of Fitch graphs and consider\ntrees $T$ that are equipped with edge-labeling $\\lambda: E\\to \\mathcal{P}(M)$\nthat assigns to each edge a subset $M'\\subseteq M$ of colors. Given such a\ntree, we can derive a map $\\varepsilon_{(T,\\lambda)}$ (or equivalently a set of\nnot necessarily disjoint binary relations), such that $i\\in\n\\varepsilon_{(T,\\lambda)}(x,y)$ (or equivalently $(x,y)\\in R_i$) with $x,y\\in\nX$, if and only if there is at least one edge with color $i$ from\n$\\mathrm{lca}(x,y)$ to $y$.\n  The central question considered here: Is a given map $\\varepsilon$ a Fitch\nmap, i.e., is there there an edge-labeled tree $(T,\\lambda)$ with\n$\\varepsilon_{(T,\\lambda)} = \\varepsilon$, and thus explains $\\varepsilon$?\nHere, we provide a characterization of Fitch maps in terms of certain\nneighborhoods and forbidden submaps. Further restrictions of Fitch maps are\nconsidered. Moreover, we show that the least-resolved tree explaining a Fitch\nmap is unique (up to isomorphism). In addition, we provide a polynomial-time\nalgorithm to decide whether $\\varepsilon$ is a Fitch map and, in the\naffirmative case, to construct the (up to isomorphism) unique least-resolved\ntree $(T^*,\\lambda^*)$ that explains $\\varepsilon$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2019 07:41:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:12:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 16:20:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Hellmuth", "Marc", ""], ["Seemann", "Carsten R.", ""], ["Stadler", "Peter F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.07748", "submitter": "Patrice Ossona de Mendez", "authors": "Jaroslav Nesetril, Patrice Ossona de Mendez, Roman Rabinovich,\n  Sebastian Siebertz", "title": "Linear rankwidth meets stability", "comments": "accepted at SODA 2020 conference. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1909.01564", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Classes with bounded rankwidth are MSO-transductions of trees and classes\nwith bounded linear rankwidth are MSO-transductions of paths.

(Discrete Mathematics, 2019) proved that for any two point sets\n$R$ and $B$ with $|R|=|B|$, the perfect matching that matches points of $R$\nwith points of $B$, and maximizes the total \\emph{squared} Euclidean distance\nof the matched pairs, verifies that all the disks induced by the matching have\na common point. Each pair of matched points $p\\in R$ and $q\\in B$ induces the\ndisk of smallest diameter that covers $p$ and $q$. Following this research\nline, in this paper we consider the perfect matching that maximizes the total\nEuclidean distance. First, we prove that this new matching for $R$ and $B$ does\nnot always ensure the common intersection property of the disks. Second, we\nextend the study of this new matching for sets of $2n$ uncolored points in the\nplane, where a matching is just a partition of the points into $n$ pairs. As\nthe main result, we prove that in this case all disks of the matching do have a\ncommon point. This implies a big improvement on a conjecture of Andy Fingerhut\nin 1995, about a maximum matching of $2n$ points in the plane.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2019 21:06:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bereg", "Sergey", ""], ["Chac\u00f3n-Rivera", "Oscar", ""], ["Flores-Pe\u00f1aloza", "David", ""], ["Huemer", "Clemens", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Lantero", "Pablo", ""], ["Seara", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10765", "submitter": "Sahil Singla", "authors": "Deeparnab Chakrabarty, Yin Tat Lee, Aaron Sidford, Sahil Singla, and\n  Sam Chiu-wai Wong", "title": "Faster Matroid Intersection", "comments": "38 pages.

They play a central\nrole in the study of Symmetric functions, in Representation theory [Sta99], in\nSchubert calculus [LM10] as well as in Enumerative combinatorics [Gas96, Sta84,\nSta99]. In recent years, they have also shown up in various incarnations in\nComputer Science, e.g, Quantum computation [HRTS00, OW15] and Geometric\ncomplexity theory [IP17].\n  However, unlike some other families of symmetric polynomials like the\nElementary Symmetric polynomials, the Power Symmetric polynomials and the\nComplete Homogeneous Symmetric polynomials, the computational complexity of\nsyntactically computing Schur polynomials has not been studied much. In\nparticular, it is not known whether Schur polynomials can be computed\nefficiently by algebraic formulas. In this work, we address this question, and\nshow that unless \\emph{every} polynomial with a small algebraic branching\nprogram (ABP) has a small algebraic formula, there are Schur polynomials that\ncannot be computed by algebraic formula of polynomial size. In other words,\nunless the algebraic complexity class $\\mathrm{VBP}$ is equal to the complexity\nclass $\\mathrm{VF}$, there exist Schur polynomials which do not have polynomial\nsize algebraic formulas.\n  As a consequence of our proof, we also show that computing the determinant of\ncertain \\emph{generalized} Vandermonde matrices is essentially as hard as\ncomputing the general symbolic determinant. To the best of our knowledge, these\nare one of the first hardness results of this kind for families of polynomials\nwhich are not \\emph{multilinear}. A key ingredient of our proof is the study of\ncomposition of \\emph{well behaved} algebraically independent polynomials with a\nhomogeneous polynomial, and might be of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 04:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chaugule", "Prasad", ""], ["Kumar", "Mrinal", ""], ["Limaye", "Nutan", ""], ["Mohapatra", "Chandra Kanta", ""], ["She", "Adrian", ""], ["Srinivasan", "Srikanth", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.13172", "submitter": "Sergiy Vorobyov A.", "authors": "Mohammad Neinavaie and Mostafa~Derakhtian and Sergiy A.
