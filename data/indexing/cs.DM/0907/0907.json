Using the grid-like minors, we introduce\nthe notion of a perfect bramble and an algorithm to find one in polynomial\ntime. Perfect brambles are brambles with a particularly simple structure and\nthey also provide us with a subgraph that has bounded degree and still large\ntreewidth; we use them to obtain a meta-theorem on deciding certain\nparameterized subgraph-closed problems on general graphs in time singly\nexponential in the parameter.\n  The second part of our work deals with providing a lower bound to Courcelle's\nfamous theorem, stating that every graph property that can be expressed by a\nsentence in monadic second-order logic (MSO), can be decided by a linear time\nalgorithm on classes of graphs of bounded treewidth. Using our results from the\nfirst part of our work we establish a strong lower bound for tractability of\nMSO on classes of colored graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2009 13:45:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kreutzer", "Stephan", ""], ["Tazari", "Siamak", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.3200", "submitter": "Yong-Hyuk Kim", "authors": "Yourim Yoon, Yong-Hyuk Kim, Alberto Moraglio, Byung-Ro Moon", "title": "A Mathematical Unification of Geometric Crossovers Defined on Phenotype\n  Space", "comments": "20 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Geometric crossover is a representation-independent definition of crossover\nbased on the distance of the search space interpreted as a metric space.
