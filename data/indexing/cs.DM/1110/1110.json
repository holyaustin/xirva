In contrast, a dominant line\nof work in the theory of voting over the past 15 years has considered a\ndifferent kind of scenario, also fundamental to voting, in which there is a\ngenuinely \"best\" outcome that voters would agree on if they only had enough\ninformation. This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet\nJury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want\nto reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the\navailable evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve\nthe company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different\noptions.\n  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a\n{\\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option\nis best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,\nwhich tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to\narrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough\nto achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for\noptions in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct\noption receives the greatest number of votes with high probability. We show\nfurther, however, that any process for achieving this is inherently expensive\nin the number of voters it requires: succeeding in identifying the correct\noption with probability at least $1 - \\eta$ requires $\\Omega(n^3 \\epsilon^{-2}\n\\log \\eta^{-1})$ voters, where $n$ is the number of options and $\\epsilon$ is a\ndistributional measure of the minimum difference between the options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Oct 2011 03:22:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chierichetti", "Flavio", ""], ["Kleinberg", "Jon", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1964", "submitter": "Karol Suchan", "authors": "Lukasz Kowalik, Marcin Pilipczuk, Karol Suchan", "title": "Towards optimal kernel for connected vertex cover in planar graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the parameterized complexity of the connected version of the vertex\ncover problem, where the solution set has to induce a connected subgraph.\nAlthough this problem does not admit a polynomial kernel for general graphs\n(unless NP is a subset of coNP/poly), for planar graphs Guo and Niedermeier\n[ICALP'08] showed a kernel with at most 14k vertices, subsequently improved by\nWang et al.

In this paper we present some theoretical\nand empirical results on the existence of acyclic USOs for which the various\nhistory based pivot rules can be made to follow a Hamiltonian path. In\nparticular, we develop an algorithm that can enumerate all such paths up to\ndimension 6 using efficient pruning techniques. We show that Zadeh's original\nrule admits Hamiltonian paths up to dimension 9 at least, and prove that most\nof the other rules do not for all dimensions greater than 5.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2011 17:57:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2012 15:19:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Aoshima", "Yoshikazu", ""], ["Avis", "David", ""], ["Deering", "Theresa", ""], ["Matsumoto", "Yoshitake", ""], ["Moriyama", "Sonoko", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3078", "submitter": "Hiroyuki Miyata", "authors": "David Avis, Hiroyuki Miyata, Sonoko Moriyama", "title": "Families of polytopal digraphs that do not satisfy the shelling property", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A polytopal digraph $G(P)$ is an orientation of the skeleton of a convex\npolytope $P$. The possible non-degenerate pivot operations of the simplex\nmethod in solving a linear program over $P$ can be represented as a special\npolytopal digraph known as an LP digraph. Presently there is no general\ncharacterization of which polytopal digraphs are LP digraphs, although four\nnecessary properties are known: acyclicity, unique sink orientation(USO), the\nHolt-Klee property and the shelling property. The shelling property was\nintroduced by Avis and Moriyama (2009), where two examples are given in $d=4$\ndimensions of polytopal digraphs satisfying the first three properties but not\nthe shelling property. The smaller of these examples has $n=7$ vertices. Avis,\nMiyata and Moriyama(2009) constructed for each $d \\ge 4$ and $n \\ge d+2$, a\n$d$-polytope $P$ with $n$ vertices which has a polytopal digraph which is an\nacyclic USO that satisfies the Holt-Klee property, but does not satisfy the\nshelling property. The construction was based on a minimal such example, which\nhas $d=4$ and $n=6$. In this paper we explore the shelling condition further.\nFirst we give an apparently stronger definition of the shelling property, which\nwe then prove is equivalent to the original definition. Using this stronger\ncondition we are able to give a more general construction of such families. In\nparticular, we show that given any 4-dimensional polytope $P$ with $n_0$\nvertices whose unique sink is simple, we can extend $P$ for any $d \\ge 4$ and\n$n \\ge n_0 + d-4$ to a $d$-polytope with these properties that has $n$\nvertices. Finally we investigate the strength of the shelling condition for\n$d$-crosspolytopes, for which Develin (2004) has given a complete\ncharacterization of LP orientations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2011 21:52:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2012 05:18:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Avis", "David", ""], ["Miyata", "Hiroyuki", ""], ["Moriyama", "Sonoko", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3211", "submitter": "Tillmann Miltzow", "authors": "Tillmann Miltzow", "title": "Tron, a combinatorial Game on abstract Graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM cs.GT math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the combinatorial two-player game Tron.

We consider the\nfollowing parameterized version of MaxLin2: decide whether there is an\nassignment satisfying equations of total weight at least $W-k$, where $k$ is a\nnonnegative parameter. We prove that this parameterized problem is W[1]-hard\neven if each equation of $S$ has exactly three variables and every variable\nappears in exactly three equations and, moreover, each weight $w_j$ equals 1\nand no two equations have the same left-hand side. We show the tightness of\nthis result by proving that if each equation has at most two variables then the\nparameterized problem is fixed-parameter tractable.

Computationally,\nthis problem is addressed as a linear optimization problem over the \"flux\ncone\". The prior construction of the flux cone is computationally expensive and\nno polynomial-time algorithms are known. Results: Here we show that the output\nmaximization problem in chemical reaction networks is NP-complete. This\nstatement remains true even if all reactions are monomolecular or bimolecular\nand if only a single molecular species is used as influx. As a corollary we\nshow, furthermore, that the detection of autocatalytic species, i.e., types\nthat can only be produced from the influx material when they are present in the\ninitial reaction mixture, is an NP-complete computational problem. Conclusions:\nHardness results on combinatorial problems and optimization problems are\nimportant to guide the development of computational tools for the analysis of\nmetabolic networks in particular and chemical reaction networks in general. Our\nresults indicate that efficient heuristics and approximate algorithms need to\nbe employed for the analysis of large chemical networks since even conceptually\nsimple flow problems are provably intractable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2011 11:15:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Andersen", "Jakob L.", ""], ["Flamm", "Christoph", ""], ["Merkle", "Daniel", ""], ["Stadler", "Peter F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6143", "submitter": "Louis D'Alotto", "authors": "Louis D'Alotto", "title": "Cellular Automata Using Infinite Computations", "comments": "Paper Accepted for Publication in Applied Mathematics and\n  Computation, Elsevier", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an application of the Infinite Unit Axiom, introduced by\nYaroslav Sergeyev, (see [11] - [14]) to the development of one-dimensional\ncellular automata.

Polymatroidal networks were introduced by Lawler and Martel and\nHassin in the single-commodity setting and are closely related to the\nsubmodular flow model of Edmonds and Giles; the well-known maxflow-mincut\ntheorem holds in this more general setting. Polymatroidal networks for the\nmulticommodity case have not, as far as the authors are aware, been previously\nexplored. Our work is primarily motivated by applications to information flow\nin wireless networks. We also consider the notion of undirected polymatroidal\nnetworks and observe that they provide a natural way to generalize flows and\ncuts in edge and node capacitated undirected networks.\n  We establish poly-logarithmic flow-cut gap results in several scenarios that\nhave been previously considered in the standard network flow models where\ncapacities are on the edges or nodes. Our results have already found\naplications in wireless network information flow and we anticipate more in the\nfuture. On the technical side our key tools are the formulation and analysis of\nthe dual of the flow relaxations via continuous extensions of submodular\nfunctions, in particular the Lov\\'asz extension. For directed graphs we rely on\na simple yet useful reduction from polymatroidal networks to standard networks.\nFor undirected graphs we rely on the interplay between the Lov\\'asz extension\nof a submodular function and line embeddings with low average distortion\nintroduced by Matousek and Rabinovich; this connection is inspired by, and\ngeneralizes, the work of Feige, Hajiaghayi and Lee on node-capacitated\nmulticommodity flows and cuts. The applicability of embeddings to polymatroidal\nnetworks is of independent mathematical interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2011 15:30:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chekuri", "Chandra", ""], ["Kannan", "Sreeram", ""], ["Raja", "Adnan", ""], ["Viswanath", "Pramod", ""]]}]
