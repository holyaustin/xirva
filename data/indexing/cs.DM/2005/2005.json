Many\nvariants of the TSP, such as those with neighborhoods, with forbidden\nneighborhoods, with time-windows and with profits, can all be framed under this\nconstruct. In sharp contrast to their discrete-optimization counterparts, the\nmodeling constructs presented in this paper represent a fundamentally new\ndomain of analysis and computation for TSPs and their variants. Beyond its\napparent mathematical unification of a class of problems in graph theory, the\nmain advantage of the new approach is that it facilitates the modeling of\ncertain application-specific problems in their home space of measurable\nfunctions. Consequently, certain elements of economic system theory such as\ndynamical models and continuous-time cost/profit functionals can be directly\nincorporated in the new optimization problem formulation. Furthermore, subtour\nelimination constraints, prevalent in discrete optimization formulations, are\nnaturally enforced through continuity requirements. The price for the new\nmodeling framework is nonsmooth functionals.

We show that an\nRNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum\nKnapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions.
