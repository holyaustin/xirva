Generalization of this measure to three genomes is known as the\nmedian score (while a resulting genome is called median genome). In contrast to\nthe rearrangement distance between two genomes which can be computed in linear\ntime, computing the median score for three genomes is NP-hard. This inspires a\nquest for simpler and faster approximations for the median score, the most\nnatural of which appears to be the halved sum of pairwise distances which in\nfact represents a lower bound for the median score.\n  In this work, we study relationship and interplay of pairwise distances\nbetween three genomes and their median score under the model of\nDouble-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) rearrangements. Most remarkably we show that while a\nrearrangement may change the sum of pairwise distances by at most 2 (and thus\nchange the lower bound by at most 1), even the most \"powerful\" rearrangements\nin this respect that increase the lower bound by 1 (by moving one genome\nfarther away from each of the other two genomes), which we call strong, do not\nnecessarily affect the median score. This observation implies that the two\nmeasures are not as well-correlated as one's intuition may suggest.\n  We further prove that the median score attains the lower bound exactly on the\ntriples of genomes that can be obtained from a single genome with strong\nrearrangements. While the sum of pairwise distances with the factor 2/3\nrepresents an upper bound for the median score, its tightness remains unclear.\nNonetheless, we show that the difference of the median score and its lower\nbound is not bounded by a constant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 08:20:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:54:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Aganezov,", "Sergey", "Jr."], ["Alekseyev", "Max A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0142", "submitter": "Stefan Kratsch", "authors": "Stefan Kratsch and Pascal Schweitzer", "title": "Graph Isomorphism for Graph Classes Characterized by two Forbidden\n  Induced Subgraphs", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures.

Graph grammar rules are most naturally employed to model elementary\nreactions like merging, splitting, and isomerisation of molecules.

We use\na generic approach for composing graph grammar rules to define a chemically\nuseful rule compositions. We iteratively apply these rule compositions to\nelementary transformations in order to automatically infer complex\ntransformation patterns. This is useful for instance to understand the net\neffect of complex catalytic cycles such as the Formose reaction. The\nautomatically inferred graph grammar rule is a generic representative that also\ncovers the overall reaction pattern of the Formose cycle, namely two carbonyl\ngroups that can react with a bound glycolaldehyde to a second glycolaldehyde.\nRule composition also can be used to study polymerization reactions as well as\nmore complicated iterative reaction schemes.

In contrast to\nexisting algorithms, this approach yields a geometric Morse-Smale complex that\nconverges almost surely to its continuous counterpart when the image resolution\nis increased. This approach is motivated using basic ideas from probability\ntheory and builds upon an algorithm from discrete Morse theory with a strong\nmathematical foundation. While a formal proof is only hinted at, we do provide\na thorough numerical evaluation of our method and compare it to established\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 15:19:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Reininghaus", "Jan", ""], ["G\u00fcnther", "David", ""], ["Hotz", "Ingrid", ""], ["Weinkauf", "Tino", ""], ["Seidel", "Hans Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6589", "submitter": "Kristan Temme", "authors": "Kristan Temme and Pawel Wocjan", "title": "Efficient Computation of the Permanent of Block Factorizable Matrices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an efficient algorithm for computing the permanent for matrices of\nsize N that can written as a product of L block diagonal matrices with blocks\nof size at most 2. For fixed L, the time and space resources scale linearly in\nN, with a prefactor that scales exponentially in L. This class of matrices\ncontains banded matrices with banded inverse. We show that such a factorization\ninto a product of block diagonal matrices gives rise to a circuit acting on a\nHilbert space with a tensor product structure and that the permanent is equal\nto the transition amplitude of this circuit and a product basis state. In this\ncorrespondence, a block diagonal matrix gives rise to one layer of the circuit,\nwhere each block to a gate acting either on a single tensor component or on two\nadjacent tensor components. This observation allows us to adopt matrix product\nstates, a computational method from condensed matter physics and quantum\ninformation theory used to simulate quantum systems, to evaluate the transition\namplitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 19:43:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Temme", "Kristan", ""], ["Wocjan", "Pawel", ""]]}]
