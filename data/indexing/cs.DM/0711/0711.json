We consider the problem of deciding whether a\ngiven directed graph D has an out-branching with at least k leaves (Directed\nSpanning k-Leaf). We prove that this problem is fixed parameter tractable, when\nk is chosen as the parameter. Previously this was only known for restricted\nclasses of directed graphs.\n  The main new ingredient in our approach is a lemma that shows that given a\nlocally optimal out-branching of a directed graph in which every arc is part of\nat least one out-branching, either an out-branching with at least k leaves\nexists, or a path decomposition with width O(k^3) can be found. This enables a\ndynamic programming based algorithm of running time 2^{O(k^3 \\log k)} n^{O(1)},\nwhere n=|V(D)|.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Nov 2007 17:05:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bonsma", "Paul", ""], ["Dorn", "Frederic", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4324", "submitter": "Jinshan Zhang", "authors": "Jinshan Zhang", "title": "Report on \"American Option Pricing and Hedging Strategies\"", "comments": "14pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.DM", "license": null, "abstract": "  This paper mainly discusses the American option's hedging strategies via\nbinomialmodel and the basic idea of pricing and hedging American option.\nAlthough the essential scheme of hedging is almost the same as European option,\nsmall differences may arise when simulating the process for American option\nholder has more rights, spelling that the option can be exercised at anytime\nbefore its maturity.
