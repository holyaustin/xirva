Edit distance is most commonly\nencountered within the context of strings, where Wagner and Fischer's string\nedit distance is perhaps the most well-known.

For example, there are several edit distance measures for\npermutations, including Wagner and Fischer's string edit distance since a\npermutation is a special case of a string. However, another edit distance for\npermutations is Kendall tau distance, which is the number of pairwise element\ninversions.

There exist multiple\nextensions of Kendall tau distance from total rankings (permutations) to\npartial rankings (i.e., where multiple elements may have the same rank), but\nnone of these are suitable for computing distance between sequences.

Once the problem is expressed as a finite set\nof constraints, the goal is to find the variables' values satisfying them. Even\nthough the problem is in general NP-complete, there are some approximation and\npractical techniques to tackle its intractability. One of the most widely used\ntechniques is the Constraint Propagation. It consists in explicitly excluding\nvalues or combination of values for some variables whenever they make a given\nsubset of constraints unsatisfied. In this paper, we deal with a CSP subclass\nwhich we call 4-CSP and whose constraint network infers relations of the form:\n$\\{ x \\sim \\alpha, x-y \\sim \\beta , (x-y) - (z-t) \\sim \\lambda \\}$, where $x,\ny, z$ and $t$ are real variables, $\\alpha , \\beta$ and $ \\lambda $ are real\nconstants and $ \\sim \\in \\{\\leq , \\geq \\} $. The paper provides the first\ngraph-based proofs of the 4-CSP tractability and elaborates algorithms for\n4-CSP resolution based on the positive linear dependence theory, the hypergraph\nclosure and the constraint propagation technique.
