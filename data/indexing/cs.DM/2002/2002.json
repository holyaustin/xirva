A dominating\nset $S$ is an Isolate Dominating Set} (IDS) if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ has\nat least one isolated vertex. It is known that Isolate Domination Decision\nproblem (IDOM) is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we extend\nthis by showing that the IDOM is NP-complete for split graphs and perfect\nelimination bipartite graphs, a subclass of bipartite graphs. A set $S\n\\subseteq V$ is an independent set if G[S] has no edge.

In addition, we initiate the study of a new\ndomination parameter called, independent secure domination. A set $S\\subseteq\nV$ is an Independent Secure Dominating Set (InSDS) if $S$ is an independent set\nand a secure dominating set of $G$. The minimum size of an InSDS in $G$ is\ncalled the independent secure domination number of $G$ and is denoted by\n$\\gamma_{is}(G)$. Given a graph $ G$ and a positive integer $ k,$ the InSDM\nproblem is to check whether $ G $ has an independent secure dominating set of\nsize at most $ k.$ We prove that InSDM is NP-complete for bipartite graphs and\nlinear time solvable for bounded tree-width graphs and threshold graphs, a\nsubclass of split graphs. The MInSDS problem is to find an independent secure\ndominating set of minimum size, in the input graph.
