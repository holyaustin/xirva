For a positive\ninteger $t$, $P_t$ is the chordless path on $t$ vertices. A paraglider is the\ngraph that consists of a chorless cycle $C_4$ plus a vertex adjacent to three\nvertices of the $C_4$. In this paper, we study the structure of ($P_5$,\nparaglider)-free graphs, and show that every such graph $G$ satisfies\n$\\chi(G)\\le \\lceil \\frac{3}{2}\\omega(G) \\rceil$, where $\\chi(G)$ and\n$\\omega(G)$ are the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively.\nOur bound is attained by the complement of the Clebsch graph on 16 vertices.\nMore strongly, we completely characterize all the ($P_5$, paraglider)-free\ngraphs $G$ that satisfies $\\chi(G)> \\frac{3}{2}\\omega(G)$. We also construct an\ninfinite family of ($P_5$, paraglider)-free graphs such that every graph $G$ in\nthe family has $\\chi(G)=\\lceil \\frac{3}{2}\\omega(G) \\rceil-1$.

We study an optimal scheduling problem that\narises in this context. This problem has two key features. First, multiple\ncells must be scheduled simultaneously for efficient operation. Second, the\ninterplay between the time-varying wireless interface rates and the fixed\ncapacity PON needs to be handled efficiently. In this paper, we take a\ncomprehensive look at this resource allocation problem by formulating it as a\nutility-maximization problem. Using combinatorial techniques, we derive useful\nstructural properties of the optimal allocation and utilize these results to\ndesign polynomial-time approximation algorithms and a pseudopolynomial-time\noptimal algorithm.
