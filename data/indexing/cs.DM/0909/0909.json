For\nbottleneck congestion games in networks, we identify cases in which the\npotential function associated with the LIP leads to polynomial time algorithms\ncomputing a strong Nash equilibrium.

This leaves open the\npossibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.\n  The set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: Given\n$G(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\\Lambda$ of\nthe graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\\Lambda$. Then we show that\nthe effect of this change on the marginals of Gibbs distribution, diminishes as\nwe move away from $\\Lambda$. Our approach is novel and suggests a new context\nfor the study of deterministic counting algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 21:41:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Apr 2010 16:22:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 16:12:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 19:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Efthymiou", "Charilaos", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.5654", "submitter": "Tamal Dey", "authors": "Tamal K.

In this paper we present an algorithm to compute a\nset of loops from a point data that presumably sample a smooth manifold\n$M\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. These loops approximate a {\\em shortest} basis of the\none dimensional homology group $H_1(M)$ over coefficients in finite field\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Previous results addressed the issue of computing the rank of\nthe homology groups from point data, but there is no result on approximating\nthe shortest basis of a manifold from its point sample. In arriving our result,\nwe also present a polynomial time algorithm for computing a shortest basis of\n$H_1(K)$ for any finite {\\em simplicial complex} $K$ whose edges have\nnon-negative weights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2009 16:26:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2009 21:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Tamal K.", ""], ["Sun", "Jian", ""], ["Wang", "Yusu", ""]]}]
