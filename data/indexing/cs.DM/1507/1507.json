With respect to\nrouting networks, route hijacking has highlighted the need to reexamine the\nexisting protocols that govern traffic routing. In particular, our pri- mary\nquestion is how the topology of a network affects the susceptibility of a\nrouting protocol to endogenous route misdirection. In this paper we define and\nanalyze an abstract model of traffic interception (i.e. eavesdropping) in\ndistance-vector routing networks. Specifically, we study al- gorithms that\nmeasure the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through\ntheir infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their\nintended destinations. We relate two variants of our model based on the allowed\nkinds of lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in\nspecial cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring\nstrategy for subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this\nstrategy to the general case. Finally, we use our results to analyze the\nsusceptibility of real and synthetic networks to endogenous traffic\ninterception. In the Autonomous Systems (AS) graph of the United States, we\nshow that compromising only 18 random nodes in the AS graph surprisingly\ncaptures 10% of all traffic paths in the network in expectation when a\ndistance-vector routing protocol is in use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2015 16:44:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 17:39:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 21:32:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Burstein", "David", ""], ["Kenter", "Franklin", ""], ["Kun", "Jeremy", ""], ["Shi", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.05461", "submitter": "Benjamin L\\'ev\\^eque", "authors": "Vincent Despr\\'e, Daniel Gon\\c{c}alves, Benjamin L\\'ev\\^eque", "title": "Encoding toroidal triangulations", "comments": "41 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CG math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Poulalhon and Schaeffer introduced an elegant method to linearly encode a\nplanar triangulation optimally.

Partially linked to its\nnumerous applications in mechanism design, substantial interest arose also in\nthe study of nonlinear versions of MSP, with a focus on the submodular matroid\nsecretary problem (SMSP). So far, O(1)-competitive algorithms have been\nobtained for SMSP over some basic matroid classes. This created some hope that,\nanalogously to the matroid secretary conjecture, one may even obtain\nO(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over any matroid. However, up to now, most\nquestions related to SMSP remained open, including whether SMSP may be\nsubstantially more difficult than MSP; and more generally, to what extend MSP\nand SMSP are related.\n  Our goal is to address these points by presenting general black-box\nreductions from SMSP to MSP. In particular, we show that any O(1)-competitive\nalgorithm for MSP, even restricted to a particular matroid class, can be\ntransformed in a black-box way to an O(1)-competitive algorithm for SMSP over\nthe same matroid class. This implies that the matroid secretary conjecture is\nequivalent to the same conjecture for SMSP. Hence, in this sense SMSP is not\nharder than MSP. Also, to find O(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over a\nparticular matroid class, it suffices to consider MSP over the same matroid\nclass. Using our reductions we obtain many first and improved O(1)-competitive\nalgorithms for SMSP over various matroid classes by leveraging known algorithms\nfor MSP. Moreover, our reductions imply an O(loglog(rank))-competitive\nalgorithm for SMSP, thus, matching the currently best asymptotic algorithm for\nMSP, and substantially improving on the previously best\nO(log(rank))-competitive algorithm for SMSP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 05:28:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Feldman", "Moran", ""], ["Zenklusen", "Rico", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08705", "submitter": "Peter Lofgren", "authors": "Peter Lofgren, Siddhartha Banerjee, Ashish Goel", "title": "Bidirectional PageRank Estimation: From Average-Case to Worst-Case", "comments": "Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph (WAW) 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new algorithm for estimating the Personalized PageRank (PPR)\nbetween a source and target node on undirected graphs, with sublinear\nrunning-time guarantees over the worst-case choice of source and target nodes.\nOur work builds on a recent line of work on bidirectional estimators for PPR,\nwhich obtained sublinear running-time guarantees but in an average-case sense,\nfor a uniformly random choice of target node.
