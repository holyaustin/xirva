We prove that any simple\nundirected graph G=(V, E) admits an expansion G'=(V', E') with the maximum\ndegree <= 3 and treewidth(G') <= treewidth(G)+1. Furthermore, such an expansion\nwill have no more than 2|E|+|V| vertices and 3|E| edges; it can be computed\nefficiently from a tree-decomposition of G. We also construct a family of\nexamples for which the increase by 1 in treewidth cannot be avoided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 19:56:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Markov", "Igor", "", "University of Michigan"], ["Shi", "Yaoyun", "", "University of\n  Michigan"]]}, {"id": "0707.4104", "submitter": "Jean Mairesse", "authors": "Moez Draief (LIAFA), Jean Mairesse (LIAFA), Neil O'Connell (WMI)", "title": "Queues, stores, and tableaux", "comments": "Conference version of the paper: \"Joint Burke's theorem and RSK\n  representation for a queue and a store\" (with M.
