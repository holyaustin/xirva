A bipartite matching is unstable if some man-woman pair is blocking:\nboth strictly prefer each other to their partner in the matching. Stability is\nan important economics concept in matching markets from the viewpoint of\nmanipulability. The unicity of a stable matching implies non-manipulability,\nand near-unicity implies limited manipulability, thus these are mathematical\nproperties related to the quality of stable matching algorithms.\n  This paper is a theoretical study of the effect of correlations on\napproximate manipulability of stable matching algorithms. Our approach is to go\nbeyond worst case, assuming that some of the input preference lists are drawn\nfrom a distribution. Our model encompasses a discrete probabilistic process\ninspired by a popularity model introduced by Immorlica and Mahdian, that\nprovides a way to capture correlation between preference lists. Approximate\nmanipulability is approached from several angles : when all stable partners of\na person have approximately the same rank; or when most persons have a unique\nstable partner. Another quantity of interest is a person's number of stable\npartners. Our results aim to paint a picture of the manipulability of stable\nmatchings in a ``beyond worst case'' setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2019 08:49:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2020 16:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 18:10:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Gimbert", "Hugo", ""], ["Mathieu", "Claire", ""], ["Mauras", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.04791", "submitter": "David Wood", "authors": "Vida Dujmovi\\'c, Gwena\\\"el Joret, Piotr Micek, Pat Morin, Torsten\n  Ueckerdt, David R.

The group search time is defined as\nthe worst-case time as a function of $d$, the distance of the exit from the\norigin, when both robots can reach the exit. It has long been known that for a\nsingle robot traveling at unit speed, the search time is at least $9d-o(d)$. It\nwas shown recently that $k\\geq2$ robots traveling at unit speed also require at\nleast $9d$ group search time.\n  We investigate energy-time trade-offs in group search by two robots, where\nthe energy loss experienced by a robot traveling a distance $x$ at constant\nspeed $s$ is given by $s^2 x$. Specifically, we consider the problem of\nminimizing the total energy used by the robots, under the constraints that the\nsearch time is at most a multiple $c$ of the distance $d$ and the speed of the\nrobots is bounded by $b$. Motivation for this study is that for the case when\nrobots must complete the search in $9d$ time with maximum speed one, a single\nrobot requires at least $9d$ energy, while for two robots, all previously\nproposed algorithms consume at least $28d/3$ energy.\n  When the robots have bounded memory, we generalize existing algorithms to\nobtain a family of optimal (and in some cases nearly optimal) algorithms\nparametrized by pairs of $b,c$ values that can solve the problem for the entire\nspectrum of these pairs for which the problem is solvable. We also propose a\nnovel search algorithm, with unbounded memory, that simultaneously achieves\nsearch time $9d$ and consumes energy $8.42588d$. Our result shows that two\nrobots can search on the line in optimal time $9d$ while consuming less total\nenergy than a single robot within the same search time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Apr 2019 03:57:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Czyzowicz", "Jurek", ""], ["Georgiou", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Killick", "Ryan", ""], ["Kranakis", "Evangelos", ""], ["Krizanc", "Danny", ""], ["Lafond", "Manuel", ""], ["Narayanan", "Lata", ""], ["Opatrny", "Jaroslav", ""], ["Shende", "Sunil", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.10011", "submitter": "Nicolas Bitar", "authors": "Nicolas Bitar, Eric Goles, Pedro Montealegre", "title": "Computational Complexity of Biased Diffusion Limited Aggregation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) is a cluster-growth model that consists\nin a set of particles that are sequentially aggregated over a two-dimensional\ngrid.
