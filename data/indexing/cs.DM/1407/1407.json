Triangles can have\nimportant interpretations in real-world graphs, especially social and other\ninteraction networks. Despite the lack of provably efficient (linear, or\nslightly super-linear) worst-case algorithms for this problem, practitioners\nrun simple, efficient heuristics to find all triangles in graphs with millions\nof vertices. How are these heuristics exploiting the structure of these special\ngraphs to provide major speedups in running time?\n  We study one of the most prevalent algorithms used by practitioners. A\ntrivial algorithm enumerates all paths of length $2$, and checks if each such\npath is incident to a triangle. A good heuristic is to enumerate only those\npaths of length $2$ where the middle vertex has the lowest degree. It is easily\nimplemented and is empirically known to give remarkable speedups over the\ntrivial algorithm.\n  We study the behavior of this algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree\ndistributions, a defining feature of real-world graphs. The erased\nconfiguration model (ECM) efficiently generates a graph with asymptotically\n(almost) any desired degree sequence. We show that the expected running time of\nthis algorithm over the distribution of graphs created by the ECM is controlled\nby the $\\ell_{4/3}$-norm of the degree sequence. Norms of the degree sequence\nare a measure of the heaviness of the tail, and it is precisely this feature\nthat allows non-trivial speedups of simple triangle enumeration algorithms. As\na corollary of our main theorem, we prove expected linear-time performance for\ndegree sequences following a power law with exponent $\\alpha \\geq 7/3$, and\nnon-trivial speedup whenever $\\alpha \\in (2,3)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jul 2014 03:07:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Berry", "Jonathan W.", ""], ["Fostvedt", "Luke A.", ""], ["Nordman", "Daniel J.", ""], ["Phillips", "Cynthia A.", ""], ["Seshadhri", "C.", ""], ["Wilson", "Alyson G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1276", "submitter": "Darko Dimitrov", "authors": "Hosam Abdo, Darko Dimitrov", "title": "Non-regular graphs with minimal total irregularity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The {\\it total irregularity} of a simple undirected graph $G$ is defined as\n${\\rm irr}_t(G) =$ $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{u,v \\in V(G)}$ $\\left| d_G(u)-d_G(v)\n\\right|$, where $d_G(u)$ denotes the degree of a vertex $u \\in V(G)$.\nObviously, ${\\rm irr}_t(G)=0$ if and only if $G$ is regular.

In particular, we provide tile assembly\nalgorithms for the assembly of the discrete Sierpinski triangle and the\ndiscrete Sierpinski carpet within a class of models we term the\n\\emph{$h$-handed assembly model} ($h$-HAM), which generalizes the 2-HAM to\nallow up to $h$ assemblies to combine in a single assembly step. Despite\nsubstantial consideration, no purely growth self-assembly model has yet been\nshown to strictly assemble an infinite fractal without significant modification\nto the fractal shape. In this paper we not only achieve this, but in the case\nof the Sierpinski carpet are able to achieve it within the 2-HAM, one of the\nmost well studied tile assembly models in the literature. Our specific results\nare as follows. We provide a $6$-HAM construction for the Sierpinski triangle\nthat works at scale factor 1, 30 tile types, and assembles the fractal in a\n\\emph{near perfect} way in which all intermediate assemblies are finite-sized\niterations of the recursive fractal. We further assemble the Sierpinski\ntriangle within the $3$-HAM at scale factor 3 and 990 tile types. For the\nSierpinski carpet, we present a $2$-HAM result that works at scale factor 3 and\nuses 1,216 tile types. We further include analysis showing that the aTAM is\nincapable of strictly assembling the non-tree Sierpinski triangle considered in\nthis paper, and that multiple hands are needed for the near-perfect assembly of\nthe Sierpinski triangle and the Sierpinski carpet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2014 22:47:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 May 2015 22:46:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chalk", "Cameron T.", ""], ["Fernandez", "Dominic A.", ""], ["Huerta", "Alejandro", ""], ["Maldonado", "Mario A.", ""], ["Schweller", "Robert T.", ""], ["Sweet", "Leslie", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8031", "submitter": "Michal Kotrb\\v{c}\\'ik", "authors": "Jonathan L.
