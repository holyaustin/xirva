Population zones allocated to each open service\nfacility together creates a stream of demand that follows a Poisson process and\nmay cause congestion at the facility. The service time at each facility is\nstochastic and depends on the service capacity and follows a general\ndistribution that can differ for each facility. The service capacity is\nselected from a given (bounded or unbounded) interval. The objective of our\nproblem is to optimize a balanced performance measure that compromises between\nfacility-induced and customer-related costs. Service times are represented by a\nflexible location-scale stochastic model. The problem is formulated using\nquadratic conic optimization. Valid inequalities and a cut-generation procedure\nare developed to increase computational efficiency. A comprehensive numerical\nstudy is carried out to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution\nprocedure. Moreover, our numerical experiments using real data of a preventive\nhealthcare system in Toronto show that the optimal service network\nconfiguration is highly sensitive to the service-time distribution. Our method\nfor convexifying the waiting-time formulas of M/G/1 queues is general and\nextends the existing convexity results in queueing theory such that they can be\nused in optimization problems where the service rates are continuous.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 23:24:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadi-Javid", "Amir", ""], ["Berman", "Oded", ""], ["Hoseinpour", "Pooya", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00162", "submitter": "Xavier Ouvrard", "authors": "Xavier Ouvrard, Jean-Marie Le Goff and Stephane Marchand-Maillet", "title": "On Adjacency and e-Adjacency in General Hypergraphs: Towards a New\n  e-Adjacency Tensor", "comments": "Preprint submitted to ENDM special journal 2nd IMA Conference on\n  Theoretical and Computational Discrete Mathematics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In graphs, the concept of adjacency is clearly defined: it is a pairwise\nrelationship between vertices.

It is known from \\cite{muller,garey}\nthat HAMILTONIAN CYCLE (PATH) are NP-complete in general graphs and chordal\nbipartite graphs. A convex bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(X,Y)$ and an\nordering $X=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$, is a bipartite graph such that for each $y \\in\nY$, the neighborhood of $y$ in $X$ appears consecutively. $G$ is said to have\nconvexity with respect to $X$. Further, convex bipartite graphs are a subclass\nof chordal bipartite graphs. In this paper, we present a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in convex\nbipartite graphs and further we obtain a linear-time algorithm for this graph\nclass. We also show that Chvatal's necessary condition is sufficient for convex\nbipartite graphs. The closely related problem is HAMILTONIAN PATH whose\ncomplexity is open in convex bipartite graphs. We classify the class of convex\nbipartite graphs as {\\em monotone} and {\\em non-monotone} graphs. For monotone\nconvex bipartite graphs, we present a linear-time algorithm to output a\nHamiltonian path.

It is easy to see that $L = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^k v_i$ for some\nefficiency $\\alpha \\in [\\frac{1}{2},1)$.
