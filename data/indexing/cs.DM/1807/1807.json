The parity constraints\ncan be extended to label constraints in a group-labeled graph, which is a\ndirected graph with each arc labeled by an element of a group. Recently, paths\nand cycles in group-labeled graphs have been investigated, such as packing\nnon-zero paths and cycles, where \"non-zero\" means that the identity element is\na unique forbidden label.\n  In this paper, we present a solution to finding an $s$--$t$ path with two\nlabels forbidden in a group-labeled graph. This also leads to an elementary\nsolution to finding a zero $s$--$t$ path in a ${\\mathbb Z}_3$-labeled graph,\nwhich is the first nontrivial case of finding a zero path. This situation in\nfact generalizes the 2-disjoint paths problem in undirected graphs, which also\nmotivates us to consider that setting. More precisely, we provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm for testing whether there are at most two possible\nlabels of $s$--$t$ paths in a group-labeled graph or not, and finding $s$--$t$\npaths attaining at least three distinct labels if exist. The algorithm is based\non a necessary and sufficient condition for a group-labeled graph to have\nexactly two possible labels of $s$--$t$ paths, which is the main technical\ncontribution of this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2018 02:18:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Apr 2019 04:40:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kawase", "Yasushi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Yusuke", ""], ["Yamaguchi", "Yutaro", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00131", "submitter": "Divya Sindhu Lekha", "authors": "Kannan Balakrishnan, Divya Sindhu Lekha, Manoj Changat, Bijo S.

A weighted subgraph $H$ of a hypergraph\n$G$ on a vertex set $V$ is said to be an $\\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier of $G$\nif $(1-\\epsilon)\\boldsymbol{x}^\\top L_H(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\leq\n\\boldsymbol{x}^\\top L_G(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\leq (1+\\epsilon)\\boldsymbol{x}^\\top\nL_H(\\boldsymbol{x})$ holds for every $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^V$. In this\npaper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an\nundirected/directed hypergraph $G$ on $n$ vertices, constructs an\n$\\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier of $G$ with $O(n^3\\log n/\\epsilon^2)$\nhyperedges/hyperarcs. The proposed spectral sparsification can be used to\nimprove the time and space complexities of algorithms for solving problems that\ninvolve the quadratic form, such as computing the eigenvalues of $L_G$,\ncomputing the effective resistance between a pair of vertices in $G$,\nsemi-supervised learning based on $L_G$, and cut problems on $G$. In addition,\nour sparsification result implies that any submodular function $f\\colon 2^V \\to\n\\mathbb{R}_+$ with $f(\\emptyset)=f(V)=0$ can be concisely represented by a\ndirected hypergraph. Accordingly, we show that, for any distribution, we can\nproperly and agnostically learn submodular functions $f\\colon 2^V \\to [0,1]$\nwith $f(\\emptyset)=f(V)=0$, with $O(n^4\\log (n/\\epsilon) /\\epsilon^4)$ samples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2018 08:32:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Soma", "Tasuku", ""], ["Yoshida", "Yuichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.05044", "submitter": "Michael Schaub", "authors": "Michael T.

Online marketplaces and exchanges allow users across the world to\nconvert between dozens of different cryptocurrencies and regular currencies\nsuch as euros or dollars. Due to the novelty of this concept, the volatility of\nthese markets and the differences in maturity and usage of particular\nmarketplaces, currency pairs may appear at multiple marketplaces but at\ndifferent trading prices. This paper proposes a novel algorithmic approach to\ntake advantage of these mispricings and capitalize upon the pricing differences\nthat exist between exchanges and currency pairs. To do so, we model each\ncombination of a currency and a market as one node in a graph. A directed link\nbetween two nodes indicates that a conversion between these two currency/market\npairs is possible. The weight of the link relates to the exchange rate of\nexecuting this particular currency exchange. To leverage the mispricings, we\nseek for cycles in the graph such that upon multiplying the weights of the\nlinks in the cycle, a value greater than 1 is found and thus a profit can be\nmade. Our goal is to do this efficiently, without exhaustively enumerating all\npossible cycles in the graph. Therefore, we convert our data and address the\nproblem in terms of finding minimum weight triangles in graphs with integer\nweights, for which efficient algorithms can be utilized. We experiment with\nparameter settings (heuristics) related to the conversion of exchange rate data\ninto integer weight values. We show that our approach improves upon a\nreasonable baseline algorithm in terms of computation time. Furthermore, using\na real-world dataset, we demonstrate how the obtained minimal weight cycles\nindeed unveil a number of currency exchange cycles that result in a net profit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2018 08:07:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bortolussi", "Francesco", ""], ["Hoogeboom", "Zeger", ""], ["Takes", "Frank W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.05777", "submitter": "Peter Chini", "authors": "Peter Chini, Rehab Massoud, Roland Meyer, Prakash Saivasan", "title": "Fast Witness Counting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the witness-counting problem: given a set of vectors $V$ in the\n$d$-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, a target vector $t$, and an\ninteger $k$, count all ways to sum-up exactly $k$ different vectors from $V$ to\nreach $t$.

Consensus and diffusion are dual dynamical processes defined on $G$\nby $\\dot x=-{\\cal L}x$ for consensus and $\\dot p=-p{\\cal L}$ for diffusion. We\nconsider both these processes as well their discrete time analogues. We define\na basis of row vectors $\\{\\bar \\gamma_i\\}_{i=1}^k$ of the left null-space of\n${\\cal L}$ and a basis of column vectors $\\{\\gamma_i\\}_{i=1}^k$ of the right\nnull-space of ${\\cal L}$ in terms of the partition of $G$ into strongly\nconnected components. This allows for complete characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of both diffusion and consensus --- discrete and continuous\n--- in terms of these eigenvectors.\n  As an application of these ideas, we present a treatment of the pagerank\nalgorithm that is dual to the usual one. We further show that the teleporting\nfeature usually included in the algorithm is not strictly necessary.\n  This is a complete and self-contained treatment of the asymptotics of\nconsensus and diffusion on digraphs. Many of the ideas presented here can be\nfound scattered in the literature, though mostly outside mainstream mathematics\nand not always with complete proofs. This paper seeks to remedy this by\nproviding a compact and accessible survey.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 20:45:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Veerman", "J.
