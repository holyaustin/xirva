Using this\nanalysis, we characterize the loss of accuracy (in a probabilistic setting)\nbetween multiple temporal graph models, ranging from one that preserves all the\ntemporal ordering information for the purpose of computing temporal graph\nproperties to one that collapses various snapshots into one graph (an operation\ncalled smashing), with multiple intermediate variants.
