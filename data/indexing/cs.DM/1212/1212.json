The paper analyzes this\nframework, by focusing in particular on \"minimal\" tree projections, that is, on\ntree projections without useless redundancies. First, it is shown that minimal\ntree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for\nnormal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In\nparticular, they enjoy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree\ndecompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the\nnegative answer that is provided to the open question about whether they enjoy\na slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the\ncomputation of hypertree decompositions. Second, it is shown that tree\nprojections admit a natural game-theoretic characterization in terms of the\nCaptain and Robber game. In this game, as for the Robber and Cops game\ncharacterizing tree decompositions, the existence of winning strategies implies\nthe existence of monotone ones. As a special case, the Captain and Robber game\ncan be used to characterize the generalized hypertree decomposition method,\nwhere such a game-theoretic characterization was missing and asked for.

Of particular importance is the case where f(X)\nis a function of independent random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well\nknown bounded differences inequality (also called McDiarmid's or\nHoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration if the function f\ndoes not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive feature is\nthat it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices to show\nthat |f(X)-f(X')| \\leq c_k whenever X,X' differ only in X_k. While this is easy\nto check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes c_k,\nwhich often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.\n  In this paper we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which\ncan be used to establish concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical\nchanges are small although (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One\nkey aspect of this inequality is that it relies on a simple condition that (a)\nis easy to check and (b) coincides with heuristic considerations why\nconcentration should hold. Indeed, given an event \\Gamma that holds with very\nhigh probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz condition (L) to\nsituations where \\Gamma occurs.
