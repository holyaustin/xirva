We show\nthat if G has balanced separators whose size is smaller than linear by a\npolynomial factor, then G has subexponential expansion. This gives a partial\nconverse to a result of Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. As an\nintermediate step, the proof uses a new kind of graph decompositions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 03:05:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 14:17:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Dvorak", "Zdenek", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7623", "submitter": "Raffaele Mosca", "authors": "Raffaele Mosca", "title": "The stable set polytope of ($P_6$,triangle)-free graphs and new\n  facet-inducing graphs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The stable set polytope of a graph $G$, denoted as STAB($G$), is the convex\nhull of all the incidence vectors of stable sets of $G$. To describe a linear\nsystem which defines STAB($G$) seems to be a difficult task in the general\ncase. In this paper we present a complete description of the stable set\npolytope of ($P_6$,triangle)-free graphs (and more generally of\n($P_6$,paw)-free graphs). For that we combine different tools, in the context\nof a well known result of Chv\\'atal \\cite{Chvatal1975} which allows to focus\njust on prime facet-inducing graphs, with particular reference to a structure\nresult on prime ($P_6$,triangle)-free graphs due to Brandst\\\"adt et al.\n\\cite{BraKleMah2005}. Also we point out some peculiarities of new\nfacet-inducing graphs detected along this study with the help of a software.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 08:18:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mosca", "Raffaele", ""]]}]
