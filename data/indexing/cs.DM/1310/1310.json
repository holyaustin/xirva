More precisely, we first prove that the problem is NP-complete\neven on trees of pathwidth at most three for any fixed budget b>=1. We then\nshow that the problem turns out to be fixed parameter-tractable with respect to\nthe combined parameter \"pathwidth\" and \"maximum degree\" of the input graph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 01:39:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 07:49:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chleb\u00edkov\u00e1", "Janka", ""], ["Chopin", "Morgan", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.2441", "submitter": "Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn", "authors": "Kumar Gaurav (INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, UPMC), Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn\n  (INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt), Holger Paul Keeler (INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt)", "title": "Pioneers of Influence Propagation in Social Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.DM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the growing importance of corporate viral marketing campaigns on online\nsocial networks, the interest in studies of influence propagation through\nnetworks is higher than ever. In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially\ntargets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable\nfraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In\ngeneral, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As\nsuch, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case\nthe campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the\ncampaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by\nenriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide\ninsight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this\nmodel, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them\nhere by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree\ndistributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind\nof benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to\napproximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed\nto have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three\ncases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences\neach of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member\ninfluences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p;\n(3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his\nfriends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the\nclosest approximation of a large online social network, when the information\navailable about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this\nstudy from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness\nof a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant\nstatistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation\ncriterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the\nunderlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign\ncan indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good\npioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in\nsuch a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking\nand targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this\nstrategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase\ngeometrically fast with the number of tries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 11:43:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Gaurav", "Kumar", "", "INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, UPMC"], ["Blaszczyszyn", "Bartlomiej", "", "INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt"], ["Keeler", "Holger Paul", "", "INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "1310.2449", "submitter": "Jos\\'e Luis Ram\\'irez", "authors": "Rodrigo De Castro, Andr\\'es L.

The proof can be generalized to construct, for every $m$, an\nunsplittable $m$-fold covering of the plane with translates of any open convex\nbody $C$ which has a smooth boundary with everywhere {\\em positive curvature}.\nSomewhat surprisingly, {\\em unbounded} open convex sets $C$ do not misbehave,\nthey satisfy the conjecture: every $3$-fold covering of any region of the plane\nby translates of such a set $C$ splits into two coverings. To establish this\nresult, we prove a general coloring theorem for hypergraphs of a special type:\n{\\em shift-chains}. We also show that there is a constant $c>0$ such that, for\nany positive integer $m$, every $m$-fold covering of a region with unit disks\nsplits into two coverings, provided that every point is covered by {\\em at\nmost} $c2^{m/2}$ sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2013 13:02:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2014 11:43:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 16 Mar 2014 19:27:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 13:56:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Pach", "J\u00e1nos", ""], ["P\u00e1lv\u00f6lgyi", "D\u00f6m\u00f6t\u00f6r", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6921", "submitter": "Miguel Romance", "authors": "Regino Criado, Esther Garcia, Francisco Pedroche and Miguel Romance", "title": "Comparing rankings by means of competitivity graphs: structural\n  properties and computation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a new technique to analyze families of rankings\nfocused on the study of structural properties of a new type of graphs.

This allows us to define an undirected graph by connecting\nelements that compete. We call this graph a competitivity graph. We study the\nrelationship of competitivity graphs with other well-known families of graphs,\nsuch as permutation graphs, comparability graphs and chordal graphs. In\naddition to this, we also introduce certain important sets of nodes in a\ncompetitivity graph. For example, nodes that compete among them form a\ncompetitivity set and nodes connected by chains of competitors form a set of\neventual competitors. We analyze hese sets and we show a method to obtain sets\nof eventual competitors directly from a family of rankings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2013 13:56:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2013 12:24:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 10:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Criado", "Regino", ""], ["Garcia", "Esther", ""], ["Pedroche", "Francisco", ""], ["Romance", "Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7004", "submitter": "Josef Cibulka", "authors": "Josef Cibulka, Pu Gao, Marek Kr\\v{c}\\'al, Tom\\'a\\v{s} Valla, Pavel\n  Valtr", "title": "On the Geometric Ramsey Number of Outerplanar Graphs", "comments": "15 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Discrete and Computational Geometry 53 (1): 64-79 (2015)", "doi": "10.1007/s00454-014-9646-x", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove polynomial upper bounds of geometric Ramsey numbers of pathwidth-2\nouterplanar triangulations in both convex and general cases.

The\nneed for real-time analysis of such large graph streams has led to progress on\nlow memory, one-pass streaming graph algorithms. These algorithms were designed\nfor simple graphs, assuming an edge is not repeated in the stream. Real graph\nstreams however, are almost always multigraphs i.e., they contain many\nduplicate edges. The assumption of no repeated edges requires an extra pass\n*storing all the edges* just for deduplication, which defeats the purpose of\nsmall memory algorithms.\n  We describe an algorithm for estimating the triangle count of a multigraph\nstream of edges. We show that all previous streaming algorithms for triangle\ncounting fail for multigraph streams, despite their impressive accuracies for\nsimple graphs. The bias created by duplicate edges is a major problem, and\nleads these algorithms astray. Our algorithm avoids these biases through\ncareful debiasing strategies and has provable theoretical guarantees and\nexcellent empirical performance. Our algorithm builds on the previously\nintroduced wedge sampling methodology.\n  Another challenge in analyzing temporal graphs is finding the right temporal\nwindow size.
