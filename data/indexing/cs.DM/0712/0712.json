This domain\nis the set of what could be called ``representative linear forms'' which are\nthe elements of the algebraic dual which are also representative on the\nmultiplicative semigroup of the algebra. When the algebra is free, this notion\nis indeed equivalent to that of rational functions of automata theory. For the\nsake of applications, the range of coefficients has been considerably\nbroadened, i.e. extended to semirings, so that the results could be specialized\nto the boolean and multiplicity cases. This requires some caution (use of\n``positive formulas'', iteration replacing inversion, stable submodules\nreplacing finite-rank families for instance). For the theory and its\napplications has been created a rational calculus which can, in return, be\napplied to harness Sweedler's duals.

For instance, the following natural\nquestion suggests itself: \\emph{given a finite doubling metric $(V,d)$, is\nthere always an \\underline{unweighted} graph $(V',E')$ with $V\\subseteq V'$\nsuch that the shortest path metric $d'$ on $V'$ is still doubling, and which\nagrees with $d$ on $V$.} This is often useful, given that unweighted graphs are\noften easier to reason about.\n  We show that for any metric space $(V,d)$, there is an \\emph{unweighted}\ngraph $(V',E')$ with shortest-path metric $d':V'\\times V' \\to \\R_{\\geq 0}$ such\nthat\n  -- for all $x,y \\in V$, the distances $d(x,y) \\leq d'(x,y) \\leq (1+\\eps)\n\\cdot d(x,y)$, and\n  -- the doubling dimension for $d'$ is not much more than that of $d$, where\nthis change depends only on $\\e$ and not on the size of the graph.\n  We show a similar result when both $(V,d)$ and $(V',E')$ are restricted to be\ntrees: this gives a simpler proof that doubling trees embed into constant\ndimensional Euclidean space with constant distortion.
