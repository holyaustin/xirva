Our first result is\nstructural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population\nsize tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model\nconverges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the\ncontinued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention.\nWhile the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due\nto the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are\nprohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address\nthis issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our\nstochastic model mixes rapidly.

Given a k-core,\nremove one edge uniformly at random and find its new k-core. We are interested\nin how many vertices are deleted from the original k-core to find the new one.\nThis can be seem as a measure of robustness of the original k-core. We prove\nthat, if the initial k-core is chosen uniformly at random from the k-cores with\nn vertices and m edges, its robustness depends essentially on its average\ndegree c. We prove that, if c converges to k, then the new k-core is empty with\nprobability 1+o(1). We define a constant c(k)' such that when k+epsilon < c <\nc(k)'- epsilon, the new k-core is empty with probability bounded away from zero\nand, if c > c(k)'+ psi with psi = omega(n^{-1/4}), psi(n) > 0 and c is bounded,\nthen the probability that the new k-core has less than n-h(n) vertices goes to\nzero, for every h(n) = omega(1/psi).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2012 23:27:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:47:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sato", "Cristiane M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.2226", "submitter": "Andreas Galanis", "authors": "Andreas Galanis, Daniel Stefankovic and Eric Vigoda", "title": "Inapproximability of the Partition Function for the Antiferromagnetic\n  Ising and Hard-Core Models", "comments": "Journal version (no changes)", "journal-ref": "Combinator.
