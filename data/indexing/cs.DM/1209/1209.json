Smith (1994, 2007) showed that an\nassociation scheme X=(Q,\\Gamma) of order d:=|Q| is Schurian iff X is extensible\nto height (d-2). In this work, we formalize the maximal height t_max(X) of an\nassociation scheme X as the largest positive integer such that X is extensible\nto height t (we also include the possibility t_max(X)=\\infty, which is\nequivalent to t_max(X)\\ge (d-2)).

On input an association scheme X=(Q,\\Gamma) of\norder d:=|Q| and an integer t such that 1\\le t\\le (d-2), the association scheme\nextension algorithm decides in time d^(O(t)) if the scheme X is extensible to\nheight t. In particular, if t is a fixed constant, then the running time of the\nassociation scheme extension algorithm is polynomial in the order of X.\n  The association scheme extension algorithm is used to show that all\nnon-Schurian association schemes up to order 26 are completely inextensible,\ni.e. they are not extensible to a positive height. Via the tensor product of\nassociation schemes, the latter result gives rise to a multitude of examples of\ninfinite families of completely inextensible association schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2012 18:05:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 13:09:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Arora", "Manuel", ""], ["Zieschang", "Paul-Hermann", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6462", "submitter": "Giorgio Nordo", "authors": "Giorgio Nordo, Angelo Maimone", "title": "A formula for the number of (n-2)-gap in digital n-objects", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a formula that expresses the number of (n-2)-gaps of a generic\ndigital n-object.
