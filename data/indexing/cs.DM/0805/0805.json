A key\nnotable feature of our work that distinguishes it from work in some other\nrelated models, such as the (standard) budget model and the (demand-) robust\nmodel, is that we obtain results in the black-box setting, that is, where one\nis given only sampling access to the underlying distribution. Our first model,\nwhich we call the risk-averse budget model, incorporates the notion of\nrisk-averseness via a probabilistic constraint that restricts the probability\n(according to the underlying distribution) with which the second-stage cost may\nexceed a given budget B to at most a given input threshold \\rho. We also a\nconsider a closely-related model that we call the risk-averse robust model,\nwhere we seek to minimize the first-stage cost and the (1-\\rho)-quantile of the\nsecond-stage cost.\n  We obtain approximation algorithms for a variety of combinatorial\noptimization problems including the set cover, vertex cover, multicut on trees,\nmin cut, and facility location problems, in the risk-averse budget and robust\nmodels with black-box distributions. We obtain near-optimal solutions that\npreserve the budget approximately and incur a small blow-up of the probability\nthreshold (both of which are unavoidable). To the best of our knowledge, these\nare the first approximation results for problems involving probabilistic\nconstraints and black-box distributions. A major component of our results is a\nfully polynomial approximation scheme for solving the LP-relaxation of the\nrisk-averse problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 May 2008 03:57:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Swamy", "Chaitanya", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0514", "submitter": "Jens Zumbr\\\"agel", "authors": "Jens Zumbragel, Gerard Maze, Joachim Rosenthal", "title": "Efficient recovering of operation tables of black box groups and rings", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.GR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  People have been studying the following problem: Given a finite set S with a\nhidden (black box) binary operation * on S which might come from a group law,\nand suppose you have access to an oracle that you can ask for the operation x*y\nof single pairs (x,y) you choose.
