In this\npaper, we investigate in which case the connectivity requirement can be dropped\nto a minimum degree condition. For instance, it was shown in [Bensmail et al.:\nEdge-partitioning a graph into paths: beyond the Barat-Thomassen conjecture.\narXiv:1507.08208] that when T is a path with k edges, there is a constant $d_k$\nsuch that every 24-edge connected graph G with size divisible by k and minimum\ndegree $d_k$ has a T-decomposition. We show in this paper that when F is a\ncoprime forest (the sizes of its components being a coprime set of integers),\nany graph G with sufficiently large minimum degree has an F-decomposition\nprovided that the size of F divides the size of G (no connectivity is\nrequired). A natural conjecture asked in [Bensmail et al.: Edge-partitioning a\ngraph into paths: beyond the Barat-Thomassen conjecture. arXiv:1507.08208]\nasserts that for a fixed tree T, any graph G of size divisible by the size of T\nwith sufficiently high minimum degree has a T-decomposition, provided that G is\nsufficiently highly connected in terms of the maximal degree of T. The case of\nmaximum degree 2 is answered by paths. We provide a counterexample to this\nconjecture in the case of maximum degree 3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2018 21:49:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Klimo\u0161ov\u00e1", "Tereza", ""], ["Thomass\u00e9", "St\u00e9phan", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03833", "submitter": "Pan Li", "authors": "Pan Li and Olgica Milenkovic", "title": "Submodular Hypergraphs: p-Laplacians, Cheeger Inequalities and Spectral\n  Clustering", "comments": "A short version of this paper is presented in ICML 2018.

The study of Gromov hyperbolicity for geodesic metric spaces can be\nreduced to the study of graph hyperbolicity. The main contribution of this\npaper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This\ncharacterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale\nnetwork analysis. A sharp estimate of graph hyperbolicity is useful, e.g., in\nembedding an undirected graph into hyperbolic space with minimum distortion\n[Verbeek and Suri, SoCG'14]. The hyperbolicity of a graph can be computed in\npolynomial-time, however it is unlikely that it can be done in subcubic time.\nThis makes this parameter difficult to compute or to approximate on large\ngraphs. Using our new characterization of graph hyperbolicity, we provide a\nsimple factor 8 approximation algorithm for computing the hyperbolicity of an\n$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ in optimal time $O(n^2)$ (assuming that the input is\nthe distance matrix of the graph). This algorithm leads to constant factor\napproximations of other graph-parameters related to hyperbolicity (thinness,\nslimness, and insize). We also present the first efficient algorithms for exact\ncomputation of these parameters. All of our algorithms can be used to\napproximate the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space.\n  We also show that a similar characterization of hyperbolicity holds for all\ngeodesic metric spaces endowed with a geodesic spanning tree. Along the way, we\nprove that any complete geodesic metric space $(X,d)$ has such a geodesic\nspanning tree.

In this paper\nwe advocate for the thesis that there is a much deeper relationship between\ncomputational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture. Our starting point is\nLinial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability\nis equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are\ninstances of Maximum Section of a Covering Space on graphs. We then observe\nthat the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell,\nFOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We\nfurther prove that inapproximability for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on\n(cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent to the Unique\nGames Conjecture. This gives the first new \"Unique Games-complete\" problem in\nover a decade.\n  Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA\n2010; Disc. Comput. Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that\ntheir question is almost equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main\ndifference is that they ask for inapproximability over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over\n$\\mathbb{Z}/k\\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact\nthat when the structure group $G$ of the covering space is Abelian - or more\ngenerally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering Space\nis the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization.\n  Although our most technically demanding result is an application of Unique\nGames to computational topology, we hope that our observations on the\ntopological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of\nalgebraic topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 04:15:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Grochow", "Joshua A.", ""], ["Tucker-Foltz", "Jamie", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06858", "submitter": "Daniel Wiebking", "authors": "Martin Grohe, Daniel Neuen, Pascal Schweitzer, Daniel Wiebking", "title": "An improved isomorphism test for bounded-tree-width graphs", "comments": "34 pages, 1 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a new fpt algorithm testing isomorphism of $n$-vertex graphs of tree\nwidth $k$ in time $2^{k\\operatorname{polylog} (k)}\\operatorname{poly} (n)$,\nimproving the fpt algorithm due to Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and\nSaurabh (FOCS 2014), which runs in time $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k^5\\log\nk)}\\operatorname{poly} (n)$.

Given two medium-sized scale-free graphs with adjacency matrices $A$ and\n$B$, their Kronecker product graph has adjacency matrix $C = A \\otimes B$. Such\ngraphs are highly compressible: $|{\\cal E}|$ edges are represented in ${\\cal\nO}(|{\\cal E}|^{1/2})$ memory and can be built in a distributed setting from\nsmall data structures, making them easy to share in compressed form. Many\ninteresting graph calculations have worst-case complexity bounds ${\\cal\nO}(|{\\cal E}|^p)$ and often these are reduced to ${\\cal O}(|{\\cal E}|^{p/2})$\nfor Kronecker product graphs, when a Kronecker formula can be derived yielding\nthe sought calculation on $C$ in terms of related calculations on $A$ and $B$.\nWe focus on deriving formulas for triangle participation at vertices, ${\\bf\nt}_C$, a vector storing the number of triangles that every vertex is involved\nin, and triangle participation at edges, $\\Delta_C$, a sparse matrix storing\nthe number of triangles at every edge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2018 00:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sanders", "Geoffrey", ""], ["Pearce", "Roger", ""], ["La Fond", "Timothy", ""], ["Kepner", "Jeremy", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.09576", "submitter": "Lucas Isenmann", "authors": "Daniel Gon\\c{c}alves and Lucas Isenmann", "title": "Dushnik-Miller dimension of TD-Delaunay complexes", "comments": "A short version appears in the proceedings of EuroCG 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  TD-Delaunay graphs, where TD stands for triangular distance, is a variation\nof the classical Delaunay triangulations obtained from a specific convex\ndistance function.
