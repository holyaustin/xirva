We concentrate on maximum flow problems and introduce a novel robust\noptimization model which, compared to known models from the literature,\nfeatures several advantageous properties: (i) We consider a general class of\npath-based flow problems which can be used to model a large variety of network\nrouting problems (and other packing problems). (ii) We aim at solutions that\nare robust against targeted attacks by a potent adversary who may attack any\nflow path of his choice on any edge of the network. (iii) In contrast to\nprevious robust maximum flow models, for which no efficient algorithms are\nknown, optimal robust flows for the most important basic variants of our model\ncan be found in polynomial time.\n  We also consider generalizations where the flow player can spend a budget to\nprotect the network against the interdictor. Here, we show that the problem can\nbe solved efficiently when the interdiction costs are determined by the flow\nplayer from scratch. However, the problem becomes hard to approximate when the\nflow player has to improve an initial protection infrastructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 14:31:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Matuschke", "Jannik", ""], ["McCormick", "S.

One approach is to use Markov\nchains based on edge switches (swaps) that preserve the constraints, are\nirreducible (ergodic) and fast mixing. In 1999, Kannan, Tetali and Vempala\n(KTV) proposed a simple swap Markov chain for sampling graphs with given degree\nsequence and conjectured that it mixes rapidly (in poly-time) for arbitrary\ndegree sequences. While the conjecture is still open, it was proven for special\ndegree sequences, in particular, for those of undirected and directed regular\nsimple graphs, of half-regular bipartite graphs, and of graphs with certain\nbounded maximum degrees. Here we prove the fast mixing KTV conjecture for\nnovel, exponentially large classes of irregular degree sequences. Our method is\nbased on a canonical decomposition of degree sequences into split graph degree\nsequences, a structural theorem for the space of graph realizations and on a\nfactorization theorem for Markov chains.
