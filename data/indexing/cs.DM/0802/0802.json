Its variant called \"Maximum Compatible Tree\" (MCT) is less stringent,\nas it allows the input trees to be refined. Both problems are of particular\ninterest in computational biology, where trees encountered have often small\ndegrees.\n  In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of MAST and MCT with\nrespect to the maximum degree, denoted by D, of the input trees. It is known\nthat MAST is polynomial for bounded D. As a counterpart, we show that the\nproblem is W[1]-hard with respect to parameter D. Moreover, relying on recent\nadvances in parameterized complexity we obtain a tight lower bound: while MAST\ncan be solved in O(N^{O(D)}) time where N denotes the input length, we show\nthat an O(N^{o(D)}) bound is not achievable, unless SNP is contained in SE. We\nalso show that MCT is W[1]-hard with respect to D, and that MCT cannot be\nsolved in O(N^{o(2^{D/2})}) time, SNP is contained in SE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2008 16:18:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2008 01:54:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2008 10:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Guillemot", "Sylvain", ""], ["Nicolas", "Francois", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.0260", "submitter": "Ritabrata Sengupta", "authors": "L.

Variants of\nthese games - defined by the type of moves allowed for the players - have been\nfound to be closely connected to graph decompositions and associated width\nmeasures such as path- or tree-width. Of particular interest is the question\nwhether these games are monotone, i.e. whether the cops can catch a robber\nwithout ever allowing the robber to reach positions that have been cleared\nbefore. The monotonicity problem for graph searching games has intensely been\nstudied in the literature, but for two types of games the problem was left\nunresolved. These are the games on digraphs where the robber is invisible and\nlazy or visible and fast. In this paper, we solve the problems by giving\nexamples showing that both types of games are non-monotone. Graph searching\ngames on digraphs are closely related to recent proposals for digraph\ndecompositions generalising tree-width to directed graphs. These proposals have\npartly been motivated by attempts to develop a structure theory for digraphs\nsimilar to the graph minor theory developed by Robertson and Seymour for\nundirected graphs, and partly by the immense number of algorithmic results\nusing tree-width of undirected graphs and the hope that part of this success\nmight be reproducible on digraphs using a directed tree-width. Unfortunately\nthe number of applications for the digraphs measures introduced so far is still\nsmall. We therefore explore the limits of the algorithmic applicability of\ndigraph decompositions.

When p=1, the task\n(i.e., counting the sum) can be accomplished using a simple counter.\n  Compressed Counting (CC) is proposed for efficiently computing the pth\nfrequency moment of a data stream signal A_t, where 0<p<=2. CC is applicable if\nthe streaming data follow the Turnstile model, with the restriction that at the\ntime t for the evaluation, A_t[i]>= 0, which includes the strict Turnstile\nmodel as a special case. For natural data streams encountered in practice, this\nrestriction is minor.\n  The underly technique for CC is what we call skewed stable random\nprojections, which captures the intuition that, when p=1 a simple counter\nsuffices, and when p = 1+/\\Delta with small \\Delta, the sample complexity of a\ncounter system should be low (continuously as a function of \\Delta). We show at\nsmall \\Delta the sample complexity (number of projections) k = O(1/\\epsilon)\ninstead of O(1/\\epsilon^2).\n  Compressed Counting can serve a basic building block for other tasks in\nstatistics and computing, for example, estimation entropies of data streams,\nparameter estimations using the method of moments and maximum likelihood.\n  Finally, another contribution is an algorithm for approximating the\nlogarithmic norm, \\sum_{i=1}^D\\log A_t[i], and logarithmic distance. The\nlogarithmic distance is useful in machine learning practice with heavy-tailed\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2008 16:42:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2008 09:51:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.2432", "submitter": "Andrei Romashchenko", "authors": "Bruno Durand (LIF), Andrei Romashchenko (LIP), Alexander Shen (LIF)", "title": "Fixed Point and Aperiodic Tilings", "comments": "v5: technical revision (positions of figures are shifted)", "journal-ref": "12th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory,\n  Kyoto : Japan (2008)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-85780-8_22", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An aperiodic tile set was first constructed by R.Berger while proving the\nundecidability of the domino problem.

We analyze the performance of the\ndifferencing algorithm on random instances by mapping it to a nonlinear rate\nequation. Our analysis reveals strong finite size effects that explain why the\nprecise asymptotics of the differencing solution is hard to establish by\nsimulations. The asymptotic series emerging from the rate equation satisfies\nall known bounds on the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm and projects a scaling\n$n^{-c\\ln n}$, where $c=1/(2\\ln2)=0.7213...$. Our calculations reveal subtle\nrelations between the algorithm and Fibonacci-like sequences, and we establish\nan explicit identity to that effect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2008 17:24:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 09:48:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Boettcher", "Stefan", ""], ["Mertens", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4293", "submitter": "Ewa Krot-Sieniawska", "authors": "Ewa Krot-Sieniawska", "title": "Reduced Incidence algebras description of cobweb posets and KoDAGs", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  After identifying the reduced incidence algebra of an arbitrary cobweb poset\nthe very first properties of these algebras are being disclosed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 05:43:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Krot-Sieniawska", "Ewa", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4307", "submitter": "Moustapha Diaby", "authors": "Moustapha Diaby", "title": "A O(n^8) X O(n^7) Linear Programming Model of the Quadratic Assignment\n  Problem", "comments": "Theorem 21 and Corollary 22 are in error; The modeling needs\n  9-dimensional variables instead of the 8-dimensional variables defined in\n  notations 6.9", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn because Theorem 21 and Corollary 22 are in\nerror; The modeling idea is OK, but it needs 9-dimensional variables instead of\nthe 8-dimensional variables defined in notations 6.9.\n  Examples of the correct model (with 9-index variables) are: (1) Diaby, M.,\n\"Linear Programming Formulation of the Set Partitioning Problem,\" International\nJournal of Operational Research 8:4 (August 2010) pp. 399-427; (2) Diaby, M.,\n\"Linear Programming Formulation of the Vertex Coloring Problem,\" International\nJournal of Mathematics in Operational Research 2:3 (May 2010) pp. 259-289; (3)\nDiaby, M., \"The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Linear Programming Formulation,\"\nWSEAS Transactions on Mathematics, 6:6 (June 2007) pp. 745-754.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 00:03:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 17:35:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Sep 2010 21:07:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2013 03:17:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 15:12:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 19:35:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Diaby", "Moustapha", ""]]}]
