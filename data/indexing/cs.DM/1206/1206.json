We\nconsider the k-colouring model, i.e. the root of T is assigned an arbitrary\ncolour and, conditional on this assignment, we take a random colouring of T. A\nbasic question here is whether the information of the assignment at the root\naffects the distribution of the colourings at the leaves. This is the so-called\nreconstruction/non-reconstruction problem. It is well known that d/ln d is a\nthreshold function for this problem, i.e.\n  * if k \\geq (1+\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root has a vanishing\neffect on the distribution of the colourings at the leaves, as the height of\nthe tree grows\n  * if $k\\leq (1-\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root biases the\ndistribution of the colouring of the leaves regardless of the height of the\ntree.\n  There is no apparent combinatorial reason why such a result should be true.\n  When k\\geq (1+\\eps)d/ ln d, the threshold implies the following: We can\ncouple two broadcasting processes that assign the root different colours such\nthat the probability of having disagreement at the leaves reduces with their\ndistance from the root. It is natural to perceive such coupling as a mapping\nfrom the colouring of the first broadcasting process to the colouring of the\nsecond one. Here, we study how can we have such a mapping \"combinatorially\".\nDevising a mapping where the disagreements vanish as we move away from the root\nturns out to be a non-trivial task to accomplish for any k \\leq d.\n  In this work we obtain a coupling which has the aforementioned property for\nany k>3d/ln d, i.e. much smaller than d.

In the first part\nof this paper we present a new algorithm for generating all non-isomorphic\nsnarks of a given order. Our implementation of the new algorithm is 14 times\nfaster than previous programs for generating snarks, and 29 times faster for\ngenerating weak snarks. Using this program we have generated all non-isomorphic\nsnarks on $n\\leq 36$ vertices. Previously lists up to $n=28$ vertices have been\npublished. In the second part of the paper we analyze the sets of generated\nsnarks with respect to a number of properties and conjectures. We find that\nsome of the strongest versions of the cycle double cover conjecture hold for\nall snarks of these orders, as does Jaeger's Petersen colouring conjecture,\nwhich in turn implies that Fulkerson's conjecture has no small counterexamples.\nIn contrast to these positive results we also find counterexamples to eight\npreviously published conjectures concerning cycle coverings and the general\ncycle structure of cubic graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2012 13:50:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 14:11:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 07:48:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Brinkmann", "Gunnar", ""], ["Goedgebeur", "Jan", ""], ["H\u00e4gglund", "Jonas", ""], ["Markstr\u00f6m", "Klas", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.7105", "submitter": "Erik Jan van Leeuwen", "authors": "Danny Hermelin and Matthias Mnich and Erik Jan van Leeuwen", "title": "Parameterized Complexity of Induced Graph Matching on Claw-Free Graphs", "comments": "Conference version appeared in ESA 2012.

This problem generalizes the classical\nIndependent Set and Induced Matching problems, among several other problems. We\nshow that Induced Graph Matching is fixed-parameter tractable in k on claw-free\ngraphs when H is a fixed connected graph, and even admits a polynomial kernel\nwhen H is a complete graph. Both results rely on a new, strong, and generic\nalgorithmic structure theorem for claw-free graphs.\n  Complementing the above positive results, we prove W[1]-hardness of Induced\nGraph Matching on graphs excluding K_1,4 as an induced subgraph, for any fixed\ncomplete graph H. In particular, we show that Independent Set is W[1]-hard on\nK_1,4-free graphs.\n  Finally, we consider the complexity of Induced Graph Matching on a large\nsubclass of claw-free graphs, namely on proper circular-arc graphs. We show\nthat the problem is either polynomial-time solvable or NP-complete, depending\non the connectivity of H and the structure of G.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 19:09:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 13:23:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hermelin", "Danny", ""], ["Mnich", "Matthias", ""], ["van Leeuwen", "Erik Jan", ""]]}]
