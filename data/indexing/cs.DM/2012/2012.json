When\nbiologists discover the SID of a BN they do not know, they may ask: given that\nSID, can it correspond to a BN having at least/at most $k$ fixed points?\nDepending on the input, we prove that these problems are in $\\textrm{P}$ or\ncomplete for $\\textrm{NP}$, $\\textrm{NP}^{\\textrm{NP}}$,\n$\\textrm{NP}^{\\textrm{#P}}$ or $\\textrm{NEXPTIME}$. In particular, we prove\nthat it is $\\textrm{NP}$-complete (resp. $\\textrm{NEXPTIME}$-complete) to\ndecide if a given SID can correspond to a BN having at least two fixed points\n(resp. no fixed point).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 10:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bridoux", "Florian", ""], ["Durbec", "Am\u00e9lia", ""], ["Perrot", "K\u00e9vin", ""], ["Richard", "Adrien", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02617", "submitter": "Shmuel Onn", "authors": "Shmuel Onn", "title": "On Line Sum Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Linear Algebra and its Applications, 610:474--479, 2021", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.DM cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the {\\em column sum optimization problem}, of finding a\n$(0,1)$-matrix with prescribed row sums which minimizes the sum of evaluations\nof given functions at its column sums, can be solved in polynomial time, either\nwhen all functions are the same or when all row sums are bounded by any\nconstant.

In addition, we show that such an algorithm is\nessentially optimal by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard with parameter\n$|V_H|$, even on a subclass of AT-free graph, namely cobipartite graphs. We\nalso show that the problems $k$-in-a-Path and $k$-in-a-Tree are polynomial-time\nsolvable on AT-free graphs even if $k$ is part of the input. These problems are\nto test if a graph has an induced path or induced tree, respectively, spanning\n$k$ given vertices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2020 18:32:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Golovach", "Petr A.", ""], ["Paulusma", "Dani\u00ebl", ""], ["van Leeuwen", "Erik Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.10151", "submitter": "Wenjun Mei", "authors": "Wenjun Mei, Ge Chen, Noah E.

In this paper, we study the open problem how steady non-all-to-all\nstructural balance emerges via local dynamics of interpersonal appraisals. We\nfirst compare two well-justified definitions of structural balance for general\nnon-all-to-all graphs, i.e., the triad-wise structural balance and the\ntwo-faction structural balance, and thoroughly study their relations. Secondly,\nbased on three widely adopted sociological mechanisms: the symmetry mechanism,\nthe influence mechanism, and the homophily mechanism, we propose two simple\nmodels of gossip-like appraisal dynamics, the symmetry-influence-homophily\n(SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily (SIOH) dynamics. In\nthese models, the appraisal network starting from any initial condition almost\nsurely achieves non-all-to-all triad-wise and two-faction structural balance in\nfinite time respectively. Moreover, the SIOH dynamics capture the co-evolution\nof interpersonal appraisals and individuals' opinions. Regarding the\ntheoretical contributions, we show that the equilibrium set of the SIH (SIOH\nresp.) dynamics corresponds to the set of all the possible triad-wise\n(two-faction resp.) structural balance configurations of the appraisal\nnetworks. Moreover, we prove that, for any initial condition, the appraisal\nnetworks in the SIH (SIOH resp.) dynamics almost surely achieve triad-wise\n(two-faction resp.) structural balance in finite time. Numerical studies of the\nSIH dynamics also imply some insightful take-home messages on whether\nmultilateral relations reduce or exacerbate conflicts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:28:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mei", "Wenjun", ""], ["Chen", "Ge", ""], ["Friedkin", "Noah E.", ""], ["D\u00f6rfler", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.10525", "submitter": "Irene Parada", "authors": "Elena Arseneva, Pilar Cano, Linda Kleist, Tamara Mchedlidze, Saeed\n  Mehrabi, Irene Parada, Pavel Valtr", "title": "Upward Point Set Embeddings of Paths and Trees", "comments": "To appear at the 15th International Conference and Workshops on\n  Algorithms and Computation (WALCOM 2021)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study upward planar straight-line embeddings (UPSE) of directed trees on\ngiven point sets.

While causal inference requires randomized\nexperiments, researchers and policymakers are increasingly using observational\nstudies to test causal hypotheses due to the wide availability of observational\ndata and the infeasibility of experiments. The matching method is the most used\ntechnique to make causal inference from observational data. However, the pair\nassignment process in one-to-one matching creates uncertainty in the inference\nbecause of different choices made by the experimenter. Recently, discrete\noptimization models are proposed to tackle such uncertainty. Although a robust\ninference is possible with discrete optimization models, they produce nonlinear\nproblems and lack scalability. In this work, we propose greedy algorithms to\nsolve the robust causal inference test instances from observational data with\ncontinuous outcomes. We propose a unique framework to reformulate the nonlinear\nbinary optimization problems as feasibility problems. By leveraging the\nstructure of the feasibility formulation, we develop greedy schemes that are\nefficient in solving robust test problems.

Moreover, the influences of the image domain are discussed and the\ncondition named weak shift inclusion is defined, which is proved as an\nequivalent condition for ensuring the order-preserving property.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2020 06:33:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Chuan-Shen", ""], ["Chung", "Yu-Min", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.13182", "submitter": "Daniel Zentai", "authors": "Daniel Zentai", "title": "Graph Theory in the Classification of Information Systems", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Risk classification plays an important role in many regulations and\nstandards.

Machine learning offers to automatically\nconstruct better heuristics from data by exploiting shared structure among\ninstances in the data. This paper applies learning to the two key sub-tasks of\na MIP solver, generating a high-quality joint variable assignment, and bounding\nthe gap in objective value between that assignment and an optimal one. Our\napproach constructs two corresponding neural network-based components, Neural\nDiving and Neural Branching, to use in a base MIP solver such as SCIP. Neural\nDiving learns a deep neural network to generate multiple partial assignments\nfor its integer variables, and the resulting smaller MIPs for un-assigned\nvariables are solved with SCIP to construct high quality joint assignments.\nNeural Branching learns a deep neural network to make variable selection\ndecisions in branch-and-bound to bound the objective value gap with a small\ntree. This is done by imitating a new variant of Full Strong Branching we\npropose that scales to large instances using GPUs. We evaluate our approach on\nsix diverse real-world datasets, including two Google production datasets and\nMIPLIB, by training separate neural networks on each. Most instances in all the\ndatasets combined have $10^3-10^6$ variables and constraints after presolve,\nwhich is significantly larger than previous learning approaches.
