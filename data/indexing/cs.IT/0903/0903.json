In\nthis approach, we split the STC CPM transmitter into a single conventional CPM\nmodulator and a correction filter bank. While the CPM modulator is common to\nall transmit antennas, the correction filter bank applies different correction\nunits to each antenna. Thereby desirable code properties as orthogonality and\nfull diversity are achievable with just a slightly larger bandwidth demand.\nThis new representation has three main advantages. First, it allows to easily\ngeneralize the orthogonality condition to any arbitrary number of transmit\nantennas. Second, for a quite general set of correction functions that we\ndetail, it can be proved that full diversity is achieved. Third, by separating\nthe modulation and correction steps inside the receiver, a simpler receiver can\nbe designed as a bank of data independent inverse correction filters followed\nby a single CPM demodulator. Therefore, in this implementation, only one\ncorrelation filter bank for the detection of all transmitted signals is\nnecessary. The decoding effort grows only linearly with the number of transmit\nantennas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Feb 2009 10:01:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hesse", "Matthias", "", "UBC"], ["Lebrun", "Jerome", "", "UBC"], ["Lampe", "Lutz", "", "UBC"], ["Deneire", "Luc", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0064", "submitter": "Xiang Yan", "authors": "Xiang Yan, Benjamin Van Roy", "title": "Manipulation Robustness of Collaborative Filtering Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A collaborative filtering system recommends to users products that similar\nusers like.

Because a study of information rates led to the Noiseless\nand Noisy Coding Theorems, two of the most important results of Shannon's\ntheory, we begin the paper by defining a pragmatic information rate, showing\nthat all of the relevant limits make sense, and interpreting them as the\nimprovement in compression obtained from using the correct distribution of\ntransmitted symbols.\n  The first of two applications of the theory extends the information theoretic\nanalysis of the Kelly Criterion, and its generalization, the horse race, to a\nseries of races where the stochastic process of winning horses, payoffs, and\nstrategies depend on some stationary process, including, but not limited to the\nhistory of previous races. If the bettor is receiving messages (side\ninformation) about the probability distribution of winners, the doubling rate\nof the bettor's winnings is bounded by the pragmatic information of the\nmessages.\n  A second application is to the question of market efficiency. An efficient\nmarket is, by definition, a market in which the pragmatic information of the\n\"tradable past\" with respect to current prices is zero. Under this definition,\nmarkets whose returns are characterized by a GARCH(1,1) process cannot be\nefficient.\n  Finally, a pragmatic informational analogue to Shannon's Noisy Coding Theorem\nsuggests that a cause of market inefficiency is that the underlying\nfundamentals are changing so fast that the price discovery mechanism simply\ncannot keep up.

First, a new\ninterpretation on the fundamental tradeoff between the transmission rate and\noutage probability in multi-antenna relay networks is given. It follows that\nmultiplexing gains can be obtained at any finite SNR, in full-duplex\nmulti-antenna relay networks. Thus relaying can offer not only stronger link\nreliability, but also higher spectral efficiency.\n  Specifically, the decode-and-forward protocol is applied and networks that\nhave one source, one destination, and multiple relays are considered. A receive\npower gain at the relays, which captures the network large scale fading\ncharacteristics, is also considered. It is shown that this power gain can\nsignificantly affect the system diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for any finite\nSNR value. Several relaying protocols are proposed and are shown to offer\nnearly the same outage probability as if the transmit antennas at the source\nand the relay(s) were co-located, given certain SNR and receive power gains at\nthe relays. Thus a higher multiplexing gain than that of the direct link can be\nobtained if the destination has more antennas than the source.\n  Much of the analysis in the paper is valid for arbitrary channel fading\nstatistics.

Tadaki, Local Proceedings of CiE 2008, pp.425-434,\n2008], we developed a statistical mechanical interpretation of algorithmic\ninformation theory by introducing the notion of thermodynamic quantities at\ntemperature T, such as free energy F(T), energy E(T), and statistical\nmechanical entropy S(T), into the theory. These quantities are real functions\nof real argument T>0. We then discovered that, in the interpretation, the\ntemperature T equals to the partial randomness of the values of all these\nthermodynamic quantities, where the notion of partial randomness is a stronger\nrepresentation of the compression rate by program-size complexity. Furthermore,\nwe showed that this situation holds for the temperature itself as a\nthermodynamic quantity. Namely, the computability of the value of partition\nfunction Z(T) gives a sufficient condition for T in (0,1) to be a fixed point\non partial randomness. In this paper, we show that the computability of each of\nall the thermodynamic quantities above gives the sufficient condition also.\nMoreover, we show that the computability of F(T) gives completely different\nfixed points from the computability of Z(T).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 22:04:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tadaki", "Kohtaro", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.3480", "submitter": "Teddy Furon", "authors": "Teddy Furon and Luis Perez-Freire", "title": "Worst case attacks against binary probabilistic traitor tracing codes", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Forensics and Security", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An insightful view into the design of traitor tracing codes should\nnecessarily consider the worst case attacks that the colluders can lead.

This\npolicy, however, often requires the solution of an NP-hard optimization\nproblem. This has motivated many researchers to develop sub-optimal algorithms\nthat approximate the GMWM policy in selecting schedule vectors. One implicit\nassumption commonly shared in this context is that during the algorithm\nruntime, the channel states remain effectively unchanged. This assumption may\nnot hold as the time needed to select near-optimal schedule vectors usually\nincreases quickly with the network size. In this paper, we incorporate channel\nvariations and the time-efficiency of sub-optimal algorithms into the scheduler\ndesign, to dynamically tune the algorithm runtime considering the tradeoff\nbetween algorithm efficiency and its robustness to changing channel states.\nSpecifically, we propose a Dynamic Control Policy (DCP) that operates on top of\na given sub-optimal algorithm, and dynamically but in a large time-scale\nadjusts the time given to the algorithm according to queue backlog and channel\ncorrelations. This policy does not require knowledge of the structure of the\ngiven sub-optimal algorithm, and with low overhead can be implemented in a\ndistributed manner. Using a novel Lyapunov analysis, we characterize the\nthroughput stability region induced by DCP and show that our characterization\ncan be tight.

The dynamics of the Q-learning are\nillustrated using Metrick-Polak plot. A rigorous proof of the convergence of\nQ-learning is provided via the similarity between the Q-learning and\nRobinson-Monro algorithm, as well as the analysis of convergence of the\ncorresponding ordinary differential equation (via Lyapunov function). Examples\nare illustrated and the performance of learning is evaluated by numerical\nsimulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2009 18:07:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Husheng", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.5341", "submitter": "Wojciech Sarnowski", "authors": "Wojciech Sarnowski, Krzysztof Szajowski", "title": "Unspecified distribution in single disorder problem", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": "Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry. 2018, vol. 34,\n  nr 5, s. 700-717", "doi": "10.1002/asmb.2317", "report-no": "Rap.
