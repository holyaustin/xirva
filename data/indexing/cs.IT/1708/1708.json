This question of \"identity\ntesting\" has received significant attention in the case of testing whether $p$\nand $q$ are equal or far in total variation distance. However, in recent work,\nthe following questions have been been critical to solving problems at the\nfrontiers of distribution testing:\n  -Alternative Distances: Can we test whether $p$ and $q$ are far in other\ndistances, say Hellinger?\n  -Tolerance: Can we test when $p$ and $q$ are close, rather than equal? And if\nso, close in which distances?\n  Motivated by these questions, we characterize the complexity of distribution\ntesting under a variety of distances, including total variation, $\\ell_2$,\nHellinger, Kullback-Leibler, and $\\chi^2$. For each pair of distances $d_1$ and\n$d_2$, we study the complexity of testing if $p$ and $q$ are close in $d_1$\nversus far in $d_2$, with a focus on identifying which problems allow strongly\nsublinear testers (i.e., those with complexity $O(n^{1 - \\gamma})$ for some\n$\\gamma > 0$ where $n$ is the size of the support of the distributions $p$ and\n$q$). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for each case. We also study\nthese questions in the case where we only have samples from $q$ (equivalence\ntesting), showing qualitative differences from identity testing in terms of\nwhen tolerance can be achieved.

This class of QGCs is constructed by assigning\nsingle-letter distributions to the indices of the codewords in a group code.\nThen, the QGC is defined as the set of codewords whose index is in the typical\nset corresponding to these single-letter distributions. The asymptotic\nperformance limits of this class of QGCs is characterized using single-letter\ninformation quantities. Corresponding covering and packing bounds are derived.\nIt is shown that the point-to-point channel capacity and optimal\nrate-distortion function are achievable using QGCs. Coding strategies based on\nQGCs are introduced for three fundamental multi-terminal problems: the\nK\\\"orner-Marton problem for modulo prime-power sums, computation over the\nmultiple access channel (MAC), and MAC with distributed states. For each\nproblem a single-letter achievable rate-region is derived.

The benefit of modular information processing,\nin contrast to globally integrated information processing, is that complex\nglobal computations are more easily and flexibly implemented via a series of\nsimpler, localized information processing operations which only control and\nchange local degrees of freedom. We show that, despite these benefits, there\nare unavoidable thermodynamic costs to modularity---costs that arise directly\nfrom the operation of localized processing and that go beyond Landauer's\ndissipation bound for erasing information.

Unfortunately, global\ncorrelations among the information-bearing degrees of freedom are easily lost\nby modular implementations. This is costly since such correlations are a\nthermodynamic fuel. We quantify the minimum irretrievable dissipation of\nmodular computations in terms of the difference between the change in global\nnonequilibrium free energy, which captures these global correlations, and the\nlocal (marginal) change in nonequilibrium free energy, which bounds modular\nwork production. This modularity dissipation is proportional to the amount of\nadditional work required to perform the computational task modularly.

This formulation can be easily computed to give finite-blocklength\nbounds and turns out to be equivalent to smooth min-entropy bounds by Renner\nand Wolf [Asiacrypt 2005] and Watanabe and Hayashi [ISIT 2013], as well as a\nbound in terms of the $E_\\gamma$ divergence by Yang, Schaefer, and Poor\n[arXiv:1706.03866 [cs.IT]].

In particular, we provide a general construction of valid inequalities\nfor the codeword polytope of the so-called constant-weight embedding of a\nsingle parity-check (SPC) code over any prime field.

To this end, we use a theoretical approach\nfrom information theory, computability theory, and complex networks. One key\nstudied question is how much emergent complexity (or information) arises when a\npopulation of computable systems is networked compared with when this\npopulation is isolated. First, we define a general model for networked\ntheoretical machines, which we call algorithmic networks. Then, we narrow our\nscope to investigate algorithmic networks that optimize the average fitnesses\nof nodes in a scenario in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the\nrandomly generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show\nthat there are graph-topological conditions that cause these algorithmic\nnetworks to have the property of expected emergent open-endedness for large\nenough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic\ncomplexity of a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to\ninfinity. Given a dynamic network, we show that these conditions imply the\nexistence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness.\nMoreover, we show that networks with small diameter compared to the network\nsize meet these conditions.

To cope with this problem, directional beamforming both\nat the Base Station (BS) side and at the user side is necessary in order to\nestablish a strong path conveying enough signal power. Finding such beamforming\ndirections is referred to as the Beam Alignment (BA) and is known to be a\nchallenging problem.

As a result, our proposed\nalgorithm is highly robust to variations of the channel time-dynamics compared\nwith other proposed approaches based on the estimation of the channel\ncoefficients, rather than of their second-order statistics.

Of course this is\nequivalent to finding a permutation matrix P such that, if A denotes the\nadjacency matrix of G, then PAP^T is approximately block diagonal. As there are\nk^n possible partitions of n vertices into k subsets, directly determining the\noptimal clustering is clearly infeasible. Instead one seeks to solve a more\ntractable approximation to the clustering problem. In this paper we reformulate\nthe community detection problem via sparse solution of a linear system\nassociated with the Laplacian of a graph G and then develop a two-stage\napproach based on a thresholding technique and a compressive sensing algorithm\nto find a sparse solution which corresponds to the community containing a\nvertex of interest in G. Crucially, our approach results in an algorithm which\nis able to find a single cluster of size n_0 in O(nlog(n)n_0) operations and\nall k clusters in fewer than O(n^2ln(n)) operations. This is a marked\nimprovement over the classic spectral clustering algorithm, which is unable to\nfind a single cluster at a time and takes approximately O(n^3) operations to\nfind all k clusters. Moreover, we are able to provide robust guarantees of\nsuccess for the case where G is drawn at random from the Stochastic Block\nModel, a popular model for graphs with clusters.
