In many applications, however, sampling at\nthe Nyquist rate is inefficient because the signals of interest contain only a\nsmall number of significant frequencies relative to the bandlimit, although the\nlocations of the frequencies may not be known a priori. For this type of sparse\nsignal, other sampling strategies are possible. This paper describes a new type\nof data acquisition system, called a random demodulator, that is constructed\nfrom robust, readily available components. Let K denote the total number of\nfrequencies in the signal, and let W denote its bandlimit in Hz. Simulations\nsuggest that the random demodulator requires just O(K log(W/K)) samples per\nsecond to stably reconstruct the signal. This sampling rate is exponentially\nlower than the Nyquist rate of W Hz. In contrast with Nyquist sampling, one\nmust use nonlinear methods, such as convex programming, to recover the signal\nfrom the samples taken by the random demodulator. This paper provides a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of the system's performance that supports the\nempirical observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2009 05:00:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 00:52:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Tropp", "Joel A.", ""], ["Laska", "Jason N.", ""], ["Duarte", "Marco F.", ""], ["Romberg", "Justin K.", ""], ["Baraniuk", "Richard G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0058", "submitter": "Robert Rolland", "authors": "Robert Rolland", "title": "The second weight of generalized Reed-Muller codes in most cases", "comments": "This version corrects minor misprints and gives a more detailed proof\n  of a combinatorial lemma", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The second weight of the Generalized Reed-Muller code of order $d$ over the\nfinite field with $q$ elements is now known for $d <q$ and $d>(n-1)(q-1)$.

Define the stability region for SDMA\nas the set of multiuser packet-arrival rates for which the steady-state queue\nlengths are finite. Given perfect CSI feedback and equal power allocation over\nscheduled queues, the stability region is proved to be a convex polytope having\nthe derived vertices. For any set of arrival rates in the stability region,\nmultiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by a joint queue-and-beamforming\ncontrol policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths.\nThe stability region for limited feedback is found to be the perfect-CSI region\nmultiplied by one minus a small factor. The required number of feedback bits\nper mobile is proved to scale logarithmically with the inverse of the above\nfactor as well as linearly with the number of transmit antennas minus one. The\neffects of limited feedback on queueing delay are also quantified. For Poisson\narrival processes, CSI quantization errors are shown to multiply average\nqueueing delay by a factor larger than one. This factor can be controlled by\nadjusting the number of feedback bits per mobile following the derived\nrelationship.

This work derives\nthe maximum number of simultaneously transmitting multiple antenna femtocells\nmeeting a per-tier outage probability constraint.

Two operating regimes are shown namely 1) a cellular-limited regime\nin which femtocell users experience unacceptable cross-tier interference and 2)\na hotspot-limited regime wherein both femtocell users and cellular users are\nlimited by hotspot interference. Our analysis accounts for the per-tier\ntransmit powers, the number of transmit antennas (single antenna transmission\nbeing a special case) and terrestrial propagation such as the Rayleigh fading\nand the path loss exponents.

One\npossible construction uses the adjacency matrices of expander graphs, which\noften leads to recovery algorithms much more efficient than $\\ell_1$\nminimization.

In this paper, unlike in the\ntraditional work that focused on mean value analysis, we study the\ndistributional properties of packet transmission delays over an ALOHA channel.\nWe discover a new phenomenon showing that a basic finite population ALOHA model\nwith variable size (exponential) packets is characterized by power law\ntransmission delays, possibly even resulting in zero throughput. These results\nare in contrast to the classical work that shows exponential delays and\npositive throughput for finite population ALOHA with fixed packets.\nFurthermore, we characterize a new stability condition that is entirely derived\nfrom the tail behavior of the packet and backoff distributions that may not be\ndetermined by mean values. The power law effects and the possible instability\nmight be diminished, or perhaps eliminated, by reducing the variability of\npackets. However, we show that even a slotted (synchronized) ALOHA with packets\nof constant size can exhibit power law delays when the number of active users\nis random. From an engineering perspective, our results imply that the\nvariability of packet sizes and number of active users need to be taken into\nconsideration when designing robust MAC protocols, especially for ad-hoc/sensor\nnetworks where other factors, such as link failures and mobility, might further\ncompound the problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2009 22:59:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2009 22:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Jelenkovic", "Predrag R.", ""], ["Tan", "Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4508", "submitter": "Luo Jinquan", "authors": "Jinquan Luo, Yuansheng Tang and Hongyu Wang", "title": "Exponential Sums, Cyclic Codes and Sequences: the Odd Characteristic\n  Kasami Case", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Let $q=p^n$ with $n=2m$ and $p$ be an odd prime.

We introduce the Stackelberg equilibrium\n(SE) with multiple leaders as the equilibrium point of the non-cooperative\ngame. Therefore, an iterative multiple waterlevels water-filling algorithm\n(IML-WFA) is developed to efficiently reach the SE of the non-cooperative game.\nThe existence of SE is established for the game.
