Using game theoretic tools,\na useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power\nallocation when users know only their own channel (while perfect channel state\ninformation is assumed at the base station). We consider the realistic case of\nfrequency selective channels for uplink CDMA. This scenario illustrates the\ncase of decentralized schemes, where limited information on the network is\navailable at the terminal. Various receivers are considered, namely the Matched\nfilter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to\nderive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the\nnumber of mobiles becomes large and the spreading length increases. To that end\ntwo asymptotic methodologies are combined. The first is asymptotic random\nmatrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions of the impact of\nall other mobiles on any given tagged mobile.

In this paper, we explore the spatial degrees of\nfreedom per orthogonal time and frequency dimension for the K user wireless\ninterference channel where the channel coefficients take distinct values across\nfrequency slots but are fixed in time. We answer five closely related\nquestions. First, we show that K/2 degrees of freedom can be achieved by\nchannel design, i.e. if the nodes are allowed to choose the best constant,\nfinite and nonzero channel coefficient values. Second, we show that if channel\ncoefficients can not be controlled by the nodes but are selected by nature,\ni.e., randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the total number of\nspatial degrees of freedom for the K user interference channel is almost surely\nK/2 per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Thus, only half the spatial\ndegrees of freedom are lost due to distributed processing of transmitted and\nreceived signals on the interference channel.

We consider two alternative\noptimization problems: P.1) the maximization of mutual information on each\nlink, given constraints on the transmit power and spectral mask; and P.2) the\nmaximization of the transmission rate on each link, using finite order\nconstellations, under the same constraints as in P.1, plus a constraint on the\nmaximum average error probability on each link. Aiming at finding decentralized\nstrategies, we adopted as optimality criterion the achievement of a Nash\nequilibrium and thus we formulated both problems P.1 and P.2 as strategic\nnoncooperative (matrix-valued) games. In Part I of this two-part paper, after\nderiving the optimal structure of the linear transceivers for both games, we\nprovided a unified set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness\nof the Nash equilibrium.
