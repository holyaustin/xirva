Which entropy coding, arithmetic or Huffman, is more\nsuitable compared to other from the compression ratio, performance, and\nimplementation points of view? We have implemented and tested Huffman and\narithmetic algorithms.

In this paper, the DoF of a K-user interference\nchannel is studied under the assumption that the transmitters can cooperate via\ncoordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission. In [1], the authors considered the\nlinear asymmetric model of Wyner, where each transmitter is connected to its\nown receiver and its successor, and is aware of its own message as well as M-1\npreceding messages. The per user DoF was shown to go to M/(M+1) as the number\nof users increases to infinity. In this work, the same model of channel\nconnectivity is considered, with a relaxed cooperation constraint that bounds\nthe maximum number of transmitters at which each message can be available, by a\ncooperation order M. We show that the relaxation of the cooperation constraint,\nwhile maintaining the same load imposed on a backhaul link needed to distribute\nthe messages, results in a gain in the DoF. In particular, the asymptotic limit\nof the per user DoF under the cooperation order constraint is (2M)/(2M+1) .\nMoreover, the optimal transmit set selection satisfies a local cooperation\nconstraint. i.e., each message needs only to be available at neighboring\ntransmitters.

The first\nperforms scheduling every $T$ slots, and approaches the boundary of the\nstability region as $T$ gets large, but at the cost of increased average delay.\nThe second introduces virtual queues for each link and constructs a virtual\nsystem wherein two virtual nodes are introduced for each link. The constructed\nvirtual system is shown to have the same stability region as the original\nsystem. Through controlling the virtual queues in the constructed system, we\navoid the non-i.i.d analysis difficulty and attain the full stability region.\nWe derive performance bounds for both algorithms and compare them through\nsimulation results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Sep 2011 19:53:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Jul 2012 04:54:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jing", ""], ["Liu", "Yanpei", ""], ["Draper", "Stark C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.2591", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "Mark M.

The aim of the present\npaper is to fill this gap by constructing near-explicit \"polar\" codes that are\ncapacity-achieving. The codes exploit the channel polarization phenomenon\nobserved by Arikan for the case of classical channels. Channel polarization is\nan effect in which one can synthesize a set of channels, by \"channel combining\"\nand \"channel splitting,\" in which a fraction of the synthesized channels are\nperfect for data transmission while the other fraction are completely useless\nfor data transmission, with the good fraction equal to the capacity of the\nchannel. The channel polarization effect then leads to a simple scheme for data\ntransmission: send the information bits through the perfect channels and\n\"frozen\" bits through the useless ones. The main technical contributions of the\npresent paper are threefold. First, we leverage several known results from the\nquantum information literature to demonstrate that the channel polarization\neffect occurs for channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs. We then\nconstruct linear polar codes based on this effect, and the encoding complexity\nis O(N log N), where N is the blocklength of the code.

The key mechanism behind proposed paradigm is the analysis\nof statistical distribution (the mean and covariance) of . We proved that if\nthe resulting mean of are zero, and their covariance are as small as possible,\none can faithfully recover approximately sparse signals from a minimal number\nof noisy measurements with overwhelming probability. The resulting theory is\nnot only suitable for almost all models - e.g. Gaussian, frequency\nmeasurements-discussed in the literature of compressed sampling, but also\nprovides a framework for new measurement strategies as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2011 08:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Lianlin", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6202", "submitter": "Gilles Puy", "authors": "Gilles Puy and Pierre Vandergheynst and Yves Wiaux", "title": "On Variable Density Compressive Sampling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 18(10), pp. 595-598, 2011", "doi": "10.1109/LSP.2011.2163712", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We advocate an optimization procedure for variable density sampling in the\ncontext of compressed sensing.

Most of previous works in\nthe literature have mainly focused on the sparse synthesis prior where the\nsparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the\nsignal from a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis\nregularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and\nthe atoms in the dictionary, where these correlations define the analysis\nsupport. The corresponding variational problem encompasses several well-known\nregularizations such as the discrete total variation and the Fused Lasso. Our\nmain contributions consist in deriving sufficient conditions that guarantee\nexact or partial analysis support recovery of the true signal in presence of\nnoise. More precisely, we give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal\nis the unique solution of the L1-analysis regularization in the noiseless case.\nThe same condition also guarantees exact analysis support recovery and\nL2-robustness of the L1-analysis minimizer vis-a-vis an enough small noise in\nthe measurements. This condition turns to be sharp for the robustness of the\nanalysis support. To show partial support recovery and L2-robustness to an\narbitrary bounded noise, we introduce a stronger sufficient condition.

Specifically, we propose a non-MDS\n(2k, k) code that tolerates any three node failures and more importantly, it is\nshown using our code a single node failure can be repaired through access to\nonly three nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Sep 2011 08:02:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kiani", "Abbas", ""], ["Akhlaghi", "Soroush", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6665", "submitter": "Behzad Ahmadi", "authors": "Behzad Ahmadi and Osvaldo Simeone", "title": "Distributed and Cascade Lossy Source Coding with a Side Information\n  \"Vending Machine\"", "comments": "33 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory (1st revision)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Source coding with a side information \"vending machine\" is a recently\nproposed framework in which the statistical relationship between the side\ninformation and the source, instead of being given and fixed as in the\nclassical Wyner-Ziv problem, can be controlled by the decoder. This control\naction is selected by the decoder based on the message encoded by the source\nnode. Unlike conventional settings, the message can thus carry not only\ninformation about the source to be reproduced at the decoder, but also control\ninformation aimed at improving the quality of the side information. In this\npaper, the analysis of the trade-offs between rate, distortion and cost\nassociated with the control actions is extended from the previously studied\npoint-to-point set-up to two basic multiterminal models. First, a distributed\nsource coding model is studied, in which two encoders communicate over\nrate-limited links to a decoder, whose side information can be controlled. The\ncontrol actions are selected by the decoder based on the messages encoded by\nboth source nodes. For this set-up, inner bounds are derived on the\nrate-distortion-cost region for both cases in which the side information is\navailable causally and non-causally at the decoder. These bounds are shown to\nbe tight under specific assumptions, including the scenario in which the\nsequence observed by one of the nodes is a function of the source observed by\nthe other and the side information is available causally at the decoder. Then,\na cascade scenario in which three nodes are connected in a cascade and the last\nnode has controllable side information, is also investigated. For this model,\nthe rate-distortion-cost region is derived for general distortion requirements\nand under the assumption of causal availability of side information at the last\nnode.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:13:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 06:30:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadi", "Behzad", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6714", "submitter": "Nan Zhao", "authors": "Nan Zhao", "title": "A Novel Two-stage Entropy-based Robust Cooperative Spectrum Sensing\n  Scheme with Two-bit Decision in Cognitive Radio", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spectrum sensing is a key problem in cognitive radio.
