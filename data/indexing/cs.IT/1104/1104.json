The asymptotic analysis\npredicts the fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\\ell$ in\nthe asymptotic regime where $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. The analysis is similar in\nnature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze\niterative decoding algorithms.

Their main advantages are low computational complexity and\npredictable decoding capabilities. Many algorithms can be extended for\ncorrection of both errors and erasures. This enables the decoder to exploit\nbinary quantized reliability information obtained from the transmission\nchannel: Received symbols with high reliability are forwarded to the decoding\nalgorithm while symbols with low reliability are erased. In this paper we\ninvestigate adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes,\ni.e. we derive an adaptive erasing strategy which minimizes the residual\ncodeword error probability after decoding. Our result is applicable to any\nerror/erasure decoding algorithm as long as its decoding capabilities can be\nexpressed by a decoder capability function.

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that a new notion of block restricted isometry property (Block\nRIP), which is less stringent than standard restricted isometry property (RIP),\ncan be used for a very straightforward analysis of Block OMP. It is\ndemonstrated that Block OMP can exactly recover any block K-sparse signal in no\nmore than K steps if the Block RIP of order K+1 with a sufficiently small\nisometry constant is satisfied. Using this result it can be proved that Block\nOMP can yield better reconstruction properties than the conventional OMP when\nthe signal is block sparse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2011 12:07:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Li", "Gang", ""], ["Zhang", "Hao", ""], ["Wang", "Xiqin", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1074", "submitter": "Jun Wang", "authors": "Jun Wang, Gang Li, Hao Zhang, Xiqin Wang", "title": "SAR Imaging of Moving Targets via Compressive Sensing", "comments": "13 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An algorithm based on compressive sensing (CS) is proposed for synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) imaging of moving targets.

Practical ADCs not only sample but\nalso quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is\nan inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth.\nIn this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the\nemphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In\nparticular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture\njust their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal\nreconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on\nthe best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d.\nrandom Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with\noverwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider\nreconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the\nBinary $\\epsilon$-Stable Embedding (B$\\epsilon$SE) property, which\ncharacterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the\nsame class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also\nenable such a robust mapping.

The key idea is to decompose the physical scattering channel\ninto two parts using the manifold decomposition technique: one is the wavefield\nindependent sampling matrices depending on the antenna arrays only; the other\nis the array independent physical channel that can be individually modeled in\nan analytical manner. Based on the framework, we firstly extend the\nconventional virtual channel representation (VCR), which is restricted to\nuniform linear arrays (ULAs) so far, to a general version applicable to\narbitrary array configurations. Then, we present two array independent\nstochastic MIMO channel models based on the proposed new VCR as well as the\nWeichselberger model. These two models are good at angular power spectrum (APS)\nestimation and capacity prediction, respectively. Finally, the impact of array\ncharacteristics on channel capacity is separately investigated by studying the\ncondition number of the array steering matrix at fixed angles, and the results\nagree well with existing conclusions. Numerical results are presented for model\nvalidation and comparison.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2011 01:59:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yao", "Yuan", ""], ["Zheng", "Jianfeng", ""], ["Feng", "Zhenghe", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4406", "submitter": "Yoav Shechtman", "authors": "Yoav Shechtman, Yonina C.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called the\nConstellation Power Allocation (CPA) scheme, wherein the instantaneous transmit\npower of the two users are varied by maintaining their average power\nconstraints. We show that the CPA scheme offers CC sum capacities equal (at low\nSNR values) or close (at high SNR values) to those offered by the CR scheme\nwith reduced decoding complexity for QAM constellations. We study the\nrobustness of the CPA scheme for random phase offsets in the channel and\nunequal average power constraints for the two users. With random phase offsets\nin the channel, we show that the CC sum capacity offered by the CPA scheme is\nmore than the CR scheme at high SNR values. With unequal average power\nconstraints, we show that the CPA scheme provides maximum gain when the power\nlevels are close, and the advantage diminishes with the increase in the power\ndifference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 15:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 01:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Harshan", "J.", ""], ["Rajan", "B.
