The result is particularly\nimportant when base stations rely on an off-grid power source (i.e.,\nbatteries).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:25:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 07:29:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tassi", "Andrea", ""], ["Egan", "Malcolm", ""], ["Piechocki", "Robert J.", ""], ["Nix", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.00663", "submitter": "Bahman Moraffah", "authors": "Bahman Moraffah and Lalitha Sankar", "title": "Privacy-guaranteed Two-Agent Interactions Using Information-Theoretic\n  Mechanisms", "comments": "33 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a multi-round interaction problem with privacy\nconstraints between two agents that observe correlated data. The agents\nalternately share data with one another for a total of K rounds such that each\nagent initiates sharing over K/2 rounds. The interactions are modeled as a\ncollection of K random mechanisms (mappings), one for each round. The goal is\nto jointly design the K private mechanisms to determine the set of all\nachievable distortion-leakage pairs at each agent. Arguing that a mutual\ninformation-based leakage metric can be appropriate for streaming data\nsettings, this paper: (i) determines the set of all achievable distortion-\nleakage tuples ; (ii) shows that the K mechanisms allow for precisely composing\nthe total privacy budget over K rounds without loss; and (ii) develops\nconditions under which interaction reduces the net leakage at both agents and\nillustrates it for a specific class of sources. The paper then focuses on\nlog-loss distortion to better understand the effect on leakage of using a\ncommonly used utility metric in learning theory. The resulting interaction\nproblem leads to a non-convex sum-leakage-distortion optimization problem that\ncan be viewed as an interactive version of the information bottleneck problem.\nA new merge-and-search algorithm that extends the classical agglomerative\ninformation bottleneck algorithm to the interactive setting is introduced to\ndetermine a provable locally optimal solution. Finally, the benefit of\ninteraction under log-loss is illustrated for specific source classes and the\noptimality of one-shot is proved for Gaussian sources under both mean-square\nand log-loss distortions constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:26:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moraffah", "Bahman", ""], ["Sankar", "Lalitha", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.00845", "submitter": "Yun Fan", "authors": "Yun Fan, Liang Zhang", "title": "Isometrically Self-dual Cyclic Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  General isometries of cyclic codes, including multipliers and translations,\nare introduced; and isometrically self-dual cyclic codes are defined.

In previous NCMA systems, users\nadopt the same modulation regardless of their individual channel conditions.\nThis leads to suboptimal throughput for many practical scenarios, especially\nwhen different users have widely varying channel conditions. A rate-diverse\nNCMA system allows different users to use modulations that are commensurate\nwith their channel conditions. A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping\nand decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different\nmodulations.

The essence of the\napproach is the use of underlying algebraic structure enforced in such problems\nby other practical constraints such as, for example, null shaping constraint.\nAccording to this approach, instead of relaxing the non-convex rankconstrained\nSDP problem to a feasible set of positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict it\nto a space of polynomials whose dimension is equal to the desired rank. The\nresulting optimization problem is then convex as its solution is required to be\nfull rank, and can be efficiently and exactly solved. A simple matrix\ndecomposition is needed to recover the solution of the original problem from\nthe solution of the restricted one. We show how this approach can be applied to\nsolving some important signal processing problems that contain null-shaping\nconstraints.

We show that the\nrequired transmit power becomes unbounded when the allowed maximal queueing\ndelay is shorter than the channel coherence time. To satisfy quality-of-service\nrequirement with finite transmit power, we introduce a proactive packet\ndropping mechanism, and optimize a queue state information and channel state\ninformation dependent transmission policy. Since the resource and policy for\ntransmission and the packet dropping policy are related to the packet error\nprobability, queueing delay violation probability, and packet dropping\nprobability, we optimize the three probabilities and obtain the policies\nrelated to these probabilities. We start from single-user scenario and then\nextend our framework to the multi-user scenario. Simulation results show that\nthe optimized three probabilities are in the same order of magnitude.\nTherefore, we have to take into account all these factors when we design\nsystems for tactile internet applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 08:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["She", "Changyang", ""], ["Yang", "Chenyang", ""], ["Quek", "Tony Q.

This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme\nas a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a\nmulti-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several\nbase-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and, therefore, allows for joint\nsignal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds,\nhowever, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of\nbackhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is\ncomposed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are\nmaintained at a fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of\nmaximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling\nthem to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to\na single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be\nserved by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the\nproblem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The\nconsidered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a\nmaximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be\nsolved using efficient techniques.

The\ntracking performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the tracking\nperformance of the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis\ndensity filter, yet with a significantly lower complexity. The fluctuation of\nthe measured channel gain is followed very well by the proposed tracking\nalgorithm, with a power loss of only 2.5 dB. We present statistical\ndistributions for the number of MPCs and the birth/death rate. The applied\nalgorithms and tracking results can be used to enhance the development of\ngeometry-based channel models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 13:38:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mahler", "Kim", ""], ["Keusgen", "Wilhelm", ""], ["Tufvesson", "Fredrik", ""], ["Zemen", "Thomas", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.07497", "submitter": "Anders Hansen", "authors": "Alex Jones and Ben Adcock and Anders Hansen", "title": "Analyzing the structure of multidimensional compressed sensing problems\n  through coherence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently it has been established that asymptotic incoherence can be used to\nfacilitate subsampling, in order to optimize reconstruction quality, in a\nvariety of continuous compressed sensing problems, and the coherence structure\nof certain one-dimensional Fourier sampling problems was determined.

Such uncertainties are\ntypically addressed by using multiple, accurately chosen training signals to\nrecover the missing information on the sensing model, an approach that can be\nresource-consuming and cumbersome. Conversely, blind calibration does not\nemploy any training signal, but corresponds to a bilinear inverse problem whose\nalgorithmic solution is an open issue. We here address blind calibration as a\nnon-convex problem for linear random sensing models, in which we aim to recover\nan unknown signal from its projections on sub-Gaussian random vectors, each\nsubject to an unknown positive multiplicative factor (or gain). To solve this\noptimisation problem we resort to projected gradient descent starting from a\nsuitable, carefully chosen initialisation point. An analysis of this algorithm\nallows us to show that it converges to the exact solution provided a sample\ncomplexity requirement is met, i.e., relating convergence to the amount of\ninformation collected during the sensing process. Interestingly, we show that\nthis requirement grows linearly (up to log factors) in the number of unknowns\nof the problem. This sample complexity is found both in absence of prior\ninformation, as well as when subspace priors are available for both the signal\nand gains, allowing a further reduction of the number of observations required\nfor our recovery guarantees to hold.

In this paper, we develop a\nsymbol synchronization framework for molecular communication (MC) systems where\nwe consider some practical challenges which have not been addressed in the\nliterature yet. In particular, we take into account that in MC systems, the\ntransmitter may not be equipped with an internal clock and may not be able to\nemit molecules with a fixed release frequency. Such restrictions hold for\npractical nanotransmitters, e.g. modified cells, where the lengths of the\nsymbol intervals may vary due to the inherent randomness in the availability of\nfood and energy for molecule generation, the process for molecule production,\nand the release process. To address this issue, we propose to employ two types\nof molecules, one for synchronization and one for data transmission.
