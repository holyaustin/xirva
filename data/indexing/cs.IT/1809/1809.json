To overcome these two attacks, we illustrate\nthat the destination and the source should inject jamming signal to the network\nin phase I and phase II, respectively. Accordingly, the communication in our\nproposed system model is accomplished in two phases. In the first phase, when\nthe source transmits its data to the untrusted relay the destination broadcasts\nits jamming signal. In the second phase, when the relay retransmits the\nreceived signal, the source transmits a jamming signal with one of its\nantennas. For this system model, we propose a power allocation strategy to\nmaximize the instantaneous secrecy rate subject to satisfying the covert\nrequirements in both of the phases. Since the proposed optimization problem is\nnon-convex, we adopt the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) approach to\nconvert it to a convex optimization problem.

The objective is to maximize some network\nutility function based on given traffic statistics collected over a slow\ntimescale, conceived to be seconds to minutes. A key challenge is scalability:\ninterference across cells creates dependencies across the entire network,\nmaking the optimization problem computationally challenging as the size of the\nnetwork becomes large. A suboptimal solution is presented, which performs well\nin networks consisting of one hundred access points (APs) serving several\nhundred user devices. This is achieved by optimizing over local overlapping\nneighborhoods, defined by interference conditions, and by exploiting the\nsparsity of a globally optimal solution. Specifically, with a total of $k$ user\ndevices in the entire network, it suffices to divide the spectrum into $k$\nsegments, where each segment is mapped to a particular set, or pattern, of\nactive APs within each local neighborhood. The problem is then to find a\nmapping of segments to patterns, and to optimize the widths of the segments. A\nconvex relaxation is proposed for this, which relies on a re-weighted $\\ell_1$\napproximation of an $\\ell_0$ constraint, and is used to enforce the mapping of\na unique pattern to each spectrum segment.

We\nalso model the N-packet transmission for the uncoded/coded packets broadcast in\norder to compare the IEEE 802.11 unreliable to reliable coded broadcast with\nACK. We analyze the delay over all, unicast and broadcast transmissions, for\nthe scenario considered with a topology with one WiFi AP before the handover.\nCapitalizing on the set of models and their corresponding mean completion times\n(delay), we analyze the performance of different mechanisms. Finally, we\nprovide a novel formulation of the Network Coding on the Edge handover when the\nstation is mobile allowing for the derivation of optimal transmission\nstrategies that can define an optimal time, when to switch to the other AP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 23:14:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ghanem", "Samah A.

In the\ncounting rule-based detection in an $N-$sensor network, the local sensors\ntransmit binary decisions to the fusion center, where the number of all $N$\nlocal-sensor detections are counted and compared to a threshold. In the\nordering scheme, sensors transmit their unquantized statistics to the fusion\ncenter in a sequential manner; highly informative sensors enjoy higher priority\nfor transmission. When sufficient evidence is collected at the fusion center\nfor decision making, the transmissions from the sensors are stopped. The\nordering scheme achieves the same error probability as the optimum\nunconstrained energy approach (which requires observations from all the $N$\nsensors) with far fewer sensor transmissions. The scheme proposed in this paper\nimproves the energy efficiency of the counting rule detector by ordering the\nsensor transmissions: each sensor transmits at a time inversely proportional to\na function of its observation. The resulting scheme combines the advantages\noffered by the counting rule (efficient utilization of the network's\ncommunication bandwidth, since the local decisions are transmitted in binary\nform to the fusion center) and ordering sensor transmissions (bandwidth\nefficiency, since the fusion center need not wait for all the $N$ sensors to\ntransmit their local decisions), thereby leading to significant energy savings.\nAs a concrete example, the problem of target detection in large-scale wireless\nsensor networks is considered. Under certain conditions the ordering-based\ncounting rule scheme achieves the same detection performance as that of the\noriginal counting rule detector with fewer than $N/2$ sensor transmissions; in\nsome cases, the savings in transmission approaches $(N-1)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 02:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sriranga", "N.", ""], ["Nagananda", "K.

Due to the\nstrong line-of-sight (LoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels, the UAV may\nimpose/suffer more severe uplink/downlink interference to/from the cellular\nbase stations (BSs) than the ground users. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nto apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to the uplink\ncommunication from a UAV to cellular BSs, under spectrum sharing with the\nexisting ground users. However, for our considered system, traditional NOMA\nwith local interference cancellation (IC), termed non-cooperative NOMA, may\nprovide very limited gain compared to the OMA. This is because there are many\nco-channel BSs due to the LoS A2G channels and thus the UAV's rate performance\nis severely limited by the BS with the worst channel condition with the UAV. To\nimprove the UAV's achievable rate, a new cooperative NOMA scheme is proposed by\nexploiting the backhaul links among BSs. Specifically, some BSs with better\nchannel conditions are selected to decode the UAV's signals first, and then\nforward the decoded signals to their backhaul-connected BSs for IC. To\ninvestigate the optimal design of cooperative NOMA, we maximize the weighted\nsum-rate of the UAV and ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV's rate and\npower allocations over multiple resource blocks. However, this problem is hard\nto be solved optimally. To obtain useful insights, we first consider two\nspecial cases with egoistic and altruistic transmission strategies of the UAV,\nrespectively, and solve their corresponding problems optimally. Next, we\nconsider the general case and propose an efficient suboptimal solution via the\nalternating optimization.

We prove that one can bound the the free\npseudodistance growth rate over a BEC from below (respectively, above) using\nthe associated tail-biting (terminated) SC-LDPC code ensemble and show\nempirically that these bounds coincide for a sufficiently large period, which\ngives the exact free pseudodistance growth rate for the SC-LDPC ensemble\nconsidered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2018 04:44:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Cunlu", ""], ["Mitchell", "David G.

To that end, we use the Lloyd-Max\nalgorithm and leverage properties of logarithmically-concave functions and\nsequential Bayesian filtering to construct the optimal quantizer that greedily\nminimizes the cost at every time instant. By connecting the globally optimal\nscheme to the problem of scalar successive refinement, we argue that its gain\nover the proposed greedy algorithm is negligible. This is significant since the\nglobally optimal scheme is often computationally intractable. All the results\nare proven for the more general case of disturbances with\nlogarithmically-concave distributions and rate-limited time-varying noiseless\nchannels. We further extend the framework to event-triggered control by\nallowing to convey information via an additional \"silent symbol\", i.e., by\navoiding transmitting bits; by constraining the minimal probability of silence\nwe attain a tradeoff between the transmission rate and the control cost for\nrates below one bit per sample.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Sep 2018 12:43:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Khina", "Anatoly", ""], ["Nakahira", "Yorie", ""], ["Su", "Yu", ""], ["Y\u0131ld\u0131z", "Hikmet", ""], ["Hassibi", "Babak", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.04957", "submitter": "Kazuyoshi Tsuchiya", "authors": "Kazuyoshi Tsuchiya, Chiaki Ogawa, Yasuyuki Nogami, Satoshi Uehara", "title": "Linear Complexity of Geometric Sequences Defined by Cyclotomic Classes\n  and Balanced Binary Sequences Constructed by the Geometric Sequences", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1709.05163", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1587/transfun.E101.A.2382", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pseudorandom number generators are required to generate pseudorandom numbers\nwhich have good statistical properties as well as unpredictability in\ncryptography.

For current blockchain systems, as more nodes join the network,\nthe efficiency of the system (computation, communication, and storage) stays\nconstant at best. A leading idea for enabling blockchains to scale efficiency\nis the notion of sharding: different subsets of nodes handle different portions\nof the blockchain, thereby reducing the load for each individual node.
