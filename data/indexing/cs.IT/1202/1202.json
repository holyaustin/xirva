In Part I, following a novel combinatorial\ngeometrical approach which is based on parallelotope geometry, we have\npresented an exact analytical expression and two closed-form bounds for the\nsymbol error probability (SEP) in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). In the\npresent Part II, we extend the analysis and present a novel analytical\nexpression for the Frame Error Probability (FEP) of multidimensional lattice\nconstellations over Nakagami-m fading channels. As the FEP of infinite lattice\nconstellations is lower bounded by the Sphere Lower Bound (SLB), we propose the\nSphere Upper Bound (SUB) for block fading channels. Furthermore, two novel\nbounds for the FEP of multidimensional lattice constellations over block fading\nchannels, named Multiple Sphere Lower Bound (MSLB) and Multiple Sphere Upper\nBound (MSUB), are presented. The expressions for the SLB and SUB are given in\nclosed form, while the corresponding ones for MSLB and MSUB are given in closed\nform for unitary block length. Numerical and simulation results illustrate the\ntightness of the proposed bounds and demonstrate that they can be efficiently\nused to set the performance limits on the FEP of lattice constellations of\narbitrary structure, dimension and rank.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 21:22:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 11:51:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pappi", "Koralia N.", ""], ["Chatzidiamantis", "Nestor D.", ""], ["Karagiannidis", "George K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.0305", "submitter": "Ronen Dar", "authors": "Ronen Dar, Meir Feder, Mark Shtaif", "title": "The Jacobi MIMO Channel", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a new fading model for MIMO channels, the Jacobi fading\nmodel. It asserts that $H$, the transfer matrix which couples the $m_t$ inputs\ninto $m_r$ outputs, is a sub-matrix of an $m\\times m$ random (Haar-distributed)\nunitary matrix. The (squared) singular values of $H$ follow the law of the\nclassical Jacobi ensemble of random matrices; hence the name of the channel.\nOne motivation to define such a channel comes from multimode/multicore optical\nfiber communication. It turns out that this model can be qualitatively\ndifferent than the Rayleigh model, leading to interesting practical and\ntheoretical results. This work first evaluates the ergodic capacity of the\nchannel. Then, it considers the non-ergodic case, where it analyzes the outage\nprobability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. In the case where\n$k=m_t+m_r-m > 0$ it is shown that at least $k$ degrees of freedom are\nguaranteed not to fade for any channel realization, enabling a zero outage\nprobability or infinite diversity order at the corresponding rates. A simple\nscheme utilizing (a possibly outdated) channel state feedback is provided,\nattaining the no-outage guarantee. Finally, noting that as $m$ increases, the\nJacobi model approaches the Rayleigh model, the paper discusses the\napplicability of the model in other communication scenaria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 21:45:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Feb 2012 22:53:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Feb 2012 19:11:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 7 Jul 2012 13:35:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2012 19:48:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Dar", "Ronen", ""], ["Feder", "Meir", ""], ["Shtaif", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.0307", "submitter": "Petar Popovski", "authors": "Petar Popovski and Zoran Utkovski", "title": "Protocol Coding through Reordering of User Resources, Part I: Capacity\n  Results", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Trans.

JNCC is\nincreasingly proposed as an alternative to a standard layered construction,\nsuch as the OSI-model. The main performance metrics for JNCCs are scalability\nto larger networks and error rate. The diversity order is one of the most\nimportant parameters determining the error rate. The literature on JNCC is\ngrowing, but a rigorous diversity analysis is lacking, mainly because of the\nmany degrees of freedom in wireless networks, which makes it very hard to prove\ngeneral statements on the diversity order.

Our main\ncontributions are the proposition of an upper and lower bound on the diversity\norder, a scalable code design and a new lower bound on the word error rate to\nasses the performance of the network code. The lower bound on the diversity\norder is only valid for JNCCs where the relays transform only two source\ncodewords.

The destination is required to\nreproduce all the source-vectors instantaneously and in a lossless manner,\nexcept those sequences that occur in an error propagation window of length B +\nW following the start of the erasure burst. We define the rate-recovery\nfunction R(B, W) - the minimum achievable compression rate per source sample in\nthis framework - and develop upper and lower bounds on this function. Our upper\nbound is obtained using a random binning technique, whereas our lower bound is\nobtained by drawing connections to multi-terminal source coding. Our upper and\nlower bounds coincide, yielding R(B, W), in some special cases. More generally,\nboth the upper and lower bounds equal the rate for predictive coding plus a\nterm that decreases as 1/(W+1), thus establishing a scaling behaviour of the\nrate-recovery function. For a special class of semi-deterministic Markov\nsources we propose a new optimal coding scheme: prospicient coding. An\nextension of this coding technique to Gaussian sources is also developed. For\nthe class of symmetric Markov sources and memoryless encoders, we establish the\noptimality of random binning. When the destination is required to reproduce\neach source sequence with a fixed delay and when W = 0 we also establish the\noptimality of binning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2012 18:30:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Etezadi", "Farrokh", ""], ["Khisti", "Ashish", ""], ["Trott", "Mitchell", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.5302", "submitter": "Nicolas Friot", "authors": "Jacques M.

This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space\nof entropic vectors and for designing network codes.
