Moreover, HCS recovery can accelerate the\nsubsequent 1-bit CS dequantizer.

Using the structural\nproperties of the Latin Squares for a given set of parameters, the problem of\nfinding all the required maps is reduced to finding a small set of maps for\n$M-$PSK constellations. This is achieved using the notions of isotopic and\ntransposed Latin Squares.

This\nsuggests that the back-door criterion can be thought of as a causal analog of\nstatistical sufficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Oct 2011 15:15:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Raginsky", "Maxim", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0748", "submitter": "Peng Zhong", "authors": "Peng Zhong and Mai Vu", "title": "Compress-Forward without Wyner-Ziv Binning for the One-Way and Two-Way\n  Relay Channels", "comments": "Appeared at Allerton conference Sept 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the role of Wyner-Ziv binning in compress-forward for relay\nchannels.

It achieves the same rate as the original compress-forward\nscheme with binning and successive decoding. Therefore, binning helps reduce\ndecoding complexity by allowing successive decoding, but has no impact on\nachievable rate for the one-way relay channel. On the other hand, no binning\nsimplifies relay operation. By extending compress-forward without binning to\nthe two-way relay channel, we can achieve a larger rate region than the\noriginal compress-forward scheme when the channel is asymmetric for the two\nusers. Binning and successive decoding limits the compression rate to match the\nweaker of the channels from relay to two users, whereas without binning, this\nrestriction no longer applies.

We\nutilize the conflict representation of the consumers in the Edgeworth box, a\ngraphical tool that depicts the allocation of the goods for the two consumers,\nto provide closed-form solution to all Pareto optimal outcomes. Afterwards, we\nmodel the situation between the links as a competitive market which\nadditionally defines prices for the goods. The equilibrium in this economy is\ncalled Walrasian and corresponds to the prices that equate the demand to the\nsupply of goods. We calculate the unique Walrasian equilibrium and propose a\ncoordination process that is realized by an arbitrator which distributes the\nWalrasian prices to the consumers. The consumers then calculate in a\ndecentralized manner their optimal demand corresponding to beamforming vectors\nthat achieve the Walrasian equilibrium. This outcome is Pareto optimal and\ndominates the noncooperative outcome of the systems. Thus, based on the game\ntheoretic model and solution concept, an algorithm for a distributed\nimplementation of the beamforming problem in multiple-input single-output\ninterference channels is provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2011 09:09:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2011 19:09:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 14:10:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mochaourab", "Rami", ""], ["Jorswieck", "Eduard A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2995", "submitter": "Antonio Campello", "authors": "Antonio Campello and Jo\\~ao Strapasson", "title": "On sequences of projections of the cubic lattice", "comments": "16 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Computational and Applied Mathematics, 32(1):57-69, 2013", "doi": "10.1007/s40314-013-0009-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CG cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study sequences of lattices which are, up to similarity,\nprojections of $\\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ onto a hyperplane $\\bm{v}^{\\perp}$, with\n$\\bm{v} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ and converge to a target lattice $\\Lambda$ which\nis equivalent to an integer lattice.

Such a priori\nknowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting\nrelay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in\nwhich case the interference received by the node now is actually self\ninformation. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have\noverheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another\nnode. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of\nthe interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this\npaper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC),\nto cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC\nconsists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the\ninterference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the\nsame between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however,\nthe signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal\nof interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical\nsecond steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of\nsmoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading\nscenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of\nreal-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with\nfast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading\nscenario.

This thesis extends upon the previously proposed discriminatory channel\nestimation (DCE) scheme that allows only the transmitter to send training\nsignals. The goal of DCE is to minimize the channel estimation error at LR\nwhile requiring the channel estimation error at UR to remain beyond a certain\nlevel. If the training signal is sent only by the transmitter, the performance\ndiscrimination between LR and UR will be limited since the training signals\nhelp both receivers perform estimates of their downlink channels. In this work,\nwe consider instead the two-way training methodology that allows both the\ntransmitter and LR to send training signals. In this case, the training signal\nsent by LR helps the transmitter obtain knowledge of the transmitter-to-LR\nchannel, but does not help UR estimate its downlink channel (i.e., the\ntransmitter-to-UR channel).

AC\nof nuclear spins was demonstrated experimentally, and may contribute to nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Several cooling algorithms were\nsuggested in recent years, including practicable algorithmic cooling (PAC) and\nexhaustive AC. Practicable algorithms have simple implementations, yet their\nlevel of cooling is far from optimal; Exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand,\ncool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of\ncooling, but they are not practicable. We introduce here semi-optimal\npracticable AC (SOPAC), wherein few cycles (typically 2-6) are performed at\neach recursive level. Two classes of SOPAC algorithms are proposed and\nanalyzed. Both attain cooling levels significantly better than PAC, and are\nmuch more efficient than the exhaustive algorithms. The new algorithms are\nshown to bridge the gap between PAC and exhaustive AC. In addition, we\ncalculated the number of spins required by SOPAC in order to purify qubits for\nquantum computation. As few as 12 and 7 spins are required (in an ideal\nscenario) to yield a mildly pure spin (60% polarized) from initial\npolarizations of 1% and 10%, respectively.

The novelty in\nour constructions is the use of the so called Wozencraft ensemble of linear\ncodes. Specifically, we obtain the following results.\n  We give an explicit construction of a two-write Write-Once-Memory (WOM for\nshort) code that approaches capacity, over the binary alphabet. More formally,\nfor every \\epsilon>0, 0<p<1 and n =(1/\\epsilon)^{O(1/p\\epsilon)} we give a\nconstruction of a two-write WOM code of length n and capacity\nH(p)+1-p-\\epsilon. Since the capacity of a two-write WOM code is max_p\n(H(p)+1-p), we get a code that is \\epsilon-close to capacity. Furthermore,\nencoding and decoding can be done in time O(n^2.poly(log n)) and time\nO(n.poly(log n)), respectively, and in logarithmic space.\n  We obtain a new encoding scheme for 3-write WOM codes over the binary\nalphabet. Our scheme achieves rate 1.809-\\epsilon, when the block length is\nexp(1/\\epsilon). This gives a better rate than what could be achieved using\nprevious techniques.\n  We highlight a connection to linear seeded extractors for bit-fixing sources.\nIn particular we show that obtaining such an extractor with seed length O(log\nn) can lead to improved parameters for 2-write WOM codes. We then give an\napplication of existing constructions of extractors to the problem of designing\nencoding schemes for memory with defects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2011 09:40:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shpilka", "Amir", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6591", "submitter": "Victor Shcherbacov Alexei", "authors": "Piroska Csorgo and Victor Shcherbacov", "title": "On some quasigroup cryptographical primitives", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.GR cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose modifications of known quasigroup based stream ciphers.

We show that the theoretical limit of SCSI can be achieved in the\nproposed list decoding based framework when the correlation between the source\nand side information is $q$-ary symmetric. We argue that, as opposed to channel\ncoding, the correct sequence from the list produced by the list decoder can\neffectively be recovered in case of SCSI with a few CRC symbols. The CRC\nsymbols, which allow the decoder to identify the correct sequence, incur\nnegligible overhead for large block lengths. More importantly, these CRC\nsymbols are not subject to noise since we are dealing with a virtual noisy\nchannel rather than a real noisy channel. Finally, we present a guideline for\ndesigning constructive SCSI schemes for non-binary and binary sources using\nReed Solomon codes and BCH codes, respectively.
