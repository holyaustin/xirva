Data shuffling is often\nconsidered as one of the most significant bottlenecks in such systems due to\nthe heavy communication load. Under a master-worker architecture (where a\nmaster has access to the entire dataset and only communication between the\nmaster and the workers is allowed) coding has been recently proved to\nconsiderably reduce the communication load. This work considers a different\ncommunication paradigm referred to as decentralized data shuffling, where\nworkers are allowed to communicate with one another via a shared link. The\ndecentralized data shuffling problem has two phases: workers communicate with\neach other during the data shuffling phase, and then workers update their\nstored content during the storage phase. The main challenge is to derive novel\nconverse bounds and achievable schemes for decentralized data shuffling by\nconsidering the asymmetry of the workers' storages (i.e., workers are\nconstrained to store different files in their storages based on the problem\nsetting), in order to characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. For\nthe case of uncoded storage (i.e., each worker directly stores a subset of bits\nof the dataset), this paper proposes converse and achievable bounds (based on\ndistributed interference alignment and distributed clique-covering strategies)\nthat are within a factor of 3/2 of one another.

In this paper we introduce a variant of the AMP algorithm that\ntakes into account glassy nature of the system under consideration.

We derive the state evolution for\nthe ASP algorithm and prove that it reproduces the one-step replica symmetry\nbreaking (1RSB) fixed-point equations, well-known in physics of disordered\nsystems. Our derivation thus gives a concrete algorithmic meaning to the 1RSB\nequations that is of independent interest. We characterize the performance of\nASP in terms of convergence and mean-squared error as a function of the free\nParisi parameter s. We conclude that when there is a model mismatch between the\ntrue generative model and the inference model, the performance of AMP rapidly\ndegrades both in terms of MSE and of convergence, while ASP converges in a\nlarger regime and can reach lower errors. Among other results, our analysis\nleads us to a striking hypothesis that whenever s (or other parameters) can be\nset in such a way that the Nishimori condition $M=Q>0$ is restored, then the\ncorresponding algorithm is able to reach mean-squared error as low as the\nBayes-optimal error obtained when the model and its parameters are known and\nexactly matched in the inference procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2018 17:28:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Antenucci", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Krzakala", "Florent", ""], ["Urbani", "Pierfrancesco", ""], ["Zdeborov\u00e1", "Lenka", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.01432", "submitter": "Youlong Cao", "authors": "Youlong Cao and Meixia Tao", "title": "Treating Content Delivery in Multi-Antenna Coded Caching as General\n  Message Sets Transmission: A DoF Region Perspective", "comments": "Part of this work was presented at IEEE GLOBECOM 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coded caching can create coded multicasting thus significantly accelerates\ncontent delivery in broadcast channels with receiver caches.

Both of them were derived via the maximum likelihood\n(ML) method. However, an implicit but fatal error was made obtaining the\nindividual DE (I-DE) approach. This letter comments on Onur et al. and points\nout the aforementioned error. By investigating the distance order statistics\n(DOS) distributions in the random networks, the correct I-DE approach is\npresented and discussed. Simulation results also show that the correct I-DE\noutperforms the wrong one. More importantly, a new method that can obtain any\nunivariate or multivariate DOS distribution is demonstrated, which is expected\nto be helpful for the study of the wireless communications and networking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2018 08:05:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Yongchang", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.02425", "submitter": "Ahmed Alkhateeb", "authors": "Cody Scarborough, Kiran Venugopal, Ahmed Alkhateeb, and Robert W.\n  Heath, Jr", "title": "Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Systems: Prototyping and Measurement\n  Results", "comments": "to appear in VTC 2018, Chicago, USA", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Demonstrating the feasibility of large antenna array beamforming is essential\nfor realizing mmWave communication systems.

In such systems, the ultimate goal of any request is to compute a\nsequence of functions in the network, where each function can be computed at\nonly a specific subset of network nodes. In conventional approaches, for each\nfunction, we choose one node from the corresponding subset of the nodes to\ncompute that function. In contrast, in this work, we allow each function to be\ncomputed in more than one node, redundantly in parallel, to respond to a given\nrequest. We argue that such redundancy in computation not only improves the\nreliability of the network, but would also, perhaps surprisingly, reduce the\noverall transmission delay. In particular, we establish that by judiciously\nchoosing the subset of nodes which compute each function, in conjunction with a\nlinear network coding scheme to deliver the result of each computation, we can\ncharacterize and achieve the optimal end-to-end transmission delay. In\naddition, we show that using such technique, we can significantly reduce the\ntransmission delay as compared to the conventional approach. In some scenarios,\nsuch reduction can even scale with the size of the network. More precisely, by\nincreasing the number of nodes that can compute the given function in parallel\nby a multiplicative factor, the end-to-end delay will also decrease by the same\nfactor. Moreover, we show that while finding the subset of nodes for each\ncomputation, in general, is a complex integer program, approximation algorithms\ncan be proposed to reduce the computational complexity.

While successful in the realm of linear inverse\nproblems, such $\\ell_1$ methods have encountered possibly fundamental\nlimitations, as no computationally efficient algorithm for phase retrieval of a\n$k$-sparse signal has been proven to succeed with fewer than $O(k^2\\log n)$\ngeneric measurements, exceeding the theoretical optimum of $O(k \\log n)$.

Then, a structure-aware optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal\npolicy of the CMDP is proposed and the impact of the wireless channel dynamics\nis studied while demonstrating that channels having a larger mean channel gain\nand less scattering can achieve better AoI performance. For the case of\nmultiple IoT devices, a low-complexity distributed suboptimal policy is\nproposed with the updating control at the destination and the sampling control\nat each device. Then, an online learning algorithm is developed to obtain this\npolicy, which can be implemented at each IoT device and requires only the local\nknowledge and small signaling from the destination. The proposed learning\nalgorithm is shown to converge almost surely to the suboptimal policy.\nSimulation results show the structural properties of the optimal policy for the\nsingle IoT device case; and show that the proposed policy for multiple IoT\ndevices outperforms a zero-wait baseline policy, with average AoI reductions\nreaching up to 33%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2018 21:21:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2019 14:14:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Bo", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.04384", "submitter": "Yunchou Xing", "authors": "Yunchou Xing, Ojas Kanhere, Shihao Ju, Theodore S.

With the aid of these two schemes, we deduce new theoretical\nequations for success probabilities and area spectral efficiencies (ASEs).\nConsidering a special case with practical path loss laws, several closed-form\nexpressions for coverage probabilities are derived to gain several insights.\nMonte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical conclusions. We\nshow that: 1) the proposed HetNet is an interference-limited system and it\noutperforms the traditional HetNets in terms of the success probability; 2)\nthere exists an optimal pre-decided rate threshold that contributes to the\nmaximum ASE; and 3) Max-Rate achieves higher success probability and ASE than\nMax-RP but it needs the extra information of the interference effect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2018 22:48:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Yi", "Wenqiang", ""], ["Liu", "Yuanwei", ""], ["Nallanathan", "Arumugam", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.04854", "submitter": "Hassan Mohammad Navazi Dr.", "authors": "Hassan M.

This approach radically differs from the conventional\nCommunication paradigm, which assumes transmitters are of two types: either\nthey have a common goal, or they act as opponent, e.g. jammer, eavesdropper.

Estimating\ninformation accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the\ndevelopment of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among\nvariables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such\nmethods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical\nproperties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and\ngenerally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.\nThis estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is\ntailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data\nindependently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be\nused both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a\nsingle framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and\ndiscrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various\nstatistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well\nagainst commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it\nallows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of\nthe marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains\naccurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the\nvariables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates\neven at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC\nestimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to\narbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and\nrobust performance when working with small sample sizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Jul 2018 20:17:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2018 20:56:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Safaai", "Houman", ""], ["Onken", "Arno", ""], ["Harvey", "Christopher D.", ""], ["Panzeri", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.08071", "submitter": "Trinh Van Chien", "authors": "Trinh Van Chien and Christopher Moll\\'en and Emil Bj\\\"ornson", "title": "Large-Scale-Fading Decoding in Cellular Massive MIMO Systems with\n  Spatially Correlated Channels", "comments": "17 pages; 10 figures; Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions\n  on Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2889090", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Massive multiple-input--multiple-output (MIMO) systems can suffer from\ncoherent intercell interference due to the phenomenon of pilot contamination.\nThis paper investigates a two-layer decoding method that mitigates both\ncoherent and non-coherent interference in multi-cell Massive MIMO.

In this paper, we consider that each node can only have a noisy\nnumerical observation of its local utility, of which the closed-form expression\nis not available. This assumption is quite realistic, especially when the\nsystem is too complicated or constantly changing. Nodes may exchange the\nobservation of their local utilities to estimate the global utility at each\ntimeslot. We propose stochastic perturbation based distributed algorithms under\nthe assumptions whether each node has collected local utilities of all or only\npart of the other nodes. We use tools from stochastic approximation to prove\nthat both algorithms converge to the optimum. The convergence rate of the\nalgorithms is also derived. Although the proposed algorithms can be applied to\ngeneral optimization problems, we perform simulations considering power control\nin wireless networks and present numerical results to corroborate our claim.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 06:27:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Wenjie", ""], ["Assaad", "Mohamad", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11250", "submitter": "Yuqing Du", "authors": "Yuqing Du and Kaibin Huang", "title": "Fast Analog Transmission for High-Mobility Wireless Data Acquisition in\n  Edge Learning", "comments": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By implementing machine learning at the network edge, edge learning trains\nmodels by leveraging rich data distributed at edge devices (e.g., smartphones\nand sensors) and in return endow on them capabilities of seeing, listening, and\nreasoning.

In this paper, we present a novel\nsolution, called fast analog transmission (FAT), for high- mobility data\nacquisition in edge-learning systems, which has several key features. First,\nFAT incurs low-latency.

Second, FAT supports\nspatial multiplexing by directly transmitting analog vector data over an\nantenna array. Third, FAT can be seamlessly integrated with edge learning\n(i.e., training of a classifier model in this work). In particular, by applying\na Grassmannian-classification algorithm from computer vision, the received GAE\nencoded data can be directly applied to training the model without decoding and\nconversion.

In MIMO radar, high resolution requires a large aperture\nand high number of antennas, increasing hardware and processing requirements.\n  Recently, novel approaches in sampling theory and radar signal processing\nhave been proposed to allow target detection and parameter recovery from\nsamples obtained below the Nyquist rate.
