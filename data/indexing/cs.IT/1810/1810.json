However, monotonic optimization is an\niterative algorithm and can often entail considerable computational complexity,\nmaking it not suitable for real-time applications. To address this, we propose\na learning-based approach that treats the input and output of a resource\nallocation algorithm as an unknown nonlinear mapping and a deep neural network\n(DNN) is employed to learn this mapping.

In this paper, we\nstudy this trade-off in a multicast network where the server is connected to\nusers with unequal cache sizes and the number of users is less than or equal to\nthe number of library files. We propose centralized uncoded placement and\nlinear delivery schemes which are optimized by solving a linear program.\nAdditionally, we derive a lower bound on the delivery memory trade-off with\nuncoded placement that accounts for the heterogeneity in cache sizes. We\nexplicitly characterize this trade-off for the case of three end-users, as well\nas an arbitrary number of end-users when the total memory size at the users is\nsmall, and when it is large. Next, we consider a system where the server is\nconnected to the users via rate limited links of different capacities and the\nserver assigns the users' cache sizes subject to a total cache budget. We\ncharacterize the optimal cache sizes that minimize the delivery completion time\nwith uncoded placement and linear delivery. In particular, the optimal memory\nallocation balances between assigning larger cache sizes to users with low\ncapacity links and uniform memory allocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2018 17:53:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2019 20:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ibrahim", "Abdelrahman M.", ""], ["Zewail", "Ahmed A.", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.08311", "submitter": "Thomas Ketseoglou", "authors": "Thomas Ketseoglou, Ender Ayanoglu", "title": "Zero-Forcing Per-Group Precoding (ZF-PGP) for Robust Optimized Downlink\n  Massive MIMO Performance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a new, combined Zero-Forcing Per-Group Precoding\n(ZF-PGP) method that achieves very high gains in comparison to ZF Precoding\ntechniques, while it simultaneously offers individually separate streams to\nreach individual User Equipment (UE), i.e., it obliterates the need for\ncoordinated, joint decoding by the group's UEs.

The other component of dynamics expresses the change in\nthe values of things, holding constant the frequency of things. The separation\nof frequency from value generalizes Shannon's separation of the frequency of\nsymbols from the meaning of symbols in information theory. The Price equation's\ngeneralized separation of frequency and value reveals a few simple invariances\nthat define universal geometric aspects of change.

Here, a\nnew constrained non-von-Neumann type inequality is proven, a step towards a\nconjectured unconstrained inequality by Linden and Winter. *IID quantum state\nmerging can be optimally achieved using the decoupling technique. The one-shot\nresults by Berta et al. and Anshu at al., however, had to bring in additional\nmathematical machinery. We introduce a natural generalized decoupling paradigm,\ncatalytic decoupling, that can reproduce the aforementioned results when used\nanalogously to the application of standard decoupling in the asymptotic case.\n*Port based teleportation, a variant of standard quantum teleportation\nprotocol, cannot be implemented perfectly. We prove several lower bounds on the\nnecessary number of output ports N to achieve port based teleportation for\ngiven error and input dimension, showing that N diverges uniformly in the\ndimension of the teleported quantum system, for vanishing error. As a\nbyproduct, a new lower bound for the size of the program register for an\napproximate universal programmable quantum processor is derived. *In the last\npart, we give a new definition for information-theoretic quantum\nnon-malleability, strengthening the previous definition by Ambainis et al.

As drive capacities continue\nto grow beyond the few terabytes range to address the demands of today's cloud,\nthe likelihood of having multiple/simultaneous disk failures become a reality.\nAmong the main factors causing catastrophic system failures, correlated disk\nfailures and the network bandwidth are reported to be the two common source of\nperformance degradation. The emerging trend is to use efficient/sophisticated\nerasure codes (EC) equipped with multiple parities and efficient repairs in\norder to meet the reliability/bandwidth requirements.

In\nparticular, there are emerging UAV applications such as aerial photograph and\ndata relaying that require high-speed communications between the UAVs and the\nground base stations (GBSs). Due to the high UAV altitude, the strong\nline-of-sight (LoS) links generally dominate the channels between the UAVs and\nGBSs, which brings both opportunities and challenges in the design of future\nwireless networks supporting both terrestrial and aerial users. Although each\nUAV can associate with more GBSs for communication as compared to terrestrial\nusers thanks to the LoS-dominant channels, it also causes/suffers more severe\ninterference to/from the terrestrial communications in the uplink/downlink.\nThis paper studies the uplink communication from a multi-antenna UAV to a set\nof GBSs within its signal coverage by considering a practical yet challenging\nscenario when the number of antennas at the UAV is smaller than that of\nco-channel GBSs. To achieve high-rate transmission yet avoid interfering with\nany of the existing terrestrial communications at the co-channel GBSs, we\npropose a novel multi-beam transmission strategy by exploiting the\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Specifically, the UAV sends\neach data stream to a selected subset of the GBSs, which can decode the UAV's\nsignals and then cancel them before decoding the messages of their served\nterrestrial users, and in the meanwhile nulls its interference at the other\nGBSs via zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming.

The optimal\nprivacy-preserving policy is proved to be a piecewise constant function in the\nform of a quantization operator applied on the output of the submitted query.\nThe measure of privacy is also used to analyze the performance of $k$-anonymity\nmethodology (a popular deterministic mechanism for privacy-preserving release\nof datasets using suppression and generalization techniques), proving that it\nis in fact not privacy-preserving.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Oct 2018 00:42:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2018 23:00:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2018 22:44:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2019 01:56:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Farokhi", "Farhad", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.11244", "submitter": "Chengwen  Xing", "authors": "Chengwen Xing, Shuai Wang, Sheng Chen, Shaodan Ma, H.

Furthermore, they play a role in quantum thermodynamics. In this\nthesis the set of quantum entropies of multipartite quantum systems is studied.\nThe problem of its characterization is not new -- however, progress has been\nsparse, indicating that the problem might be hard and that new methods might be\nneeded.

I\ndescribe the symmetries of this cone and highlight geometric similarities and\ndifferences to the classical entropy cone.\n  In a different approach, I utilize the local geometric properties of extremal\nrays of a cone. I show that quantum states whose entropy lies on such an\nextremal ray of the quantum entropy cone have a very simple structure.\n  As the set of all quantum states is very complicated, I look at a simple\nsubset called stabilizer states.
