It is shown, via a\ncounter-example, that the common folklore of applying symmetric threshold\npolicy, which is well known to be optimal (for unimodal state densities) in the\nclassical two-channel remote estimation problem, can be suboptimal for the\nsetting considered. Next, in order to make the problem tractable, a side\nchannel which signals the sign of the underlying state is considered. It is\nshown that, under some technical assumptions, threshold-in-threshold\ncommunication scheduling is optimal for this setting.

Second, efficient hybrid analog/digital\ncodebooks are developed for spatial multiplexing in wideband mmWave systems.\nFinally, a low-complexity yet near-optimal greedy frequency selective hybrid\nprecoding algorithm is proposed based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.\nSimulation results show that the developed hybrid codebooks and precoder\ndesigns achieve very good performance compared with the unconstrained solutions\nwhile requiring much less complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 14:23:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 06:24:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2016 18:32:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 17:24:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alkhateeb", "Ahmed", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1510.00649", "submitter": "MM Aftab Hossain", "authors": "M.

To fill\nthe gap between the performance of the existing approaches, in this work, we\nestablish a new scheme in which, at the receiver's side, it utilizes an\nextension of the compute-and-forward decoding strategy and at the transmitters'\nside it exploits lattice alignment, cooperative jamming, and i.i.d. random\ncodes. For the proposed scheme, we derive a new achievable bound on sum secure\nrate which scales with log(SNR) and hence it outperforms the i.i.d. Gaussian\ncodes in moderate and high SNR regimes. We evaluate the performance of our\nscheme, both theoretically and numerically. Furthermore, we show that our sum\nsecure rate achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom in the\ninfinite-SNR regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 17:48:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Babaheidarian", "Parisa", ""], ["Salimi", "Somayeh", ""], ["Papadimitratos", "Panos", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.01288", "submitter": "Erik Str\\\"om", "authors": "Erik G.

The first, termed the full-IA,\navoids all intra-cell interference (ICI) and other-cell interference by finding\nthe perfect interference-nulling receive beamforming matrices (RxBFMs). The\nsecond protocol, termed partial-IA, only attempts to null the ICI.

Our result clarifies the\nfact that the $\\ell_0$-based method greatly outperforms the $\\ell_1$-based one.\nSecond, we examine the practical performances of two well-known algorithms,\northogonal matching pursuit and approximate message passing, when they are used\nto execute the $\\ell_0$- and $\\ell_1$-based methods, respectively. Our\nexamination shows that orthogonal matching pursuit achieves a much better\nperformance than the exact execution of the $\\ell_1$-based method, as well as\napproximate message passing. However, regarding the $\\ell_0$-based method,\nthere is still room to design more effective greedy algorithms than orthogonal\nmatching pursuit. Finally, we evaluate the performances of the algorithms when\nthey are applied to image data compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 03:09:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 09:32:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Nakanishi-Ohno", "Yoshinori", ""], ["Obuchi", "Tomoyuki", ""], ["Okada", "Masato", ""], ["Kabashima", "Yoshiyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02190", "submitter": "Victoria Kostina", "authors": "Victoria Kostina", "title": "Data compression with low distortion and finite blocklength", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers lossy source coding of $n$-dimensional memoryless\nsources and shows an explicit approximation to the minimum source coding rate\nrequired to sustain the probability of exceeding distortion $d$ no greater than\n$\\epsilon$, which is simpler than known dispersion-based approximations.\n  Our approach takes inspiration in the celebrated classical result stating\nthat the Shannon lower bound to rate-distortion function becomes tight in the\nlimit $d \\to 0$.

Specifically,\nthe MTs first cache in their local memories in off-peak hours and then exchange\nthe requested files with each other in the vicinity during peak hours. However,\nprior works largely overlook MTs' heterogeneity in file preferences and their\nselfish behaviours. In this paper, we practically categorize the MTs into\ndifferent interest groups according to the MTs' preferences. Each group of MTs\naims to increase the probability of successful file discovery from the\nneighbouring MTs (from the same or different groups). Hence, we define the\ngroups' utilities as the probability of successfully discovering the file in\nthe neighbouring MTs, which should be maximized by deciding the caching\nstrategies of different groups. By modelling MTs' mobilities as homogeneous\nPoisson point processes (HPPPs), we analytically characterize MTs' utilities in\nclosed-form. We first consider the fully cooperative case where a centralizer\nhelps all groups to make caching decisions. We formulate the problem as a\nweighted-sum utility maximization problem, through which the maximum utility\ntrade-offs of different groups are characterized.

Recently,\nKarimi and Banihashemi proposed a characterization of ETSs, which was based on\nviewing an ETS as a layered superset (LSS) of a short cycle in the code's\nTanner graph. A notable advantage of LSS characterization is that it\ncorresponds to a simple LSS-based search algorithm that starts from short\ncycles of the graph and finds the ETSs with LSS structure efficiently. Compared\nto the LSS-based characterization of Karimi and Banihashemi, which is based on\na single LSS expansion technique, the new characterization involves two\nadditional expansion techniques. The introduction of the new techniques\nmitigates two problems that LSS-based characterization/search suffers from: (1)\nexhaustiveness, (2) search efficiency. We prove that using the three expansion\ntechniques, any ETS structure can be obtained starting from a simple cycle, no\nmatter how large the size of the structure $a$ or the number of its unsatisfied\ncheck nodes $b$ are. We also demonstrate that for the proposed\ncharacterization/search to exhaustively cover all the ETS structures within the\n$(a,b)$ classes with $a \\leq a_{max}, b \\leq b_{max}$, for any value of\n$a_{max}$ and $b_{max}$, the length of the short cycles required to be\nenumerated is less than that of the LSS-based characterization/search. We also\nprove that the three expansion techniques, proposed here, are the only\nexpansions needed for characterization of ETS structures starting from simple\ncycles in the graph, if one requires each and every intermediate sub-structure\nto be an ETS as well.

This shift creates the opportunity to cache part of the content in\nmemories closer to the end users, for example in base stations. Most of the\nprior literature focuses on the reduction of load in the backhaul and core\nnetworks due to caching, i.e., on the benefits caching offers for the wireline\ncommunication link between the origin server and the caches. In this paper, we\nare instead interested in the benefits caching can offer for the wireless\ncommunication link between the caches and the end users.\n  To quantify the gains of caching for this wireless link, we consider an\ninterference channel in which each transmitter is equipped with an isolated\ncache memory. Communication takes place in two phases, a content placement\nphase followed by a content delivery phase. The objective is to design both the\nplacement and the delivery phases to maximize the rate in the delivery phase in\nresponse to any possible user demands. Focusing on the three-user case, we show\nthat through careful joint design of these phases, we can reap three distinct\nbenefits from caching: a load balancing gain, an interference cancellation\ngain, and an interference alignment gain. In our proposed scheme, load\nbalancing is achieved through a specific file splitting and placement,\nproducing a particular pattern of content overlap at the caches. This overlap\nallows to implement interference cancellation. Further, it allows us to create\nseveral virtual transmitters, each transmitting a part of the requested\ncontent, which increases interference-alignment possibilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 03:22:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 16:14:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Maddah-Ali", "Mohammad Ali", ""], ["Niesen", "Urs", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.06141", "submitter": "Ertugrul Basar", "authors": "Ertugrul Basar", "title": "Multiple-Input Multiple-Output OFDM with Index Modulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 22, no. 12, pp. 2259-2263,\n  2015", "doi": "10.1109/LSP.2015.2475361", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is\na novel multicarrier transmission technique which has been proposed as an\nalternative to classical OFDM.

Polar codes can be efficiently decoded by\nthe low-complexity successive cancelation (SC) algorithm and the SC list (SCL)\ndecoding algorithm. The belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm not only is\nan alternative to the SC and SCL decoders, but also provides soft outputs that\nare necessary for joint detection and decoding. Both the BP decoder and the\nsoft cancelation (SCAN) decoder were proposed for polar codes to output soft\ninformation about the coded bits. In this paper, first a belief propagation\ndecoding algorithm, called reduced complexity soft cancelation (RCSC) decoding\nalgorithm, is proposed. Let $N$ denote the block length. Our RCSC decoding\nalgorithm needs to store only $5N-3$ log-likelihood ratios (LLRs),\nsignificantly less than $4N-2+\\frac{N\\log_2N}{2}$ and $N(\\log_2N+1)$ LLRs\nneeded by the BP and SCAN decoders, respectively, when $N\\geqslant 64$.\nBesides, compared to the SCAN decoding algorithm, our RCSC decoding algorithm\neliminates unnecessary additions over the real field.

In this scheme, a reduced-rank framework\nis employed for linear receive processing and multiuser interference\nsuppression based on the minimization of the symbol-error-rate (SER) cost\nfunction. We present a structure with multiple processing branches that\nperforms a dimensionality reduction, where each branch contains a group of\njointly optimized preprocessing and decimation units, followed by a linear\nreceive filter. We then develop stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms to compute\nthe parameters of the preprocessing and receive filters, along with a\nlow-complexity decimation technique for both binary phase shift keying (BPSK)\nand $M$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols. In addition, an\nautomatic parameter selection scheme is proposed to further improve the\nconvergence performance of the proposed reduced-rank algorithms.

Based on this condition, we derive the expression of\nthe minimum sum-rate for CO and show that this expression is consistent with\nthe results in multivariate mutual information (MMI) and coded cooperative data\nexchange (CCDE). We prove that the coalition game model is convex if the\nsum-rate is no less than the minimal value. In this case, the core is non-empty\nand a rate vector in the core that allocates the sum-rate among the users in a\nfair manner can be found by calculating the Shapley value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 02:19:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Ni", ""], ["Chan", "Chung", ""], ["Liu", "Tie", ""], ["Kennedy", "Rodney A.", ""], ["Sadeghi", "Parastoo", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08954", "submitter": "James P.

This\nmulti-way network is a suitable model for 3-user device-to-device\ncommunications. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the capacity\nregion of the underlying Gaussian 3-way channel (3WC) within a constant gap. To\nthis end, a capacity outer bound is derived using cut-set bounds and\ngenie-aided bounds. For achievability, the 3WC is first transformed into an\nequivalent star-channel. This latter is then decomposed into a set of\n`successive' sub-channels, leading to a sub-channel allocation problem. Using\nbackward decoding, interference neutralization, and known results on the\ncapacity of the star-channel relying of physical-layer network coding, an\nachievable rate region for the 3WC is obtained. It is then shown that the\nachievable rate region is within a constant gap of the developed outer bound,\nleading to the desired capacity approximation. Interestingly, in contrast to\nthe Gaussian two-way channel (TWC), adaptation is necessary in the 3WC.\nFurthermore, message splitting is another ingredient of the developed scheme\nfor the 3WC which is not required in the TWC. The two setups are, however,\nsimilar in terms of their sum-capacity pre-log which is equal to 2. Finally,\nsome interesting networks and their approximate capacities are recovered as\nspecial cases of the 3WC, such as the cooperative BC and MAC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 11:03:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 17:09:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chaaban", "Anas", ""], ["Maier", "Henning", ""], ["Sezgin", "Aydin", ""], ["Mathar", "Rudolf", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09091", "submitter": "Jafar Mohammadi", "authors": "Igor Bjelakovic, Jafar Mohammadi and S{\\l}awomir Sta\\'nczak", "title": "Strong Secrecy and Stealth for Broadcast Channels with Confidential\n  Messages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a discrete memoryless broadcast channel consists of two users and\na sender.

In next-generation heterogeneous networks where\nultra-dense small-cell base stations are deployed,\nsimultaneous-wireless-information-and-power-transfer (SWIPT) is feasible over\nshort ranges. One challenge for designing a WPC system is the severe near-far\nproblem where a user attempts to decode an information-transfer (IT) signal in\nthe presence of extremely strong SWIPT signals. Jointly quantizing the mixed\nsignals causes the IT signal to be completely corrupted by quantization noise\nand thus the SWIPT signals have to be suppressed in the analog domain. This\nmotivates the design of a framework in this paper for analog spatial\ncancellation in a multi-antenna WPC system. In the framework, an analog circuit\nconsisting of simple phase shifters and adders, is adapted to cancel the SWIPT\nsignals by multiplying it with a cancellation matrix having unit-modulus\nelements and full rank, where the full rank retains the spatial-multiplexing\ngain of the IT channel. The unit-modulus constraints render the conventional\nzero-forcing method unsuitable. Therefore, the paper presents a novel\nsystematic approach for constructing cancellation matrices. For the\nsingle-SWIPT-interferer case, the matrices are obtained as truncated\nFourier/Hadamard matrices after compensating for propagation phase shifts over\nthe SWIPT channel. For the more challenging multiple-SWIPT-interferer case, it\nis proposed that each row of the cancellation matrix is constructed as a\nKronecker-product of component vectors, with each component vectors designed to\nnull the signal from a corresponding SWIPT interferer similarly as in the\npreceding case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:28:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 06:52:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 18:07:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Guangxu", ""], ["Huang", "Kaibin", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09219", "submitter": "Jiaming Xu", "authors": "Bruce Hajek and Yihong Wu and Jiaming Xu", "title": "Submatrix localization via message passing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.SI math.IT math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The principal submatrix localization problem deals with recovering a $K\\times\nK$ principal submatrix of elevated mean $\\mu$ in a large $n\\times n$ symmetric\nmatrix subject to additive standard Gaussian noise.
