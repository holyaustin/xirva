In the\nproposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other\nneighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all\nthe nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a\nmessage followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then\nprovides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each\nnode.\n  We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double\nZ-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each\ncase, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading\nto three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed\ndecisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve\nthe same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective\nof the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double\nZ-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node\ninformation is below a threshold. Third, using reduced parametrization $K$-user\nchannel, we show that very few protocol rounds are needed for the case of very\nweak or very strong interference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2009 09:40:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""], ["Liu", "Youjian", ""], ["Sabharwal", "Ashutosh", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.3509", "submitter": "Mohammad Hossein Yassaee", "authors": "Mohammad Hossein Yassaee, Mohammad Reza Aref", "title": "Slepian-Wolf Coding Over Cooperative Relay Networks", "comments": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, accepted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2011.2143990", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with the problem of multicasting a set of discrete\nmemoryless correlated sources (DMCS) over a cooperative relay network.\nNecessary conditions with cut-set interpretation are presented.

The complexity associated with a richly scattering\nenvironment implies that the short-term fading process is inherently hard to\npredict and best modeled stochastically, with rapid decorrelation properties in\nspace, time and frequency. In this paper, we demonstrate how the channel state\nbetween a wireless transmitter and receiver can be used as the basis for\nbuilding practical secret key generation protocols between two entities. We\nbegin by presenting a scheme based on level crossings of the fading process,\nwhich is well-suited for the Rayleigh and Rician fading models associated with\na richly scattering environment. Our level crossing algorithm is simple, and\nincorporates a self-authenticating mechanism to prevent adversarial\nmanipulation of message exchanges during the protocol. Since the level crossing\nalgorithm is best suited for fading processes that exhibit symmetry in their\nunderlying distribution, we present a second and more powerful approach that is\nsuited for more general channel state distributions. This second approach is\nmotivated by observations from quantizing jointly Gaussian processes, but\nexploits empirical measurements to set quantization boundaries and a heuristic\nlog likelihood ratio estimate to achieve an improved secret key generation\nrate.

The\nlower bound on the MSE is derived for the joint estimation of the vector of\nunknown parameters, consisting of the target location and the mismatch of the\nallegedly known system parameters, i.e., phase offsets at the radars.\nSynchronization errors are modeled as being random and Gaussian. A closed-form\nexpression for the hybrid CRB is derived for the case of orthogonal\nwaveforms.The bound on the target localization MSE is expressed as the sum of\ntwo terms - the first represents the CRB with no phase mismatch, and the second\ncaptures the mismatch effect. The latter is shown to depend on the phase error\nvariance, the number of mismatched transmitting and receiving sensors and the\nsystem geometry. For a given phase synchronization error variance, this\nexpression offers the means to analyze the achievable localization accuracy.\nAlternatively, for a predetermined localization MSE target value, the derived\nexpression may be used to determine the necessary phase synchronization level\nin the distributed system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2009 02:31:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Godrich", "Hana", ""], ["Haimovich", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Poor", "H.

In\nparticular, Alice observes an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nsource X and wishes to transmit this source losslessly to Bob over a\nrate-limited link. A helper (Helen), observes an i.i.d. correlated source Y and\ncan transmit information to Bob over a separate rate-limited link. A passive\neavesdropper (Eve) can observe the coded output of Alice, i.e., the link from\nAlice to Bob is public. The uncertainty about the source X at Eve, is measured\nby the conditional entropy of the source given the coded output of Alice. We\ncompletely characterize the rate-equivocation region for this secure source\ncoding model, where we show that Slepian-Wolf binning of X with respect to the\ncoded side information received at Bob is optimal. We next consider a\nmodification of this model in which Alice also has access to the coded output\nof Helen. For the two-sided helper model, we characterize the rate-equivocation\nregion. While the availability of side information at Alice does not reduce the\nrate of transmission from Alice, it significantly enhances the resulting\nequivocation at Eve. In particular, the resulting equivocation for the\ntwo-sided helper case is shown to be min(H(X),R_y), i.e., one bit from the\ntwo-sided helper provides one bit of uncertainty at Eve. From this result, we\ninfer that Slepian-Wolf binning of X is suboptimal and one can further decrease\nthe information leakage to the eavesdropper by utilizing the side information\nat Alice. We finally generalize these results to the case in which there is\nadditional un-coded side information W available at Bob and characterize the\nrate-equivocation regions under the assumption that Y-X-W forms a Markov chain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 00:35:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 00:07:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 01:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tandon", "Ravi", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""], ["Ramchandran", "Kannan", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.5904", "submitter": "Bernhard G.

This motivates a carefully\nchosen list of desired properties for upper and lower redundancies. The means\nto achieve these properties is to consider the maximum and minimum of a\nredundancy function, which is interesting in itself. The redundancy function is\ndefined on the sphere of the Hilbert space and measures the concentration of\nframe vectors around each point. A complete characterization of functions on\nthe sphere which coincide with a redundancy function for some frame is given.\nThe upper and lower redundancies obtained from this function are shown to\nsatisfy all of the intuitively desirable properties.
