Another typical feature of such\nproblems is that the signals are not only sparse in some dictionary, but\npossess a so-called local sparsity in levels structure.

The goal is to realize\ntimely delivery of fresh data over time, which is assessed by an\nage-of-information (AoI) metric. Channel coding is used to combat the channel\nerrors, and feedback is sent to acknowledge updates' reception. In case\ndecoding is unsuccessful, a hybrid ARQ protocol is employed, in which\nincremental redundancy (IR) bits are transmitted to enhance the decoding\nability. This continues for some amount of time in case decoding remains\nunsuccessful, after which a new (fresh) status update is transmitted instead.\nIn case decoding is successful, the transmitter has the option to idly wait for\na certain amount of time before sending a new update. A general problem is\nformulated that optimizes the codeword and IR lengths for each update, and the\nwaiting times, such that the long term average AoI is minimized. Stationary\ndeterministic policies are investigated, in which the codeword and IR lengths\nare fixed for each update, and the waiting time is a deterministic function of\nthe AoI. The optimal waiting policy is then derived, and is shown to have a\nthreshold structure, in which the transmitter sends a new update only if the\nAoI grows above a certain threshold that is a function of the codeword and IR\nlengths.

Similar to belief\npropagation, the estimation of the previous (segment of) packet can serve as\nthe prior knowledge for the next (segment of) packet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2019 18:27:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Mingda", "", "Eugene"], ["Feng", "Zhe", "", "Eugene"], ["Huang", "Xinming", "", "Eugene"], ["Youjian", "", "", "Eugene"], ["Liu", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.03901", "submitter": "Ayush Bhandari", "authors": "Ayush Bhandari, Felix Krahmer and Ramesh Raskar", "title": "On Unlimited Sampling and Reconstruction", "comments": "Accepted to IEEE Trans. on Sig.

That said,\npractical realization of this theorem still suffers from a severe bottleneck\ndue to the fundamental assumption that the samples can span an arbitrary range\nof amplitudes. In practice, the theorem is realized using so-called\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which clip or saturate whenever the signal\namplitude exceeds the maximum recordable ADC voltage thus leading to a\nsignificant information loss. In this paper, we develop an alternative paradigm\nfor sensing and recovery, called the Unlimited Sampling Framework. It is based\non the observation that when a signal is mapped to an appropriate bounded\ninterval via a modulo operation before entering the ADC, the saturation problem\nno longer exists, but one rather encounters a different type of information\nloss due to the modulo operation. Such an alternative setup can be implemented,\nfor example, via so-called folding or self-reset ADCs, as they have been\nproposed in various contexts in the circuit design literature. The key task\nthat we need to accomplish in order to cope with this new type of information\nloss is to recover a bandlimited signal from its modulo samples. In this paper\nwe derive conditions when perfect recovery is possible and complement them with\na stable recovery algorithm. The sampling density required to guarantee\nrecovery is independent of the maximum recordable ADC voltage and depends on\nthe signal bandwidth only. Our recovery guarantees extend to measurements\naffected by bounded noise, which includes the case of round-off quantization.\nNumerical experiments validate our approach. Applications of the unlimited\nsampling paradigm can be found in a number of fields such as signal processing,\ncommunication and imaging.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2019 00:48:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 20:17:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bhandari", "Ayush", ""], ["Krahmer", "Felix", ""], ["Raskar", "Ramesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.03913", "submitter": "Yanting Ma", "authors": "Yanting Ma, Cynthia Rush, Dror Baron", "title": "Analysis of Approximate Message Passing with Non-Separable Denoisers and\n  Markov Random Field Priors", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Approximate message passing (AMP) is a class of low-complexity, scalable\nalgorithms for solving high-dimensional linear regression tasks where one\nwishes to recover an unknown signal from noisy, linear measurements.

One way of improving spectral efficiency is to\nshare the spectrum amongst different coexisting networks and serve multiple\ndevices simultaneously. Spectrum sharing mechanisms for coexistence of a\nlicensed network, such as LTE, with an unlicensed network, such as Wi-Fi, are\nbeing considered in the recent literature and standardizations. In order to\nenable the coexistence between licensed and unlicensed users, it is necessary\nto include interference mitigation techniques to protect the licensed primary\nusers (PUs) from harmful interference. Typical interference mitigation\nmechanisms are based on spectrum sensing and cognitive radio (CR), wherein\nunlicensed secondary users (SUs) observe the spectrum and utilize it when\nlicensed PUs are inactive. Thus, the SUs utilize empty time-slots in the shared\nspectrum to avoid the interference. The spectral efficiency can be further\nimproved if the SUs are allowed to transmit concurrently with PUs by exploiting\nthe spatial dimension provided by multiple antenna techniques. The underlay CR\nparadigm allows such coexistence where SUs transmit its signal in the same\ntime-slots as PUs by exploiting the spatial and frequency resources in the\nnetwork. In order to exploit the spatial dimension, SUs can utilize the\nlocation coordinates of PUs to steer its signal away from PUs to mitigate the\ninterference. The SU transmitter can also employ multiple antenna techniques to\nserve a large number of devices. Further, the SUs can utilize frequency bands\noccupied by PUs by dynamically selecting the frequency band that provides the\nhighest rate.

Matsumoto,\narXiv:1010.1030 (2010)]. The key constituents of this resource theory are\nquantum boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum states, which can be manipulated\nfor free by means of an arbitrary quantum channel. We introduce bits of\nasymmetric distinguishability as the basic currency in this resource theory,\nand we prove that it is a reversible resource theory in the asymptotic limit,\nwith the quantum relative entropy being the fundamental rate of resource\ninterconversion. The distillable distinguishability is the optimal rate at\nwhich a quantum box consisting of independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) states can be converted to bits of asymmetric distinguishability, and\nthe distinguishability cost is the optimal rate for the reverse transformation.\nBoth of these quantities are equal to the quantum relative entropy. The exact\none-shot distillable distinguishability is equal to the min-relative entropy,\nand the exact one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the max-relative\nentropy. Generalizing these results, the approximate one-shot distillable\ndistinguishability is equal to the smooth min-relative entropy, and the\napproximate one-shot distinguishability cost is equal to the smooth\nmax-relative entropy. As a notable application of the former results, we prove\nthat the optimal rate of asymptotic conversion from a pair of i.i.d. quantum\nstates to another pair of i.i.d. quantum states is fully characterized by the\nratio of their quantum relative entropies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2019 06:30:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2019 01:18:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:21:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11741", "submitter": "Yigit Ugur", "authors": "Yigit Ugur, George Arvanitakis, Abdellatif Zaidi", "title": "Variational Information Bottleneck for Unsupervised Clustering: Deep\n  Gaussian Mixture Embedding", "comments": "accepted for publication in Entropy, Special Issue on Information\n  Theory for Data Communications and Processing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/e22020213", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop an unsupervised generative clustering framework\nthat combines the Variational Information Bottleneck and the Gaussian Mixture\nModel.

For this purpose, we derive general formulas for\nthe upper limit of error probability and reliability functions without assuming\na specific information theoretical structure. These general formulas are\napplicable to various fields other than source coding problems, because they\nhave been proved without assuming any particular information theoretical\nstructure. We prove some theorems under the condition that the coding system is\nsubadditive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2019 10:31:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Iriyama", "Kiminori", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.12394", "submitter": "Xiaopeng Mo", "authors": "Xiaopeng Mo, Yuwei Huang and Jie Xu", "title": "Radio-Map-Based Robust Positioning Optimization for UAV-Enabled Wireless\n  Power Transfer", "comments": "submiited for possible publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This letter studies an unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled wireless power\ntransfer system within a radio-map-based robust positioning design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 02:47:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mo", "Xiaopeng", ""], ["Huang", "Yuwei", ""], ["Xu", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.12424", "submitter": "Vahid Jamali", "authors": "Marzieh Najafi, Hedieh Ajam, Vahid Jamali, Panagiotis D.\n  Diamantoulakis, George K.

Two unique characteristics make UAV-based FSO systems\nsignificantly different from conventional FSO systems with static transceivers.\nFirst, for UAV-based FSO systems, the incident laser beam is not always\northogonal to the receiver lens plane. Second, both position and orientation of\nthe UAV fluctuate over time due to dynamic wind load, inherent random air\nfluctuations in the atmosphere around the UAV, and internal vibrations of the\nUAV. On the contrary, for conventional FSO systems, the laser beam is always\nperpendicular to the receiver lens plane and the relative movement of the\ntransceivers is limited. In this paper, we develop a novel channel model for\nUAV-based FSO systems by quantifying the corresponding geometric and\nmisalignment losses (GML), while taking into account the non-orthogonality of\nthe laser beam and the random fluctuations of the position and orientation of\nthe UAV. In particular, for diverse weather conditions, we propose different\nfluctuation models for the position and orientation of the UAV and derive\ncorresponding statistical models for the GML. We further analyze the\nperformance of a UAV-based FSO link in terms of outage probability and ergodic\nrate and simplify the resulting analytical expressions for the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

First, it optimizes the compressive channel sensing vectors based\non the surrounding environment in an unsupervised manner to focus the sensing\npower on the most promising spatial directions. This is enabled by a novel\nneural network architecture that accounts for the constraints on the RF chains\nand models the transmitter/receiver measurement matrices as two complex-valued\nconvolutional layers. Second, the proposed model learns how to construct the RF\nbeamforming vectors of the hybrid architectures directly from the projected\nchannel vector (the received sensing vector). The auto-precoder neural network\nthat incorporates both the channel sensing and beam prediction is trained\nend-to-end as a multi-task classification problem. Thanks to this design\nmethodology that leverages the prior channel observations and the implicit\nawareness about the surrounding environment/user distributions, the proposed\napproach significantly reduces the training overhead compared to classical\n(non-machine learning) solutions. For example, for a system of 64 transmit and\n64 receive antennas, with 3 RF chains at both sides, the proposed solution\nneeds only 8 or 16 channel training pilots to directly predict the RF\nbeamforming/combining vectors of the hybrid architectures and achieve\nnear-optimal achievable rates. This highlights a promising solution for the\nchannel estimation and hybrid precoding design problem in mmWave and massive\nMIMO systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2019 17:54:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Xiaofeng", ""], ["Alkhateeb", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.13340", "submitter": "Hsin-Po Wang", "authors": "Hsin-Po Wang and Iwan Duursma", "title": "Log-logarithmic Time Pruned Polar Coding", "comments": "13 pages, 13 figures; we extend arXiv:1812.08106 and remove \"BEC\"\n  from title", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2020.3041523", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A pruned variant of polar coding is proposed for binary erasure channels.

Two different\nconfigurations are considered: First, an infinite-capacity backhaul enables\nnodes to communicate in a lossless way, thereby obtaining the solution by\ncentralized computations. Second, a practical finite-capacity backhaul leads to\nthe deployment of distributed solvers equipped along with quantizers for\ncommunication through capacity-limited backhaul. The distributed nature and the\nnonconvexity of the optimizations render the identification of the solution\nunwieldy.

In consequence,\nthe original problems are transformed to training tasks of the DNNs subject to\nnon-convex constraints where existing DL libraries fail to extend\nstraightforwardly.
