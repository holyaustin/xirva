However, it has recently been shown that perfect feedback does allow\ngreat improvements in the asymptotic tradeoff between end-to-end delay and\nprobability of error, even for symmetric channels at high rate. Since gains are\nclaimed with ideal instantaneous feedback, it is natural to wonder whether\nthese improvements remain if the feedback is unreliable or otherwise limited.\n  Here, packet-erasure channels are considered on both the forward and feedback\nlinks. First, the feedback channel is considered as a given and a strategy is\ngiven to balance forward and feedback error correction in the suitable\ninformation-theoretic limit of long end-to-end delays. At high enough rates,\nperfect-feedback performance is asymptotically attainable despite having only\nunreliable feedback! Second, the results are interpreted in the zero- sum case\nof \"half-duplex\" nodes where the allocation of bandwidth or time to the\nfeedback channel comes at the direct expense of the forward channel.

Upper bounds are derived on\nthe reliability functions with delay when side-information is known only to the\ndecoder as well as when it is also known at the encoder.\n  When the encoder is not ignorant of the side-information (including the\ntrivial case when there is no side-information), it is possible to have\nsubstantially better tradeoffs between delay and probability of error at all\nrates.

This setup has attracted significant attention and\nseveral relaying protocols have been reported in the literature.

To achieve consensus,\ndither (small noise) is added to the sensor states before quantization. When\nthe quantizer range is unbounded (countable number of quantizer levels),\nstochastic approximation shows that consensus is asymptotically achieved with\nprobability one and in mean square to a finite random variable. We show that\nthe meansquared error (m.s.e.) can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the link\nweight sequence, at a cost of the convergence rate of the algorithm.

This requires characterization of the statistical properties of the\nsupremum taken over the sample paths of the state of the quantizer. This is\naccomplished by splitting the state vector of the quantizer in two components:\none along the consensus subspace and the other along the subspace orthogonal to\nthe consensus subspace. The proofs use maximal inequalities for submartingale\nand supermartingale sequences.

MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop,\nrelay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack\nof a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of\nmany types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and\ncommunity mesh networks.

First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of\nunbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions\nhave not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal\ndynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must\nintegrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and\nfeedback.

Schwartz and\nVardy conjectured that the stopping redundancy of an MDS code should only\ndepend on its length and minimum distance.\n  We define the (n,t)-single-exclusion number, S(n,t) as the smallest number of\nt-subsets of an n-set, such that for each i-subset of the n-set, i=1,...,t+1,\nthere exists a t-subset that contains all but one element of the i-subset. New\nupper bounds on the single-exclusion number are obtained via probabilistic\nmethods, recurrent inequalities, as well as explicit constructions. The new\nbounds are used to better understand the stopping redundancy of MDS codes. In\nparticular, it is shown that for [n,k=n-d+1,d] MDS codes, as n goes to\ninfinity, the stopping redundancy is asymptotic to S(n,d-2), if d=o(\\sqrt{n}),\nor if k=o(\\sqrt{n}) and k goes to infinity, thus giving partial confirmation of\nthe Schwartz-Vardy conjecture in the asymptotic sense.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2007 00:53:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Junsheng", ""], ["Siegel", "Paul H.", ""], ["Roth", "Ron M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2870", "submitter": "Hari Palaiyanur", "authors": "Hari Palaiyanur, Cheng Chang and Anant Sahai", "title": "The source coding game with a cheating switcher", "comments": "27 pages, 11 figures.

By exploiting these results,\nnovel upper and lower bounds for $\\emph{Q}_{M,N}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}_{M,N}$ are\nproposed. Furthermore, specific tight upper and lower bounds for\n$\\emph{Q}_{M}$, previously reported in the literature, are extended for real\nvalues of M. The offered theoretical results can be efficiently applied in the\nstudy of digital communications over fading channels, in the\ninformation-theoretic analysis of multiple-input multiple-output systems and in\nthe description of stochastic processes in probability theory, among others.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2007 05:54:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2009 22:20:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 15:39:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 16 Jul 2009 23:59:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 24 Jan 2010 00:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kapinas", "Vasilios M.", ""], ["Mihos", "Sotirios K.", ""], ["Karagiannidis", "George K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4115", "submitter": "Salah Aly A", "authors": "Salah A.

Several good LDPC codes have been constructed\nusing random, algebraic, and finite geometries approaches, with containing\ncycles of length at least six in their Tanner graphs. However, it is impossible\nto design a self-orthogonal parity check matrix of an LDPC code without\nintroducing cycles of length four.\n  In this paper, a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on lines and points of\nfinite geometries is constructed. The parity check matrices of these codes are\nadapted to be self-orthogonal with containing only one cycle of length four.\nAlso, the column and row weights, and bounds on the minimum distance of these\ncodes are given. As a consequence, the encoding and decoding algorithms of\nthese codes as well as their performance over various quantum depolarizing\nchannels will be investigated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2007 19:35:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2007 23:25:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2009 20:58:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4135", "submitter": "Xiaojun Tang", "authors": "Xiaojun Tang, Ruoheng Liu, Predrag Spasojevic, H.

The\nhybrid automatic retransmission request (HARQ) protocol is revisited for a\nblock-fading wire-tap channel, in which two legitimate users communicate over a\nblock-fading channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper who intercepts\nthe transmissions through an independent block-fading channel. In this model,\nthe transmitter obtains a 1-bit ACK/NACK feedback from the legitimate receiver\nvia an error-free public channel. Both reliability and confidentiality of\nsecure HARQ protocols are studied by the joint consideration of channel coding,\nsecrecy coding, and retransmission protocols. In particular, the error and\nsecrecy performance of repetition time diversity (RTD) and incremental\nredundancy (INR) protocols are investigated based on good Wyner code sequences,\nwhich ensure that the confidential message is decoded successfully by the\nlegitimate receiver and is kept in total ignorance by the eavesdropper for a\ngiven set of channel realizations. This paper first illustrates that there\nexists a good rate-compatible Wyner code family which ensures a secure INR\nprotocol. Next, two types of outage probabilities, connection outage and\nsecrecy outage probabilities are defined in order to characterize the tradeoff\nbetween the reliability of the legitimate communication link and the\nconfidentiality with respect to the eavesdropper's link. For a given\nconnection/secrecy outage probability pair, an achievable throughput of secure\nHARQ protocols is derived for block-fading channels. Finally, both asymptotic\nanalysis and numerical computations demonstrate the benefits of HARQ protocols\nto throughput and secrecy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2007 17:50:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Liu", "Ruoheng", ""], ["Spasojevic", "Predrag", ""], ["Poor", "H.
