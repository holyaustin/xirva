Under an erasure channel model which\naccounts for interference and allows for multipacket reception, we first\ncharacterize the Shannon capacity region. We then consider a queueing-theoretic\nformulation and characterize the stable throughput region for two different\ntransmission policies: a retransmission policy and random linear coding. Our\nresults indicate that for large blocklengths, the random linear coding policy\nprovides a higher stable throughput than the retransmission policy.\nFurthermore, our results provide an example of a transmission policy for which\nthe Shannon capacity region strictly outer bounds the stable throughput region,\nwhich contradicts an unproven conjecture that the Shannon capacity and stable\nthroughput coincide for random access systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2007 21:20:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Sep 2007 00:24:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shrader", "Brooke", ""], ["Ephremides", "Anthony", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3099", "submitter": "Chris Ng", "authors": "Chris T.

The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the\nchannel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The\nexpected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power\namong the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when\npower is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends\nonly on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is\nallocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex\nconstraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.\nIn the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion\nis given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of\nthe density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses\nper source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes\nexpected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.\nWhile expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter\n(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading\npaths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from\nCSIT, especially when b is large.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 May 2007 07:07:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2009 10:27:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Ng", "Chris T.

Thus,\ntechniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also\nthat number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of\nthese techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD\nanalyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users\nis constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of\nusers entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly\npessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and\ndetection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one\nmay impair performance.\n  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem\nof identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a\nrandom-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the\nsystem.
