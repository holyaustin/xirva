Unlike standard codes\nwhich are designed for a specific type of channel, our most general universal\ncode makes communication resilient on every channel, provided the noise level\nis below the tolerated bound, where the noise level t of a channel is the\nlogarithm of its ambiguity (the maximum number of strings that can be distorted\ninto a given one). The other more restricted universal codes still work for\nlarge classes of natural channels. In a universal code, encoding is\nchannel-independent, but the decoding function knows the type of channel. We\nallow the encoding and the decoding functions to share randomness, which is\nunavailable to the channel. There are two scenarios for the type of attack that\na channel can perform. In the oblivious scenario, codewords belong to an\nadditive group and the channel distorts a codeword by adding a vector from a\nfixed set. The selection is based on the message and the encoding function, but\nnot on the codeword. In the Hamming scenario, the channel knows the codeword\nand is fully adversarial. For a universal code, there are two parameters of\ninterest: the rate, which is the ratio between the message length k and the\ncodeword length n, and the number of shared random bits. We show the existence\nin both scenarios of universal codes with rate 1-t/n - o(1), which is optimal\nmodulo the o(1) term. The number of shared random bits is O(log n) in the\noblivious scenario, and O(n) in the Hamming scenario, which, for typical values\nof the noise level, we show to be optimal, modulo the constant hidden in the\nO() notation.

Hence, a strategy for\n(near-term) robust QM that is easily adaptable to future QEC-based QM is\ndesirable.

If $C$ is any code concatenated with inner\nrepetition codes of length linear in $n$, a quantum advantage in QM is\npossible. Hence, given any CSS code of constant length, concatenation with\nrepetition codes of length linear in $n$ is asymptotically optimal for QM with\na constant number of erasure errors.

Their secrecy rate (bit generation rate)\ndepends heavily on the randomness of the channel, which may reduce\nsignificantly in a stable environment. Existing methods seek to improve the\nsecrecy rate by injecting artificial noise into the channel. Unfortunately,\nnoise injection cannot alter the underlying channel state, which depends on the\nmultipath environment between the transmitter and receiver.

The combined result is a communication channel stable in the eyes of\nthe intended receiver but randomly changing from the viewpoint of the\neavesdropper.

By applying this theory\nto neural-network estimators, we show that if a neural network family satisfies\none of several strengthened versions of the universal approximation property\nthen the corresponding R\\'enyi divergence estimator is consistent. In contrast\nto density-estimator based methods, our estimators involve only expectations\nunder $Q$ and $P$ and hence are more effective in high dimensional systems. We\nillustrate this via several numerical examples of neural network estimation in\nsystems of up to 5000 dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 22:34:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2020 15:51:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Apr 2021 13:07:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:12:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Birrell", "Jeremiah", ""], ["Dupuis", "Paul", ""], ["Katsoulakis", "Markos A.", ""], ["Rey-Bellet", "Luc", ""], ["Wang", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.03827", "submitter": "Md.

Specifically, the BS is able to\nadaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink transmission to\noptimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of\nInformation (AoI) metric. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only serve one client\nwithin each time slot and should decide which client to serve; if the BS\nchooses NOMA, it can serve more than one client at the same time and needs to\ndecide the power allocated to the served clients.

We then show by way of a counter-example that\nthe loss estimation approach fails in the general case. Finally, we show that\nfor the binary symmetric channel, combining the loss estimation with a\nrandomization step leads to a solution to the stated problem under no\nrestrictions on the given denoisers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jul 2020 04:19:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ordentlich", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.05923", "submitter": "Can Xiang", "authors": "Can Xiang, Chunming Tang and Cunsheng Ding", "title": "Shortened linear codes from APN and PN functions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Linear codes generated by component functions of perfect nonlinear (PN) and\nalmost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions and the first-order Reed-Muller codes\nhave been an object of intensive study in coding theory.

To generate high-quality text, popular decoding algorithms\nlike top-k, top-p (nucleus), and temperature-based sampling truncate or distort\nthe unreliable low probability tail of the language model.

We use this analysis to design a feedback-based adaptive\ntop-k text decoding algorithm called mirostat that generates text (of any\nlength) with a predetermined value of perplexity, and thereby high-quality text\nwithout any tuning. Experiments show that for low values of k and p in top-k\nand top-p sampling, perplexity drops significantly with generated text length,\nwhich is also correlated with excessive repetitions in the text (the boredom\ntrap). On the other hand, for large values of k and p, we find that perplexity\nincreases with generated text length, which is correlated with incoherence in\nthe text (confusion trap). Mirostat avoids both traps: experiments show that\ncross-entropy has a near-linear relation with repetition in generated text.\nThis relation is almost independent of the sampling method but slightly\ndependent on the model used.

We empirically\ndemonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as\nsignificant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about $64\\%$ of the\nevents of significant increase of cases in 37 studied countries, our method can\ndetect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the\nevents, buying considerably long time for making responses.
