A\nprominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by\nElhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency\nmatrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the\nother data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the\ndimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC\nquickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-OMP obtained by\nreplacing the Lasso by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm\nresults in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding\ncomparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical\nperformance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce\nand analyze the SSC-MP algorithm, which employs matching pursuit (MP) in lieu\nof OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces\nintersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The\nclustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for\nSSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to\nHeckel and B\\\"olcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results\nindicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion\nautomatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data.\nMoreover, experiments on synthetic and on real data show that SSC-MP compares\nvery favorably to SSC, SSC-OMP, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor\nalgorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time.

Alternative\nmethods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main\ndrawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix\nand 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix.\nTo overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $k$, $n$\nand $m$ grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then\nused to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are\ncommonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select\nproperly $k$ measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error\nmeasures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists\nin applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure.\nThe second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look\nfor a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The\ngreedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error\nmeasures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions.

Typically this requires to compute the\nreliability of all the $N$ synthetic channels and then to include those that\nare sufficiently reliable. However, we know from [1], [2] that there is a\npartial order among the synthetic channels. Hence, it is natural to ask whether\nwe can exploit it to reduce the computational burden of the construction\nproblem.\n  We show that, if we take advantage of the partial order [1], [2], we can\nconstruct a polar code by computing the reliability of roughly a fraction\n$1/\\log^{3/2} N$ of the synthetic channels. In particular, we prove that\n$N/\\log^{3/2} N$ is a lower bound on the number of synthetic channels to be\nconsidered and such a bound is tight up to a multiplicative factor $\\log\\log\nN$. This set of roughly $N/\\log^{3/2} N$ synthetic channels is universal, in\nthe sense that it allows one to construct polar codes for any $W$, and it can\nbe identified by solving a maximum matching problem on a bipartite graph.\n  Our proof technique consists of reducing the construction problem to the\nproblem of computing the maximum cardinality of an antichain for a suitable\npartially ordered set.

In general, the optimal strategies for content placement in\nHCNs remain largely unknown and deriving them forms the theme of this paper. To\nthis end, we adopt the popular random HCN model where $K$ tiers of BSs are\nmodelled as independent Poisson point processes distributed in the plane with\ndifferent densities. Further, the random caching scheme is considered where\neach of a given set of $M$ files with corresponding popularity measures is\nplaced at each BS of a particular tier with a corresponding probability, called\nplacement probability. The probabilities are identical for all BSs in the same\ntier but vary over tiers, giving the name tier-level content placement. We\nconsider the network performance metric, hit probability, defined as the\nprobability that a file requested by the typical user is delivered successfully\nto the user. We maximize the hit probability over content placement\nprobabilities, which yields the optimal tier-level placement policies. For the\ncase of uniform received signal-to-interference thresholds for successful\ntransmissions for BSs in different tiers, the policy is in closed-form where\nthe placement probability for a particular file is proportional to the\nsquare-root of the corresponding popularity measure with an offset depending on\nBS caching capacities.

Moreover, we also provide\nextensions of our results to the scenarios where the atoms in the transform has\nvarying incoherence parameters and the unknown signal exhibits a structured\nsparsity pattern. In particular, for the partial Fourier recovery of sparse\nsignals over a circulant transform, our main results suggest a uniformly random\nsampling. Numerical results demonstrate that the variable density random\nsampling by our main results provides superior recovery performance over known\nsampling strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 19:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 15:35:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Kiryung", ""], ["Li", "Yanjun", ""], ["Jin", "Kyong Hwan", ""], ["Ye", "Jong Chul", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09592", "submitter": "Erik Hoel", "authors": "Erik P Hoel", "title": "When the map is better than the territory", "comments": "15 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/e19050188", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.AI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The causal structure of any system can be analyzed at a multitude of spatial\nand temporal scales. It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro)\ndescriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a\ncompressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However,\nrecent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that\nthe causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more\ninformative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a\nsystem (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the\nsystem (the territory). This has been called causal emergence. While causal\nemergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the\nphenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of\nthe channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity,\nand that different causal models of those systems take advantage of that\ncapacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale causal models\nuse the full causal capacity. Such macroscale causal models can either be\ncoarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous)\nin various ways, which can improve the model's efficacy and its informativeness\nvia the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take\nadvantage of an information channel's capacity. As model choice increase, the\ncausal capacity of a system approaches the channel capacity. Ultimately, this\nprovides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some\nsystems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscopic model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 20:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hoel", "Erik P", ""]]}]
