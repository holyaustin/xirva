The\nfeasibility of their dense deployments depends on the existence of a high\ndata-rate transport network that can provide high-data backhaul from an\naggregation node where data traffic originates and terminates, to every such\nsmall cell. Due to the limited range of radio signals in the high frequency\nbands, multihop wireless connection may need to be established between each\naccess node and an aggregation node. In this paper, we present a novel\ntransmission scheme for wireless multihop backhaul for 5G networks. The scheme\nconsists of 1) {\\em group successive relaying} that established a relay\nschedule to efficiently exploit half-duplex relays and 2) an optimized\nquantize-map-and-forward (QMF) coding scheme that improves the performance of\nQMF and reduces the decoding complexity and the delay. We derive an achievable\nrate region of the proposed scheme and attain a closed-form expression in the\nasymptotic case for several network models of interests. It is shown that the\nproposed scheme provides a significant gain over multihop routing (based on\ndecode-and-forward), which is a solution currently proposed for wireless\nmultihop backhaul network. Furthermore, the performance gap increases as a\nnetwork becomes denser. For the proposed scheme, we then develop\nenergy-efficient routing that determines {\\em groups} of participating relays\nfor every hop. To reflect the metric used in the routing algorithm, we refer to\nit as {\\em interference-harnessing} routing. By turning interference into a\nuseful signal, each relay requires a lower transmission power to achieve a\ndesired performance compared to other routing schemes.

However, it is difficult to implement such transmit\nbeamforming in a distributed fashion in practice since perfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) need to be made available at all distributed transmitters,\nrequiring tremendous overhead to feed back CSI from the receiver to all\ndistributed transmitters.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that belongs to the category of\ndeterministic phase adjustment algorithm: the Deterministic Differential Search\nAlgorithm (DDSA), where the differences between the measured received signal\nstrength (RSS) are utilized judiciously to help us predict the deterministic\nphase adjustment done at distributed transmitters. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate rapid convergence to a pre-determined threshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2015 08:00:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Po-Chun", ""], ["Li", "Pei-Rong", ""], ["Wei", "Li-Ming", ""], ["Chen", "Chang-Lin", ""], ["Lin", "Che", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.00860", "submitter": "M\\=aris Ozols", "authors": "Maris Ozols", "title": "How to combine three quantum states", "comments": "26 pages, 4 figures, 1 table. v2: small corrections throughout + the\n  four-bar linkage", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP math.RT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We devise a ternary operation for combining three quantum states: it consists\nof permuting the input systems in a continuous fashion and then discarding all\nbut one of them.

In this way, different function\nsplitting scheme could be incorporated into the radio access network to satisfy\nthe bandwidth and latency requirements of ultra-dense networks, control/data\n(C/D) decoupling architectures, and delay-sensitive communications. At the same\ntime, massive cooperation and device-centric networking could be effectively\nenabled with point-to-multi-point FH transportation. We analyze three unique\ndesign requirements for the renovated FH, including the ability to handle\nvarious payload traffic, support different logical topology, and provide\ndifferentiated latency guarantee. Following this analysis, we propose a\nreference architecture for designing the renovated FH.

To address this\nproblem, we visualize the 3-D RF fingerprint data as a function of locations\n(x-y) and indices of access points (fingerprint), as a tensor and use tensor\nalgebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In\nparticular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we\ncapture the complexity of the fingerprint space as a low-dimensional\ntensor-column space. In this formulation the proposed scheme exploits\nadaptivity to identify reference points which are highly informative for\nlearning this low-dimensional space. Further, under certain incoherency\nconditions we prove that the proposed scheme achieves bounded recovery error\nand near-optimal sampling complexity. In contrast to several existing work that\nrely on random sampling, this paper shows that adaptivity in sampling can lead\nto significant improvements in localization accuracy. The approach is validated\non both data generated by the ray-tracing indoor model which accounts for the\nfloor plan and the impact of walls and the real world data. Simulation results\nshow that, while maintaining the same localization accuracy of existing\napproaches, the amount of samples can be cut down by 71% for the high SNR case\nand 55% for the low SNR case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 16:57:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 22:43:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Xiao-Yang", ""], ["Aeron", "Shuchin", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""], ["Wang", "Xiaodong", ""], ["Wu", "Min-You", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02341", "submitter": "Arian Shoari", "authors": "Arian Shoari", "title": "On the Definition and Existence of an MVU Estimator for Target Location\n  Estimation", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of target localization with ideal binary detectors is considered\nin one dimensional space.

In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive\nsensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L\nrandomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The\nweight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called\nmeasurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution\nfunction. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for\nthe AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is\nanalyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is\nformulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of\nmeasurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show\nthat in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-n log(1-k/n)),\nwhere n is the signal length and k is the signal sparsity level. We then\nconsider the signal reconstruction of AFCS in the presence of additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) and the standard message passing decoder is then used for\nthe signal recovery. Simulation results show that the AFCS can perfectly\nrecover all non-zero elements of the sparse binary signal with a significantly\nreduced number of measurements, compared to the conventional binary CS and\nL1-minimization approaches in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs).\nFinally, we show a practical application of the AFCS for the sparse event\ndetection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the sensors' readings can\nbe treated as measurements from the CS point of view.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2015 01:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Shirvanimoghaddam", "Mahyar", ""], ["Li", "Yonghui", ""], ["Vucetic", "Branka", ""], ["Yuan", "Jinhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.03415", "submitter": "Guangkui Xu", "authors": "Guangkui Xu and Xiwang Cao", "title": "Several classes of bent, near-bent and 2-plateaued functions over finite\n  fields of odd characteristic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Inspired by a recent work of Mesnager, we present several new infinite\nfamilies of quadratic ternary bent, near-bent and 2-plateaued functions from\nsome known quadratic ternary bent functions.

Such a CSI knowledge setting brings\nabout a formulation based on the theory of Team Decisions, whereby the TXs aim\nat optimizing a common objective given the same constraint set, on the basis of\nindividual channel information. Consequently, a novel set of applicable\nprecoding schemes is proposed. Relying on statistical coordination criteria,\nthe two TXs cooperate in the lack of any instantaneous CSI exchange. We verify\nby simulations that our novel coordinated precoding scheme outperforms the\nstandard underlay CR approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 12:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Filippou", "Miltiades C.", ""], ["de Kerret", "Paul", ""], ["Gesbert", "David", ""], ["Ratnarajah", "Tharmalingam", ""], ["Pastore", "Adriano", ""], ["Ropokis", "George A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.04359", "submitter": "Alireza Vahid", "authors": "Alireza Vahid, Ilan Shomorony, Robert Calderbank", "title": "Informational Bottlenecks in Two-Unicast Wireless Networks with Delayed\n  CSIT", "comments": "In proceedings of the 53rd Annual Allerton Conference on\n  Communication, Control, and Computing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the impact of delayed channel state information at the transmitters\n(CSIT) in two-unicast wireless networks with a layered topology and arbitrary\nconnectivity.

An even harder\nproblem is to find characterizations of families of cyclic codes in terms of\ntheir weight distributions. On the other hand, it is also well known that\ncyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding\ntheory and cryptography. In particular, cyclic codes having three nonzero\nweights have been studied by several authors, however, most of these efforts\nfocused on cyclic codes over a prime field. In this work we present a\ncharacterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3\nover any finite field. The codes under this characterization are, indeed,\noptimal in the sense that their lengths reach the Griesmer lower bound for\nlinear codes. Consequently, these codes reach, simultaneously, the best\npossible coding capacity, and also the best possible capabilities of error\ndetection and correction for linear codes. But because they are cyclic in\nnature, they also possess a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a\nvariety of ways, particularly, in the design of very efficient coding and\ndecoding algorithms. What is also worth pointing out, is the simplicity of the\nnecessary and sufficient numerical conditions that characterize our class of\noptimal three-weight cyclic codes. As we already pointed out, it is a hard\nproblem to find this kind of characterizations. However, for this particular\ncase the fundamental tool that allowed us to find our characterization was the\ncharacterization for all two-weight irreducible cyclic codes that was\nintroduced by B. Schmidt and C. White (2002). Lastly, another feature about the\ncodes in this class, is that their duals seem to have always the same\nparameters as the best known linear codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 19:29:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Vega", "Gerardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05084", "submitter": "Kaya Tutuncuoglu", "authors": "Kaya Tutuncuoglu and Aylin Yener", "title": "Energy Harvesting Networks with Energy Cooperation: Procrastinating\n  Policies", "comments": "Accepted for publication, IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers multiterminal networks with energy harvesting\ntransmitter nodes that are also capable of wirelessly transferring energy to or\nreceiving energy from other nodes in the network.

In particular, STAC takes\nadvantage of the superposition nature of electromagnetic (EM) waves, and allows\nmultiple transmitters to transmit in the same time slot with appropriately\nchosen parameters, such that the received superimposed signal can be directly\ntransformed to the needed summation at the receiver. Exploiting the static\nchannel environment and compact space in DCN, we propose an enhanced Software\nDefined Network (SDN) architecture to enable STAC, where wired connections are\nestablished to provide the wireless transceivers external reference signals.\nTheoretical analysis and simulation show that with STAC used, both the\nbandwidth and energy efficiencies can be improved severalfold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 02:31:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shengli", ""], ["Wu", "Xiugang", ""], ["Ozgur", "Ayfer", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05977", "submitter": "Kenza Guenda", "authors": "K.
