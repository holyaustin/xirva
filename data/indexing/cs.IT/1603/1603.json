It is of paramount\nimportance that the required resources, such as energy and bandwidth, do not\nscale with traffic. While the aggregate network traffic is growing at an\nunprecedented rate, users tend to request the same popular contents at\ndifferent time instants. Therefore, caching the most popular contents at the\nnetwork edge is a promising solution to reduce the traffic and the energy\nconsumption over the backhaul links. In this paper, two scenarios are\nconsidered, where caching is performed either at a small base station, or\ndirectly at the user terminals, which communicate using \\ac{D2D}\ncommunications. In both scenarios, joint design of the transmission and caching\npolicies is studied when the user demands are known in advance. This joint\ndesign offers two different caching gains, namely, the \\textit{pre-downloading}\nand \\textit{local caching gains}. It is shown that the finite cache capacity\nlimits the attainable gains, and creates an inherent tradeoff between the two\ntypes of gains. In this context, a continuous time optimization problem is\nformulated to determine the optimal transmission and caching policies that\nminimize a generic cost function, such as energy, bandwidth, or throughput. The\njointly optimal solution is obtained by demonstrating that caching files at a\nconstant rate is optimal, which allows to reformulate the problem as a\nfinite-dimensional convex program.

Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the task\nservice times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by the\nslowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is to\nreplicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task to\nfinish early. The delay performance of replications depends heavily on the\nscheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, and\nwhich job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize these\nscheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling of\nreplications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems.\nLow-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to be\ndelay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal and\nnon-preemptive policies. These theoretical results are established for general\nsystem settings and delay metrics that allow for arbitrary arrival processes,\narbitrary job sizes, arbitrary due times, and heterogeneous servers with data\nlocality constraints.

These techniques,\nalong with algebraic properties of the proposed lattices, are then used to\nconstruct a sub-optimal de-coupled coding schemes that achieves a gap to\ncompound capacity by decoding in a lattice that does not depend of the channel\nrealization. The gap is characterized in terms of algebraic invariants of the\ncodes, and shown to be significantly smaller than previous schemes in the\nliterature. We also exhibit alternative algebraic constructions that achieve\nthe capacity of ergodic fading channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 16:19:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:23:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Campello", "Antonio", ""], ["Ling", "Cong", ""], ["Belfiore", "Jean-Claude", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09301", "submitter": "Pedro A.

In a UD-CRAN,\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless fronthaul is preferred for information\nexchange between the central processor and the distributed remote radio heads\n(RRHs), due to its lower cost and higher flexibility in deployment, compared to\nfixed optical links. This motivates our study in this paper on the downlink\ntransmission in a mmWave fronthaul enabled, orthogonal frequency division\nmultiple access (OFDMA) based UD-CRAN. In particular, the fronthaul is shared\namong the RRHs via time division multiple access (TDMA), while the RRHs jointly\ntransmit to the users on orthogonal frequency subchannels using OFDMA. The\njoint resource allocation over the TDMA-based mmWave fronthaul and OFDMA-based\nwireless transmission is investigated to maximize the weighted sum rate of all\nusers. Although the problem is non-convex, we propose a Lagrange duality based\nsolution, which can be efficiently computed with good accuracy.

We propose an\ninformation-theoretic model where a charger can dynamically decide on how much\npower to transfer to the transmitter based on its side information regarding\nthe communication, while the transmitter needs to dynamically adapt its coding\nstrategy to its instantaneous energy state, which in turn depends on the\nactions previously taken by the charger. We characterize the capacity as an\n$n$-letter mutual information rate under various levels of side information\navailable at the charger. When the charger is finely tunable to different\nenergy levels, referred to as a \"precision charger\", we show that these\nexpressions reduce to single-letter form and there is a simple and intuitive\njoint charging and coding scheme achieving capacity. The precision charger\nscenario is motivated by the observation that in practice the transferred\nenergy can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude of the beamformed\nsignal. When the charger does not have sufficient precision, for example when\nit is restricted to use a few discrete energy levels, we show that the\ncomputation of the $n$-letter capacity can be cast as a Markov decision process\nif the channel is noiseless. This allows us to numerically compute the capacity\nfor specific cases and obtain insights on the corresponding optimal policy, or\neven to obtain closed form analytical solutions by solving the corresponding\nBellman equations, as we demonstrate through examples.
