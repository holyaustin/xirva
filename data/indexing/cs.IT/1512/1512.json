In our approach, we interpret the Viterbi algorithm as a repeated\ncomputation of matrix-vector $(\\max, +)$-multiplications. On time-homogeneous\nHMMs, this computation is online: a matrix, known in advance, has to be\nmultiplied with several vectors revealed one at a time. Our main contribution\nis an algorithm solving this version of matrix-vector $(\\max,+)$-multiplication\nin subquadratic time, by performing a polynomial preprocessing of the matrix.\nEmploying this fast multiplication algorithm, we solve the MAPD problem in\n$O(mn^2/ \\log n)$ time for any time-homogeneous HMM of size $n$ and observation\nsequence of length $m$, with an extra polynomial preprocessing cost negligible\nfor $m > n$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for the\nMAPD problem requiring subquadratic time per observation, under the only\nassumption -- usually verified in practice -- that the transition probability\nmatrix does not change with time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 22:38:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 10:40:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Cairo", "Massimo", ""], ["Farina", "Gabriele", ""], ["Rizzi", "Romeo", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.00115", "submitter": "Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan", "authors": "Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Saeid Haghighatshoar, Martin Vetterli", "title": "Unlabeled Sensing with Random Linear Measurements", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Nov 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of solving a linear sensing system when the observations\nare unlabeled. Specifically we seek a solution to a linear system of equations\ny = Ax when the order of the observations in the vector y is unknown. Focusing\non the setting in which A is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we show that\nif the sensing matrix A admits an oversampling ratio of 2 or higher, then with\nprobability 1 it is possible to recover x exactly without the knowledge of the\norder of the observations in y. Furthermore, if x is of dimension K, then any\n2K entries of y are sufficient to recover x. This result implies the existence\nof deterministic unlabeled sensing matrices with an oversampling factor of 2\nthat admit perfect reconstruction. The result is universal in that recovery is\nguaranteed for all possible choices of x. While the proof is constructive, it\nuses a combinatorial algorithm which is not practical, leaving the question of\ncomplexity open. We also analyze a noisy version of the problem and show that\nlocal stability is guaranteed by the solution. In particular, for every x, the\nrecovery error tends to zero as the signal-to-noise-ratio tends to infinity.\nThe question of universal stability is unclear. We also obtain a converse of\nthe result in the noiseless case: If the number of observations in y is less\nthan 2K, then with probability 1, universal recovery fails, i.e., with\nprobability 1, there exists distinct choices of x which lead to the same\nunordered list of observations in y. In terms of applications, the unlabeled\nsensing problem is related to data association problems encountered in\ndifferent domains including robotics where it is appears in a method called\n\"simultaneous localization and mapping\" (SLAM), multi-target tracking\napplications, and in sampling signals in the presence of jitter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 01:32:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Unnikrishnan", "Jayakrishnan", ""], ["Haghighatshoar", "Saeid", ""], ["Vetterli", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.00135", "submitter": "Jiange Li", "authors": "Emmanuel Abbe, Jiange Li, Mokshay Madiman", "title": "Entropies of weighted sums in cyclic groups and an application to polar\n  codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Entropy, 19(9), 235, 2017", "doi": "10.3390/e19090235", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this note, the following basic question is explored: in a cyclic group,\nhow are the Shannon entropies of the sum and difference of i.i.d. random\nvariables related to each other?

We present two frameworks in\nwhich the idea of innovation pursuit is used to distinguish the subspaces.\nUnderlying the first framework is an iterative method that finds the subspaces\nconsecutively by solving a series of simple linear optimization problems, each\nsearching for a direction of innovation in the span of the data potentially\northogonal to all subspaces except for the one to be identified in one step of\nthe algorithm. A detailed mathematical analysis is provided establishing\nsufficient conditions for iPursuit to correctly cluster the data. The proposed\napproach can provably yield exact clustering even when the subspaces have\nsignificant intersections. It is shown that the complexity of the iterative\napproach scales only linearly in the number of data points and subspaces, and\nquadratically in the dimension of the subspaces. The second framework\nintegrates iPursuit with spectral clustering to yield a new variant of\nspectral-clustering-based algorithms. The numerical simulations with both real\nand synthetic data demonstrate that iPursuit can often outperform the\nstate-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms, more so for subspaces with\nsignificant intersections, and that it significantly improves the\nstate-of-the-art result for subspace-segmentation-based face clustering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 23:52:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 05:26:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 17 May 2017 23:12:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 03:29:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 26 Nov 2017 15:24:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Rahmani", "Mostafa", ""], ["Atia", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01017", "submitter": "Erwin Riegler", "authors": "David Stotz, Erwin Riegler, Eirikur Agustsson, Helmut B\\\"olcskei", "title": "Almost lossless analog signal separation and probabilistic uncertainty\n  relations", "comments": "to appear in IEEE Trans. on Inf.

The accuracy of\nthe recovery results is related to the additive input noise. Simple derivation\nof this relation is presented. If a reconstruction algorithm for a sparse\nsignal is used in the reconstruction of a nonsparse signal then the noise due\nto missing samples will remain and behave as an additive input noise. An exact\nrelation for the mean square error of this error is derived for the partial DFT\nmatrix case in this paper and presented in form of a theorem. It takes into\naccount very important fact that if all samples are available then the error\nwill be zero, for both sparse and nonsparse recovered signals. Theory is\nillustrated and checked on statistical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 18:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Stankovic", "Ljubisa", ""], ["Stankovic", "Isidora", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01839", "submitter": "Merc\\`e Villanueva", "authors": "Roland D.

It is also known that, if the first\nsample of the impulse response of G has unit-magnitude, then this integral\nequals the sum of the logarithm of the magnitudes of the non-minimum phase\nzeros of G, say B(G).

Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser\ninterference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as\nopposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited\nregime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and\non proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet,\nthese regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design,\nwith the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance.

We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision\nprobability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under\nslotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a\nnon-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an\ninterference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density\nand size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and\ntransmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of\nadaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based\nand contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free\nphase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the\ncontention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of\ninterference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks.

The multicast\nnetworks considered in this paper have one source with $h$ messages, and the\nvector solution is over a field of size $q$ with vectors of length~$t$. For a\ngiven network, let the smallest field size for which the network has a scalar\nlinear solution be $q_s$, then the gap in the alphabet size between the vector\nsolution and the scalar linear solution is defined to be $q_s-q^t$. In this\ncontribution, the achieved gap is $q^{(h-2)t^2/h + o(t)}$ for any $q \\geq 2$\nand any even $h \\geq 4$. If $h \\geq 5$ is odd, then the achieved gap of the\nalphabet size is $q^{(h-3)t^2/(h-1) + o(t)}$. Previously, only a gap of size\nsize one had been shown for networks with a very large number of messages.\nThese results imply the same gap of the alphabet size between the optimal\nscalar linear and some scalar nonlinear network coding solution for multicast\nnetworks. For three messages, we also show an advantage of vector network\ncoding, while for two messages the problem remains open. Several networks are\nconsidered, all of them are generalizations and modifications of the well-known\ncombination networks. The vector network codes that are used as solutions for\nthose networks are based on subspace codes, particularly subspace codes\nobtained from rank-metric codes. Some of these codes form a new family of\nsubspace codes, which poses a new research problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2015 10:55:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:24:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 15:21:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 15 May 2016 11:14:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 14 Jan 2018 09:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Etzion", "Tuvi", ""], ["Wachter-Zeh", "Antonia", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06383", "submitter": "Chuang Zhang", "authors": "Chuang Zhang, Dongning Guo, Pingyi Fan", "title": "Tracking Angles of Departure and Arrival in a Mobile Millimeter Wave\n  Channel", "comments": "6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICC 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Millimeter wave provides a very promising approach for meeting the\never-growing traffic demand in next generation wireless networks.

In particular, we show\nthat there exists a family of (deterministic) braided codes that follows the\nsame DE equation as the ensemble, for any spatial length and coupling width.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 23:11:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 06:52:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 06:59:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["H\u00e4ger", "Christian", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""], ["Amat", "Alexandre Graell i", ""], ["Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m", "Fredrik", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09184", "submitter": "Deanna Needell", "authors": "Hao-Jun Michael Shi, Mindy Case, Xiaoyi Gu, Shenyinying Tu, Deanna\n  Needell", "title": "Methods for Quantized Compressed Sensing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we compare and catalog the performance of various greedy\nquantized compressed sensing algorithms that reconstruct sparse signals from\nquantized compressed measurements.

One component of the decomposed map corresponds to\nreversible behaviours, while the other to irreversible characteristics. For a\nfinite dimensional system, we employ real vectors or Bloch representations and\nexpress a dynamical map on the state space as a real matrix acting on the\nrepresentation. It is found that rotation and scaling transformations on the\nreal vector space, obtained from the real-polar decomposition, form building\nblocks for the dynamical map. Consequently, the change of the linear entropy or\npurity, which indicates dissipative behaviours, depends only on the scaling\npart of the dynamical matrix. The rate of change of the entropy depends on the\nstructure of the scaling part of the dynamical matrix, such as eigensubspace\npartitioning, and its relationship with the initial state. In particular, the\nlinear entropy is expressed as a weighted sum of the exponential-decay\nfunctions in each scaling component, where the weight is equal to\n$\\vert\\vec{x}_k(\\rho)\\vert^2$ of the initial state $\\rho$ in the subspace. The\ndissipative behaviours and the partition of eigensubspaces in the decomposition\nare discussed and illustrated for qubit systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 15:28:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 13:55:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 23:45:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2018 07:59:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sakuldee", "Fattah", ""], ["Suwanna", "Sujin", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09333", "submitter": "Nir Elkayam", "authors": "Nir Elkayam and Meir Feder", "title": "On the calculation of the minimax-converse of the channel coding problem", "comments": "Extended version of a submission to ISIT 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A minimax-converse has been suggested for the general channel coding problem\nby Polyanskiy etal.
