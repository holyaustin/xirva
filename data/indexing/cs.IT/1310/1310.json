A\ndistributed storage system (DSS) is parameterized by three parameters (n, k,d),\nin which a file stored across n distributed nodes, can be recovered from any k\nout of n nodes. If a node fails, any d out of (n-1) nodes help in the repair of\nthe failed node. For such a (n,k,d)-DSS, two types of wiretapping scenarios are\ninvestigated: (a) Type-I (node) adversary which can wiretap the data stored on\nany l<k nodes; and a more severe (b) Type-II (repair data) adversary which can\nwiretap the contents of the repair data that is used to repair a set of l\nfailed nodes over time. The focus of this work is on the practically relevant\nsetting of exact repair regeneration in which the repair process must replace a\nfailed node by its exact replica. We make new progress on several non-trivial\ninstances of this problem which prior to this work have been open. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the optimal characterization of the secure\nstorage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff region of a (n,k,d)-DSS, with n<=4\nand any l<k in the presence of both Type-I and Type-II adversaries. While the\nproblem remains open for a general (n,k,d)-DSS with n>4, we present extensions\nof these results to a (n, n-1,n-1)-DSS, in presence of a Type-II adversary that\ncan observe the repair data of any l=(n-2) nodes. The key technical\ncontribution of this work is in developing novel information theoretic converse\nproofs for the Type-II adversarial scenario. From our results, we show that in\nthe presence of Type-II attacks, the only efficient point in the\nstorage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff is the MBR (minimum bandwidth\nregenerating) point. This is in sharp contrast to the case of a Type-I attack\nin which the storage-vs-exact-repair-bandwidth tradeoff allows a spectrum of\noperating points beyond the MBR point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 20:58:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 16:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tandon", "Ravi", ""], ["Amuru", "SaiDhiraj", ""], ["Clancy", "T.

As the design criterion, the\nminimization of weighted sum mean-square-error (MSE) is considered first, and\nthe joint design in this case is approached based on alternating optimization\nthat iterates between optimal design of the FF relay for a given set of MIMO\nprecoder and decoder and optimal design of the MIMO precoder and decoder for a\ngiven FF relay filter. Next, the joint design problem for rate maximization is\nconsidered based on the obtained result regarding weighted sum MSE and the\nexisting result regarding the relationship between weighted MSE minimization\nand rate maximization. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nFF relay design and significant performance improvement by FF relays over\nwidely-considered simple AF relays for MIMO-ODFM systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Oct 2013 03:34:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Donggun", ""], ["Sung", "Youngchul", ""], ["Chung", "Jihoon", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.3062", "submitter": "Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam", "authors": "T.

Channel hardening refers\nto the phenomenon where the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^H{\\bf H}$ matrix\nbecome increasingly weaker compared to the diagonal terms as the size of the\nchannel gain matrix ${\\bf H}$ increases. Specifically, we propose a message\npassing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched\nfiltered received vector (whose signal term becomes ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}{\\bf x}$,\nwhere ${\\bf x}$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation\non the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}$ matrix. We also propose a\nsimple estimation scheme which directly obtains an estimate of ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf\nH}$ (instead of an estimate of ${\\bf H}$), which is used as an effective\nchannel estimate in the MPD algorithm. We refer to this receiver as the {\\em\nchannel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP)} receiver. The proposed\nCHEMP receiver achieves very good performance in large-scale MIMO systems\n(e.g., in systems with 16 to 128 uplink users and 128 base station antennas).\nFor the considered large MIMO settings, the complexity of the proposed MPD\nalgorithm is almost the same as or less than that of the minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) detection. This is because the MPD algorithm does not need a\nmatrix inversion. It also achieves a significantly better performance compared\nto MMSE and other message passing detection algorithms using MMSE estimate of\n${\\bf H}$. We also present a convergence analysis of the proposed MPD\nalgorithm. Further, we design optimized irregular low density parity check\n(LDPC) codes specific to the considered large MIMO channel and the CHEMP\nreceiver through EXIT chart matching. The LDPC codes thus obtained achieve\nimproved coded bit error rate performance compared to off-the-shelf irregular\nLDPC codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Oct 2013 09:20:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 14:19:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Narasimhan", "T.

In this paper, we\npropose a numerical method to perform variable density sampling with block\nconstraints. Our main contribution is to propose a new way to draw the blocks\nin order to mimic CS strategies based on isolated measurements. The basic idea\nis to minimize a tailored dissimilarity measure between a probability\ndistribution defined on the set of isolated measurements and a probability\ndistribution defined on a set of blocks of measurements. This problem turns out\nto be convex and solvable in high dimension. Our second contribution is to\ndefine an efficient minimization algorithm based on Nesterov's accelerated\ngradient descent in metric spaces. We study carefully the choice of the metrics\nand of the prox function. We show that the optimal choice may depend on the\ntype of blocks under consideration.

Such\npartitions are shown to arise naturally on topological zero-dimensional Abelian\ngroups, for instance, Cantor-type groups or the groups of p-adic numbers. This\nenables us to construct large classes of dual pairs of association schemes on\nzero-dimensional groups with respect to their Haar measure, and to compute\ntheir eigenvalues and intersection numbers. We also derive properties of\ninfinite metric schemes, connecting them with the properties of the\nnon-Archimedean metric on the group.\n  Pursuing the connection between schemes on zero-dimensional groups and\nharmonic analysis, we show that the eigenvalues have a natural interpretation\nin terms of Littlewood-Paley wavelet bases, and in the (equivalent) language of\nmartingale theory.

Therefore, there is a gap between the\nunicity condition and the one required to use the polynomial-complexity BP\nformulation. For the case of general dictionaries, it is also well known that\nfinding the sparse representation under the only constraint of unicity is\nNP-hard.\n  In this paper, we introduce, for the case of Fourier and canonical bases, a\npolynomial complexity algorithm that finds all the possible $K$-sparse\nrepresentations of a signal under the weaker condition that $K<\\sqrt{2}\n/\\mu(D)$. Consequently, when $K<1/\\mu(D)$, the proposed algorithm solves the\nunique sparse representation problem for this structured dictionary in\npolynomial time. We further show that the same method can be extended to many\nother pairs of bases, one of which must have local atoms. Examples include the\nunion of Fourier and local Fourier bases, the union of discrete cosine\ntransform and canonical bases, and the union of random Gaussian and canonical\nbases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 18:56:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 14:56:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dragotti", "Pier Luigi", ""], ["Lu", "Yue M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6132", "submitter": "Ronen Dar", "authors": "Ronen Dar, Meir Feder, Antonio Mecozzi, and Mark Shtaif", "title": "Time varying ISI model for nonlinear interference noise", "comments": "Submitted to the optical fiber communication conference (OFC), 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.optics cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the effect of nonlinear interference in WDM systems is\nequivalent to slowly varying inter-symbol-interference (ISI), and hence its\ncancellation can be carried out by means of adaptive linear filtering.
